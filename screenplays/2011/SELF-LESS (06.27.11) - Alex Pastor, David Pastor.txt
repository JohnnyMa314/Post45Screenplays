           FADE IN:

           AN EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF A MAN in his late 60s.

           His face enters frame, as the bed he lies onto is pushed into 
           frame. The loud, mechanical noises that surround us suggest 
           that we’re inside an MRI MACHINE.

           The man’s name, we’ll soon find out, is DAMIAN HAYES.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           ANOTHER CLOSE-UP OF DAMIAN. Now we’re somewhere else. He 
           seems distracted, until... 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        He’s here.

           Damian snaps out of it. As we PULL BACK, we realize we’re in 
           the UPSCALE RESTAURANT OF A GRAND NEW YORK CITY HOTEL. Damian 
           sits at a table next to MARTIN LEARY (50s). They both wear 
           expensive, perfectly tailored suits, that fit right in with 
           the lunch hour power crowd.  

           Both rise to welcome the man joining them for lunch. He’s 
           crossing the restaurant now. CARL BALDWIN (30s). Young, 
           cocky, a shark’s smile as he shakes their hands.

                                 MARTIN
                        Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Martin.
                             (shaking Damian’s hand)
                        Mr. Hayes. “The man who changed the 
                        face of New York.” What an honor.

                                 MARTIN
                        Sit, please.
                             (off-handedly)
                        And congratulations. On getting the 
                        downtown contract.

           Carl stops for a split second before sitting, a little thrown 
           off by the remark. But he keeps the smile in place.

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, I... I didn’t know the 
                        word was out yet.

                                 MARTIN
                        Hard to keep the word in on a two 
                        hundred million contract. I hear 
                        your bid was very solid. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTIN (CONT'D)
                        That you wined and dined Councilman 
                        Clark pretty hard.

                                 CARL
                        I’m not sure about “pretty hard.” 
                        Steak dinner, but not much more.

                                 MARTIN
                        Clark says you lobbied him pretty 
                        hard. 

           Carl’s starting to feel uneasy, both for the direction the 
           conversation’s taking and the fact that Damian Hayes watches 
           him intently but hasn’t said a word.

                                 CARL
                        If he says so.

                                 MARTIN
                        You told him the Hayes Group 
                        wouldn’t be up to the task of 
                        completing the downtown job because 
                        of “doubts about the long-term 
                        stability of its management.”

           Now Carl’s starting to sweat, suspects he’s walked into an 
           ambush. 

                                 CARL
                        Not sure that those were my exact 
                        words...

                                 MARTIN
                        No, your exact words were “The old 
                        man won’t be around for long.” Now 
                        that could be interpreted as 
                        speculation about Mr. Hayes’s 
                        health--

                                 CARL
                        It’s not.

                                 MARTIN
                        That’s what I told Councilman Clark 
                        when he called me this morning.

                                 CARL
                        He called you.

           By now, Carl’s smile is gone, as his defeat dawns on him:

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting the contract, aren’t 
                        you?
           And then, Damian speaks for the first time. His voice is 
           coarse, his words measured.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t want the contract.

           Carl gives him a quizzical look.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        What I want is your head on a 
                        platter. 
                             (beat)
                        I spoke to Miller and Schwartz. 
                        That’s seven seats on your board 
                        they control. 

                                 CARL
                        They support me.

                                 DAMIAN
                        They did. Until I offered them the 
                        downtown contract.

                                 MARTIN
                        They’ll vote you out at the next 
                        board meeting.

           Carl trembles with rage and impotence.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You didn’t think you were worth two 
                        hundred million, did you?

           Carl doesn’t even look at Martin. His attention is focused on 
           Damian, the man in charge.

                                 CARL
                        You son of a bitch, you’ll be dead 
                        in a year and you still hold on to 
                        all this... shit.

           And this last word is loud enough that other patrons turn and 
           stare. Carl gets up in a rush, knocking over a glass, and 
           storms out of the room before he loses it.

           Damian and Martin watch him go.

                                 DAMIAN
                        He’s right, you know.

                                 MARTIN
                        He’s done.
                                 DAMIAN
                        Still, the best oncologist in New 
                        York agrees with him.

           Martin turns to him. He realizes it’s serious.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s metastasized. Lungs and liver. 
                        This morning the bastard started 
                        talking to me about palliative 
                        therapy.

                                 MARTIN
                        I’m sorry.

           But Damian brushes the pity off.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Don’t. What you and Judy went 
                        through, losing a child... that’s a 
                        tragedy. An old man dying, that’s 
                        just life.

           There’s a moment of silence between the two friends.

                                 MARTIN
                        Have you told Claire?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Haven’t had the chance.

                                 MARTIN
                        Jesus, Damian, she--

                                 DAMIAN
                             (cutting him off)
                        How’s Judy? Still upstate?

           Martin nods. Gives up.

                                 MARTIN
                        She likes it there.

           A WAITER appears with two plates and places them before them, 
           but Damian takes a look at his salad and stops him.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I ordered mine without peanuts.

           The waiter hurries to take it away.

                                 WAITER
                        I’m sorry about that.
                                 DAMIAN
                             (to Martin)
                        Cancer’s eating me up and I worry 
                        about my allergies. Maybe I should 
                        just eat a PB&J sandwich, take the 
                        easy way out.

           Martin can’t help but laugh. 

           EXT. GRAND OLD HOTEL - DAY

           As Damian and Martin exit the hotel, there’s a BLACK SEDAN 
           waiting at the curb. RAOUL (40s), the driver, holds the back 
           door open.

           Before getting in, Damian turns and takes in the imposing 
           BEAUX-ARTS FACADE OF THE HOTEL. A smile appears on his face.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You know thirty years ago I tried 
                        to tear this bastard down to build 
                        condos?

                                 MARTIN
                        What about now? Would you still do 
                        it?

           Damian takes another look at the facade.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I couldn’t. It’s a landmark now.

           Martin chuckles: way to dodge the question. Damian gets in 
           the car. Raoul is closing the door behind him when Damian 
           impulsively hold it open with his hand. 

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Martin.
                             (Martin stops)
                        Have you heard about something 
                        called “shedding”?

                                 MARTIN
                        Shedding? You mean like a snake?

           Damian shakes his head, waves the whole thing off.

                                 DAMIAN
                        No. Forget it. It’s nothing. 
                        Just... something I was reading 
                        about.

           Damian grabs the handle and closes the door himself.
           When the black sedan takes off down the busy avenue, Martin 
           watches it go.

           INT. SEDAN - DAY

           Damian rides in the back seat of the sedan. He nervously taps 
           what seems to be a BUSINESS CARD on the armrest on the door. 
           He looks out the window: his mind is somewhere else...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Grafted from prime DNA and 
                        harvested to maturity.

           INT. DARK CHAMBER - FLASHBACK

           A dark windowless room. We don’t know where or “when” we are.

           Damian stands in front of an IRON TANK. A porthole reveals 
           what’s inside: a MURKY LIQUID conceals a TRANSLUCENT BAG and, 
           inside of the bag, a VAGUELY HUMAN FIGURE. 

           Suddenly, the shape inside the bag JERKS and startles him.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        A reflex movement.

           Someone’s behind Damian, talking to him, but he remains out-
           of-focus. His voice is authoritative, fastidiously polite.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Is it alive?

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Only in the most basic sense of the 
                        world. But you’re asking yourself 
                        the wrong question.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What’s the right question?

           INT. DAMIAN’S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A vast, luxurious penthouse. Classical taste applied to a 
           modern space. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city: 
           New York is at our feet. 

           This is the home of a man to be envied, if it wasn’t for... 
           well, you know.

           Damian’s at the liquor cabinet in the ample living room.
                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Have people started telling you 
                        about your buildings? How they’re 
                        your legacy. How you’ll leave them 
                        behind and they’ll make you 
                        immortal?

           While he pours himself a scotch, Damian’s gaze wanders across 
           the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS on the cabinet: A GROUP PHOTO OF YOUNG 
           MEN HOLDING THE SIGN “HARVARD BOXING TEAM 1964”, A PICTURE OF 
           A YOUNGER DAMIAN WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN MOSCOW’S SAINT 
           PETER SQUARE, BLISSFULLY IN LOVE... The story of a life...

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.)
                        Yes.

           Then his eyes rest on a picture of Damian in his 30s, playing 
           with a LITTLE GIRL. Is this Claire? 

           INT. DAMIAN’S PENTHOUSE - LATER (FLASHBACK)

           Damian sips his scotch, standing in front of one of the large 
           windows. Watching the magnificent skyline of New York City.

                                 MAN’S VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Ask yourself: do you feel immortal?

           INT. SEDAN - DAY (BACK TO THE PRESENT)

           The car door suddenly opens, making Damian snap out of his 
           reverie. They’ve arrived.

           INT. THE HAYES GROUP - DAY

           Damian exits an elevator that leads to the ample, bright 
           lobby of his company, THE HAYES GROUP. Here we find again 
           floor-to-ceiling windows offering a magnificent vista of 
           Midtown: capitalism at its most vertical.

           Damian heads towards the-- 

           RECEPTION--

           --with an unsteady walk. A young RECEPTIONIST immediately 
           stands up and comes around her desk, ready to help him. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Hayes.

           But Damian hands her his COAT instead, as a way to fend her 
           off.
                                 DAMIAN
                        Thanks.

           INT. DAMIAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           A GROUP OF UNDERLINGS are arguing heatedly.

                                 UNDERLING 1
                        Look, I’m no fan of that community 
                        board, either, but if we want a 
                        chance at rezoning, we need them on 
                        our side.

                                 UNDERLING 2
                        As long as it’s just a photo-op, as 
                        long as we aren’t actually 
                        committing to anything...

           But Damian isn’t listening. He’s completely engrossed in his 
           computer screen.

           We see that he’s sifting through NEWS ARTICLES. They’re all 
           about one subject: a DR. FRANCIS JENSEN.

           “NEUROLOGIST AWARDED NIH GRANT”, “A NEW FRONTIER IN MEMORY 
           STORAGE”, “UNTANGLING THE NEURAL NETWORK”...

           The pictures show a bookish man in his 50s. And then, an 
           OBIT:

           “PROMINENT NEUROLOGIST DIES IN CAR CRASH”

           A snippet of text reveals: “Dr. Francis Jensen had been 
           diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1995, but had kept 
           working until the week before his death.”

           In that same article, Damian finds an embedded VIDEO CLIP. He 
           plays it: it’s video footage of DR. JENSEN giving a lecture. 
           Talking to his students. Drawing a rudimentary nerve cell on 
           a blackboard. Rubbing his earlobe... 

           Damian hits PAUSE, freezing Jensen in that GESTURE, when...

           Suddenly, BLOOD SPRAYS the KEYBOARD.

           It’s Damian’s. He’s COUGHING. A FIT. It’s bad, and getting 
           WORSE. 

           The Underlings stop arguing and turn to Damian. They rush to 
           help him, but before they can, DAMIAN COLLAPSES on the floor.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           LIGHTS FLASHING and SIREN BLARING as the ambulance races 
           across town.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

           Damian lies in bed, unconscious, accompanied by the rhythmic 
           sounds of the HEART MONITOR and the RESPIRATOR that he’s 
           hooked to.

           For the first time he looks truly sick.

           When Damian opens his eyes and the room comes into focus, he 
           spots MARTIN, sitting on a bedside chair. 

                                 MARTIN
                        He’s awake.

           Who is he talking to? And then he sees her: a YOUNG WOMAN IN 
           HER LATE 20s, standing in a corner, watching him anxiously.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (weakly, through the 
                              inhalator)
                        Claire...

           Claire walks up to the bed. Her voice wavers, almost cracks:

                                 CLAIRE
                        Jesus, dad, why didn’t you tell me?

           Damian takes off the inhalator. Martin tries to stop him, but 
           Damian is forcefully adamant.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I was... I was afraid you wouldn’t 
                        care.

           Claire shakes her head, fighting back the tears.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        How’s work?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s fine, I... I teach on the 
                        Upper West now.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I know.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Keeping tabs on me, dad?
           Damian attempts a smile.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        There’s one thing you may not know.

           Her hand instinctively reaches for her abdomen. Damian’s gaze 
           follows and he notices her belly’s slightly swollen.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I’m due in May.

           Damian, speechless, manages to raise his hand and touch her 
           belly. It’s clear he didn’t know.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I guess we’re both good at keeping 
                        secrets.

           Damian takes Claire’s HAND.

                                 DAMIAN
                        My Lapushka... That’s what your 
                        mother used to call you, you know, 
                        when you were little.

           Claire’s eyes well up. Martin approaches her from behind.

                                 MARTIN
                        We should let your father get some 
                        rest.

           Claire nods, kisses Damian on the cheek and lets Martin lead 
           her out of the room.

           Alone, Damian notices through the window the setting sun 
           dipping behind the buildings. As the light of day dies, 
           darkness creeps across the room.

           CLOSE ON DAMIAN, a decision to be made... And then--

           He searches for his wallet on the bedside table. Inside, he 
           finds the BUSINESS CARD we saw before. Now, we can read it. 
           On one side, someone’s scribbled “THEY CAN HELP YOU”. 

           On the other, there’s a PHONE NUMBER. 

           Damian reaches for the bedside phone and DIALS THE NUMBER. 
           After a couple of rings...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Albright.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t. Feel immortal.
                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Mr. Hayes...

           Damian tries to sound as authoritative as possible:

                                 DAMIAN
                        I have one condition. I will 
                        liquidate all my assets and place 
                        them into a dummy account. You will 
                        get the access code to that account 
                        after the procedure. Only then. 
                        This condition is non-negotiable. 
                        Call it my insurance policy.
                             (beat)
                        Do we have a deal?

           Silence on the other end of the line. Seemingly forever. 
           Finally:

                                 ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                        You’re aware that, the moment I say 
                        yes, there’ll be no turning back?

                                 DAMIAN
                             (wavering)
                        I am.

           Beat.

                                 ALBRIGHT (O.S.)
                        Be ready in five days.

           And he hangs up. For a moment, he stares at the phone in 
           disbelief: he’s done it. What, we don’t know yet.

           But he immediately gets moving and DIALS another number.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Geoff? It’s Damian. Are you still 
                        interested in taking the Hayes 
                        Group off my hands? 
                             (beat)
                        No, an all-cash deal, but it’s a 
                        bargain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DAMIAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Damian, still weak and breathing from an oxygen tank, sits at 
           his desk surrounded by LAWYERS as he puts his SIGNATURE on a 
           piece of paper.
           Making an effort, Damian stands up and shakes hands with a 
           BUSINESSMAN across the desk.

           INT. DAMIAN’S PENTHOUSE - STUDY - DAY

           Damian, feeling stronger, no oxygen tank, stands behind his 
           desk. He’s opening a wall-mounted SAFE.

           After punching in the combination, he opens the safe and 
           reaches inside...

           EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON

           CLAIRE, watching over her SIX YEAR-OLD STUDENTS as they play. 
           We see her through the CHAIN-LINK FENCE that surrounds the 
           playground, because...

           Damian, sitting in the back of his car, WATCHES HER from 
           across the street. Love, regret... His expression is hard to 
           read.

           Damian turns to the driver.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Let’s go.

           We see that he’s holding something on his lap: AN OLD TIN 
           BOX.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DUSK

           The sedan stops by an ENTRANCE TO THE PARK. The driver steps 
           out to open Damian’s door and help him out of the car.

           Damian takes frail steps towards the PARK, carrying the tin 
           box. The driver remains by the car and watches Damian 
           disappear into Central Park.

           LATER--

           It’s already DARK. The Driver’s inside the car, listening to 
           SPORTS TALK RADIO, when a HAND KNOCKS ON THE WINDOW.

           It’s Damian. As he gets into the car, we may notice that he’s 
           not carrying the tin box anymore.
           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY

           Damian and Martin sit across a table, having lunch. Two 
           Arnold Palmers constantly refilled. An empty plate in front 
           of Martin. Damian has barely touched his.

                                 MARTIN
                        I have to say, I was surprised I 
                        had to hear it from legal.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I knew you’d try to talk me out of 
                        it.

           Damian glances at his CELLPHONE, which is sitting on the 
           table.

                                 MARTIN
                        You’re damn right I would’ve.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Are you going to stay? Geoff wants 
                        you to.

                                 MARTIN
                        What, at Hayes without Hayes? No, 
                        time to cash out, spend more time 
                        upstate. Judy’s going to love you 
                        for this, you know.

           But Damian seems more interested in his phone, which he keeps 
           glancing at, than in the conversation.

           A WAITER shows up and clears their plates. Martin gets up.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me...
                             (to the waiter)
                        The restroom?

           The Waiter points at the far end of the restaurant and Martin 
           walks away.

           Left alone, Damian checks his cellphone again. He tinkers 
           with it, rising the volume of the ringer, when...

           The Waiter places A CUP OF ESPRESSO on the table, right next 
           to the phone.

           Damian grabs the Waiter’s sleeve before he leaves.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I didn’t order this.
                                 WAITER
                        Compliments of Mr. Albright.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 WAITER
                        You should drink it. Before your 
                        friend comes back.

           Damian studies the Waiter, for the first time really looking 
           at him. Who is this guy? 

           The Waiter frees himself from Damian’s grip and heads towards 
           the kitchen. Damian watches him disappear through the KITCHEN 
           DOORS and then spots--

           MARTIN... coming back to the table.

           Damian inspects the coffee: it looks just like regular 
           espresso, thick and creamy. He smells it. Nothing...

           Martin’s crossing the room. He’s almost there.

           Damian looks at the espresso again, a decision waiting to be 
           made...

           And he DOWNS IT, right as Martin arrives at the table.

           Damian waits for a beat. What now?

                                 MARTIN
                             (sitting down)
                        Sorry about that. I’m not getting 
                        any younger.

           Suddenly, Damian feels it: his heart starts to race. He’s 
           sweating, he has difficulty breathing... He loosens his 
           collar, but it’s not enough: he can barely breath.  

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Damian? You OK?

           He’s not. He gasps for air. He feels like he’s having a HEART 
           ATTACK.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Your epipen. Do you have it with 
                        you?

           Damian tries to stand up, but as he leans on the table, he 
           slips and COLLAPSES on the floor, silverware and glasses 
           crashing all around him.
           Everyone at the restaurant turns. Someone SCREAMS. Martin 
           rushes to his side and unbuttons his shirt...

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Someone call 911!

           ...while ANOTHER GUEST pulls out his phone.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Damian...

           Then, A SIREN BLARES. Martin looks up:

           It’s an AMBULANCE, screeching to a halt in front of the 
           restaurant. That was surprisingly quick.

           Two EMTs rush into the restaurant, carrying a GURNEY and 
           pushing people aside.

                                 EMT
                        Make a hole, make a hole!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Damian is now strapped to the gurney. One of the EMTs wheels 
           him towards the ambulance, while the other pumps a manual 
           VENTILATOR. They are quick, efficient, know what they’re 
           doing...

           We stay on MARTIN, who comes out of the restaurant just in 
           time to see Damian disappear into the ambulance. 

           The EMT closes the doors and soon the ambulance takes off, 
           lights flashing... 

           INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON DAMIAN, scared, immobilized on the gurney as the 
           ambulance races across the city. He tries to look around him 
           from his limited vantage point:  

           He catches a glimpse of a man sitting in the passenger seat. 
           Wait, is that the Waiter? Yes, he is. And he’s talking on a 
           WALKIE TALKIE:

                                 WAITER
                        We’re on our way. ETA is five 
                        minutes.
           The EMT riding with him in the back grabs his wrist and feels 
           his pulse.

                                 EMT
                        Mr. Hayes? 

           Damian turns to him. The EMT points a small FLASHLIGHT into 
           his eyes as he speaks:

                                 EMT (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Hayes, I have good news and bad 
                        news for you. Good news is you’re 
                        not going into anaphylactic shock. 
                        You just felt like you were. A high 
                        dose of laderol will do that to 
                        you. Bad news is your body has to 
                        arrive D.O.A. at New York 
                        Presbyterian in about fifteen 
                        minutes, so we need to hurry.

           Where are they going? He catches a piece of the sky on the 
           small windows on the sides of the vehicle, but not much more. 

           Under the siren, he manages to hear:

           The WHEEL hitting a POTHOLE...

           ...the AMBULANCE driving over a series of METAL GRATES... A 
           BRIDGE, perhaps? 

           And then, the piece of sky out the window disappears, 
           replaced by concrete and artificial lights: THE AMBULANCE HAS 
           GONE UNDERGROUND.

           The vehicle comes to a sudden stop and the BACK DOORS are 
           pulled open.

           Damian’s wheeled outside, onto:

           A LOADING DOCK. The METAL GATE has been shut behind the 
           ambulance, so there’s no way of knowing where we are. 

           There’s MEDICAL PERSONNEL waiting. They hurry to PUSH THE 
           GURNEY through a SWINGING DOOR and into...

           A LONG HALLWAY-- 

           White walls. Fluorescent lights. No windows. A MEDICAL 
           COMPLEX somewhere. But where?

           Strapped to the gurney, Damian tries to see what’s going on 
           as they RUSH HIM down the hallway. He catches glimpses of the 
           medical personnel...
           UNDRESSING HIM.

           TAKING OFF HIS WATCH AND A RING.

           Suddenly, a DOCTOR, 40s, appears by the gurney and walks next 
           to it.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Open your mouth, please.

           Damian obeys. The Doctor examines the inside of his mouth 
           with another small flashlight.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Any fillings?

           Damian shakes his head no.

           As he walks, the Doctor examines a FOLDER.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        According to your medical history, 
                        you’ve had no implants. Is that 
                        correct? 

           Damian nods.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Metal plates, orthopedic screws, 
                        anything made out of metal...

           Damian shakes his head.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Now this is very important. There 
                        can be no metal in the machine. Any 
                        piece of metal in your body could 
                        disrupt the procedure. Your 
                        consciousness could vanish. Are you 
                        sure we’re not missing anything?

           Damian nods.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        OK.
                             (looks up at someone 
                              Damian can’t see)
                        We’re good.

           The gurney blasts through another SWINGING DOOR and Damian 
           finds himself in a--
           CIRCULAR CHAMBER-- 

           At its center, there’s a LARGE MACHINE that looks like a DUAL 
           MRI MACHINE: that is, two MRI beds, one grey and one white, 
           connected to a central hub.

           Damian spots A YOUNG MAN (late 20s) watching over the whole 
           operation from behind the window of some sort of CONTROL 
           ROOM. In spite of his youth, he wears a conservative, 
           perfectly tailored suit (tie pin and all) and seems to be in 
           charge. Albright, perhaps? 

           Only a small nervous tic betrays some concern: the man RUBS 
           HIS EARLOBE.

           A Male and a Female TECHNICIANS lift Damian from the gurney 
           and place him carefully on one of the “MRI” beds, securing 
           him with STRAPS made of rubber. Looking to his right, Damian 
           catches a glimpse of something else:

           ANOTHER BODY, lying on the second bed. Only its lower half is 
           visible, because the upper half is already inside the other 
           “MRI”.

           Suddenly, THE MACHINE COMES TO LIFE: its movable parts start 
           spinning, first slowly, then faster, and VERY LOUDLY.

           The Technician pulls out a JET INJECTOR, presses it against 
           Damian’s arm and shoots him up.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What’s that?

           The bed starts to SLIDE INTO THE MRI. The Technician answers 
           something, but it’s too loud inside to hear him.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        What?!

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        I said it’s something to stop your 
                        heart!

           WTF?! Before Damian can reply, he STARTS TO CONVULSE. Now he 
           is going into cardiac arrest. He tries to scream, but it’s 
           hard to know if he’s screaming or not, the machine is so 
           loud...

           We are now in DAMIAN’S POV, seeing everything spin around 
           us...

           Until there’s a weird, little VISUAL GLITCH, after which 
           everything remains the same, but slightly different:
           He’s still inside the “MRI” and the machine begins to slow 
           down.

           The bed slides out of the machine. Still from DAMIAN’S POV, 
           we see the Technicians looming over him, over US, as we 
           emerge from the machine.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        How are you feeling?

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.)
                        Didn’t work...

           His VOICE sounds strange, muddled. Is he mumbling?

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Can you repeat that for me?

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.)
                        I said I didn’t work.

           But then, he sees something: the other MRI-like machine, 
           which should be to his right, but is now to his left. 

           There’s a body on it. Two Technicians are lifting it back to 
           the gurney. But that body is different now: frail, wrinkled. 
           A SICK OLD MAN.

           And when we catch a glimpse of the face, we see that the body 
           is actually DAMIAN.

           And then the camera PULLS OUT, the POV turning into a 
           REFLECTION on someone’s EYE. And the camera keeps pulling 
           back, to reveal the face of the body Damian now inhabits:

           A MAN in his early 30s, handsome, hair cropped very short.

           It did work. Damian’s consciousness has been transferred into 
           this younger body.

           Damian’s first reaction: vertigo, nausea. He leans over the 
           edge of the bed and throws up...

           UP IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Albright watches as the Technician 
           wraps Damian in a robe. Albright doesn’t bat an eyelid: it’s 
           all going as it should.

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

           DAMIAN lies in bed at the center of what looks like a sparse, 
           high-end hospital room, except there are no windows. A series 
           of PANELS on the wall try to create the illusion of daylight.  
           Damian sips liquid food from a BOTTLE with the help of a 
           NURSE. Damian has difficulty moving and speaking, not unlike 
           a stroke survivor.

           Albright stands in the corner, holding a briefcase and 
           watching him.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        It gets easier. It’ll take a few 
                        days, but you’ll break it in.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Has. That. New. Body. Smell.

           Albright smiles. Damian watches him, when something strange 
           happens. Some sort of GLITCH: for a split second, the 
           background behind Albright changes. It changes to a RUSTIC 
           LIVING ROOM, but it only lasts a moment and then it’s gone.

           Damian flinches.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Are you OK?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Migraine.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        A by-product of being dead.

           As he says this, Albright places a manila FOLDER on the 
           overbed table and opens it.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        The paper of record.

           Inside, a New York Times OBIT reads: “DAMIAN HAYES, MASTER 
           BUILDER, DIES AT 68.” It’s accompanied by a picture of Damian 
           in his 50s. Of course now he looks nothing like him.

           But there’s something UNDERNEATH. With some effort, Damian 
           manages to push the obit aside, revealing SNAPSHOTS taken at 
           a BURIAL. HIS. We spot Claire, clad in black and wearing 
           sunglasses to conceal she’s been crying. There’s also Martin 
           and other business associates.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Your daughter gave a beautiful 
                        eulogy. We can arrange a visit to 
                        the plot, in a few months, if it 
                        holds any significance for you.
                             (beat)
                        And now... There’s one thing we 
                        should get over with.
           Albright opens the briefcase on the overbed table: a LAPTOP 
           COMPUTER. The webpage of a BANK appears onscreen...

           Waiting for a PASSWORD. 

           This is the cue for the Nurse to leave the room. Damian 
           reaches for the keyboard, but then stops. He hesitates, his 
           curled fingers hovering over the keys.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I...

           Damian closes his eyes. Albright tightens, getting nervous. 
           Has he forgotten?

           A long beat...

           Until Damian’s hand slowly types the password. He looks at 
           Albright, a semblance of a smile appearing on his lips.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                             (with difficulty)
                        Wanted. To. See. You. Sweat. For a 
                        change. 

           On screen, a message appears: ACCESS GRANTED.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Funny.

           Albright closes the computer and takes it with him.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Get some rest now. Tomorrow’s when 
                        the real work begins.

           Albright exits and Damian is left alone. He watches this 
           strange new environment, when something catches his eye: HIS 
           REFLECTION, distorted on the surface of a stainless steel 
           tray.  

           With difficulty, Damian raises his hand and pushes the tray 
           aside... until it CRASHES ON THE FLOOR with a LOUD BANG. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE: THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTING TO THE NEW BODY.

           A series of scenes similar to the rehab process after a 
           stroke or a severe accident. Supervised by PHYSICAL 
           THERAPISTS, they all take place in a series of WINDOW-LESS 
           ROOMS, their look somewhere between a hospital and a high-end 
           spa:
           -Sitting in a wheelchair, Damian struggles to make a fist.

           -Two therapists help Damian up from his wheelchair. He grabs 
           a set of PARALLEL BARS and manages to take a few steps...

           -Damian sits in front of an upright PING-PONG TABLE, playing 
           against himself. Or trying, anyway. His hand-brain 
           coordination is still not good enough to return his own 
           volleys.

           -Damian swims against the current in a “swimmer’s treadmill.”

           -While Damian showers in a handicapped-ready shower, we see 
           that he’s placed a TOWEL OVER THE BATHROOM MIRROR, blocking 
           it.

           -ANOTHER WINDOW-LESS OFFICE--

           Damian sits on a couch, opposite DOCTOR ANN MILLER, 40s, kind 
           and reassuring. 

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        So how are you feeling?

                                 DAMIAN
                             (with a slight slur)
                        Not bad. I can almost eat without 
                        spilling food all over myself.

           Doctor Miller chuckles.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        A sense of humor’s good. It’s 
                        important to fend off despair any 
                        way you can. 

                                 DAMIAN
                        Is that why I only get plastic 
                        knives?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        Suicidal thoughts are not that 
                        rare. The idea of inhabiting a body 
                        the mind considers alien, a body 
                        grown in a lab, can sometimes 
                        become intolerable.

           As she says this, Doctor Miller pulls out a BOTTLE OF PILLS 
           and places it on the COFFEE TABLE between them.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Prozac?
                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        Among other things.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What else?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        A mild antipsychotic.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Jesus...

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        Those “glitches” you’ve described 
                        to me, that’s your mind adjusting 
                        to the new neural structure. The 
                        two need to click, and this will 
                        help. Just think of it as the anti-
                        rejection drug you’d take after any 
                        transplant.

           Damian, still distrustful, looks at the bottle. 

                                 DAMIAN
                        What if I don’t take them? What 
                        does “rejection” look like?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        Migraine, nausea, disorientation... 
                        Finally, your consciousness... 
                        disintegrates. Disappears.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Why don’t I ever read the fine 
                        print?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        It will never get to that. You take 
                        them and keep them with you at all 
                        time. 

           A beat. Then, when Damian reaches for the bottle, he catches 
           a GLIMPSE of something on the table. Movement: his reflection 
           on a HAND-MIRROR. 

           Having caught a glimpse of HIMSELF, he instinctively backs 
           away. Doctor Miller watches him intently.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to take a look?

           Damian, disturbed, shakes his head “no”. 
                                 DAMIAN (O.S.)
                        I was born on September 20th, 1980 
                        in Phoenix, Arizona.

                                                 THE MONTAGE CONTINUES:

           -Damian swims, this time faster.

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        My parents and my older sister were 
                        killed in a car crash when I was 
                        ten years old.

           -Damian, struggling on the parallel bars, almost falls. The 
           Physical Therapist tries to help him up, but Damian rejects 
           him and pulls himself up.

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I had stayed home because of a 
                        bellyache after I sneaked in the 
                        kitchen and ate a whole tub of 
                        chocolate ice cream.

           -Damian plays ping-pong. Faster and faster. 

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t eaten chocolate since.

           -Damian READS from a document into a MICROPHONE. We realize 
           that this is the V.O. we’ve been hearing. The slur is gone.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        My uncle Frank raised me in 
                        Chicago.

           -Damian on a TREADMILL, now running. He wears HEADPHONES and 
           listens to himself read his NEW BIOGRAPHY.

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I went to Northwestern, where I 
                        majored in Computer Science.

           -Damian in the shower, now standing. As he showers, he 
           studies this new body: a hand that is and isn’t his.

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I have never married. I have no 
                        children.

           -Damian finally PULLS THE TOWEL that covers the mirror. For 
           the first time, he takes a good look at his new face.

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        My name is Edward Grey.
           He’s ready.

                                                        END OF MONTAGE.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Damian, wearing a smart suit, no tie, follows Doctor Miller 
           down the window-less hallway of The Complex. 

           They’re headed towards a door. When she opens it, it 
           reveals... 

           THE LOADING DOCK--

           Damian stops. The gate is closed. No way of knowing where 
           they are. 

           In the middle of the room, A LIMO awaits for him, door open. 
           Albright stands by.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Ready?

           INT. LIMO - MOMENTS LATER

           Damian sits inside the limo, opposite Albright. When he 
           closes the door, Damian notices that the windows are not just 
           tinted: they’re COMPLETELY OPAQUE.

           The car starts: Damian can feel the pull, he can hear the 
           gate opening, but he can’t see anything.

           Albright catches Damian’s look of frustration.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        You could say we’re nothing if not 
                        consistent.

           Albright pulls out a case and places it on the table between 
           them.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        This is your graduation present.

           Albright opens the case. Inside there are a series of ITEMS: 
           cellphone, driver’s license, Social Security Card, credit 
           card, keys... 

           Damian starts examining the items. 
                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        One last time: You run into someone 
                        you know...

                                 DAMIAN
                        I keep walking. I don’t say 
                        anything, I don’t look back.

           Damian pockets the cellphone, the keys, the credit cards...

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Good. Damian Hayes is dead. That’s 
                        something that can’t be undone.

           Hearing this, Damian remembers something...

                                 DAMIAN
                        I did some research. Before. I came 
                        across a Doctor Francis Jensen. 
                        Neurologist. Died in a car crash 
                        ten years after he was diagnosed 
                        with multiple sclerosis.

           Albright tightens ever so slightly, but he doesn’t say 
           anything. Just holds Damian’s gaze.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        If he did die. Brilliant mind 
                        trapped in a failing body... Seems 
                        like the kind of person who could 
                        come up with something like 
                        shedding.

           Albright rubs his earlobe. That nervous tic again.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 DAMIAN
                             (pointing at the tic)
                        You two would’ve been terrible 
                        poker players.

           Albright stops rubbing his ear, embarrassed. He reaches into 
           his jacket and hands Damian another BOTTLE OF PILLS.

           But when Damian opens it, he sees inside there are only...

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Seven.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        You’ll get your refills when you 
                        see Doctor Miller on Tuesdays. 
                                 DAMIAN
                        What happens if I run out?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        You won’t. Not if you see Doctor 
                        Miller every week.

           Damian doesn’t like the sound of this, but before he can 
           reply, the car comes to a stop.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        We’re here.

           When Albright opens the door, it reveals a LEAFY, UPSCALE 
           STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE. It must be early morning, 
           because the street is deserted.

           Damian steps out of the car, finding himself in front of a 
           stately, beautifully preserved TOWN HOUSE.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                             (from inside the car)
                        In a few months we can talk about a 
                        job, if there’s anything you want 
                        to do. For now, relax, have fun. 
                        You’re a seventy year-old man. I’d 
                        say you’ve earned it.

           Albright closes the door and the limo drives off.

           After a beat, Damian turns his attention back to the house.

           The house key he got from Albright slides smoothly into the 
           lock. He turns it.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           The interior is grand, but completely different from the 
           façade’s classicism. It’s been renovated and turned into a 
           sleek, modern bachelor pad. The decor is tasteful, yet a bit 
           bland.

           Damian examines some FRAMED PHOTOS on the wall: a series of 
           pictures that have been photoshopped to add his new self. 
           Vacations, graduations... an unreal life.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           A modern, spotless kitchen. Damian opens the WINDOW that 
           leads to the back yard, when...
           Suddenly, ANOTHER GLITCH: Out the window, he suddenly sees an 
           EXPANSIVE VIEW OF THE OCEAN, a PIER jutting into it.

           After a second, the glitch is gone and Damian is left facing 
           again a manicured, but unremarkable back yard.

           Dizzy, he holds on the kitchen counter for support, while his 
           other hand reaches into his pocket and finds his PILLS.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Damian opens the door to the bedroom. The king-sized bed’s 
           been made. Everything’s impeccable. As if the world’s neatest 
           person lived in this place.

           Damian walks to the huge walk-in closet. Inside, he finds row 
           after row of expensive suits, shirts and pants in assorted 
           styles and colors. 

           And hanging from a hook, a pair of BOXING GLOVES. Someone 
           found out about his old sport of choice.

           Damian walks back and sits on the bed. He looks around him. 

           Now what...?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           A PAIR OF GLOVED FISTS, DELIVERING A SERIES OF BLOWS.

                                                          CUT WIDER TO:

           INT. GYM - DAY

           The RING at the center of the gym. Two fighters wearing 
           protective gear SPAR on the ring, dancing around one 
           another...

           As we get closer, we see that one of the fighters is Damian, 
           sparing with a TOUGH GUY in his late 30s. 

           The punches are timid at first, until the tough guy throws a 
           right hook that gets Damian by surprise. Damian stumbles, 
           takes a couple of steps back. He’s a bit dazed, but not 
           upset. Instead...

           He GRINS, revealing his mouth-guard. He relishes the 
           challenge. A real fight. Bring it on. 
           Damian counterattacks. Bang, bang. Left, right, left, right. 
           His new body is strong and fast. Faster than his opponent, 
           who can barely keep up. 

           The tough guy has given up trying to get to Damian. Now he’s 
           just trying to protect his own ass.

           Damian delivers a series of punishing BODY BLOWS. The tough 
           guy lowers his guard to protect his abdomen, a moment that 
           Damian uses to hit him in the face and...

           THE TOUGH GUY FALLS ON THE MAT.

           Damian stops. Panting heavily. Towering over his opponent, 
           who raises his hand, meaning “I’m done.”

           INT. GYM - SHOWERS - DAY

           Damian closes his eyes under an invigorating shower. His body 
           is sore, but it also feels good.

           INT. GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Damian opens his locker: the MEDICINE BOTTLE awaits inside. 
           He grabs it and pops a PILL.

           LATER--

           Damian carries his bag and heads for the exit, when he 
           notices...

           THE TOUGH GUY, sitting by a locker, getting dressed.

           Damian stops. After a moment’s hesitation, he walks up to 
           him.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Sorry about that. I think I got a 
                        little carried away.

                                 TOUGH GUY
                        That’s OK. I get worse bruises from 
                        my girls.

           He speaks with a quite strong RUSSIAN ACCENT. The Tough Guy 
           pulls out his wallet and shows Damian a PHOTO of two cute 7 
           year-old girls eating birthday cake.

                                 TOUGH GUY (CONT’D)
                        Sacha and Lara
                                 DAMIAN
                             (IN RUSSIAN)
                        They’re beautiful.

           After a beat, surprised that Damian speaks the language...

                                 TOUGH GUY
                             (in Russian)
                        Thank you. They live with their 
                        mother.

           The Tough Guy offers his hand...

                                 TOUGH GUY (CONT’D)
                        Anton.

           Damian shakes his hand.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Edward. Ed.

                                 ANTON
                             (in Russian)
                        Hard to find people who speak 
                        Russian these days.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (in Russian)
                        My wi--
                             (catches himself)
                        I had a Russian girlfriend.

                                 ANTON
                             (in Russian)
                        My condolences.

           Damian smiles. He’s about to walk away, when...

                                 ANTON (CONT’D)
                        Listen.

           Damian stops and turns.

                                 ANTON (CONT’D)
                        I’m meeting these girls tonight. 
                        Fun girls. For drinks. Maybe you 
                        want to join us?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t know, I...

                                 ANTON
                        Come on, I’m not that young. I 
                        don’t think I can handle both.
           Damian considers this...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNTOWN CLUB - NIGHT

           We follow Damian, sharply dressed, as he walks into a TRENDY 
           DOWNTOWN SPOT. The lights strobe and the music pulses as he 
           makes his way through the young, stylish crowd, a crowd he 
           belongs to only outwardly.

                                 ANTON (O.S.)
                        Ed! Over here!

           Damian sees Anton’s at the bar, waving at him. As he makes 
           his way to the bar, he finds him in the company of two 
           SPECTACULAR GIRLS. They’re in their twenties and dressed to 
           kill. Anton makes the introductions. 

                                 ANTON (CONT’D)
                        Ed, these are Leah and Andrea. This 
                        is Ed...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Grey.

                                 LEAH
                        Pleasure to meet you, Ed.

                                 ANTON
                        The girls were asking me what you 
                        do. I told them I had no idea.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Me? I do nothing.

                                 ANDREA
                        What do you mean nothing?

           Damian enjoys the confusion he creates.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’m retired.

                                 LEAH
                        Wait, how old are you?

           Beat, as Damian considers how to answer such question...

                                 DAMIAN
                        I was born on September 20th, 1980.
                                 LEAH
                        Wow, that’s... weirdly specific.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I had a company, but I sold it.

                                 ANTON
                        What? To Google?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Something like that.
                             (to Leah)
                        Can I get you something to drink?

           Leah nods, with hungry eyes and a flirty smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Damian and Leah make out in the back of the cab. Damian’s 
           caressing Leah’s perfect thigh, when the song “DAYDREAMING” 
           comes on the radio and she leans toward to the cab driver.

                                 LEAH
                        Hey, turn that up!
                             (turns to Damian)
                        I love Lupe Fiasco.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Yeah, she’s great.

           Leah gives him a confused look, and when the song kicks in, 
           it becomes clear to Damian that...

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                             (cringing)
                        He’s a guy, isn’t he?

           Leah laughs: she finds him adorable.

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           The cab stops in front of Damian’s house and out of the 
           vehicle stumble Damian and Leah. 

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Leah follows Damian inside his place. She stops for a moment, 
           to take in the magnificent interior of Damian’s place.
                                 LEAH
                        Oh, wow...

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Damian walks into the kitchen and opens the stainless-steel 
           fridge. He grabs a couple of beers and closes the door...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Another one?

           ...revealing Leah, standing in the doorway... just as she 
           DROPS HER DRESS to the floor.

           If you thought she looked hot with that dress on, you should 
           see her without it.

           Damian just stands there, beers in hand, speechless.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I quote you and say... Wow...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Damian and Leah blast into the bedroom, making out 
           ferociously. She unbuttons his shirt and pushes him on the 
           bed. Leah straddles Damian and proceeds to kiss his chest, 
           when he stops her:

                                 DAMIAN
                        Wait, I... Look, I haven’t done 
                        this in a long time.

                                 LEAH
                             (smiles)
                        You’re kidding me.

           Damian shakes his head no.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Well, it’s like riding a bike. And 
                        in this case, I’ll do the riding.

           Leah dives in. She’s good. She’s amazing, actually, and 
           Damian loses himself in a torrent of unadulterated pleasure, 
           until we...

                                                              FLASH TO:
           Suddenly, we find ourselves somewhere else. Inside a RUSTIC 
           HOUSE. DAYLIGHT streams through the windows and floods the 
           place.

           We are in SOMEONE’S POV, as we walk towards an open doors 
           that leads...

           OUTSIDE--

           The OCEAN appears at our feet, wide and majestic. It’s a 
           clear, beautiful day. And down by the shore, there’s a LONG 
           PIER that goes into the water. It’s the same image from his 
           glitch...

           As WE APPROACH, a figure appears at the end of the pier, 
           amidst the glares on the water surface... 

           IT’S A WOMAN.

           We walk towards her. She wears a summer dress and looks at 
           the ocean, her back against us. 

           We’re almost there and she’s about to turn, when we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Damian’s eyes POP OPEN, waking up from a dream. He breathes 
           heavily.

           When he turns, he finds the other half of the bed empty. 
           Leah’s gone. But among the crumpled sheets, he finds her lacy 
           thong.

           And then he can’t help it: the memory of the night before 
           comes back and he chuckles. Sun streams through the window. 
           It’s a beautiful day. And he’s alive...

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAMIAN’S SNEAKERS, HITTING THE ASPHALT

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY (MONTAGE)

           It’s a crisp spring day in the park. And Damian jogs. Fast. 
           Young and healthy, he barely breaks a sweat.
           EXT. OCEAN - DAY (MONTAGE)

           The vastness of the sea, interrupted only by a SAILBOAT 
           cutting across its shimmering surface. A TANNED MAN pilots 
           the yacht, a gorgeous girl at his side, while Damian and 
           Anton chat with two other beauties.

           EXT. SAILBOAT - DAY (MONTAGE)

           The boat is now anchored. 

           Anton watches, amused, as a GORGEOUS GIRL jokingly pulls 
           Damian towards the edge of the boat. Damian resists, he 
           doesn’t want to get wet, but he trips...

           ...and they both plunge in the water.

           After a moment underwater, the two of them break the surface. 
           She looks at him teasingly, splashes some water on him and 
           starts swimming backwards, away from him. Damian takes the 
           bait and swims after her...

           INT. SAILBOAT - DAY (MONTAGE)

           The girl leads Damian down the steps into the boat’s cabin. 
           In the semi-darkness of the cabin, she starts to unbutton his 
           soaked shirt...

           EXT. MARINA - DAY (MONTAGE)

           Damian is tying up the boat to the dock, when he notices the 
           TANNED MAN watching him from the boat.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (re: the knot)
                        Did I screw up?

           The Man jumps on the dock and pulls the knot: rock solid.

                                 TANNED MAN
                        No. It’s great.

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY (MONTAGE)

           Damian sits with Doctor Miller for their weekly meeting. The 
           office has windows: it’s not the same as the one in “The 
           Complex.”

           Doctor Miller slides a new bottle of pills across the coffee 
           table. Damian takes it.
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY (MONTAGE)

           Damian keeps jogging. Faster now. Pushing himself. His 
           breathing quickens. The trees zoom by.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

           Damian opens the bottle and swallows his daily pill.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT - DAY (MONTAGE)

           A CASHIER (20s) glances at Damian with suspicion...

           ...because she’s scanning JAR AFTER JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER. 
           Damian seems to be buying a decade’s worth of supply. 

                                 DAMIAN
                             (off her look)
                        I haven’t had it since 1952.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DUSK (MONTAGE)

           Damian sits at the very edge of the rooftop, feet dangling 
           over the void. 

           Damian watches the sun dip behind the Hudson, a fiery orange 
           orb, while he eats spoonful after spoonful of PEANUT BUTTER 
           straight from a jar. He closes his eyes, relishing in such a 
           simple pleasure...

           I/E. RACECAR / RACETRACK - DAY (MONTAGE)

           Damian, behind the wheels of a stock racecar. He’s right 
           behind another car, trying to pass it, but the other driver 
           cuts him off.

           We see that Anton is the one driving the other car. Left, 
           right... Every time Damian finds a hole, Anton blocks it. 

           When we CUT TO A MUCH WIDER SHOT, it reveals...

           THE EMPTY RACETRACK. They’ve rented it out and they have it 
           all to themselves.

           Damian sees the CURVE coming up. He switches gears and guns 
           the engine, darting towards the inside of the curve. A space 
           that shrinks more and more as Anton veers left...

           ...about to cut him off...
           But Damian manages to squeak through, with barely an inch to 
           spare...

           ...coming out of the curve in first place... 

           ...and crossing the finishing line ahead of Anton.

           INT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

           A beat, deep and infectious, is pulsing, as Damian dances 
           with a SEXY BRUNETTE. 

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

           A cab drops Damian and the Sexy Brunette in front of Damian’s 
           house. But as he leads her to his place, we notice something:

           We’re watching them through a windshield, through somebody’s 
           POV.

           SOMEONE’S SPYING ON DAMIAN FROM A PARKED CAR.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY (MONTAGE)

           Damian’s now running as fast as he can. Even his new body 
           can’t take this much longer. With his lungs about to burst, 
           Damian comes to a stop. He leans against a tree, gasping for 
           air. 

           Damian touches his neck and feels his HEARTBEAT PULSE. THUMP-
           THUMP-THUMP. Blood pumping. Life. 

           When suddenly, he sees something that makes EVERYTHING SLOW 
           DOWN, including his heartbeat, which is the only thing we can 
           hear now:

           A woman. Walking briskly across the park... 

           CLAIRE. His daughter.

           Her belly has swollen considerably. Now she’s visibly 
           pregnant.

           Claire passes Damian by without a second glance. Of course 
           she doesn’t recognize him. Damian is dumbfounded. Can’t take 
           her eyes off her, until we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A RIGHT HOOK THAT CONNECTS WITH DAMIAN’S FACE.
           INT. GYM - DAY (END OF MONTAGE)

           Damian lands on the mat. Anton, his sparring partner, walks 
           to him and helps him get up. 

                                 ANTON
                        You OK?

           Damian nods, but he’s still groggy.

                                 ANTON (CONT’D)
                             (in Russian)
                        Where’s your head today?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t know. Somewhere.

           And he gets off the ring. Anton watches him take his gloves 
           off and walk away.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Damian turns in bed, eyes wide open: he can’t sleep.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           Damian stands on a street corner, leaning on a traffic light 
           as he sips from a cup of coffee.

           A REVERSE ANGLE shows us what he’s watching:

           Across the street, there’s CLAIRE. She’s chatting with a 
           COLLEAGUE at the entrance of her SCHOOL.

           Damian SMILES: he’ll get to see his grandchild after all...

           Behind Damian, we spot a BATTERED SEDAN parked on the side 
           street. Inside the car, someone’s watching the watcher. But 
           who?

           Then, the Driver kicks the sedan into drive and pulls out, 
           driving towards Damian...

           But Damian is oblivious to this. He watches his daughter as 
           she says goodbye to her friend and walks to the sidewalk...

           ...the sedan getting close to Damian...

           ...when a BIKE MESSENGER jumps the light and CLIPS CLAIRE 
           right as she was about to cross the street. She falls.
           Damian’s reaction is instinctive and immediate: he drops the 
           coffee and runs to her...

           ...prompting the sedan to swerve away and drive off.

           Damian reaches Claire, who’s on her knees, and HELPS HER UP.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Are you OK?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (shaken)
                        I’m fine, I think.

           Damian watches the Bike Messenger pedal away without even 
           looking back.

                                 DAMIAN
                        That pinhead.

           Claire chuckles.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Nothing. Pinhead. I... I hadn’t 
                        heard that word in a while. But 
                        thank you.

           Claire is about to walk away and Damian knows that he should 
           let her go. He knows it. And yet, he can’t help it...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Wait, are you...? You’re Claire 
                        Hayes, aren’t you?

                                 CLAIRE
                             (wary)
                        Yeah...

                                 DAMIAN
                        I... I used to work for your 
                        father.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well, sorry about that...

           Damian misses, or decides to miss, the barb.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I missed his funeral. I couldn’t 
                        make it, but I heard you gave a 
                        beautiful eulogy.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Yes, I guess I did...

           Claire is uncomfortable. She doesn’t want to talk about this. 
           She just wants to go, but Damian can’t see it.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Listen, would you like to grab a 
                        cup of coffee or something? I just 
                        spilled mine. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        What for?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t know. To talk...

                                 CLAIRE
                        About my father? About the great 
                        man?

           The bitterness in her voice takes Damian aback. Beat.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Have you read that book? That 
                        memoir someone wrote for him?

                                 DAMIAN
                        “The Man who built New York”, yes.

                                 CLAIRE
                        When I got home from the funeral, I 
                        went through it. And I realized all 
                        the stories I told in my eulogy, I 
                        learned from reading that book.

                                 DAMIAN
                        But--

                                 CLAIRE
                        I didn’t really know my father. 
                        After the divorce, he was never 
                        there. You want to talk about him? 
                        You should talk to his ghostwriter. 
                        Now if you’ll excuse me...

           And Claire walks away, leaving Damian standing there, 
           heartbroken.

           EXT. MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Establishing shot of a MODERN OFFICE BUILDING in Midtown. 
           Damian walks in.
           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Close on Damian, FIDGETING WITH A NEW BOTTLE OF PILLS.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER (O.S.)
                        And you’ve been going out? Enjoying 
                        yourself?

           Damian NODS halfheartedly. He sits on the couch across from 
           DOCTOR MILLER, who’s on an armchair. 

                                 DOCTOR MILLER (CONT’D)
                        What about the dream?

                                 DAMIAN
                        What dream?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        You know, the pier, the woman... 
                        Have you managed to see her face?

           Damian shakes his head no.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER (CONT’D)
                        You’re not very talkative today.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I guess not.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        Could it have something to do with 
                        this?

           Doctor Miller slides a MANILA ENVELOPE across the coffee 
           table. Intrigued, Damian reaches for it and opens it...

           Inside, he finds TELEPHOTO PICTURES of DAMIAN HELPING CLAIRE 
           UP, of DAMIAN AND CLAIRE TALKING...

                                 DOCTOR MILLER (CONT’D)
                        The rules were very simple.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Keep walking, don’t say anything, 
                        don’t look back, I know. 

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        And yet--

                                 DAMIAN
                        Look, it won’t happen again.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        You went looking for her...
                                 DAMIAN
                        I said it won’t happen again.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        For her own sake, let’s hope not.

           Beat. Damian sits up.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        Mr. Grey...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Is that a threat? Are you 
                        threatening my daughter?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        How can I? You don’t have a 
                        daughter.

           Touché. Damian sinks in the couch.

           INT. DARK ROOM - SAME TIME

           A VIDEO MONITOR shows Damian and Doctor Miller, recorded with 
           a hidden camera somewhere in the office. 

           We’re in a DARKENED, WINDOW-LESS ROOM, where ALBRIGHT studies 
           Damian on the monitor, very intently.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Do you think we have a problem?

           The CAMERA MOVES to reveal another man standing next to 
           Albright: it’s ANTON! He shakes his head.

                                 ANTON
                        He loves her. He’ll listen.

           Albright ponders this as he studies the monitor.

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Doctor Miller places another, smaller envelope on the table.

                                 DAMIAN
                        More pictures?
                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        No. We feel a trip will do you 
                        good. Change of scenery. Just for a 
                        few weeks.

           Inside the envelope, Damian finds a PLANE TICKET.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You didn’t give me a passport.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        It’s to Hawaii.

           Right. Damian pockets the ticket and stands up.

           EXT. TOWNHOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           A YELLOW CAB’s parked in front of Damian’s house. The CABBY 
           HONKS a couple of times and Damian emerges from inside, 
           carrying a SMALL SUITCASE.

           The Cabby opens the trunk and takes the suitcase from Damian, 
           who hasn’t noticed that someone has stepped out of the 
           BATTERED SEDAN, parked behind the cab...

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Mark?

           Damian turns: there’s a WOMAN (late 20s, beautiful in a 
           strong, self-reliant sort of way) standing on the sidewalk, a 
           few feet away from him. She seems deeply shaken.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Mark...

           Damian looks around: there’s nobody else, so she must be 
           talking to him.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Mark, what did you?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’m sorry, I... I think you’re 
                        mistaking me for someone else.

           The Cabby gets in the vehicle: whatever’s going on between 
           these two, it’s not his problem.

                                 WOMAN
                        I’m what?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Look, madam--
                                 WOMAN
                        Madam? Why are you doing this?!

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’m not doing anything. I just 
                        don’t know you.

           Damian opens the cab door and tries to get in, but she blocks 
           him, putting a hand on his chest. 

                                 WOMAN
                             (angry)
                        If you don’t know me, why is my 
                        name tattooed on your fucking 
                        chest?

           Beat. Damian doesn’t answer. Slowly, she removes her hand. 
           She’s letting him go. He gets in the cab, but before he can 
           close the door... 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        If you want to do the right thing, 
                        I’m at the Peninsula. Room 410. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           Damian finally manages to shut the door.

           INT. YELLOW CAB - CONTINUOUS

           The cab pulls out. Damian, disturbed by the encounter, sees 
           the Woman get smaller and smaller in the REARVIEW MIRROR, 
           watching the cab drive away.

           Distraught, he instinctively places a hand on his chest.

           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

           The cab arrives at the busy curb of the Departures Area.

           INT. AIRPORT RESTROOM - DAY

           Damian stands in front of the MIRROR. When the TRAVELER next 
           to him finishes washing up and leaves, Damian unbuttons his 
           shirt and EXAMINES HIS CHEST in the mirror...

           Nothing...
                                 PA SYSTEM (O.S.)
                        Last call for passengers on flight 
                        Delta 92 to Honolulu. Please 
                        proceed to gate 8.

           But wait. There is something. Upon closer inspection, Damian 
           discovers a SLIGHT DECOLORATION across the left side of his 
           chest, right where the woman placed her hand. The faint scar 
           of a tattoo that’s been removed.

           Damian looks at himself in the eye: she was right.

           He STORMS out of the restroom, leaving his suitcase behind.

           INT. AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           Damian crosses the terminal. He pulls out his CELLPHONE and 
           is about to dial a number... but he stops.

           Damian searches the terminal around him, until he spots A 
           PAYPHONE and pockets his cell.

           MOMENTS LATER-- 

           Damian sits at the PAYPHONE, holding the receiver.

                                 DAMIAN
                        New York. 477 Amsterdam Avenue, 
                        apartment 2D.
                             (beat)
                        And transfer me, please.

           While he waits, Damian scans the people around him: men, 
           women, families... Dragging luggage, talking on cellphones. 
           Are any of them watching him? He can’t be sure.

           Then, someone answers the phone.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Yes, hi. This is going to sound 
                        strange, but I’m trying to reach 
                        your neighbor. She’s in 2C. Her 
                        name’s Claire. There must be 
                        something wrong with her phone, 
                        cause I can’t get through.
                             (beat)
                        I know, I know. But it’s an 
                        emergency. If you could go get her, 
                        I really need to speak to her.

           Beat. Damian closes his eyes, waiting for an answer... 
           Until...
                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                             (relieved)
                        Thank you.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. NEIGHBOR’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           We stay on the RECEIVER, laying on a living room table. We 
           see the NEIGHBOR in the background, leading Claire into the 
           room. She walks to the phone and picks up, clearly confused.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hello?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Claire?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Who is this?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Claire, this is a friend of your 
                        father’s. We met yesterday, outside 
                        your school.

           Claire’s uneasy. This guy again...

                                 CLAIRE
                        What do you want? Wait, how did you 
                        get this number?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Look, yesterday was not a 
                        coincidence. Right before he died, 
                        your father asked me to keep an eye 
                        on you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        My father asked you--

                                 DAMIAN
                        He got in bed with some dangerous 
                        people. He was afraid they’d target 
                        you.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Look, I had nothing to do with my 
                        father’s business.
                                 DAMIAN
                        They don’t care about that, these 
                        people could hurt you. Claire, I 
                        need you to go away for a while.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Wait, what?

           The neighbor watches Claire with a mixture of curiosity and 
           worry.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Go to your cousin’s. Just for a few 
                        days. I’ll come and get you as soon 
                        as this thing blows over.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Are you insane?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Claire--

                                 CLAIRE
                        You expect me to do what some 
                        wackjob tells me over the phone?

           Beat. Damian breathes deeply.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Claire... Claire, you have no 
                        reason to believe me when I tell 
                        you this, but your father loved you 
                        and he made me promise I’d take 
                        care of you. You were his Lapushka. 
                        Do you know what that means?

           This word hits Claire. She’s overwhelmed by emotion...

                                 CLAIRE
                        His little paw...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Please, Claire, do what I ask you 
                        to.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Please.

           About to cry, Claire hangs up. 
           Damian stares at the phone, no way of knowing if Claire will 
           do what he asked her to.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           We follow Damian down a hotel hallway. He walks fast, 
           determined.

           When he reaches a door, it’s room 410. He knocks.

           A few seconds later, the door opens...

                                 WOMAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Well, good of you to--

           Damian pushes it open all the way...

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           ...and storms into the...

           HOTEL ROOM--

           Damian looks around, always on the move.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You need to go.

                                 WOMAN
                        What?

                                 DAMIAN
                        You need to pack and go. Where are 
                        your things? 

           Damian opens a CLOSET. Inside there are clothes on hangers 
           and a SUITCASE on the floor.

                                 WOMAN
                        What do you think you’re doing?

           Damian throws the suitcase on the bed and opens it. He grabs 
           the clothes from the hangers and throws them inside the 
           suitcase.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Stop!

           The woman grabs his arm... 
                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        I said STOP!

           Damian does, indeed, stop. After a beat:

                                 DAMIAN
                        If you don’t want me to do it, you 
                        do it, but you need to leave. Now.

                                 WOMAN
                        Mark, what are you talking about?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Look, I don’t have time to explain. 
                        All I can tell you is you’re not 
                        safe. Not if you stay. You need to 
                        go back to wherever you came 
                        from...

                                 WOMAN
                        Wherever I--?

                                 DAMIAN
                        ...and never contact me again.

           Beat.

                                 WOMAN
                        If you think I’ll just pack and go 
                        back to Oregon, you don’t know me 
                        at all.

           An impasse. 

           The woman looks at Damian and, for a moment, her exasperation 
           turns into tenderness. She reaches for Damian’s face, and the 
           moment she touches him, we...

           FLASH CUT to DAMIAN’S DREAM: the WOMAN at the end of the 
           pier, turning towards us. We can almost see her face. Are 
           they the same person...? 

           Damian recoils from her touch, disturbed. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                             (puzzled)
                        Mark, what’s--

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           There’s someone at the door. They go quiet.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Stay here.
           Damian walks to door and looks out the peephole:

           Standing in the hallway there’s ANTON. It takes Damian half a 
           second to put two and two together: Anton works for Albright.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Anton’s about to knock again, when Damian slowly opens the 
           door...

                                 ANTON
                        Hello, Ed.

           Now Damian can see that Anton is flanked by two dangerous-
           looking MERCENARIES. Their civilian clothes can’t quite 
           conceal they’re military types. 

                                 ANTON (CONT’D)
                        Albright’s waiting for you down the 
                        hallway.

           Anton opens his jacket just enough to reveal A GUN WITH A 
           SILENCER.

                                 ANTON (CONT’D)
                        You should go.

           Or else. The threat is unmistakable. Damian walks out of the 
           room, but stops for a beat: 

                                 DAMIAN
                        Anton. Is that even your real name?

                                 ANTON
                             (nods)
                        Anton Rublev.

                                 DAMIAN
                        And your kids?

                                 ANTON
                             (in Russian)
                        I have no kids.

           Damian shakes his head in disgust and continues. Anton 
           doesn’t give a shit. He barks an ORDER IN RUSSIAN to 
           Mercenary 1, who escorts Damian down the hallway. 

           Anton and the other Mercenary enter the woman’s room.
           INT. HOTEL - ROOM 416 - CONTINUOUS

           Mercenary 1 opens the door to another, larger room and leads 
           Damian inside. Albright sits in an armchair, with a third 
           MERCENARY standing by. 

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        You were supposed to be on a plane 
                        right now.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (angry)
                        Is that how you really want to 
                        start this conversation?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        No. You’re right. You deserve an 
                        apology.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You think?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        She shouldn’t be here. We’re still 
                        trying to figure out how she found 
                        you.

           Damian paces the room.

                                 DAMIAN
                        She... Who is she? Better yet, who 
                        is this?

           Damian points at himself. When Albright speaks, he does so 
           carefully and deliberately.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Her name’s Madeleine Russell. She 
                        and her husband have a daughter, 
                        Anna. Two years ago, when she was 
                        four, she was diagnosed with a 
                        congenital heart defect. The 
                        procedure that could save her, the 
                        insurance wouldn’t pay for it. They 
                        deemed it “experimental.” The 
                        Russells could have gone to court, 
                        but they didn’t have the time.

           ON DAMIAN, listening, as the truth about his new body dawns 
           on him. He understands now:

                                 DAMIAN
                        How much did you pay him?
                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Two million dollars. In the form of 
                        life insurance after he went 
                        missing at sea.

           Damian sits on the bed, devastated. Albright stands and 
           approaches him.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        When patients knew the truth, the 
                        adjustment process became so much 
                        harder. Some people killed 
                        themselves, they couldn’t take it.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You lied to me.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        I told you what you wanted to hear. 
                        When I showed you those bodies, 
                        deep inside, wasn’t there a truth 
                        you suspected but refused to 
                        confront?

           Damian doesn’t answer. Maybe there’s some truth to that.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Look, I provide a valuable service.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You’re a guy who saved his own ass 
                        and now’s rationalizing.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Tell that to Anton. He got his legs 
                        blown off in Chechnya and now he 
                        can walk. Anna is alive because of 
                        you.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I could have given them the money.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Yeah, but would you have?

           Touché. Beat. Damian stands up. He’s feeling sick.

                                 DAMIAN
                        This is insane.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Now maybe. Five years from now it 
                        will be legal.
                                 DAMIAN
                        You are insane, if you believe 
                        that.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Where do you think your money goes? 
                        A third of Congress is where it is 
                        thanks to us. Half will be two 
                        years from now. What do you think 
                        will happen when they come 
                        knocking, hat in hand, and we 
                        reveal to them what we do? We are 
                        already one of the biggest lobbies 
                        in Washington. They will pass 
                        legislation or they will lose. And 
                        then, there’ll be no more hiding.

           The walls seem to spin around Damian. This is a nightmare. 
           Worse than a nightmare. He backs against a wall for support.

                                 DAMIAN
                        And now-- what?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Now you go back to being Ed Grey 
                        and we clean up the mess.

                                 DAMIAN
                        How?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Don’t worry. You can’t run an 
                        operation like this without buying 
                        yourself a few friends in law 
                        enforcement. 

                                 DAMIAN
                        What about the woman?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Madeleine?

                                 DAMIAN
                        What will happen to her?

           Beat.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        She’s seen a dead man.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You’re not going to kill her...

           Albright shakes his head no.
                                 ALBRIGHT
                        We have a quadriplegic client. 
                        Diving accident. She’s a perfect 
                        match for her.
                             (beat)
                        If it’s any consolation, the 
                        process for the donor is completely 
                        painless.

           Now Damian really feels sick. He retches and stumbles into 
           the BATHROOM. Albright looks at Mercenary 1 and nods towards 
           the bathroom: go with him.

           INT. HOTEL - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Mercenary closes the bathroom door. Damian is hugging the 
           toilet. A contemptuous smirk appears on the Mercenary’s face: 
           he has no sympathy for Damian.

           Damian flushes the toilet and manages to stand up. He turns 
           on the faucet and lets the cool water run over his face...

           When he looks up, he comes face to face with HIS REFLECTION 
           IN THE MIRROR.

           Himself. Or more precisely, the face of the man whose life he 
           stole.

           A long beat, as Damian searches for his own soul in the eyes 
           of another man...

           FLASH CUT TO THE DREAM: The WOMAN at the end of the pier 
           finishes her turn. We can finally see her face. She’s 
           MADELEINE. Smiling. Tenderly. Beautiful.

           Then, a steely resolution appears in Damian’s eyes: He can’t 
           allow this to happen.

           His right hand reaches for the hand towel, but actually grabs 
           the METAL ROD that holds it.

           Damian takes one deep breath...

           ...and spins, swinging the rod at the Mercenary.

           BAAAM! The swing is fast and the Mercenary can barely block 
           it.

           IN THE ROOM OUTSIDE- Albright jumps, while Mercenary 3 
           immediately reaches for his gun.

           IN THE BATHROOM- A brutal hand-to-hand fight is taking place.
           Mercenary 1 fights back. He punches Damian in the belly. 
           Once, Twice. But Damian throws a right hook that sends the 
           Mercenary flying against the mirror, shattering it in a 
           thousand pieces. Looks like all the boxing practice is paying 
           off.

           Bloodied, the Mercenary charges against Damian and throws him 
           against the shower... 

           But Damian manages to put his feet against the shower wall 
           and pushes back...

           ...sending the two of them across the room and smashing the 
           cabinet on the other end. 

           Enough is enough: the Mercenary reaches for his GUN and 
           DRAWS.

           Damian grabs the Mercenary’s wrist, trying to divert the gun. 
           The two men are very close... When the Mercenary pulls the 
           trigger... POP! The bullet misses Damian’s side by a hair. 

           Damian pushes the Mercenary’s arm more and more...

           ...until it starts bending in an unnatural way...

           ...and the barrel of the gun hovers somewhere between his 
           chin and the Mercenary’s...

           ...and Damian places his finger right on top of the 
           Mercenary’s finger and PULLS THE TRIGGER right as we... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE ROOM OUTSIDE--

           POP, POP, POP!

           Albright and Mercenary 3 hear the SILENCED SHOTS coming from 
           behind the bathroom door... And then nothing... Silence...

           They exchange nervous glances.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Whoever comes out that door, shoot.

           Albright sneaks out of the room, leaving his man alone, 
           facing that CLOSED DOOR...

           Mercenary 3 keeps the gun aimed at the door, unnerved. From 
           inside the bathroom, not a sound. Could they both be dead?
           He takes cautious steps towards the door, never lowering his 
           weapon...

           ...reaches for the doorknob with his left hand...

           ...turns it and...

           POP, POP, POP!

           BULLETS PIERCE THE DOOR and hit him right in the chest.

           The Mercenary stumbles for a moment and then crumples to the 
           floor.

           The door swings open and reveals DAMIAN, holding the smoking 
           gun in one hand and clutching his side with the other. He’s 
           wounded.

           For a moment, he stares at the gun in his hand, amazed that 
           he was capable of doing what he just did.

           But there’s no time to lose. Damian steps over the Mercenary 
           and heads for the door. Gun raised. Not knowing what awaits 
           him around the corner.

           He’s almost at the door, when SOMEONE appears. Damian’s about 
           to shoot...

           ...but it turns out to be just a couple of MIDDLE-AGED 
           TOURISTS. Judging by what they wear, they’re coming back from 
           a matinee of “Wicked”.

           The tourists freeze, their worst fears about New York City 
           coming true, until...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Enjoy your stay.

           ...Damian pulls the gun from their faces and runs towards 
           Room 410.

           We follow him, down the hallway...

           ...as he reaches Madeleine’s room, the door ajar...

           ...pushes it open, gun always ready...

           And finds that the ROOM IS EMPTY. She’s gone, the suitcase’s 
           gone. Just an unmade bed.

           Damian bursts back into the hallway and runs, runs, runs... 

           ...TURNS A CORNER...
           Just in time to see the DOORS OF A SERVICE ELEVATOR CLOSE at 
           the far end of this new hallway. Inside the elevator, he 
           catches a glimpse of ANTON AND MERCENARY 2 HOLDING MADELEINE.

           Damian runs towards the elevator: the screen above the door 
           indicates THEY’RE GOING DOWN. 4, 3, 2...

           So Damian BLASTS THROUGH THE EMERGENCY EXIT to reach...

           A STAIRCASE--

           SIRENS BLARE the moment Damian opens that door and RACES down 
           the stairs, four or five steps at a time.

           THIRD FLOOR, SECOND FLOOR...

           When he reaches the FIRST FLOOR he runs out of the staircase 
           and into the--

           LOBBY--

           Guests turn and gawk at the frantic, disheveled man coming 
           out of the staircase. Damian rushes to hide his gun under the 
           jacket and faces the elevator...

           But the SCREEN on the elevator shows they’re skipping the 
           first floor. They’re going to the PARKING GARAGE!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL - PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Damian storms out of the staircase and reaches the garage. At 
           the far end of the garage, he spots THE MERCENARY JUMPING 
           BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A NONDESCRIPT VAN... 

           ...while ANTON DRAGS MADELEINE INTO THE BACK.

           Damian pulls up the gun and aims...

           But he cannot get a clean shot. Madeleine’s in the way. Shit.

           The van takes off before the back door has even been shut and 
           heads for the ramp.

           Time to run again.

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Damian sprints across the lobby. This time he doesn’t even 
           bother to pretend. We follow him out the revolving doors...
           EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, a GUEST is handing the CAR KEYS to the VALET, when 
           Damian charges between them, SNATCHING THE KEYS.

                                 VALET
                        Hey!

           But Damian slides across the hood of the car, a brand-new 
           AUDI A4, and jumps behind the wheel. The DOOR SLAMS and a 
           second later, he BURNS RUBBER OUT OF THERE.   

           I/E. AUDI - CONTINUOUS

           Damian steps on the gas, startled guest and valet receding in 
           the rearview mirror.

           He’s about to make a right on the next street, hoping to 
           intercept the van...

           But just as he reaches the intersection, he sees the VAN has 
           already exited the garage and is passing that block.

           It’s too late, so he SWERVES LEFT to stay on the avenue 
           and...

           HOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!!!

           A BUS almost rear ends him from the left. God, that was 
           close.

           Now Damian really floors it. He changes lanes, passing cars, 
           missing them by inches. This is suicide... 

           ONE BLOCK, TWO BLOCKS... At each intersection, he sees the 
           van driving up the next avenue. He’s catching up.

           Then, THE LIGHT AHEAD TURNS RED!

           Fuck it. Damian JUMPS THE RED LIGHT and makes a sharp right.

           The OTHER CARS SCREECH TO A HALT and barely miss him, as 
           Damian speeds along the side street, headed towards... 

           THE INTERSECTION, where a moment later THE VAN APPEARS.

           This is split-second decision-making. Damian doesn’t slow 
           down. Instead, he ACCELERATES and heads straight for the van!

           Mercenary 2 sees him, but only a fraction of a second before:

           THE AUDI RAMS AGAINST THE DRIVER’S DOOR.
           BLAAAAAAAAAAAAM!

           The impact is brutal. METAL TWISTS. GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE. 
           THE AIRBAG DEPLOYS and pushes Damian against the seat.

           After a few seconds, Damian opens his eyes. Still groggy, he 
           manages to push the door open and stumble out of the car.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

           The Audi is a wreck, its hood crumpled against the van. The 
           front of the van is wedged between the car and the traffic 
           light that stopped it on the other side.

           Damian takes tentative steps towards the van, gun ready, but 
           as he walks past the smoke he realizes that THE MERCENARY HAS 
           BEEN KILLED INSTANTLY. 

           On the passenger seat, Anton is still alive, but barely: a 
           METAL ROD PIERCES HIS ABDOMEN. He looks at Damian, helpless. 
           He tries to talk, but can’t. He doesn’t have long.

           Damian rushes to the back of the van, as PEOPLE start to 
           gather around the scene of the accident. 

           Damian pulls the back door open: he finds MADELEINE, bruised 
           but alive. Her wrists bound, her mouth gagged.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (removing the gag)
                        Are you alright?

           Madeleine nods, too shocked to talk. 

           Damian proceeds to untie her wrists. He can hear a POLICE 
           SIREN, getting closer and closer.

           Damian pulls Madeleine out of the van...

                                 MADELEINE
                             (still in a daze)
                        Wait...

           ...and drags her through the SMALL CROWD that’s already 
           forming. Out the corner of his eye, Damian spots the POLICE 
           CAR approaching.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Where are we going?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’ll explain. Let’s go.
           The two turn a corner right as the cops arrive.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           The magnificent view of the skyline on Central Park South in 
           the distance. Closer, at ground level, we find Damian and 
           Madeleine. 

           He’s leading her into the RAMBLE, the more heavily wooded 
           area of the park. But the leading turns to dragging as 
           Madeleine recovers.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Stop, stop... STOP!

           Madeleine frees herself and refuses to keep going. Damian 
           scans their surroundings, looking for Albright’s men.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Madeleine...

                                 MADELEINE
                        Madeleine? Since when? What 
                        happened to Maddie?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Maddie. We have to keep moving. You 
                        saw those guys, we’re not safe.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Those guys, who are those guys?
                             (beat)
                        Rangers? You know them from 
                        Afghanistan?

           She wants answers. Damian realizes he’s going to have to give 
           her something if he wants her to keep moving. 

                                 DAMIAN
                        Yes. 
                             (Improvise, improvise!)
                        We needed money. For Anna. These 
                        people, they... found out and 
                        offered me a deal. They’d give us 
                        the money we needed if I... faked 
                        my own death and did... things for 
                        them.

                                 MADELEINE
                        What kind of things?
                                 DAMIAN
                        Illegal things, things a “dead man” 
                        can get away with. That’s why I was 
                        supposed to be dead and you were 
                        never supposed to find out. You 
                        could not know. But now you do, and 
                        you’re in danger, and so is Anna. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s why we need to keep moving.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Anna...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Where is she? Home?

                                 MADELEINE
                        No, I left her in Pittsburgh with 
                        Sally and Fred.

                                 DAMIAN
                        We have to get her.

                                 MADELEINE
                        How?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - THE RAMBLE - LATER

           The dense, unkept woods of the Ramble. One of the trees 
           sports a STAR-SHAPED MARK that’s been carved on its bark...

           ...and right under this tree, Damian and Madeleine are 
           digging with their bare hands.

           They dig and dig, until they hit something buried in the 
           dirt... A bright-colored object... It’s THE TIN BOX we saw 
           Damian carry around before.

           When he OPENS it, we finally understand what it was: inside 
           there are WADS OF CASH, A BLACK POUCH and A KEY.

           Like a time capsule, this is stuff Damian left for himself in 
           case something went wrong. Smart guy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE KEY FITS INTO A LOCK AND A ROLL-UP DOOR GOES UP, 
           revealing...

           A CORVETTE STING RAY. Classic. And in mint condition.
           We realize that Damian and Madeleine have just opened an 
           OUTDOOR STORAGE UNIT. Madeleine’s confused. She eyes other 
           stuff in the storage unit: pictures and mementos belonging to 
           one Damian Hayes.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Whose car is this?

                                 DAMIAN
                        A guy I know. He wanted to keep it 
                        away from the IRS.

           And he gets into the car.

           EXT. STORAGE SPACE - AFTERNOON

           The Corvette speeds out of the storage unit.

           INT. DARK ROOM - SAME TIME

           Albright paces furiously, while an image of Damian appears 
           frozen on the video monitors. Doctor Miller watches him.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        How come we didn’t know Hayes had 
                        combat training?

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        He doesn’t.

           Albright catches an ever-so-slightly emphasis on the first 
           word. He doesn’t? Doctor Miller hands him a folder.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Mark Russell served two tours of 
                        duty in Afghanistan. Army Ranger.

           Albright goes over the donor’s file.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        But the donor’s dormant.

                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        As long as he takes his meds. Even 
                        then...

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        What?
                                 DOCTOR MILLER
                        There’s a primal aspect, a part 
                        that’s so ingrained in the instinct 
                        for survival that it may kick in 
                        when the patient feels threatened.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Jesus...

           Albright pulls out his CELL as he turns to the video monitor.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Get a hold of the daughter. We need 
                        to get a twenty on this guy.

           On screen, Damian’s face seems to stare back at him.

           EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

           The Corvette drives over the GW Bridge, leaving Manhattan 
           behind, the setting sun ahead of them.

           EXT. VARIOUS ROADS - DUSK

           The Corvette races along the freeway, across New Jersey and 
           into Pennsylvania. Urban becomes suburban. Suburban becomes 
           rural.

           INT. CORVETTE - DUSK

           While Damian drives, Madeleine pulls out a CELLPHONE and 
           starts dialing.  Damian immediately reaches out to close the 
           cell.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Don’t. They may be listening.

           By reaching out, Damian offers a glimpse of the BLOODIED 
           SHIRT under his jacket. 

           Madeleine sees it and, alarmed, pulls the jacket aside...

                                 MADELEINE
                        God, Mark.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I know.

                                 MADELEINE
                        We’ve got to stop.
           Damian shakes his head no.

                                 DAMIAN
                        We keep driving, we can be there by 
                        morning.

                                 MADELEINE
                        We don’t stop, you won’t make it 
                        till morning.

           Damian looks at Madeleine: she’s not kidding.

           EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           A seedy motel where no one would like to spend more than one 
           night at.

           The Corvette pulls up to the parking lot.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A thin-walled room, all kinds of noises coming from the 
           adjoining rooms.

           Damian, sitting on the bed, struggles to take off his jacket, 
           while Madeleine returns from the bathroom carrying a few 
           TOWELS.

           Madeleine helps him unbutton his shirt. She pauses for a 
           moment when she notices the TATOO IS GONE, but she says 
           nothing, because the WOUND in his side claims her attention.

           She examines it and it looks like she knows what she’s doing.

                                 MADELEINE
                        The bullet went through. I think I 
                        can handle it.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You can handle it?

                                 MADELEINE
                        Don’t flatter yourself. When you 
                        get down to it, you’re not that 
                        different from a cow. Not that I 
                        treat many cows for bullet wounds.

           So she’s a veterinarian? Damian has to conceal his surprise. 

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        I saw a drugstore by the freeway. 
                        I’m going to need a few things. 
           Madeleine presses one of the towels against the wound and 
           then puts Damian’s hand on the towel.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        You keep pressing this. I’ll be 
                        back in ten minutes. Keys? 

           Damian reaches into the jacket and hands her the car keys.

           INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

           We follow MADELEINE down the starkly bright aisles of the 
           drugstore, as she grabs PAINKILLERS...

           ...RUBBING ALCOHOL...

           ...GAUZE... 

           ...BANDAGES...

           INT. DRUGSTORE - CHECKOUT - NIGHT

           The CASHIER is an overweight woman in her mid-20s who’s just 
           finished scanning all the items.

                                 CASHIER
                        It’ll be twenty-four fifty.

           Madeleine opens her wallet. She just has a twenty in there. 
           So she pulls out a CREDIT CARD and hands it to the cashier.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Damian holds the towel with one hand and uses the other to 
           dig into his pocket and pull out the BOTTLE OF PILLS.

           With some difficulty, he manages to pop it open: inside, 
           there are only about six pills.

           Damian swallows one, when he catches movement out the window: 
           Madeleine’s coming back. 

           He hurries to put the cap back on the bottle and slides it 
           into his pocket, right as the door opens and Madeleine 
           enters.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Hey.

                                                                CUT TO:
           LATER--

           Madeleine’s carefully cleaning up Damian’s wound.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Two tours in Afghanistan without a 
                        scratch and you go and get shot in 
                        New York City.

           Madeleine pads alcohol on the wound. Damian FLINCHES.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        You big baby.

           Madeleine proceeds to tape GAUZE over the entry wound.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You still haven’t told me how you 
                        found me.

           Madeleine looks into Damian’s eyes for a moment, before she 
           continues dressing his wounds.

                                 MADELEINE
                        They said the yard hit you. They 
                        said you were out on the boat and 
                        the yard must’ve been unsecured and 
                        it knocked you over board.
                             (beat)
                        Mark, you’ve never left an 
                        unsecured yard in your life. When 
                        it comes to sailing, you’re the 
                        most anal person I know.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Right.

                                 MADELEINE
                        And then this check comes in, from 
                        a life insurance I didn’t even know 
                        you had. And they pay up, just like 
                        that. There’s no body, but they pay 
                        up without a peep. After Anna, we 
                        both know insurance companies will 
                        do just about anything to get out 
                        of paying. It just didn’t feel 
                        right.

           Madeleine prepares another bandage.

                                 DAMIAN
                        So what did you do?
                                 MADELEINE
                        I followed the money. The check 
                        came from New York, so I dropped 
                        Anna with Fred and Sally and looked 
                        up the address. All I found was an 
                        empty office. Locked, nobody in. 
                        But I waited. And waited. Until a 
                        guy showed up to pick up the mail. 
                        I followed him to another building, 
                        some place with doctor’s offices. 
                        Well, you know the place, because I 
                        staked it out and I waited some 
                        more and one day who do I see but 
                        my dead husband walking in. 

           Madeleine makes him turn around to take care of the exit 
           wound. Now he’s facing away from her.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Maddie...

           This time she just POURS the alcohol on the wound. Ouch. That 
           shuts him up fast.

                                 MADELEINE
                        My dead husband, alive. Not just 
                        alive, but making out with some 
                        twenty year old dressed like a 
                        hooker.

           Madeleine slaps him in the back of the head.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        If you weren’t hurt I’d make you 
                        sleep on the floor.

           But she cannot stay mad for long. She puts her arms around 
           him and rests her head against his. In spite of everything, 
           it feels good to have him back.  

           A physical proximity that’s normal for Madeleine, but very 
           awkward for Damian, who doesn’t know what to do...

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           PUSH IN ON MADELEINE, sound asleep on one side of the bed. 

           Her cellphone rests on the night stand... when a HAND enters 
           frame and grabs it.
           INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Damian sits on the bathroom floor, back against the wall. He 
           holds Madeleine’s cellphone as he goes over the PHOTOS stored 
           in it. He sees:

           MARK, ASLEEP ON A HAMMOCK...

           MARK, SMILING PROUDLY IN HIS SERVICE UNIFORM...

           MARK HOLDING A LITTLE GIRL, ANNA, BOTH OF THEM LAUGHING...

           MARK AND MADELEINE ON A SAILBOAT, MUGGING FOR THE CAMERA...

           Happy moments... For Damian, it’s unreal to see his own face 
           on somebody else’s life, a life he stole... 

           Then, he notices something on the cellphone screen: A VIDEO 
           FILE named “B-Day”. He plays it:

           The VIDEO ON THE CELLPHONE shows-- 

           A pixelated image of a DARKENED DOORWAY... until someone 
           comes out of the dark, carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE.

                                 VOICES OFF-SCREEN
                        Happy birthday to you, happy 
                        birthday to you, happy birthday 
                        dear Anna...

           The person holding the cake is Mark: for the first time, 
           Damian sees him come to life. The light from the BIRTHDAY 
           CANDLES makes him look like an apparition.

           We realize that we’re in a HOSPITAL ROOM when Mark places the 
           cake on an overbed table, in front of Anna. She looks ill, 
           but she musters enough strength to blow out the candles. The 
           GUESTS clap.

                                 MADELEINE
                             (off screen: she’s 
                              recording the scene)
                        Did you make a wish, button?

                                 ANNA
                        I want Dad to teach me how to swim.

           The camera finds Mark. For a moment, his face darkens: does 
           he already know he won’t be around much longer?

                                 DICKISH COUSIN
                        You were not supposed to say! Now 
                        it won’t come true!
                                 ANNA
                             (worried)
                        Dad! Is that true?

                                 MARK
                        Of course not. I’ll teach you. As 
                        soon as you get better, we’ll go 
                        down to the point and I’ll teach 
                        you all the strokes.

           Mark does his best to sound cheery and cover his sadness. 

           We STAY ON DAMIAN, watching the scene as the birthday party 
           keeps playing off screen... 

           For the first time, the full weight of what he’s done comes 
           crashing down on him.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Madeleine, now awake, watches the sliver of light coming from 
           under the bathroom door...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Slowly, the darkness breaks. The SUN is rising.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           Sunlight filters through the curtains, falling on...

           DAMIAN, fast asleep. But the light seems to bother him and, 
           after a twist and a turn, he finally OPENS HIS EYES.

           He finds the other half of the bed EMPTY and immediately 
           SPRINGS FORWARD, alarmed. Where’s Madeleine?!

           Suddenly, THE DOORKNOB TURNS, the door opens and...

           MADELEINE WALKS INTO THE ROOM, carrying two cups of coffee.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Shit, what time is it? Why didn’t 
                        you wake me up?

                                 MADELEINE
                        You got shot, remember? You needed 
                        some rest. Vet’s orders.

           Madeleine puts one of the cups on the night table, by 
           Damian’s side.
                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Black. Two sugars.

           Damian smiles, unsure, and sits on the edge of the bed. He 
           grabs his SHIRT. He tries to put it on but the gunshot wound 
           sends a sharp PANG OF PAIN through his body.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Easy there.

           Madeleine carefully helps him with it. She kneels in front of 
           him and tenderly BUTTONS IT UP for him. 

           The action is INTIMATE, their faces very close to each other. 
           When she reaches the top button, Madeleine looks Damian 
           straight into his eyes and smiles, making him UNCOMFORTABLE.

           After a silent beat, Damian breaks the intimacy of the 
           moment.

                                 DAMIAN
                        We should go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The racing ASPHALT disappearing under the car.

           INT. MUSCLE CAR - DAY

           Damian’s hands are tight around the driving wheel as he 
           speeds through the highway.

           On the passenger seat, Madeleine fidgets with the RADIO dial, 
           changing stations. The result is an ANNOYING CACOPHONY.

           That, added to the pain on his side every time he shifts 
           gears, is giving Damian a headache.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 MADELEINE
                        Looking for something, something 
                        about yesterday. 

                                 DAMIAN
                        You won’t find anything.

                                 MADELEINE
                        A shooting like that... Maybe they 
                        arrested someone.
                                 DAMIAN
                        Forget it. They’re too good at 
                        covering their tracks.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Who are these people?

           Suddenly, Damian raises his finger. A gesture for silence.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Damian turns the radio off and LISTENS CAREFULLY. Madeleine, 
           confused, listens too.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Can you hear that?

           Yes, she can. Under the rumble of the engine, A DISTANT 
           BEATING NOISE, ominous in its implications.

           Damian looks up through the windshield and SCANS THE SKY 
           until...

           There it is, A HELICOPTER in the distance, a small dot beyond 
           the tree line.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Maybe it’s nothing. A traffic 
                        helicopter.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Wouldn’t bet on it.
                             (beat)
                        Have you been using your cell?

                                 MADELEINE
                        No.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Did you call your parents, even 
                        from a pay phone?

                                 MADELEINE
                        No!

                                 DAMIAN
                        What about credit cards?

           Madeleine doesn’t answer. Yes, she did. At the pharmacy.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Ok. It’s ok. It’s gonna be 
                        fine.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        They know the car now. We have to 
                        lose them. Switch cars.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Over there.

           Madeleine points at a HUGE SHOPPING MALL rapidly approaching.

           Damian abruptly TURNS RIGHT, cutting in front of an SUV. 
           Caught by surprise, the car HONKS in a panic and violently 
           BREAKS, causing a chain reaction of cars swerving and 
           skidding.

           Damian rapidly takes the NEXT EXIT to the mall, leaving the 
           near accident behind. 

           As they exit the highway, Madeleine looks at the HELICOPTER 
           hovering over the road through the rear window.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Who are these people?

           EXT. MALL - DAY

           Damian’s car makes its way through the outdoors parking lot 
           around the mall, dodging cars and shoppers, when...

           Madeleine spots a CAR. It looks normal except for its 
           suspicious TINTED WINDOWS.

           Then she spots another one, different model, same windows. 
           And another one. And another one. They’re closing in...

           Damian drives the car into the...

           INT. MALL - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Corvette rushes through the parking garage and parks. 
           Immediately, the doors open and they step out of the car.

           She’s ready to leave when she notices Damian taking one last 
           look at the car.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Mark...

           Damian puts his hand on the hood...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Shit, I’ll miss you, boy.
           ...when, suddenly, the sound of RUBBER TIRES SCREECHING 
           catches their attention. The TINTED WINDOW CARS are driving 
           down the different ramps, blocking the exits.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           Damian grabs Madeleine by the hand and they run towards the 
           escalators.

           INT. MALL - DAY

           The two of them emerge in the middle of the CROWDED mall. 
           MUZZAK fills the antiseptic building as shoppers flow in 
           streams. 

           Damian pulls Madeleine into the crowd. Keeping their heads 
           down and walking at regular pace, they BLEND IN as two 
           regular shoppers.

           Suddenly, Madeleine SQUEEZES HIS HAND and shoots a look at 
           the gallery above their heads:

           Leaning on the rail, there’s a NORMAL LOOKING GUY in his 30s, 
           plaid shirt, khakis... But something gives him away. He’s 
           wearing an EARPIECE!

           Damian and Madeleine make a sharp right, away from the 
           MERCENARY, and into another hall of stores.

           Damian shoots quick glances over his shoulder. There they 
           are, scattered among the crowd, MERCENARIES in civilian 
           clothes, spreading, discreetly SEARCHING THE MALL.

           He spots ANOTHER ONE, BLOCKING THEIR WAY. He hasn’t seen them 
           yet, but he’s walking straight towards them.

           Damian yanks Madeleine to the left and into the...

           FOOD COURT--

           Loud and busy, the food court is crowded with parents, 
           children and obnoxious teenagers chewing on their favorite 
           fast food as they holler at each other from separate tables.

           Damian and Madeleine quicken their pace across the room when 
           a VOICE calls their attention.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Stop it, Jason. Stop it! 
           It belongs to a FATHER, a broken and exhausted man with a 
           BAWLING TODDLER on his lap and an a not too happy 6 YEAR OLD 
           BOY sitting across the table. Between them, a battlefield of 
           half eaten fries, chicken fingers and puddles of ketchup.

                                 FATHER
                        Put the fries down and eat the 
                        chicken.

                                 SON
                        I hate chicken!

                                 FATHER
                        What?! Who hates chi--? You had it 
                        last week!

                                 SON
                             (louder)
                        I hate chicken! It’s gross!

           The Father picks up a chicken finger...

                                 FATHER
                        It’s not gross! See, I’m eating it. 
                        I’m eating it! Mmmmhhh... so 
                        good...

           ...and nibbles at it with a FORCED SMILE.

                                 DAMIAN (O.S.)
                        Do you mind if I sit?

           The Father looks up to see Damian and Madeleine standing in 
           front of him.

                                 FATHER
                        Excuse me?

           Damian takes a chair from a nearby table, right when a 
           TEENAGER with a tray is about to sit...

                                 TEENAGER
                        Dude!

           ...and takes a seat.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I saw you across the room and I 
                        thought, that’s a man in the need 
                        of a break, if I ever saw one. 
                        Would you mind answering me a 
                        question for a hundred dollars? No 
                        strings attached.
           Damian puts a CRISP HUNDRED DOLLARS BILL on the table. The 
           Father’s eyes widen.

                                 FATHER
                        S--sure...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Is your car parked outside?

                                 FATHER
                        What?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Outside, on the street. It’s a yes 
                        or no question. 

                                 FATHER
                        Y-- yes...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Good.
                             (beat)
                        Now, what would you say if I 
                        offered you fifty thousand dollars 
                        for it?

           As he says this, Damian reaches in his inside pocket and 
           produces a FAT ENVELOPE overflowing with BILLS. It’s not only 
           the Father who is dumbfounded, but MADELEINE AS WELL, seeing 
           that thick wad of cash on the table.

                                 FATHER
                        Yes?

           With a smile, Damian puts his hand out.

                                 DAMIAN
                        It’s a deal, then.

           After a beat, the Father gets it and fumbles in his pocket, 
           putting the CAR KEYS on his hand. Damian immediately pockets 
           them and STORMS OUT with Madeleine.

           The Father rushes to open the envelope and check if he’s been 
           conned. Nope, it’s real...

                                 FATHER
                        Hey, man! Thanks!

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Damian and Madeleine rush past a CLOTHING STORE when 
           Madeleine stops and pulls him inside.
           INT. MALL - CLOTHING STORE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s a two-floor CHAIN STORE for the hip and the young, where 
           jeans are sold next to fake vintage T-shirts and Japanese 
           inspired toys.

           Madeleine grabs a BASEBALL HAT and tosses it to Damian. She 
           tries another hat on herself.

           SUNGLASSES. They take a pair each from a rack and look 
           themselves in the mirror. They look unrecognizable enough...

           Suddenly, Damian spots something in the reflection: A 
           Mercenary entering the store. He hasn’t seen them yet. Damian 
           nods towards him, warning Madeleine of his presence.

           With their exit blocked, they have to walk deeper into the 
           store. They make their way through wades of costumers, moving 
           briskly but not fast enough to attract attention.

           But the Mercenary, scanning faces as he walks, slowly CLOSES 
           IN ON THEM.

           Damian and Madeleine soon find that the only way to keep 
           going is THE FITTING ROOM. On their way, Madeleine snatches A 
           COUPLE OF RAINCOATS.

           INT. MALL - CLOTHING STORE - FITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           In front of them, two rows of CHANGING BOOTHS on both sides.

           And, at the end of the corridor, A DOOR WITH A SIGN that 
           reads: “EMPLOYEES ONLY”. Bingo...

           INT. MALL - STORAGE ROOM - DAY

           The DOOR BLASTS OPEN and Damian and Madeleine storm into the 
           storage room. There are boxes all around them and just one 
           way out: A LOCKED DOOR.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (rattling the knob)
                        Shit.

           INT. MALL - CLOTHING STORE - FITTING ROOM - AT THE SAME TIME

           The Mercenary walks into the fitting room. Empty. No 
           movement, except...

           CLICK. The storage room door just closing. Gotcha.
           INT. MALL - STORAGE ROOM - AT THE SAME TIME

           Meanwhile, Damian has found a SERVICE ELEVATOR and presses 
           insistently its BUTTON to call it... 

                                 DAMIAN
                        Comeoncomeoncomeon...

           ...when he hears a noise: THE DOOR BEING OPENED. Damian and 
           Madeleine freeze. SOMEONE IS CREEPING IN.

           Damian pushes Madeleine against a corner.

           The Mercenary carefully pulls out A GUN WITH SILENCER and 
           stealthily walks towards them. 

           Damian puts a hand over Madeleine’s mouth as the Mercenary 
           closes in... CLICK, CLACK, CLICK, CLACK... the footsteps 
           approaching...

           He’s almost on them now, about to turn the corner, when...

           CLANK! The SERVICE ELEVATOR lands loudly on their floor.

           The sudden noise makes the Mercenary turn...

           ...and Damian takes this opportunity to JUMP ON HIM, grabbing 
           his arm and twisting it... 

                                 MERCENARY
                        Aaaarghhh!

           ...until THE GUN FALLS on the ground.

           The Mercenary immediately pulls his arm, throwing Damian 
           violently against a wall.

           A FRENETIC HAND TO HAND COMBAT ensues. Both men fight with 
           PROFESSIONAL SKILL and LIGHTNING REFLEXES.

           They fall on the ground, the Mercenary on top, HIS HANDS 
           AROUND DAMIAN’S NECK, pressing, chocking.

                                 MADELEINE (O.S.)
                        Stop it!

           The Mercenary looks up to find Madeleine, HOLDING THE GUN IN 
           HER TREMBLING HANDS.

           The Mercenary SMILES, pressing even harder. She can’t 
           shoot...

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        I said stop it!
           And POP! She squeezes the trigger and A BULLET GRAZES THE 
           MAN’S EAR.

                                 MERCENARY
                        Fuck!

           The Man falls back, with his hands on his BLEEDING EAR. 
           Damian TAKES THE GUN from Madeleine and points it at the Man.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Stand up.

           The Man complies, with an eerily COCKY SMILE, letting the 
           blood drip from his ear. 

           Damian takes the RADIO from him, and holds it in front of the 
           mercenary’s face.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Tell them we’re leaving through the 
                        south exit.

                                 MERCENARY
                        Attention, all units. The targets 
                        are headed for the south exit.

           There’s something familiar in his voice. THE RUSSIAN ACCENT! 
           Could he be...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Anton...

           Behind those new eyes, there’s the cold stare of the Russian.

                                 ANTON
                        First time I take it out for a spin 
                        and I already got a scratch.

                                 MADELEINE
                        You know him?

                                 ANTON
                        It’s a nice face, don’t you think? 
                        It has... character. Never quite 
                        liked the other one.

                                 DAMIAN
                        But how? It takes weeks to even...

                                 ANTON
                        First time’s the hardest. But it 
                        gets easier. After a couple of 
                        transfers, you're up on your feet 
                        in no time.
                                 MADELEINE
                        Mark, what is-- what is he talking 
                        about?

           Anton LAUGHS as it dawns on him:

                                 ANTON
                             (to Damian)
                        Of course. You haven’t told her. 

                                 MADELEINE
                        Tell me what?

                                 ANTON
                        Maybe you should ask your husband 
                        when’s your daughter’s birthday. 

                                 DAMIAN
                        Shut up.

                                 ANTON
                        Or where did you two love birds got 
                        marr--

           Damian HITS ANTON IN THE FACE with the butt of the gun.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Shut up!

           As Anton doubles up in pain, Damian buries his hand into 
           Anton’s jacket and produces...

           ...a BOTTLE OF BLUE PILLS.

           Immediately, Damian PUSHES ANTON INSIDE THE SERVICE ELEVATOR 
           and presses the button, sending the elevator downstairs. 

           POP! Damian SHOOTS THE CONTROLS, leaving the elevator stuck 
           between floors.  

           Damian sees Madeleine’s distrustful look, but there’s no time 
           to lose.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE BLADES OF A HELICOPTER FURIOUSLY SPINNING.

           EXT. MALL - DAY

           The CHOPPER HOVERS over the mall, scanning the area. 
           Below it, we see streams of shoppers walking in and out of 
           the mall. Nothing suspicious when seen from above.

           But from the ground, WE RECOGNIZE TWO FIGURES: Damian and 
           Madeleine walk out of the building, disguised with their 
           hats, sunglasses and raincoats.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Don’t look up.

           As they approach the cars parked by the curb, Damian 
           discretely produces the CAR KEYS and presses the UNLOCK 
           BUTTON.

           No response...

           Damian tries again and again, never raising the arm, never 
           stopping, until...

           Finally, a MINIVAN FLASHES ITS LIGHTS. Their new ride... 
           Damian and Madeleine get inside the vehicle and, with the 
           DOOR SLAM, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE MINIVAN FLYING BY on the highway.

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           It’s a mess in there: toys, children’s music CDs, used 
           tissues, cheese puffs in the ashtrays... There’s a baby car 
           seat in the back and the mandatory car DVD player.

           Madeleine scans the sky looking for the helicopter...

                                 DAMIAN
                        See anything?

                                 MADELEINE
                        We lost it.

           Damian nods, relieved, when he notices that the GAS TANK 
           LIGHT IS ON.

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           The minivan pulls into a gas station.
           INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

           Damian unbuckles the seat belt and he’s about to take the CAR 
           KEY when...

           Madeleine YANKS IT FROM THE IGNITION first. They won’t move 
           until they have a talk. It takes an AWKWARD SILENT BEAT for 
           Madeleine to find the courage to ask.

                                 MADELEINE
                        That man... What was he talking 
                        about?

           Damian is too ashamed to respond, but she won’t let it go.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Anna’s birthday... When is it?

           Damian can’t answer that. He looks away, averting her gaze.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Where did we get married?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Maddie...

           Madeleine SNAPS, furious.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Don’t you Maddie me! Don’t you 
                        dare! No more lies. Who are those 
                        people? Who--
                             (She stops. Quieter now)
                        Who are you?

           Damian takes a beat to think. It’s time to tell the truth.

                                 DAMIAN
                        My name is Damian Hayes...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           We witness the conversation from OUTSIDE THE CAR. 

           Although we can’t hear Damian explaining, we see Madeleine 
           going from disbelief...

           ...to outrage...

           And, finally, grief.
           Damian reaches to touch Madeleine, but she immediately 
           RECOILS, repulsed by him, and STORMS OUT OF THE CAR.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Don’t you touch me, you son of a 
                        bitch.

           Damian follows. An ATTENDANT (20s) watches them argue from 
           the inside of the GAS STATION.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        Stay away from me!

                                 DAMIAN
                        You can hate me all you want. God 
                        knows I deserve it. But these 
                        people, they won’t stop. They’ll do 
                        anything to cover it up.

                                 MADELEINE
                        You killed Mark!

           Madeleine SLAPS Damian. Hard.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Maybe... But I’m the only one who 
                        can help you now. I can protect 
                        you.
                             (beat)
                        I can protect Anna.

           Suddenly, DING-DING, the Gas Station Attendant steps outside.

                                 GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                        Is everything OK, Ma’am? Is this 
                        man bothering you?

           Madeleine hesitates. She looks at Damian, unsure. Can he 
           trust the man hiding behind his husband’s face?

           Damian tries to read her eyes. What will she say?

           Finally, after a long beat, she speaks...

                                 MADELEINE
                        I’m... I’m fine, thank you.

           The Gas Station looks at her bloodshot eyes, the tears 
           running down her cheeks. He’s not convinced.

                                 GAS STATION ATTENDANT
                        Are you sure? 
                                 MADELEINE
                             (nodding)
                        I’m sure. The bastard forgot our 
                        anniversary, that’s all.

           Finally, the Attendant nods and walks back inside.

           Madeleine walks past Damian, not even looking at him, and 
           gets inside the car. With the ANGRY DOOR SLAM we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           The MINIVAN WIPING FRAME, revealing a magnificent bridge 
           crossing the DELAWARE RIVER. Welcome to Pennsylvania.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD - DAY

           The minivan drives through a suburban area nearby Pittsburgh. 
           Cookie-cutter houses and manicured lawns fly by, one after 
           the other.

                                 MADELEINE (O.S.)
                        It’s here. Pull over.

           The car comes to a halt in front of a unremarkable house.

           INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

           Madeleine and Damian sit in silence for a long tense beat.

           Madeleine looks at the path that will take her to the door 
           and the daughter that waits beyond. She takes a deep breath 
           and...

                                 MADELEINE
                        Wait here. I’ll speak to her first.

           Damian nods, agreeing, but Madeleine is already stepping out 
           of the car. She was not asking for his approval.

           Damian wraps his hands tightly around the driving wheel as he 
           watches Madeleine disappear into the house. He fidgets on his 
           seat, unsure if he’s up to what will come next.

           Restless, Damian finally exits the car.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBOURHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           A beautiful afternoon outside. A MAN IN SHORTS waters his 
           garden. A BOY practices his skills on the skateboard. 
           A WOMAN sunbathes, reading a paperback novel. Normal people 
           living normal lives. How quaint and removed they look from 
           his own.

           Damian leans on the car and looks at the dreaded house. The 
           house looks back, silently, inscrutable.

           And then, a MOVEMENT behind the window. The CURTAIN opens, 
           revealing the radiant wide-eyed face of a girl. ANNA.

           She looks at him in wonderment. Could that really be her dad?

           Having been caught off guard, it takes a second for Damian to 
           PUT ON HIS BEST SMILE. 

           But when he does, Anna immediately disappears from the window 
           and DARTS OUT OF THE HOUSE.

                                 ANNA
                        Dad!

           Incredibly happy, the little girl jumps on his arms. Damian 
           can’t do anything but catch her and HUG HER, UNCOMFORTABLE. 
           Anna buries her face in his chest.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I missed you so much, Dad.

           Damian looks up to find MADELEINE watching him from the 
           threshold. If looks could kill...

                                 DAMIAN
                        I missed you too, button.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE MINIVAN’S DOOR SLIDING OPEN, revealing...

           INT. MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

           ...Anna looking inside the car, puzzled.

                                 ANNA
                        Whose car is this?

                                 MADELEINE
                        Ours. Dad got us a new one. See? 
                        Much bigger. Don’t you like it?

           Madeleine helps Anna climb into the car, but Anna is still 
           not convinced. Seeing the BABY SEAT...
                                 ANNA
                        But I’m too old for a baby’s chair!

           Madeleine shoots a look to Damian, who is putting Anna’s 
           luggage in the trunk, and sits her by the baby seat.

                                 MADELEINE
                        I know, button. Dad’s been a little 
                        silly lately.

           Madeleine fastens Anna’s seat belt, closes the sliding door 
           and takes the passenger’s seat. Damian takes the driver seats 
           and STARTS THE CAR.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                             (anger bubbling)
                        So, where to now?

           Damian drives off as he talks.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Well, they know where you-- 
                             (noticing Anna)
                        Where we live. So that’s out of the 
                        question.

           Madeleine picks up a pair of HEADPHONES lying between the 
           seats and turns to Anna.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Why don’t we watch a movie, huh, 
                        honey?

                                 ANNA
                        But I wanna know what you’re 
                        talking about!

                                 MADELEINE
                        It’s grown up talk, Anna. Time for 
                        a movie.

           Anna rolls her eyes, annoyed, but Madeleine puts the 
           headphones on her anyway and PRESSES PLAY.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                             (curbing his anger)
                        What’s the plan then?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Well... I have this friend in 
                        Upstate New York. His name’s 
                        Martin. Very rich man. He owns a 
                        private jet and could sneak us out 
                        of the country.
                                 MADELEINE
                        Out of the country?! Are you 
                        insane?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Here, sooner or later, we’ll slip, 
                        we’ll make a mistake, and they’ll 
                        find us. They won’t stop, 
                        Madeleine.

           Madeleine knows he’s right. As the reality of their situation 
           sinks in, Madeleine’s eyes fill with TEARS.

                                 MADELEINE
                        For how long?

           Beat.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t know.

           Suddenly, ANNA NOTICES HER MOM’S TEARS and takes off the 
           headphones.

                                 ANNA
                        Why are you crying, Mom?

           Madeleine turns to her daughter and puts on her best smile, 
           as she wipes her tears.

                                 MADELEINE
                        It’s nothing, button. Just happy to 
                        see your father, that’s all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The CAR ZOOMS BY the empty highway as the SUN SETS behind it.

           EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           The NEON SIGN of the motel buzzes and flickers in the dark.

           Damian, standing on the BALCONY, outside their room, scans 
           the road and the empty parking lot, looking for anything 
           suspicious.

           Damian turns and sees, inside, Madeleine help Anna into the 
           bed and tuck her in.

                                 MADELEINE
                        So, what’s it going to be tonight? 
                        “Cat in the hat” or “Green eggs and 
                        ham”?
                                 ANNA
                        “Cat in the hat”! But I want dad to 
                        read it to me.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Not tonight, button. Dad is very 
                        tired from all the driving.

           Damian, uncomfortable, turns to the darkness and leans on the 
           rail, as Madeleine STARTS READING.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        The sun did not shine. It was too 
                        wet to play. So we sat in the house 
                        all that cold, cold, wet day...

           Nothing moves. Are they really safe? If so, for how long?

           Damian produces ANTON’S PILLS and SWALLOWS ONE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           RIIIIIIIIIIING! A doorbell.

           EXT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - DAY

           Damian and Madeleine wait in front of an IRON GATE. Beyond 
           it, past the lawn, the pool and the rose garden, a beautiful 
           and luxurious COUNTRY HOME stands.

           Anna waits in the minivan, behind them.

                                 MADELEINE
                        He’ll think you’re a nutjob.

                                 DAMIAN
                        We’ll see.

           Finally, the intercom crackles.

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Mr. Leary? 

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Yes?
                                 DAMIAN
                        I have a message for you, from a 
                        common friend. Damian Hayes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A GLASS filling up with SCOTCH.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - OFFICE - DAY

           Martin pours his drink and deliberately adds a couple of ice 
           cubes. By him, JUDY (50) sits, elegant and beautiful. The 
           years have been kind to her but SHE LOOKS WORRIED.

           At the other end of the room, Damian and Madeleine wait 
           expectantly. She takes a quick look through the half open 
           door. Beyond it, Anna waits, sitting in front of a glass of 
           milk and a plate of cookies.

           Finally, Martin takes a sip and turns to them.

                                 MARTIN
                        I saw him die, you know? With my 
                        own eyes.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You saw what they wanted you to 
                        see. Trust me, I know how insane 
                        all this sounds. And I wouldn’t 
                        have come to you if we had any 
                        other option, but...

                                 MARTIN
                             (growingly angry)
                        But you expect me give up my plane 
                        to some strangers with a wild 
                        story.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’m not a stranger. It’s me, 
                        Damian.

                                 MARTIN
                        Stop it! Damian’s dead.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Let’s go. This is pointless.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’ve known you for 25 years. Fresh 
                        out of law school.
                                 MARTIN
                        I said stop it!

           Judy suddenly stands up and REACHES FOR THE PHONE.

                                 JUDY
                        I’m calling the police.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Wait! Wait. 

           Judy stops, the receiver already in her hand.

           Damian struggles to find something to say. One chance. Don’t 
           screw it up.

           Finally, he speaks...

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        One night, nine years ago, Martin 
                        showed up at my door, stinking 
                        drunk. “It’s over”, he said. All 
                        those years trying to get pregnant, 
                        they’d taken its toll and... that 
                        was it. Time to file for a divorce.
                             (beat)
                        I did the only sensible thing a 
                        friend could do. I got drunk with 
                        him. 

           Judy slowly hangs up the phone.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        A couple of bottles of Scotch 
                        later, we were watching the sun 
                        rise. And the phone rang. It was 
                        you. You just found out you were 
                        pregnant. Impossible but true. 
                        Martin cried. He said it was a 
                        miracle.

           Judy finally breaks down and her eyes fill with tears.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        I never forgot that night.

           Martin rushes to his wife and HUGS HER. She lets go and sobs.

                                 JUDY
                        My baby... my baby...

           Martin looks Damian straight in the eye.
                                 MARTIN
                        You’ll fly out tonight.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Thank you.

                                 MARTIN
                        Give us a moment now, please.

           Damian nods, grateful.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Damian closes the office’s door behind him when Madeleine 
           notices the EMPTY CHAIR. The leftovers of the milk and 
           cookies lie on the table, but...

                                 MADELEINE
                        Anna?

           ...ANNA IS GONE.

           Damian looks out the window and smiles. There she is, 
           standing by the outdoors SWIMMING POOL.

           EXT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Damian slowly approaches Anna from behind. She stands by the 
           pool’s edge, watching its shimmering surface longingly.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What’s wrong, button? You forgot 
                        your swimsuit?

                                 ANNA
                             (without turning)
                        It’s not that.

                                 DAMIAN
                             (understanding)
                        I never got around to teach you, 
                        did I?

           Anna, very serious, shakes her head no.

                                 ANNA
                        You left before I got better.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Right...

           Damian doubts for a beat. Should he say it?
                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, you’re better now, aren’t 
                        you?

           Anna suddenly turns to Damian, EYES WIDE OPEN in excitement.

                                 ANNA
                        I am!

           Damian smiles at her reaction.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What are you waiting for, then? Get 
                        your swimsuit!

           Anna immediately runs inside, almost tripping on the 
           doorstep.

                                 ANNA
                        MOM!

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE SUN LIGHT FILTERING THROUGH THE WATER SURFACE. We are 
           underwater.

           Suddenly, SOMETHING BREAKS THE SURFACE and sinks. It’s ANNA, 
           wearing a pink swimsuit and goggles, her cheeks full of air, 
           her nose pinched.

           A PAIR OF HANDS lifts her to the surface. Damian.

           This is the beginning of a MONTAGE: 

           We see Anna squeal, splash and laugh as DAMIAN TEACHES THE 
           GIRL TO SWIM. He holds her over the surface while the girl 
           practices her strokes and her breathing.

           Sitting on a lawn chair, Madeleine watches them, uneasy at 
           first, but growingly ambivalent, until she can’t help but 
           LAUGH AND CLAP when...

           Damian lets go of Anna and SHE FINALLY TAKES HER FIRST 
           STROKES ON HER OWN. Anna swims across the pool while DAMIAN 
           AND MADELEINE CHEER.

           For a moment, Damian’s the father he never was to his own 
           daughter. For a moment, he’s Mark and the family is whole 
           again.

           From the second floor of the house, JUDY SULLENLY WATCHES THE 
           HAPPY SCENE. Martin walks to her and puts a comforting hand 
           on her shoulder.
           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           Leaving a trail of wet footsteps, Anna runs upstairs, wrapped 
           in a towel, taking two steps at a time. Madeleine appears at 
           the bottom of the stairs.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Hey, slow down, little lady! Do you 
                        want me to help you?

           Reaching the second floor, Anna turns...

                                 ANNA
                        I’m not a baby!

           ...and immediately takes off again, disappearing into a room.

                                 MADELEINE
                        I know, I know...

           Damian appears from behind, buttoning his shirt, his hair 
           still wet. He looks out the window to find THE SUN SETTING 
           behind the treeline.

                                 DAMIAN
                        It’s getting dark. All this... it 
                        will be over soon.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Are you sure?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I promise.

                                 MADELEINE
                        But where are we gonna go?

                                 DAMIAN
                             (trying to make the best 
                              out of it)
                        Wherever you want. Any place you 
                        ever dreamed living in.

           Damian puts his hand in his pocket and produces the BLACK 
           POUCH, the one he kept in the buried tin box.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Here. This should take care of 
                        everything you may need.

           Madeleine looks inside the pouch. It’s full of SPARKLING 
           DIAMONDS. There’s a fortune in there.
                                 MADELEINE
                        Wait, you’re not coming with us?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I can’t. I... I have a daughter. 
                        She’s in New York. It’s not safe 
                        for her there. I have to go back.

           Madeleine nods, understanding. She would do anything for her 
           daughter too.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. Martin will take care 
                        of you.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Anna, now dressed, finishes to tie her shoes when...

           A NOISE catches her attention: a BUZZING SOUND coming from 
           outside the room.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Anna steps out of the room, filled with curiosity.

                                 ANNA
                        Hello?

           The buzzing is now LOUDER, CLEARER. It comes from behind a 
           door, at the other end of the dark hallway. 

           Anna slowly walks towards the door, and the light that comes 
           from under it.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Finally, Anna reaches the other end of the hallway, wraps her 
           hand around the doorknob and pushes. The door opens with a 
           CREAKING SOUND, and...

           ...what it reveals, we don’t see yet.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I’m Anna. What’s your name?

                                                                CUT TO:

           DAMIAN’s HANDS SPLASHING WATER ON HIS FACE.
           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Damian dries his face with a towel when he notice something 
           strange: Over the sink, THERE’S NO MIRROR. It’s been removed.

           This gives him pause. Why would anyone remove the mirror from 
           the bathroom?

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Damian storms out of the bathroom and rushes through the 
           hallway.

           The first thing he notices is a big DARK SPOT on the 
           wallpaper, like something was missing: ANOTHER MIRROR most 
           likely.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Madeleine?

           Then he notices something else: On the wall, by the stairs, a 
           constellation of TINY PICTURE FRAME HOOKS. The family

           What the hell is going on?

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Madeleine!

           Madeleine comes out of the living room and stops dead when 
           she sees Damian’s concerned look.

                                 MADELEINE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Where’s Anna?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           THE GUEST BEDROOM DOORS BLASTING OPEN.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                 MADELEINE
                        Anna!

           But the bedroom is empty. Only the wet towel remains, lying 
           on the floor.

                                 MADELEINE (CONT’D)
                        ANNA!
           Suddenly, Damian makes a gesture for SILENCE. A distant BUZZ 
           catches their attention.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Damian and Madeleine exit the room. Again, the mysterious 
           buzzing sound seems to come from the other end of the 
           hallway.

           The two of them carefully approach the door and open it, 
           revealing a...

           PLAYROOM

           Anna sits on the carpeted floor of a colorful room crowded 
           with toys, board games and stuffed animals. Any kid’s dream 
           come true.

           Sitting by her side, his back towards them, there’s a 
           MYSTERIOUS BOY (9). Anna and the boy are concentrated racing 
           REMOTE CONTROL CARS, the source of the buzzing.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Anna? Who is this?

           Anna turns for a split second...

                                 ANNA
                        His name’s Tony. He lives here.

           ...but immediately goes back to the game.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Anna, honey, say goodbye to your 
                        friend. It’s time to go.

                                 MADELEINE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 DAMIAN
                        He’s Martin and Judy’s son.
                             (to Anna)
                        You heard me. Time to go.

                                 MADELEINE
                        So?

                                 DAMIAN
                        He died a year ago.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The door slowly opens revealing Damian. HE PULLS OUT HIS GUN 
           as he steps out of the room.  Madeleine follows, CARRYING 
           ANNA in her arms.

           As they carefully walk towards the stairs, Anna turns to see 
           TONY STANDING BY THE PLAYROOM DOOR.

                                 ANNA
                             (waving her hand)
                        Bye!

           Tony WAVES BACK. He looks sad to be left alone once again.

           Damian is taking the stairs when...

           JUDY appears running at the bottom of the stairs.

                                 JUDY
                        Tony!

           Damian immediately raises the gun.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Step back. Step back!

           Judy complies, taking a couple of steps back.

           Damian descends with his gun on Judy, closely followed by a 
           terrified Madeleine.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As soon as they walk past Judy, the mother runs upstairs to 
           her son.

           Damian and Madeleine are rushing towards the exit, when...

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Put that thing down, will you?

           Damian immediately turns, POINTING HIS GUN AT MARTIN, who 
           stands in a corner of the room.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        No need for it.

           But Damian keeps the gun on him.

                                 MADELEINE
                        What the hell did you do to your 
                        son?
                                 MARTIN
                        I saved his life, like any other 
                        father would’ve done.

                                 MADELEINE
                             (horrified)
                        By turning him into a freak? 
                        Shutting him away from the world? 
                        Burning every photograph, breaking 
                        every mirror?

                                 MARTIN
                             (snapping)
                        He was our miracle, goddamit!

           Martin takes a deep breath, regains control of himself.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Kids, they-- they endure. They 
                        forget. One day, he won’t even 
                        remember what he looked like. He’ll 
                        just know he used to be a sick kid, 
                        that’s all.

                                 DAMIAN
                        There’s no plane waiting for us, is 
                        there?

                                 MARTIN
                             (sincere)
                        I’m afraid not, Damian. Sorry.

           Damian moves the curtain to take a peak outside. NOT A 
           MOVEMENT in the garden. The pool eerily glows in the shadows.

                                 DAMIAN
                        How much time do we have?

                                 MARTIN
                        You have to understand, I owe them 
                        everything. I---

           Damian PRESSES THE BARREL OF HIS GUN against Martin’s face.

                                 DAMIAN
                        HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?!!!

           Martin swallows hard, feeling the cold steel against his 
           cheek.

                                 MARTIN
                        None. None at all. They’re already 
                        outside, waiting. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTIN (CONT'D)
                        As soon as we leave for the 
                        airport, they’ll fall on us.

           Damian pulls his gun away.

                                 DAMIAN
                        You son of a bitch.

                                 MADELEINE
                        What are we gonna do?

           Damian thinks for a beat.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’m going out. 

                                 MADELEINE
                        Out?

           Damian nods.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’ll take one of his cars. Blast 
                        through those doors. When they come 
                        after me, I want you to take Anna 
                        and run. 

                                 MADELEINE
                        Run? Run where?

                                 DAMIAN
                        Sneak out through the woods in the 
                        back. Get to the road. Use the 
                        diamonds and buy your way out the 
                        country.

                                 MADELEINE
                        I-- I can’t.

           Damian grabs her hands and looks her in the eye.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Yes, you can. Of course, you can.

                                 MARTIN
                        I’ll take them. I’ll get them 
                        there.

           Damian looks at his friend, the traitor, and considers him. 
           Can he really trust him? 

           Finally, Martin’s contrite expression convinces him and 
           Damian NODS, accepting the offer.
                                 MADELEINE
                        What about you?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’ll... I’ll find you. Wherever you 
                        are.

           Madeleine realizes that he’s lying. His chances of escaping 
           are slim to none. Damian’s sacrificing himself for them. And 
           for a moment, despite how she feels about this man, SHE'S 
           ACTUALLY MOVED.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Thank you.

           Damian SMILES for a second, but then turns to Martin, waving 
           his gun.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Come on. Let’s go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A ROW OF LUXURY AND VINTAGE CARS OF ALL KINDS.

           INT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT

           Damian examines the cars, followed by the Martin.

                                 MARTIN
                        I had no choice, Damian. I--

                                 DAMIAN
                        I don’t want to hear it.

                                 MARTIN
                        They own me. Hell, they own us all 
                        with those fucking pills.

           Damian stops. He looks at Martin as something dawns on him...

                                 DAMIAN
                        “They can help you...” It was you, 
                        wasn’t it?

           Beat. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I should’ve never send you that 
                        card. I’m sorry.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I should’ve never said yes. 
                                 MARTIN
                        So much for the wisdom of old age.

           They both chuckle. A reconciliation between old friends. But 
           there’s no time to lose. 

           Damian notices a car at the end of the row: AN SUV WITH 
           TINTED WINDOWS.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What about that one?

                                 MARTIN
                        We tinted the windows for Tony, to 
                        keep the neighbors from talking.

                                 DAMIAN
                        I’ll take it.

           EXT. MARTIN’S COUNTRY HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           The GARAGE DOOR OPEN, revealing the BLINDING HEADLIGHTS of 
           the SUV, its engine roaring.

           INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly, Damian STEPS ON THE GAS, hard, and the car PEELS 
           OFF.

           The car gains speed as Damian recklessly drive it on the 
           windy gravel path. He makes a sharp turn, the WHEELS SKIDDING 
           OVER THE GRAVEL.

           Suddenly, there it is: THE GATE RAPIDLY APPROACHING. Damian 
           braces for the impact and...

           BLAAAM! The whole car shakes as IT BLASTS THROUGH THE DOORS.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           TREES WIPING FRAME AT GREAT SPEED.

           EXT. FOREST - AT THE SAME TIME

           Madeleine and Anna run through the woods, following Martin, 
           their breaths quickened.  

           The country house is now a receding island of light in the 
           middle of the dark forest.
           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AT THE SAME TIME

           The SUV roars through the road when...

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! HEADLIGHTS TURN ON one after the other, 
           piercing the darkness.

           TWO BLACK CARS, hidden by the side of the road, peel off and 
           GIVE CHASE TO DAMIAN’S CAR. Albright’s men. 

           EXT. FOREST - AT THE SAME TIME

           Suddenly, FLASHLIGHTS in the forest, cutting through the 
           darkness.

           Martin and Madeleine FREEZE. Martin immediately crouches, 
           while Madeleine scoops Anna from the ground, pressing her 
           body against a tree trunk, as she holds her daughter tight.

           Hidden, Martin and Madeleine hold their breaths as they see 
           the BEAMS OF LIGHT SCANNING THE WOODS.

           Albright’s men are closing in.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AT THE SAME TIME

           The two black cars are rapidly catching up to Damian.

           One of them STARTS HITTING DAMIAN’S SUV, trying to push it 
           off road.

           EXT. FOREST - AT THE SAME TIME

           Madeleine can hear the FOOTSTEPS growing louder.

           The mercenaries, dark silhouettes in the night, are slowly 
           closing in on her and her daughter.

           Martin closes his eyes. Madeleine covers Anna’s mouth to 
           prevent her from screaming. But it’s useless. They’re on 
           them. There’s NO WAY OUT.

           But, suddenly, one of the men’s WALKIES BUZZES.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Attention. Targets located. They’ve 
                        been spotted driving away in a 
                        black SUV. All units head to I-87 
                        immediately.
           With this message, the mercenaries immediately TURN AROUND 
           and vanish into the darkness.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AT THE SAME TIME

           The first black car keeps hitting the rear of the SUV while 
           the second one places himself to Damian’s right and...

           ...PUSHES THE SUV towards the STEEP SLOPE by the side of the 
           road.

           For a second, Damian’s car skids and one of its REAR WHEELS 
           SPINS OVER THE VOID!!!

           But Damian regains control and takes a RIGHT, crashing the 
           SUV against the car and getting back on the paved road.

           When the first car gets ready to ram him again from behind... 

           ...Damian STEPS ON THE BRAKES!!! And the two vehicles 
           VIOLENTLY COLLIDE. A raw and brutal impact.

           The stunned DRIVER looks up and sees Damian STEP ON THE GAS 
           and DRAG THE BLACK CAR WITH HIM. Because of the collision, 
           his FRONT BUMPER is now STUCK to the SUV’s REAR BUMPER. 

           The Driver produces his GUN and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! SHOOTS AT 
           DAMIAN through the windshield.

           Damian DUCKS as bullets and pieces of glass fly over his 
           head.

           And then, he starts SWERVING the SUV wildly, making, in turn, 
           the attached car swerve too, MESSING WITH THE DRIVERS AIM, 
           who now shoots randomly left and right.

           But the second car is back, hitting from the right flank.

           Suddenly, DAMIAN MAKES A SHARP RIGHT and the SUV SKIDS!!!

           The car turns 180 degrees, making the black car turn with it. 
           But it doesn’t stop there! It just keeps skidding until...

           The SECOND DRIVER sees the FIRST CAR LUNGING TOWARDS HIM 
           SIDEWAYS.

                                 SECOND DRIVER
                        AAAAAAHHH!!!

           And, BOOOOM!!! BOTH BLACK CARS GO OUT IN A FIREBALL...

           ...as the SUV is released and DAMIAN DRIVES AWAY FROM THE 
           EXPLOSION.
           He looks at the EMPTY ROAD through the rearview mirror. No 
           more pursuers. He’s home free.

           Damian smiles, satisfied, as he drives into the night.

           Suddenly, he seems to SEE SOMETHING coming over a hill and 
           straight to him. It’s hard to tell in the dark but it seems 
           to be MOVING FAST.

           Could it be a CAR WITH THE HEADLIGHTS OFF?

           Indeed. It’s a BLACK CAR, rushing straight towards him!!!

           Damian turns the wheel, hard, trying to avoid it, but...

           Too late!!! THE BLACK CAR IS CHARGING SUICIDALLY AGAINST THE 
           SUV and...

           CRAAAAASH!!! THE TWO VEHICLES COLLIDE HEAD-ON!!!

           There’s a moment of silence as THE CLOUD OF DUST settles 
           around the two completely wrecked vehicles. 

           Suddenly, the SUV’s door opens and Damian CRAWLS out of it, 
           bleeding and in pain.

           From the black car, we see the driver stepping out: ANTON, 
           also bruised and covered in blood.

           Anton limps towards Damian and KICKS HIM in the stomach while 
           he’s down. Damian rolls on the ground. 

           Anton KICKS AGAIN, but...

           Damian grabs Anton’s leg and SINKS HIS FINGERS into an open 
           wound. Anton FALLS on the ground, howling in pain. The two 
           men roll on the dusty ground. 

           It’s a SLOW AND BRUTISH FIGHT, where the two exhausted men, 
           not ready to give up, throw clumsy punches at each other.  

           Anton SMASHES DAMIAN’S FACE against the ground, the dust 
           mixing with his blood. Keeping him down, he produces his GUN 
           and PRESSES IT AGAINST DAMIAN’S HEAD, ready to execute him.

           With a sudden move, Damian ELBOWS ANTON’S ARM. The GUN FIRES 
           but the bullet hits the ground.

           Both men struggle for control of the gun. Damian twists 
           Anton’s arm towards him and BANG! A bullet PIERCES ANTON’S 
           SHOULDER.

           Anton falls back, still gripping the gun.
           Suddenly, BIG CLOUDS OF DUST APPROACH. FAST. More company 
           cars.

           Damian crawls, as fast as he can, towards Anton, who lies on 
           the ground semiconscious, and tries to reach the gun in time.

           But, just as he grabs the weapon, he finds himself SURROUNDED 
           BY CARS AND MERCENARIES aiming their guns at him.

                                 MERCENARIES
                        Freeze! Don’t move! DON’T MOVE!!!

           Damian freezes. Still on his knees, HE RAISES HIS HANDS and 
           lets the gun slip through his fingers. A MERCENARY twists 
           Damian’s arms behind his back and puts a pair of PLASTIC 
           HANDCUFFS around his wrists.

           ALBRIGHT steps out of one of the vehicles and walk towards 
           the WRECKED SUV.

           He opens the door but FINDS IT EMPTY.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                             (to Damian, furious)
                        Where are they?! WHERE ARE THEY?!

           Damian responds with a SHIT EATING GRIN.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fool yourself. We’ll find 
                        them.

           Albright makes a GESTURE to his men and...

           Suddenly, A BLACK HOOD FALLS ON DAMIAN’S HEAD.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - DAWN

           Finally, the darkness starts to dissolve. A new day is 
           coming.

           Madeleine spots a ROAD beyond the trees. They made it! As she 
           rushes towards it, she takes one last look over her shoulder:

           Martin stands there, watching them run to safety.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Madeleine emerges from the treeline, carrying Anna. With her 
           free arm, she WAVES at the cars that zoom by...
                                 MADELEINE
                        Hey! HEEEEEY!!!

           ...until A SEMI-TRAILER TRUCK comes to a halt a few feet past 
           them.

           Madeleine runs to it as the PASSENGER’S DOOR POPS OPEN.

           INT. SEMI-TRAILER TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Madeleine helps Anna climb into the truck and gets inside.

                                 MADELEINE
                        Thank you.

           As the vehicle starts moving, Madeleine looks out the window 
           to see THE SUN RISING ABOVE THE TREELINE.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Where you going, Ma’am?

           But Madeleine doesn’t answer. She can only watch the sunrise 
           and wonder what the future holds for her and her daughter.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am? Where are you going?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           THE BLACK HOOD IS PULLED OFF DAMIAN’S HEAD, and he finds 
           himself in an...

           ASEPTIC ROOM

           Damian sits on a chair in the middle of a white room, 
           sparsely furnished. A CURTAIN covers the only window in the 
           room.

           It’s not hard to guess that he’s been brought back to the 
           HEADQUARTERS of the company.

           Albright stares at him from the other end of the room.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Do you know what disappoints me the 
                        most? How ungrateful you’ve turned 
                        out to be. People would kill for an 
                        opportunity like this.

           Behind Damian, one of the mercenaries who pulled off the bag 
           CUTS THE PLASTIC HANDCUFFS.
                                 DAMIAN
                        I apparently did.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Mr. Russell volunteered. But you 
                        almost killed my best man. 

           Albright pulls the curtain, revealing an adjacent room. 
           Beyond the glass, ANTON LIES ON A HOSPITAL BED, intubated.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        He’s in a deep comma. But still 
                        somewhere in there. Anton’s a 
                        strong man. He doesn’t give up 
                        easily.

           A TEAM OF NURSES prepares Anton to be wheeled out of the 
           room. At the same time, the men behind Damian take off his 
           watch and his belt. Damian grows uneasy.

                                 DAMIAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Repossess the merchandise, give it 
                        to who’ll certainly appreciate my 
                        gift.

           It dawns on Damian: They’re going to use Damian’s body to 
           save Anton’s life.

                                 DAMIAN
                        No, wait, you can’t. This body is 
                        MY property!

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        We had a contract, Mr. Hayes. But 
                        you broke it.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Wait! WAIT! Let’s write a new one, 
                        then! 

           Suddenly, Damian slips through the men’s fingers and JUMPS ON 
           ALBRIGHT! In the face of Death, Damian is a desperate man.

                                 DAMIAN (CONT’D)
                        Let me buy it again. I have 
                        contacts. I can get you so much 
                        more money.

           The two mercenaries immediately PULL HIM AWAY from his boss. 
           Albright SMILES, satisfied, as he fixes his tie and jacket.
                                 ALBRIGHT
                        See? Wouldn’t you kill right now 
                        just to live a little bit longer? 
                        No one’s ever ready to die, Mr. 
                        Hayes.
                             (to his men)
                        Get him ready.

           As his men start undressing Damian, Albright leaves the room. 
           He SLAMS the door behind and we...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           A SWINGING DOOR BLASTING OPEN.

           INT. HALLWAY

           A GURNEY is rushed down a long hallway by TWO NURSES. Damian 
           twists and turns on it, fighting the STRAPS holding his arms 
           and legs, as well the MOUTHPIECE that MUFFLES HIS SCREAMS. 

           The gurney blasts through another SWINGING DOOR, entering...

           INT. CIRCULAR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Like before, Damian is wheeled across the room to the MACHINE 
           under Albright’s supervision, watching from the control room. 

           Damian is lifted from the gurney and strapped again on one of 
           the “MRI” beds. 

           But this time it’s the OPPOSITE BED. Anton lies on the bed he 
           occupied the first time, and Damian... he’s on the receiving 
           end. This time, he’s the vessel.

           THE MACHINE IS TURNED ON. As it starts humming, slowly 
           building, growing louder, and its movable parts start 
           spinning, DAMIAN’S BED SLIDES INTO THE MACHINE.

           Inside, the machine is IMPOSSIBLY LOUD, roaring and 
           hammering. Damian’s BREATH QUICKENS, terrified, when...

           Suddenly, HIS WHOLE BODY CONTORTS AND HIS BACK ARCHES, like 
           he was struck by lightning and a 1000 VOLTS RAN THROUGH HIM.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Beyond the glass, Albright impassively watches Damian 
           convulse.
           THE MACHINE SPINS FASTER AND FASTER as its noise becomes 
           DEAFENING.

                                 MALE TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
                        Sir?! Sir! I think something’s 
                        wrong!

           Albright turns to a terrified MALE TECHNICIAN and notices 
           what he’s looking at with widened eyes:

           The Technician’s TIE IS FLOATING, as if it was being pulled. 
           But it’s actually the TIE PIN that it’s being ATTRACTED BY AN 
           INVISIBLE FORCE.

           Suddenly, the pin is yanked from the tie and flies across the 
           room, GETTING STUCK TO THE GLASS PARTITION.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        What the hell...

           Albright reaches for the pin with his fingers and...

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           ...GETS SHOCKED when he touches it. The pin is electrically 
           charged.

           Soon, all the computer screens light up with ERROR MESSAGES. 
           The Female Technician behind the keyboards turns to Albright.

                                 FEMALE TECHNICIAN
                        Sir! We should stop the process!

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Too late for that! We have to let 
                        the cycle finish!

           ALL THE EQUIPMENT around them, screens and huge CPU towers, 
           start to GROAN AND TREMBLE, magnetically attracted to the 
           machine.

           One by one, all the small metallic objects in the room (pens, 
           coins, wire-rimmed glasses...) dart across the room, SMASHING 
           AGAINST THE GLASS like flies against a windshield.

           Albright and the technicians DROP TO THE FLOOR as ALL THE 
           ALARMS GO OFF and THE GLASS STARTS TO CRACK.
           INT. CIRCULAR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the machine, DAMIAN SHAKES UNCONTROLLABLY, his teeth 
           sinking hard into the mouth guard, his face almost a blur. It 
           seems as if his body is about to split in two, when...

           ...suddenly, EVERYTHING STOPS. The machine has finished the 
           cycle and it’s turning itself off.

           The only noise in the room now is a PROLONGED BEEP indicating 
           that ANTON’S BODY HAS FLATLINED.

           Albright and the two technicians rush into the room and slide 
           Damian’s bed out of the machine. The Female Technician takes 
           the mouth guard off as Albright opens one of his eyelids and 
           checks his pupils with a small flashlight.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        Can you hear me? Shake your head if 
                        you hear me.

           Slowly, Damian moves his head. He can hear.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Good. Can you speak? What’s your 
                        name?

           Damian mumbles something unintelligible.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Can you tell me your name?

           Finally, louder this time...

                                 DAMIAN (?)
                             (a slight Russian accent)
                        Anton Rublev.

           The process worked. Damian is gone, and Anton has taken over 
           the body. But just to be sure...

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        And what are you daughters names?

           Anton replies something in Russian.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        In English, please.

                                 ANTON
                        I have no daughters.

           Albright smiles, satisfied.
           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

           Anton lies in bed in the windowless room. Unable to sleep, 
           his eyes are fixed on the milky overhead light.

           Suddenly, there’s a KNOCK, and the door opens. Albright.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        How are you feeling?

                                 ANTON
                        Like a new man.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        I just wanted to let you know that 
                        they just brought in the woman. 
                        I’ll tell one of your men to take 
                        care of her.

                                 ANTON
                        No. I’ll do it. I’m ready.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Anton, now fully dressed, follows TWO OF HIS MEN down the 
           hallway. 

           They walk past several doors (recovery rooms, storage rooms, 
           offices...) until, finally, they stop at an unmarked door.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the cell, Anton finds a WOMAN tied to a chair, with A 
           BAG OVER HER HEAD. Could it be Madeleine?

           One of the men pulls the bag, revealing...

           ...CLAIRE, gagged and terrified.

           She looks confused when she recognizes what used to be 
           Damian’s face. But she immediately reacts, GRUNTING FOR HELP.

                                 CLAIRE
                        --ease, -e- -e -o!!!

           Damian/Anton’s face betrays no emotion. He extends his arm, 
           and one of the mercenaries immediately puts A GUN WITH A 
           SILENCER in his hand.

           It dawns on Claire. He’s not here to help her.
           Claire CLOSES HER EYES, weeping, as Anton aims at Claire’s 
           head, cocks his gun and... 

           POP-POP. Two shots...

           ...but NOTHING HAPPENS. Claire opens her eyes, surprised to 
           still be alive.

           And then, THE TWO MERCENARIES CRUMPLE TO THE FLOOR. Anton has 
           shot them!

           Anton rushes to untie Claire.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 ANTON
                        I’m going to get you out of here, 
                        ok? But I need you to do everything 
                        I say. And no questions. 

           We realize that Anton’s RUSSIAN ACCENT IS GONE. It’s not 
           Anton after all inside the body, but Damian. 

           How’s that even possible? How did he survive the procedure?

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Damian moves swiftly but silently through the hallway, 
           closely followed by Claire. He’s retracing his steps, until 
           he reaches...

           ...THE STORAGE ROOM he walked past before. They sneak in.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is full of MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. Damian immediately 
           springs into action.

           One by one, he opens all the OXYGEN TANKS lined by the wall. 
           Their content slowly hisses into the room. 

           Then, he grabs a couple of JUGS sitting on a shelf and POURS 
           THEIR CHEMICAL CONTENT all over the room.

           Finally, he STRIKES A MATCH and drops it on the floor. As the 
           FLAMES SPREAD, Damian and Claire exit the room.
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Damian and Claire walk away from the storage room as a WHIFF 
           OF BLACK SMOKE starts to flow from under the door.

           A MAN dressed in scrubs walk past by them, when he stops. HE 
           LOOKS AT CLAIRE, suspicious. She shouldn’t be there.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Excuse me.

           Suddenly, BOOOOOOOM!!! A huge BALL OF FIRE makes the storage 
           room door fly off its hinges. 

           RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING! The FIRE ALARM starts blaring as the 
           SPRINKLERS RAIN on Damian and Claire. 

           The two of them walk away, without looking back, as CHAOS AND 
           PANIC SPREADS IN THE HEADQUARTERS.

           The workers run and scramble trying to contain the fire 
           without noticing the two figures sneaking towards the exit.

           Damian and Claire rush along the hallway, towards the EXIT 
           DOOR he took earlier. Damian opens it.

           INT. LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           The two step on the loading dock where he once was dropped. 
           Beyond the metal shutter at the other end of the room, 
           there’s the OUTSIDE WORLD. 

           Home free... Almost. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Anton?

           Damian turns to find ALBRIGHT behind them, standing at the 
           door. He looks puzzled, but... 

           ...when he sees CLAIRE, Albright seems to understand. Damian 
           immediately POINTS THE GUN AT HIM.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        How did you...?

           Damian smiles as he produces something small from his 
           pocket... It's Albright's TIE PIN.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ASEPTIC ROOM (FLASHBACK)

           Once again, we see Damian slip through the men’s fingers and 
           jump on Albright.

                                 DAMIAN
                        Let me buy it again. I have 
                        contacts. I can get you so much 
                        more money.

           Albright’s men immediately PULL HIM AWAY from his boss. But 
           this time we notice that DAMIAN HAS GRABBED ALBRIGHT’S TIE 
           PIN and hides it in HIS MOUTH.

           INT. CIRCULAR CHAMBER - LATER (FLASHBACK)

           Damian violently shakes inside the machine, as it GROANS AND 
           SPINS out of control. All the ALARMS GO OFF.

           The CAMERA rapidly approaches Damian’s face until, in one of 
           the ELECTRICAL FLASHES, like an X RAY, we see the TIE PIN 
           HIDDEN UNDER HIS TONGUE, causing the machine to malfunction. 

           Damian has effectively nullified the procedure.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The TIE PIN HITTING THE GROUND, taking us back to the...

           LOADING DOCK

           Albright doesn’t look intimidated. He keeps his confident 
           facade.

                                 ALBRIGHT
                        You know you won’t. You can’t.

           Slowly, Albright starts walking towards Damian and Claire.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        How long will you last out there 
                        without us, Mr. Hayes? 

           The name doesn’t go unnoticed to Claire.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        How long until the pills run out? A 
                        week? Two? And then what?

           Damian doesn’t answer. He keeps pointing the gun at him, his 
           face betraying no emotion.
                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you what. Then...

           Albright blows his fist, as he opens it. WHOOSH. GONE WITH 
           THE WIND.

                                 ALBRIGHT (CONT’D)
                             (smiling)
                        Put the gun down. You’re a business 
                        man. I’m sure we can strike a dea--

           POP! DAMIAN PULLS THE TRIGGER and Albright hits the ground, 
           with A BULLET IN HIS HEAD. He won't be coming back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The METAL SHUTTERS OPENING.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAWN

           Damian and Claire step out of the building, to realize it's 
           an INDISTINCT WAREHOUSE in the middle of an unremarkable 
           industrial area. THE SUN IS COMING UP.

           Soaked to the bone, father and daughter walk away from the 
           BURNING BUILDING, trying not to attract any attention.

           Damian produces the GUN and throws it into a DUMPSTER when...

           Suddenly, a couple of POLICE CARS, sirens blaring, DART PAST 
           THEM in the opposite direction. After them, FIRE TRUCKS. 

           As the fire trucks gather around the warehouse and Damian and 
           Claire get lost into the crowd, the CAMERA rises to reveal, 
           past the black pillar of smoke... 

           ...the MANHATTAN SKYLINE, looming in the background. The 
           headquarters were in Queens all along.

           EXT. CLAIRE’S BUILDING - DAY

           A CAB stops by the curb, dropping Damian and Claire.

           Claire takes a couple of steps up to stoop when she notices 
           that Damian is staying on the sidewalk. He’s not coming in.

                                 CLAIRE
                        So this is goodbye?

                                 DAMIAN
                        I guess so.
           Claire thinks for a beat, not knowing how to ask.

                                 CLAIRE
                        The name he... Hayes... How did-- 
                        how did you say you met my father 
                        again?

           Damian smiles.

                                 DAMIAN
                        It was a long time ago.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, but were you--? Are we rel--?

           Claire stops, unsure how to ask, frustrated with herself.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure you have to go? 

                                 DAMIAN
                        I can’t...

                                 CLAIRE
                        But you two were close, right? I 
                        mean, I’d just love if you could, 
                        you know, tell me some more about 
                        him...

           Damian nods, understanding, and finally...

                                 DAMIAN
                        He thought about you. All the time. 
                        I think he regretted not getting to 
                        know you better.

           Claire nods, grateful. She knows that’s all she’ll get from 
           him.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Thank you.

           Damian looks at her for a long silent beat, until...

                                 DAMIAN
                        Have a good life, OK?

           He CARESSES CLAIRE’S CHEEK. She’s is surprised by it, but 
           lets him do it. Somehow, it feels right.

           Claire watches the mysterious man walk away and DISAPPEAR 
           INTO THE EARLY MORNING CROWD, unsuspecting that this was her 
           last encounter with her dead father.
           The CAMERA turns to a STOREFRONT displaying half a dozen of 
           FLAT SCREEN TVs. On all the screens, a NEWSCASTER reports in 
           front of the ruins of a CHARRED BUILDING. It’s the warehouse 
           in Queens!

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        ...a surprising new development on 
                        the mysterious fire that broke out 
                        in Long Island City this morning. 
                        What seems to be an illegal clinic 
                        has been found in the building. 
                        Police are investigating...

           As we PUSH IN on the Newscaster, we...

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                                               FADE IN:

           DAMIAN, eyes closed, sleeping.

           Slowly, he wakes up, his head a little hazy, like he was 
           coming out of the deepest sleep.

           He looks confused when he sees where he is:

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           It’s a warm and cozy bedroom kept in darkness by thick 
           curtains.

           Damian spots something on a desk: It’s a LAPTOP. A post-it on 
           its screen reads: “PLAY ME”.

           He slowly gets out of bed and walks to the computer. He 
           presses the SPACE BAR and A VIDEO POPS UP onscreen.

           Recorded in that same room, it shows DAMIAN HIMSELF. He wears 
           the exact same clothes, but looks FRAZZLED AND ILL. Pale and 
           covered in cold sweat, HE TALKS TO THE CAMERA.

                                 DAMIAN (VIDEO)
                        Hello, Mark. My name is Damian, 
                        Damian Hayes. We’ve never met, but 
                        I’m the man who bought your body.

           Shocked and confused, Damian, who we now realize it’s 
           actually MARK, TAKES A SEAT.

                                 DAMIAN (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        Many things have happened while you 
                        were gone. You’ll find out in time. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAMIAN (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to thank you for the 
                        months you’ve given me. Now I 
                        understand it’s time for me to go.

           Damian, on the screen, produces the BOTTLE OF PILLS and sadly 
           smiles as he shows it to Mark.

                                 DAMIAN  (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        I’ve haven’t taken one in a couple 
                        of weeks, and I can already feel 
                        you coming back. In the morning, I 
                        won’t be me.

           Mark spots the BOTTLE lying next to the computer.

                                 DAMIAN  (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        Welcome back, Mark. And please, 
                        take good care of Maddie and Anna.

           THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.

           Mark gets up from the computer and exits the bedroom.

           INT. RUSTIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house beyond the door is dark but strangely familiar.

           Mark walks down the empty hallway and takes the stairs to the 
           ground floor, also deserted.

           He keeps walking, like in a dream, towards the door. He 
           PUSHES IT OPEN, reveling.

           EXT. RUSTIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...a SPECTACULAR VISTA of the ocean. The sun shines. The 
           water is impossibly blue. 

           Just like in Damian’s dream, there's a PIER that goes into 
           the water. And like in the dream, THERE'S A WOMAN at the end 
           of the pier.

           Mark walks to her. And when she turns...

           It's MADELEINE. 

           When Madeleine sees him, she watches him approach, a little 
           hesitant. Is he…? 

           MARK SMILES. Yes, it’s him.
                                 MADELEINE
                        Mark!

           Madeleine runs to his arms and THE TWO EMBRACE.

           Out of the ocean comes ANNA, in her swimsuit. And when she 
           sees Mark...

                                 ANNA
                        Daddy!!!

           She runs to her father and jumps into his arms.

           The CAMERA pulls back as we see the family finally reunited.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
