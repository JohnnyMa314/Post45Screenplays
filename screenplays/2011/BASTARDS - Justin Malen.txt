           EXT. SCHOOLYARD (NORTHERN CALIFORNIA) -- DAY

           It’s 1987 at a private elementary school, and we meet PETER 
           REYNOLDS when he’s 11.  He’s a normal-looking kid...but, for 
           some reason, doesn’t seem to have any friends.

           He’s sitting alone at a picnic table, ostensibly reading... 
           but mainly watching everyone else have fun.  

           And there’s one kid he’s particularly envious of.  A 
           CHARISMATIC BOY HOLDING COURT FROM ATOP THE JUNGLE GYM.    

                                 CHARISMATIC BOY
                        I’m telling you guys -- Principal Watts 
                        and Lunch Lady Janice are definitely
                        fucking.  

           ALL THE KIDS LAUGH.  

                                 CHARISMATIC BOY (CONT’D)
                        Nobody eats that much meatloaf!         
                        You go up for seconds?  Okay.  You go 
                        up for thirds?  Fine, I’m still with 
                        you.  Maybe you skipped breakfast.  But 
                        you go up for 4 servings of meatloaf?  
                        That shit’s definitely coming with a 
                        side of poontang.     

           ANGLE ON PETER shaking his head and returning to his book. 

           He’s interrupted, however, by AN AFFABLE MALE TEACHER.

                                 AFFABLE MALE TEACHER
                        Hey there, Peter.  

                                 PETER
                             (unenthusiastically)
                        Hey Mr. Henning.  
                             (then, concerned)
                        We aren’t having a quiz today, are we?

           But Mr. Henning isn’t listening.  He’s also watching KYLE... 
           clearly the king of the playground.  

                                 MR. HENNING
                        Boy, sometimes it just blows my mind 
                        that you two are twins.  
                             (beat)
                        I mean, I’m a science teacher, of 
                        course...so I “get it”.  Genetics and 
                        whatnot.  But still.  Someone should 
                        study you guys.
           Peter glares at the educator, but he doesn’t notice.  

           THE END OF RECESS

           As the kids all head toward the school, we find KYLE WALKING 
           WITH AN ARM AROUND PETER’S NECK.  It’s an affectionate 
           embrace...but it still feels like a headlock to Peter.     

                                 KYLE
                        Yo Pete, get a load of these 
                        schmendricks.

           Evidently, FOUR OF KYLE’S BUDDIES are in the middle of the 
           perennial schoolboy debate - “Whose Dad is Toughest?”

                                 BUDDY #1
                        Yeah, well...my dad is so strong, I 
                        saw him lift a car once.

                                 BUDDY #2
                        Yeah whatever, Ronnie.  A Yugo maybe.

                                 BUDDY #1
                        No, seriously -- a full-size sedan.  
                        American.

           Another buddy attempts to one-up this.

                                 BUDDY #3
                        That’s nothing.  One time, my dad 
                        beat up three cops.  Yeah, they were 
                        givin’ him shit ‘cuz he’s half-
                        Mexican and my dad was like --
                             (RE-ENACTS HIS FATHER’S AWESOME MOVES)

                                 BUDDY #4
                        Jimmy, your dad’s like 4-foot-6.  
                        There’s no way he beat up 3 cops.    
                        I don’t care how half-Mexican he is.

           Kyle laughs and finally speaks up for the Reynolds family.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright, look, I’m not gonna lie. 
                        Your dads all seem pretty bad ass.  
                             (beat)
                        But if our old man hadn’t died from 
                        colon cancer before we were born... 
                        he’d have kicked all their asses.  
                        Right, Pete?

                                 PETER
                             (a little too serious)
                        Yeah. 
                                 KYLE
                        And then he’d have probably fucked 
                        your mothers.  
                             (beat)
                        Sorry fellas -- that’s just how 
                        attractive he was.  

           Kyle’s buddies, however, aren’t easily swayed.   

                                 BUDDY #1
                        No offense, dude...but “colon cancer”?  
                        There’s no way that would have killed 
                        my dad.  

                                 BUDDY #2
                        Yeah, my dad would’ve been like, 
                        “Fuck off, colon cancer.”

                                 BUDDY #4
                        Please, colon cancer would be like a 
                        cold to my father.  He probably 
                        wouldn’t even take Tylenol for it.  

           Unlike Peter (who’s clearly taking offense), Kyle just makes 
           the “jerking off” hand gesture.  However, when Jimmy adds...     

                                 JIMMY/BUDDY #3
                        Plus, I heard only fags get colon cancer.  

           ...it’s clear to everyone he went too far.  Even Kyle, the 
           most easygoing kid alive, has to note...

                                 KYLE
                        How can I not hit you?  Seriously.  

           Peter saves him the trouble, though -- CHARGING JIMMY AND 
           TACKLING HIM TO THE GROUND.  And his brother loves it!

                                 KYLE
                        Take it to him, Pete!  You’re doing 
                        great, buddy!  Fists of fury!
                             (but as the fight continues)
                        Okay, you’re kind of losing now...
                             (with Jimmy now on top of him)
                        Yeah, the tide has definitely turned, 
                        Pete.  Just let me know if you want 
                        me to jump in and help. 
                             (with Jimmy landing punch after punch)
                        You’re really getting pounded now, 
                        Pete.  I think I better jump in.  
                        Just for safety’s sake.

           And from Kyle entering the fray, we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           ...where a bloodied & bruised Peter and an unscathed Kyle are 
           sitting beside THEIR EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, CONSERVATIVELY-
           DRESSED MOTHER (MRS. REYNOLDS).  She can hardly look at them.       

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        You boys know how the Lord feels 
                        about fighting.  

           With Kyle distracted, flirting with the Principal’s secretary 
           thru the window, Peter gripes...

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, we know how he feels about 
                        everything.  

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Well, then tell me, smart guy.  Tell 
                        Principal Watts.

                                 PETER
                        He hates it.  

           Kyle chuckles and adds...

                                 KYLE
                        He seems to hate everything we like, 
                        sir.  It’s uncanny.

           But Principal Watts isn’t amused.  

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        I’m just glad your father isn’t alive 
                        to see this.

                                 KYLE
                        Wow, seriously?  You’d rather he be 
                        dead than see us in the Principal’s 
                        office?  That seems pretty harsh, Ma.  
                        I’m kind of shocked, actually.

                                 PETER
                             (annoyed)
                        She didn’t mean it like that.

                                 KYLE
                        No?  It sounded like she did.  
                             (to Principal Watts)
                        What do you think, sir?  Break the tie.
                             (then, noticing a tray of food)
                        Dude, are you seriously eating more 
                        meatloaf?!  You dog, you!  Pete, you 
                        believe this guy?
           Peter just shakes his head.

           INT. CAR (DRIVING) -- DAY

           With their mother driving and Kyle riding shotgun...we find 
           PETER IN THE BACKSEAT, STARING AT AN OLD PHOTO OF THEIR 
           PARENTS (back when they were in their early-20s).  

           You’d be hard-pressed to find a more normal-looking couple.  
           Probably the only noteworthy thing about their father is a 
           long, skinny birthmark on one side of his face.

                                 PETER
                        Ma, would you tell us about Dad again?

                                 KYLE
                             (amused)
                        Dude, she’s told us about him a 
                        million times.  Give her a break. 
                        Mom’s had a rough day.

           But Peter can’t let it go.

                                 PETER
                        Please, Ma.  

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        You’re being punished, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        But it’ll help set me on the right path.  
                             (beat)
                        Jesus would want you to.   

           Against her better judgment, she appeases him.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Your father was the sweetest, most 
                        wonderful man I’d ever met. 

                                 PETER
                        Start earlier!  Start with his 
                        childhood!

           After a beat...

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Well...as you know, he grew up in a  
                        small village in the South of England...

                                 PETER
                        So small, it doesn’t even exist 
                        anymore, right?  It got combined with 
                        the village next to it.
                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        That’s right.  He didn’t have the 
                        easiest childhood, either.  Didn’t 
                        have all the luxuries you and Kyle 
                        take for granted.

                                 PETER
                        Because he was an orphan.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Yes, unfortunately, your father never 
                        knew his parents.  Or any family, for 
                        that matter.  He was raised by nuns 
                        who gave him the last name Reynolds...

                                 PETER
                             (loving the history)
                        On account of the aluminum foil they 
                        found him wrapped in!  

           Kyle chuckles -- amused at how happy this makes his brother.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, skip forward to when you guys met!

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                             (thinking back)
                        Well...I had just graduated from college.  
                        And your father had come to America to 
                        work for a bicycle manufacturer.

                                 PETER
                             (confused)
                        Wait--I thought it was a distributor.  
                        You said the bikes were made back in 
                        England.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        I did?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  

           Beat.  She’s clearly in a spot until she “remembers” --

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        You know what?  The distributor and the 
                        manufacturer were owned by the same 
                        company.  So, technically, he worked 
                        for both.   
                             (beat)
                        That’s why I got confused.

           Peter nods, buying it.  
                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Anyhow, we met in church group, praising 
                        Jesus...and the rest is history.  

           Peter smiles, comforted by the story.  But then he grows sad.

                                 PETER
                        I wish I could have met him.  Wish he 
                        didn’t get colon cancer from eating 
                        too much junk food.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        I do too, honey.  But just know that he’s 
                        watching down on you both from Heaven.  
                        And that he loves you very much.

           Peter gazes at the photo and vows...

                                 PETER
                        I’m gonna make you proud, Dad.

                                 KYLE
                             (being supportive)
                        Hey, make me proud too, Pete.  Do it 
                        for the both of us.

           And it’s from Peter still staring at the photo that we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE PRESENT -- 25 YEARS LATER

           ...where we find A 36-YR-OLD PETER GAZING DIRECTLY INTO A 
           GROWN MAN’S ASSHOLE.

                                 PATIENT #1
                        So how does it look back there, Doc?  
                        Can you see my colon?

                                 PETER
                             (still examining)
                        We won’t be able to see your colon 
                        until the colonoscopy, Mr. Jensen.   
                        I just wanted to take a preliminary 
                        look at your anus.

                                 PATIENT #1
                        Yeah, I bet you did.
                             (then)
                        Hey Doc, next time buy me dinner first!

           Peter concludes his inspection and feigns amusement.

                                 PETER
                        That’s a good one, sir.  
           INT. PETER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Peter is now at his desk, with A DIFFERENT MALE PATIENT 
           sitting across from him.  Peter is reviewing the man’s tests. 

                                 PETER
                        Well, good news, Mr. Grunwald.  Your 
                        tests came back negative.  

                                 PATIENT #2
                        No cancer?

                                 PETER
                        Nope.  You’ve got the colon of an 18-yr-
                        old.  

                                 PATIENT #2
                        I’d rather have his dick...but we get 
                        what we get, right?  

           Peter nods, understanding this all too well.  The patient 
           then spots A PHOTO OF A 7-YR-OLD BOY ON THE DESK. 

                                 PATIENT #2
                        Hey, cute kid.

           Peter looks at the photo.  Grows melancholy.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  He sure was.

                                 PATIENT #2
                             (fearing the worst)
                        Oh my god.  Did he--

                                 PETER
                        Oh--no.  No.  He’s alive.  He’s just 
                        gotten older and decided he doesn’t like 
                        his old man anymore.  Not quite as cute.
                             (losing himself in the photo)
                        Last month he called me a “professional 
                        butt-pirate”.

           The patient tries to be upbeat for him.

                                 PATIENT #2 
                        Hey, you know kids.  They go through 
                        phases.

                                 PETER
                        This one’s lasted 5 years...but I 
                        appreciate the thought. 
                             (noticing the time)
                        Ooh -- I’m late for a little quality  
                        time as we speak.  
           EXT. GATED ESTATE COMMUNITY (SILICON VALLEY) -- DAY

           Peter is in his Prius, waiting at the security gate to a 
           community of multi-million dollar estate homes.  THE GUARD 
           scans his list...but isn’t having any luck.   

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’m sorry Dr. Reynolds...but she must 
                        have forgotten to call again.  You’re 
                        not on the list.  You want me to try 
                        the house?  

           But Peter is already on his cell, calling.   

           INT. MANSION FOYER -- DAY

           Despite having made it past the gate, Peter’s frustration has 
           only grown...now dealing with his EX-WIFE (DEBORAH).

                                 PETER
                        What do you mean he’s not coming?  
                        It’s his grandmother’s 60th birthday.    
                        I promised her he’d be there.

                                 DEBORAH
                        He has to study.

                                 PETER
                        Study for what?  It’s Friday.  And 
                        please don’t say his Bar Mitzvah. 

                                 DEBORAH
                        Well, he does.  It’s in 2 weeks.

                                 PETER
                             (exploding)
                        HE’S NOT EVEN JEWISH!  You’ve been 
                        married to this guy, what, a year and 
                        already he’s converting my son? 

                                 DEBORAH
                        Don’t start this again.  My getting 
                        remarried has been really hard for Ethan. 

           Peter glances out the window and catches -- HIS NOW 13-YR-OLD 
           SON, ETHAN, AND HIS STEPDAD, PLAYING PAINTBALL, HAVING A 
           BLAST.

                                 DEBORAH (CONT’D)
                        Joel just thought a Bar Mitzvah would 
                        make him feel more welcome in the family.

           PETER’S POV:  ETHAN’S STEPSIBLINGS JOIN THE “BATTLE”.  One 
           even shoots back-to-back with him, covering his rear.  Never, 
           in the history of stepfamilies, has a child felt more welcome.    
                                 PETER
                             (ready to lose it)
                        The kid just wants a party, Deborah.  
                        Next to you, he’s the most spoiled 
                        person I know.

           She’s hardly affected by the insult.  

                                 DEBORAH
                        Look, if you’d like to go outside and 
                        have him reject you to your face... 
                        please, be my guest.  

           Peter looks outside again.  Sadly, he knows she isn’t 
           bluffing.     

           EXT. PETER’S MOTHER’S HOME IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- DAY

           Peter arrives alone for his mother’s 60th birthday party, 
           already in progress in the backyard of the modest home.     
           30-40 people BBQing, drinking, etc. 

           Peter’s mother looks happy and healthy...now married to a 
           nice, easy-going guy (PASTOR GENE MANNING). 

                                 PETER
                        Hey, Mom.  Hey Pastor Manning.

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Peter, come on.  I’ve been married to 
                        your mother for 15 years.  I’ve known 
                        you since you were 8.  You can call 
                        me Gene.  Dad...if you want...

           Peter just looks back at the man.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        So where’s my grandson?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, Ethan couldn’t make it, Mom.  
                        He’s got strep throat.  

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Oh, that’s terrible.

                                 PETER
                        I know.  He really wanted to be here too.

           Before Peter can continue lying, who should arrive but --

           KYLE AND HIS PERFECT HAWAIIAN FAMILY (KAYLANI, his swimsuit 
           model wife, and their 2 golden-skinned sons, KAPONO & KEANU).  
                                 KYLE
                        Did somebody say Aloha?

           Before Mrs. Reynolds can even express her delight, KAPONO AND 
           KEANU (AGES 8 AND 6) COME RUNNING OVER FOR HUGS.

                                 KAPONO/KEANU
                        GRANDMA!!!!!

           They couldn’t be more excited to see her.  And she them.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Kyle, I can’t believe you flew all 
                        the way from Hawaii just for this?

                                 KYLE
                        “Just for this”?  How often does the 
                        prettiest woman in the world turn 60?

           Mrs. Reynolds blushes and hugs her son.  Kaylani adds to the 
           moment by putting a beautiful floral lei around her neck.

                                 KAYLANI
                        Happy birthday, Mrs. Reynolds.  It’s 
                        wonderful to see you again.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Kaylani, please, call me mom.  Oh, 
                        this is so beautiful.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s called a “lei”, Ma.  Kapono and 
                        Keanu made it themselves out of 
                        flowers we have growing on our lanai.

           Peter can only mumble to himself...

                                 PETER
                        Jesus Christ.

           Kyle finally notices him. 

                                 KYLE
                        Pete!  Oh my God, I didn’t even see 
                        you there!  
                             (hugging him vigorously)
                        Holy bejeezus you lost weight.  You look 
                        amazing!  Doesn’t he look great, kids?

                                 KAPONO/KEANU
                        Totally!/Definitely!

           Peter forces a smile.  
                                 KYLE
                        And Gene!  You look great too, buddy.    

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Lost a few more hairs, probably.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, but you’ve got a perfectly 
                        shaped head.  You’re like a white 
                        Michael Jordan.

           Kyle then notices A STATE-OF-THE-ART GRILL BEING PUT TO USE.

                                 KYLE
                        Sweet -- the grill came!  We were 
                        worried it wouldn’t make it in time.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        It’s wonderful, Kyle.  You really 
                        shouldn’t have.

                                 KYLE
                        Please, what’s the point of having a 
                        shitload of money if you can’t spend it 
                        on the people you love?  Right, Pete?

           Kyle musses Pete’s hair like you would a child.

           LATER IN THE PARTY

           Peter is about to put condiments on his burger when he 
           notices A BOTTLE OF “HANG LOOSE BBQ SAUCE” -- a Hawaiian-
           themed sauce with the silhouette of a man giving the “hang 
           loose” sign.  (NOTE: the figure on the bottle could be 
           literally anyone)  

           Peter contemplates smashing the bottle, but Kyle interrupts --

                                 KYLE
                        Oh sweet!  The new bottles have hit 
                        the mainland!
                             (beat)
                        I tell ya, Pete, life’s a crazy ride.  
                        One minute you’re lying on a beach in 
                        Maui...unemployed...uneducated...30 
                        bucks to your name...and the next 
                        minute some guy comes up and says he 
                        wants to put your silhouette on his 
                        BBQ sauce bottles.  
                             (beat)
                        And then the next minute, you’re making 
                        10 cents for every bottle they sell.

                        And then the next minute, they’re 
                        selling 10 million bottles a year.  
                             (beat)
                        And then the next minute--

                                 PETER
                        You’re married to a Hawaiian Tropics 
                        model.  I know.  It’s a crazy ride.

                                 KYLE
                        God, it’s been forever since we’ve 
                        seen each other.  I’ve called a bunch 
                        of times, but--

                                 PETER
                        I’ve been having problems with my 
                        voicemail.  I need to switch carriers.

           Kyle nods (he always believes his brother).

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, you wanna grab a drink later?  
                        The kids are staying with Ma...so 
                        Kaylani and I are completely free.     

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, no...I can’t.  Ethan’s sick.  
                        I’m gonna bring him some chicken 
                        soup, spend a little quality time. 

                                 KYLE
                        Aw, okay.  I understand.  Hope he 
                        feels better.  
                             (then)
                        Hey, what about tomorr--

                                 PETER
                             (pretends his cell is buzzing)
                        Damn, it’s my answering service.  I 
                        really better take this.

           Kyle watches him go.  Before he can give it more thought, 
           though, KAPONO & KEANU RUN OVER FOR HUGS. 

                                 KAPONO/KEANU
                        Daddy!!!!!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PETER’S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

           It’s the kind of sterile, corporate-looking place that 
           divorced guys gravitate to.  
           INT. PETER’S APARTMENT -- EVENING

           Peter enters his sad, sparsely furnished apartment.  He looks 
           equally sad. 

           KITCHEN

           He makes himself a White Russian...using Lactose-free milk.

           BEDROOM

           He enters, drink in hand...now in his bathrobe.  Gets into 
           bed and turns on the TV.  

           NOTE: a framed photo of his mother and father is on the 
           nightstand.  It’s not the same photo we saw him with as a 
           child...but it’s similarly wholesome and unremarkable.

           He CHANNEL-SURFS a bit...his attention shifting between the 
           TV and his iPad...but ultimately he lands on --

           AN EPISODE OF LAW & ORDER SVU.

           ON TV:  It’s the climax of a heated interrogation --  
           Detectives Stabler & Benson really laying into the suspect.

                                 DETECTIVE STABLER
                        Goddammit, admit it!  You molested every 
                        one of those boy scouts!  The entire 
                        troop!  Didn’t you?!  DIDN’T YOU?!!

           Peter grimaces and is about to turn the channel when we 
           finally get a look at the suspect and see --  

           IT’S HIS FATHER!!!!  

           (or at least it’s an actor who looks exactly like Peter’s 
           father would look if you aged him 40 years from the photo on 
           the nightstand -- right down to the birthmark on his cheek!)

           PETER IS STUNNED SPEECHLESS...watching “his father” break 
           down, sobbing uncontrollably and confessing...

                                 “PETER’S FATHER”
                             (with a British accent, no less)
                        ...I did it...Oh god, I did it...I 
                        molested them all...

                                 DETECTIVE STABLER
                        Including the troop in Baltimore!

                                 “PETER’S FATHER”
                        Yes!
                                 DETECTIVE BENSON
                        And the troop in Toledo!
                             (not getting a response)
                        And the troop in Toledo!

           But “Peter’s father” can’t even respond.  He’s just hunched 
           over in emotional agony...drool streaming from his mouth...

           ON PETER, STILL SHELL-SHOCKED.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A LUXURIOUS HOTEL BED

           ...WHERE A NAKED, COWBOY HAT-WEARING KYLE ANSWERS HIS CELL.

                                 KYLE
                        Pete!  What’s goin’ on, buddy?!

           Granted, “Cowboy Kyle” is a little distracted -- WATCHING HIS 
           EQUALLY NAKED WIFE HOOK UP WITH A FEMALE MEMBER OF THE HOTEL 
           STAFF -- but he’s definitely happy his brother called.  

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Is Ethan feeling better?

           INT. PETER’S BEDROOM

                                 PETER
                        Turn on TNT.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 KYLE
                        Is that code for something?

                                 PETER
                        The television.  Turn to TNT. 

           Kyle obliges. 

           ON KYLE’S TV: “THEIR FATHER” CONTINUES WEEPING...EXPLAINING...

                                 “THEIR FATHER”
                        ...They wanted me to touch them...the 
                        little boys...They...liked it...

           DETECTIVE BENSON LUNGES AT HIM -- but Stabler holds her back.

                                 DETECTIVE STABLER
                        He’s not worth it, Olivia!  He’s not 
                        worth it.

           ON KYLE who, apparently, doesn’t even notice the resemblance.
                                 KYLE
                        Why are we watching this?

                                 PETER
                        Are you kidding me?!  How can you not 
                        see it?!  This guy is our father!
                             (beat)
                        HE’S ALIVE!

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, are you high right now?

                                 PETER
                        No!      

                                 KYLE
                        Drunk?

           Despite the concierge licking her nipples, Kaylani’s 
           curiosity has been piqued.

                                 KAYLANI
                        What’s going on?

                                 KYLE
                        Pete thinks this guy is our father.

           Kaylani looks at the TV and has to admit...

                                 KAYLANI
                        He does look like him.  At least 
                        based on the pictures you showed me.  

                                 KYLE
                        You think?

                                 PETER
                             (losing it)
                        THEY LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE, KYLE!  Look 
                        at the birthmark on his cheek!

           Kyle gives the actor another look, but still dismisses it.

                                 KYLE
                        So what if they look alike?  There are 
                        50 billion people in the world -- 
                        there’s someone who looks like everyone.  
                             (beat)
                        I saw this guy at Foot Locker once  
                        who looked exactly like Nicole Richie.

           But Peter is no longer listening.  And he comes to the only 
           reasonable explanation.   
                                 PETER
                        He must have faked his own death.
                             (beat)
                        Like Julia Roberts in Sleeping with 
                        the Enemy.  He must have faked his 
                        death to get away from Mom.      

                                 KYLE
                             (chuckling)
                        Dude, who’d fake their death by colon 
                        cancer?  That’d take like 2 years!

                                 PETER
                        That’s the genius of it!

                                 KYLE
                        You’re crazy, Pete.  I love you, but 
                        you’re crazy.

                                 PETER
                        I gotta go tell her.

                                 KYLE
                        Now?

                                 PETER
                        Yes now!  Are you coming or not?

           Kyle looks at Kaylani and the concierge...their glistening 
           bodies aching for his manhood.  

                                 KYLE
                             (”annoyed”)
                        Apparently not. 

           EXT. THEIR MOTHER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Peter & Kyle are on the front porch, waiting.  Kyle is still 
           in his hotel bathrobe.  Peter has his iPad in hand.

                                 KYLE
                        We should have called first. 

                                 PETER
                        Mom turns the ringer off after 9.

           She appears at the door with Pastor Gene.  

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                             (preparing herself for the worst)
                        Who’s dead?  Is it Ethan?  Is it my 
                        grandson Ethan?

                                 KYLE
                        Relax Ma.  No one’s dead.
                                 PETER
                        Just the opposite, actually.

           Understandably, this confuses her.  

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Mom, I think you better sit down.  
                        There’s something I need to show you.

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t worry, Ma.  Pete’s just 
                        overreacting like he always does.

           Peter displays his iPad and RUNS A HULU CLIP OF THE LAW & 
           ORDER EPISODE.

           At first she doesn’t know what she’s looking at.  The 
           “pervert’s” face hasn’t been revealed yet.  But once she sees 
           it...SHE’S CLEARLY AFFECTED.

                                 KYLE
                        Ma, please tell Pete this guy isn’t 
                        our father.

           After a few moments, she replies weakly...

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        He isn’t your father.

           Kyle puts his arm around her.  He assumes she’s just getting 
           emotional because of the resemblance.

                                 KYLE
                        Look how upset you made her, Pete.  I 
                        told you this was a bad idea. 

           But Peter isn’t satisfied.  

                                 PETER
                        No.  I’ve looked at photos of our father 
                        every day since I was 4.  Mom, it’s him!  
                             (beat)
                        Look at the birthmark for Christ’s sake!  
                        It’s the exact same shape!  Hell, he’s 
                        even speaking with a British accent!

           She has trouble facing Peter.  Kyle looks ready to kill him, 
           until Pastor Gene finally speaks.  

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        It’s time, Helen.  Tell them the truth.

           And...after a long beat...she nods.         
                                 KYLE
                             (actually a little worried)
                        What truth, Ma?  What the F is Gene 
                        talking about?  

           With great difficulty, she ultimately confesses...

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        The man in the photos I gave you... 
                        wasn’t actually your father.  

           ON THE BROTHERS.  STUNNED BEYOND REACTION.  

           After several beats...

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry, what?

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        He was just a friend of mine back in 
                        college.  An exchange student from 
                        England named Colin Barnes.    
                             (beat)
                        He moved back after graduation...so I 
                        just assumed you’d never see him.  
                             (in disbelief herself)
                        He had studied to become a botanist, for 
                        crying out loud!  Never even had an 
                        interest in acting! 

           Once again, Peter can only muster...

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry, what?

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        The truth is...I made up all the stories 
                        about your father.  That he was an 
                        orphan...that he worked for a bicycle 
                        company...that he died of colon cancer...  

           Kyle notices that PETER IS NOW TRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF 
           SUSPENDED ANIMATION...and he decides to field this one.

                                 KYLE
                        And you did this because...

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        The truth is...I wasn’t sure who your 
                        father was.  
                             (beat)
                        The 70s were a crazy time for me.  A 
                        time I’m not proud of.

           Pastor Gene comes to her defense, though.
                                 PASTOR GENE
                        You have to understand, it was the 
                        Disco era.  And if you were a woman 
                        living in New York City...and partying 
                        at places like Studio 54...it wasn’t 
                        unusual for you to...
                             (with no delicate way to say it)
                        have sex with a lot of men.

           PETER IS STILL CATATONIC, just staring back at the mother he 
           thought he knew.  

           Kyle, on the other hand, can’t help but be impressed.

                                 KYLE
                        You partied at Studio 54?  Seriously?  
                        Ma, that’s awesome!

           Peter shows his first sign of life in turning to his brother.  
           “Are you fucking kidding me?” 

                                 KYLE
                             (off Peter’s look)
                        What?  It turns out mom was cool as shit.  
                             (beat)
                        Plus, this explains where I get my love 
                        of fucking.  Haven’t you always wondered 
                        where I got that?

           Peter returns to his mother.  But only to conclude... 

                                 PETER
                        Bullshit.  It was all bullshit.  My 
                        entire life...has been based on a lie.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Peter...

                                 PETER
                             (backing away from her)
                        No.  All the rules you set for us.  
                        Making us go to church all the time... 
                        Jesus this and Jesus that...It was all 
                        just to hide your own sins.  

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Peter, like many members of my 
                        congregation, your mother found the Lord 
                        later in life.  Once she learned she was 
                        pregnant with the two of you, actually.  
                        Don’t you see?  You boys saved her.   

           Peter is unmoved, though, AND EXPLODES --
                                 PETER
                        Do you have any idea what this means?!  
                        I’ve spent my whole life trying to make 
                        “my father” proud!  To honor his memory!   

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        And you have!

                                 PETER
                        What memory?!  
                             (beat)
                        I stare at assholes all day long!   
                        My own son calls me “Doctor Sodomy”!
                             (beat)
                        You don’t think I’d rather be a 
                        dermatologist?!  You don’t think I’d 
                        rather be a plastic surgeon looking 
                        at tits all day?!  I love tits!! 

                                 KYLE
                             (trying to calm him)
                        I love them too, bro.  Just rela--

                                 PETER
                        Jesus, you had me so afraid I’d die  
                        young like “Dad” that I actually got 
                        married in college!  To Deborah of 
                        all people!  The biggest mistake of 
                        my life! 

                                 KYLE
                        Come on, it’s not Mom’s fault you 
                        married a bitch.

           But Peter clearly isn’t listening.  Just continues his tirade.  

                                 PETER
                        She changed her last name!  From Baxter 
                        to Reynolds!  She took a fictional man’s 
                        last name!  She gave us a fictional 
                        man’s last name!  
                             (beat)
                        Am I the only one who sees how insane 
                        that is?!

           ON THEIR MOTHER.  And we can see this is hurting her.  

                                 KYLE
                        It seems pretty clever to me, dude.  Made 
                        the story more believable.  Plus, Baxter 
                        would’ve made us sound like dweebs.
                             (robot voice)
                        “Hello, I’m Kyle Baxter”.  See? 
           Amidst his meltdown, though --

           PETER HAS A MOMENT OF CLARITY.

                                 PETER
                        Wait a second.  He’s out there.  This 
                        means he’s out there.  

                                 KYLE
                        Who?

                                 PETER
                        Our father!  He’s been out there the 
                        whole time!

                                 KYLE
                             (more intrigued than upset)
                        Hey, that’s true.  
                             (then)
                        Ma, who did you think our father was?  
                        I know it was a crazy time and all -- 
                        what with the drugs and the fucking 
                        and whatnot -- but you probably had 
                        some idea, right?  

                                 PETER
                        Especially as we got older. 

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, especially.  Who do we remind 
                        you of?  

           She looks back at the two of them.  She really doesn’t want 
           to get into this.    

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        None of the men I was with would have 
                        made a good father.  I was only trying 
                        to protect you.

                                 PETER
                             (scoffs)
                        Protect yourself is more like it.

           Beat.  She looks him square in the eyes.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Is that what you think?   

           Peter doesn’t respond.  But clearly it is.  She masks her 
           hurt with indignation.
                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Fine, you want to know who I thought 
                        your father was?  I’ll tell you who I 
                        thought your father was.

           The brothers wait eagerly.  

           But she still doesn’t come out with it.  Peter is actually 
           forced to press again.

                                 PETER
                        Who?

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Jack Tibbs, alright.  There.  Are you 
                        happy?   

           THE NAME LEAVES ALL THREE MEN STUNNED...even her husband.  

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        The football player?

           She nods.  Her sons, however, remain in disbelief.  

                                 PETER
                        Hall of Fame quarterback Jack Tibbs?

                                 KYLE
                        Hertz Rent-A-Car Spokesman Jack Tibbs?

           Before she can even respond, KYLE CELEBRATES -- 

                                 KYLE
                        Ma, that’s unbelievable!!!  Isn’t 
                        that unbelievable, Pete?  

           But, true to form, Peter only views the negative.

                                 PETER
                        Let me get this right.  You decided 
                        to not tell us that Jack Tibbs was 
                        our father.  An American legend.  A 
                        multi-MULTI-millionaire.    
                             (beat)
                        That’s who you were protecting us from?

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        He wasn’t the man you’ve seen on TV.  
                        He had a drug problem.  

                                 PETER
                        SO DID EVERYONE!  It was the 70s!

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        And he was violent.  
           This concerns all the men.  But Peter most of all.

                                 PETER
                        He hit you?  

           She considers lying, but concedes...

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        No.  But as a football player...he 
                        was frequently violent.

                                 PETER
                        That was his job!  Plus, he played 
                        quarterback!  People hit him!  A lot!  
                        He had like 12 concussions over his 
                        career!  
                             (to himself as much as his mother)
                        Jesus, do you have any idea what my life 
                        could have been like with him as my 
                        father?  The doors it would have opened?  
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I would’ve been a pro football 
                        player!

                        even make our middle school team.

                                 PETER
                        Well...maybe that’s because I didn’t  
                        have Jack Tibbs teaching me fundamentals.

                        can go meet him now.  Make up for 
                        lost time.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, right...because I’m sure he’d 
                        be thrilled to learn he has two 
                        middle-aged bastard sons.

                                 KYLE
                        First of all, middle-age starts at 40.   
                        And second of all, maybe he would.  Think 
                        about it.  We wouldn’t be asking him for 
                        money or anything -- you’re a doctor and 
                        I’m rich as fuck.  We’d just be two kick-
                        ass guys who share half his DNA.

                        we can actually say it honestly.

           Despite everything, we can tell that part of Peter is 
           interested.  Curious to meet the man.

                        Plus, he probably lives someplace 
                        awesome with like a thousand golf 
                        courses.  We can make a “bro-cation” 
                        out of it...if that’s a thing.  It’ll 
                        give us a chance to catch up.    

           Spending time with his brother is the last thing Peter wants,

           But she clearly isn’t happy about this.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

           Peter is waiting for his brother outside the airport.  He has 
           one piece of carry-on luggage and is on his cell, frustrated.  

                                 PETER  
                        Gene, would you please put my mother 
                        on the phone?

           INT. THEIR MOTHER’S HOME -- DAY

           Pastor Gene looks over at his wife, but she’s just shaking 
           her head...still upset that they’re doing this. 

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        She’s still a little hurt, Peter.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS 
                        I’m a lot hurt!

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        She’s a lot hurt.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 PETER
                        Look, tell her this isn’t about her.  
                        It’s just something we need to do.
                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Your mother loves you very much, Peter.  

                                 PETER
                             (exasperated)
                        I know.  Look, I’m not angry anymore.  

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Really?  Because you still sound angry.

                                 PETER
                        Alright, I’m still angry.  But I forgive 
                        her.  Would you please at least tell her 
                        that?

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        I will.  Hey, just one thing, Peter. 
                             (walking into another room, quietly)
                        Would you try to get an autograph for me?  

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, will do, Gene.

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Ask him to make it out to “Pastor Gene”.  
                        But have him spell pastor with two S’s.  
                        You know, because he was a quarterback.   

                                 PETER
                        Two S’s. Got it.

           Just then, Peter sees KYLE BEING DROPPED OFF BY HIS PERFECT, 
           LOVING FAMILY.  Kapono and Keanu hug him tightly.

                                 KEANU
                        Daddy, don’t go.

           Kyle looks over at Peter like “What am I supposed to do?”  
           Peter feigns amusement.

           Kaylani is next to bid Kyle farewell.  And, even by her 
           ridiculously high standards, she looks amazing.  

                                 KAYLANI
                        Think about what I said, okay? 

                                 KYLE
                             (actually a little annoyed)
                        Kaylani...

                                 KAYLANI
                        You don’t want to disappoint me, do you?
                                 KYLE
                             (ultimately acquiescing)
                        Alright, I’ll think about it.

           She beams and gives him a deep soul kiss.  It’s like one of 
           those old Big Red commercials.  Just keeps going.

           ON PETER already in agony.   

           INT. SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

           As Peter and Kyle are waiting in line to go thru security, 
           Peter can’t help but ask...

                                 PETER
                        So what did she want you to think about? 

           But Kyle is clearly still annoyed by it. (which of course 
           only further piques Peter’s interest)

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        She wants another kid, right?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, I wish.

                                 PETER
                        What then?

                                 KYLE
                             (like it’s a bad thing)
                        She wants me to have sex with other 
                        women while we’re gone.

           Beat.

                                 PETER
                        She wants you to have an affair?

                                 KYLE
                        She doesn’t see it as an “affair”.  
                        She has this theory that men are 
                        biologically wired to have sex with 
                        lots of women and that fighting it is 
                        against nature.  She thinks it’ll 
                        help me be a better, happier husband.

           Peter is left speechless, watching Kyle put his bag on the 
           conveyer belt to be scanned.  When he finally comes to...

                                 PETER
                        And she’s not just saying this so she
                        can fool around? 
                                 KYLE
                        I wish she was.  I’d feel less guilty.  
                        But, unfortunately, she can’t even get 
                        aroused when I’m not around.  
                             (beat)
                        She’s like one of those anglerfish.  
                        You know, the ones that mate for life?       

           Peter is again left speechless.  The luckiest man in the 
           world is even luckier than he seemed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           GATE 7 -- FLIGHT 23 TO MIAMI

           Kyle continues venting while they wait.

                                 KYLE
                        I mean, don’t get me wrong -- I love 
                        when Kaylani brings women home for us 
                        to fuck together...but it just wouldn’t 
                        feel right without her.  
                             (then)
                        Ah, maybe I’m just being difficult.

           But Peter has tuned his brother out.  HE’S ON HIS IPAD, 
           CONFIRMING THEIR ITINERARY.

                                 PETER
                        Okay, so Tibbs is still scheduled to 
                        sign autographs tomorrow morning at  
                        the Sports Authority in Miami Springs.

                                 KYLE
                        Why don’t we just go to his home?  I 
                        know a guy who can get anyone’s address.  
                        People call him “Big Brother”.  
                             (beat)
                        But that’s also because he’s a large 
                        black man.    

                                 PETER
                        Going to his home would be inappropriate. 

                                 KYLE
                        You think?

                                 PETER
                        I know.  The guy has a family.  We 
                        can’t just barge in on them.
                             (beat)
                        According to Wikipedia, he lives with 
                        his 3rd wife, Karen.  He’s got 5 
                        children and 10 grandkids.  
                                 KYLE
                        Hey, let me see that.

           INT. PLANE -- DAY

           It’s before takeoff.  Kyle & Peter are seated in First Class.  

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, I still can’t believe you’ve 
                        never flown First Class before.  
                        You’re gonna love it.  We can do 
                        literally anything we want up here.

           But Peter isn’t listening.  He’s on his iPad, scouring the 
           web for more on Jack Tibbs. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, is that a video?  Hit play.
                             (like they’re kids again)
                        Come on, hit play!

           PETER PLAYS THE VIDEO...AND IT’S AN OLD, GRAINY NFL FILMS 
           PRODUCTION (complete with “Voice of God” narration). 

                                 “VOICE OF GOD”
                        In the annals of professional football, 
                        no player embodied the word “toughness” 
                        like New York Giants quarterback Jack 
                        Tibbs.

           ON SCREEN: Jack Tibbs (think the sex appeal of Joe Namath and 
           the physicality of Terry Bradshaw) jogs onto the field in 
           slow-motion, his uniform covered in dirt and blood.

                                 “VOICE OF GOD”
                        The Giants’ all-time leading passer, 
                        Tibbs was a molotov cocktail of guts, 
                        testosterone and fury.  

           ON SCREEN: Tibbs throws his helmet off and starts fighting 
           with a TREMENDOUS DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.  He’s like a honey 
           badger -- doesn’t give a fuck.

                                 “VOICE OF GOD”
                        The most-sacked quarterback in NFL 
                        history, Tibbs refused to leave the 
                        pocket, seeing it as a sign of weakness.

           ON SCREEN: we see Tibbs getting sacked -- again and again.  

                                 “VOICE OF GOD”
                        2 Superbowl rings and twelve concussions 
                        later...Jack Tibbs’ place in the Hall of 
                        Fame is a foregone conclusion.
           ON SCREEN: Tibbs celebrates a Superbowl with his teammates. 

                                 NY GIANTS TEAMMATES
                        They call him Mr. Tibbs!  They call 
                        him Mr. Tibbs!

                                 “VOICE OF GOD”
                        With his chiseled physique and million 
                        dollar smile, though, it was only a 
                        matter of time before Hollywood came 
                        calling.  

           ON SCREEN: we see footage of Tibbs’ many media appearances -- 
           attending premieres...”fighting” alongside Stallone in a Rambo-
           like movie...posing shirtless with two buxom blondes for an ad 
           for Courvoisier. Just as he toasts us, though--

           A PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT INTERRUPTS --

                                 PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I’m sorry, but you’re going to have 
                        to turn that off.  We’re about to 
                        take off. 

                                 PETER
                        Oh, sure, no problem.  

                                 KYLE
                        We were just watching footage of our 
                        father.  We’re going to meet him 
                        tomorrow for the very first time.  

                                 PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Really?  

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, we grew up thinking he was a 
                        bicycle salesman, but it turns out he 
                        was actually a Hall of Fame athlete.  
                        We’re both extremely excited.

                                 PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Aw, you’re so sweet.

           Peter can tell she’s into Kyle and can only shake his head.  

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, if you think I’m sweet, you should 
                        meet my brother Pete here.  He’s like a 
                        ripe honeydew, he’s so sweet.

                                 PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                             (smiling at Peter)
                        A honeydew, huh?
           But Peter isn’t exactly good with women. 

                                 PETER
                        Apparently.

                                 PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I love honeydews.

           And she gives him a promising smile as she returns to her pre-
           flight duties.  Once she’s gone, Kyle celebrates --

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, she totally wants to fuck you!

                                 PETER
                        Gimme a break.

                                 KYLE
                             (to THE ELDERLY WOMAN across the aisle)
                        She does, right?

           The woman agrees.  It sure looked like it.

                                 PETER
                        Whatever.  I’m not on this trip to 
                        get laid.  

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well, you’re gonna.  Whether 
                        you like it or not.  That’s my new 
                        mission.  I’m making it a sub-mission 
                        of our larger mission.  
                             (off Peter’s displeased look)
                        Dude, how many women have you even 
                        slept with since the divorce?  10?  

           Evidently, 10 is a low number from Kyle’s perspective.

                                 PETER
                             (sarcastically)
                        Yeah, 10.  

           Kyle doesn’t note the sarcasm.

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus, it’s been what?  A year? 

                                 PETER

                                 KYLE
                        10 women in 2 years?  
                             (compassionately)
                        Peter I had no idea.  I’m sorry.
                                 PETER
                        I was being sarcastic, dick.  I haven’t 
                        had sex with anyone since Deborah.

           This stuns Kyle speechless.  It’s like Peter just revealed  
           he’s actually an alien.  And it only gets worse when he adds...

                                 PETER
                        I haven’t had sex with anyone besides
                        Deborah.  We got married in college, 
                        remember?

           KYLE’S EXPRESSION REMAINS FROZEN AS THE PLANE TAKES OFF.

           INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

           Peter and Kyle wheel their luggage through the terminal...but 
           Kyle is still dazed -- a good 5 and a half hours later.

                                 PETER
                        Would you knock it off?  I knew I 
                        shouldn’t have told you.

           Kyle finally regains the power of speech.

                                 KYLE
                        Is it...you know...a physical thing?  
                        Are you not able to--

                                 PETER
                        It’s not physical.  I just...since 
                        Deborah cheated on me...I’ve been a 
                        little depressed.  You wouldn’t 
                        understand.

                                 KYLE
                        Sure I would.  You don’t think I’ve 
                        ever been depressed?

                                 PETER
                        The saddest I’ve ever seen you is the 
                        day they cancelled Perfect Strangers.

                                 KYLE
                        It was my favorite show.

           While Peter is shaking his head, THE PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
           PASSES WITH HER EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE COLLEAGUES.

                                 PRETTY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Bye, Honeydew.  Good luck meeting 
                        your father.

           Peter smiles politely...but nothing more.
           INT. HERTZ RENT-A-CAR -- DAY

           The brothers are picking up their rental car (NOTE: A POSTER 
           OF SPOKESPERSON JACK TIBBS is visible up on the wall).

           Kyle tries to cheer Peter up.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, at least you got a great kid out 
                        of the marriage, right?  Ethan’s 
                        hilarious.  Did you get that joke Bar 
                        Mitzvah invitation he sent out?

                                 PETER
                        It wasn’t a joke.

                                 KYLE
                        What?  

                                 PETER
                        Deborah’s new husband is throwing him 
                        a big Bar Mitzvah bash.

                                 KYLE
                        But Ethan’s not Jewish.

                                 PETER
                        I know.  

           Kyle considers this.  Huh?  

           INT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL -- EVENING

           The brothers are checking in at the trendy hotel.  Kyle 
           continues trying to cheer Peter up.

                                 KYLE
                        But business is good, right?  Your 
                        practice... 

                                 PETER
                        Well, besides Deborah taking half my 
                        income per our divorce settlement, I’ve 
                        spent the better part of the year 
                        defending two frivolous lawsuits.  One 
                        malpractice, one sexual molestation.

                                 KYLE
                        Sexual molestation?

                                 PETER
                        Uh huh.  Apparently one patient felt I 
                        was enjoying my job a little too much.  
                             (beat)
                        That definitely helped business.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Not to mention my son’s already stellar
                        opinion of me.

           Kyle’s disbelief has clearly grown.  The Front Desk Woman 
           comes back with their keys.  

                                 FRONT DESK WOMAN
                        Sorry for the wait.  Here are your 
                        keys.  Do you need help with your bags?

                                 KYLE
                             (still in shock)
                        No...thanks.  We’re good.

                                 FRONT DESK WOMAN
                        Just let me know if you need anything 
                        else.
                             (directed at Kyle)
                        Anything at all.

           Peter just rolls his eyes and starts toward the elevators.

           INT. THEIR AMAZING HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Peter has unpacked...and is undressing, ready to call it a 
           night.  Kyle, on the other hand, is psyched to go out.

                                 KYLE
                        So what are you thinking?  Stone Crab?  
                        Cuban?  A little Arroz con Pollo action?  

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, it’s late...I was just gonna order 
                        room service.  But you should go out.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh snap, room service is a great idea!  
                             (beat)
                        It’ll be just like the time Ma took us  
                        to San Diego.  Remember that?  Me and you 
                        pigging out on burgers and sundaes while 
                        she was at that conference?

           It’s actually a decent memory for Peter.

                                 PETER
                        She was so pissed.

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, that’s one of my all-time 
                        favorite memories.  
                             (beat)
                        Not that she got pissed, I mean.  But 
                        the whole weekend.
           Peter doesn’t buy it.  Not with the kind of life Kyle’s lived.

                                 PETER
                        Shut the hell up.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m serious.  And not just because I 
                        finger-banged the maid when you went 
                        swimming.  I really had a great time 
                        with you.   

           Peter looks back at his brother.  The fact that he’s such a 
           good guy makes Peter feel even worse for hating him.  

           LATER

           Room service has arrived...and KYLE IS LAUGHING HIS ASS OFF, 
           watching an episode of Perfect Strangers on Peter’s iPad.

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, this is awesome!  How did you 
                        find it? 

                                 PETER
                        It was pretty tough, actually.  I had 
                        to type “Perfect Strangers” on YouTube.

                                 KYLE
                             (still impressed)
                        Yeah?  Fucking sweet.

           And, for a brief moment, Peter actually seems to be having a 
           decent time too.  

                                 PETER
                        God, I can’t remember the last time I 
                        was on vacation.

                                 KYLE
                        It feels good, right?

           Peter’s escape is cut short, however, when 2 LIVE CREW’S    
           “ME SO HORNY” BLARES FROM KYLE’S CELL.  He answers excitedly.

                                 KYLE 
                        Hey baby!...Yeah, me and Pete are 
                        just chillin’ up in the room...Aw, I 
                        miss you too, baby.
                             (to Peter)
                        Kaylani says hi.
                             (then)
                        So do Kapono and Keanu.

           Peter nods...but finds the conversation hard to bear.  He 
           wanders out onto
           THE BALCONY

           It’s a beautiful night.  He looks at his own cell...but 
           doesn’t have anyone to call.  No one who’d want to hear from 
           him at least.

           After a conflicted beat, though, he dials someone anyway.   
           IT RINGS TWICE...AND GOES TO VOICEMAIL.

                                 ETHAN’S VOICE
                        Hey it’s Ethan.  You know what to do.
                             (BEEP)

                                 PETER
                             (awkward)
                        Hey buddy.  It’s me.  Dad.  Just... 
                        calling to say hey.  Uncle Kyle and I 
                        are in Miami, so...just figured I’d 
                        let you know.
                             (then, upbeat)
                        We’re about to meet our biological 
                        father, actually -- your grandpa.  
                        Turns out he wasn’t dead after all.
                             (then)
                        Turns out he’s Jack Tibbs, actually.  
                        The Hall of Fame football player.  
                        You might not know who that is, but 
                        he was like the Tom Brady of the 70s.  
                        Maybe you’ve seen him in those Rent-A-
                        Car commercials?   
                             (beat)
                        Anyways, I thought you’d get a kick 
                        out of that.  I know how much you’re 
                        into celebrities.    
                             (sitting down, like they’re 
                              having a conversation)
                        So what else are you into these days?  
                        Still playing the piano?  God, I’d 
                        love to hear you play again.  
                             (then, noticing the weather)
                        It’s really nice here.  Hey, maybe 
                        you and I could take a trip like this 
                        sometime.  Maybe we could--

                                 AUTOMATED WOMAN’S VOICE
                        You have exceeded the maximum message 
                        length.  Goodbye.

           And just like that, the “conversation” is over.  Peter 
           digests it.  How pathetic his life is.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE SPORTS AUTHORITY -- THE NEXT MORNING

           There’s a big sign out front indicating that NFL legend Jack 
           Tibbs is signing autographs today. 

           INT. THE SPORTS AUTHORITY -- DAY

           We find Peter & Kyle at the end of a long line of fans here 
           to see the guy, all holding memorabilia for him to sign.

           Peter struggles...but finally gets a view of --

           THE MAN HIMSELF -- JACK TIBBS -- holding court (much the same 
           way that Kyle captivated kids on the playground in the 
           opening scene).

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        So I said to Farrah, “I know you like 
                        polka dots, but trust me -- wear the 
                        red bathing suit.”  And you want to 
                        know what Miss Fawcett said to me?

           Everyone is dying to know.  Kyle especially.

                                 KYLE
                        Tell us, Jack!

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        She said, “Jack...I’d really like to 
                        have sex with you.” 

           Everyone dies laughing.  

                                 JACK TIBBS (CONT’D)
                        No, seriously, she said, “Jack... 
                        you’re absolutely right.”

           Everyone digests this.  Wow.

                                 JACK TIBBS (CONT’D)
                        And then she said we should fuck!

           Everyone dies laughing again.  Even the kids in line.  No 
           one’s offended.

           ON PETER, looking a little nervous.

                                 PETER
                        Hey, when we get up there...you do 
                        the talking.

                                 KYLE
                        What?  Why?
                                 PETER
                        Because people always like you.

                                 KYLE
                        People like you too.  I know I do.  
                        Hell, I fucking love you. 

           The guy in front of them gives them a homophobic look, but 
           Kyle is oblivious and smiles back...  

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, man.  How’s it goin’?

           Peter shakes his head.

                                 PETER
                        You love everyone.

                                 KYLE
                        Look, neither of us are gonna have to 
                        explain anything.  I’m telling you, 
                        he’s gonna take one look at us and 
                        know.  I’ve played this out in my 
                        head like two times.

           But Peter still looks worried.

           LATER

           Peter & Kyle finally make it to the signing table.  It’s a 
           tremendous moment for Peter.  36 years in the making.  

           Tibbs is all-smiles, just as he’s been for the other fans.  
           (NOTE: he’s definitely lightened up in his retirement -- 12 
           concussions can do that to a guy)

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Hey fellas.  How’s it going?

           Kyle beams back but, as planned, doesn’t say anything.  Just 
           waits for Tibbs to “see it”.  Which he doesn’t.  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                             (to Peter)
                        Is he okay?

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Tibbs, my brother is 
                        just...

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Oh.  You’re one of my “special” fans, 
                        aren’t you?

           Peter actually finds this amusing.  It relaxes him.
                                 PETER
                        No, he’s not retarded, sir.  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        No?

           Peter chuckles, but confirms it.  

           As Tibbs is looking at Peter, however, a strange feeling 
           comes over him.  He looks puzzled.

                                 JACK TIBBS 
                        Do I know you?  I mean...have we met?

                                 PETER
                        No.  Not that I know.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Are you sure?  You look really
                        familiar to me.

           Peter can hardly contain his glee.  Tries to keep cool.  

                                 PETER
                        Well...I think you knew my mother.  
                             (displays an old photo of her)

           Tibbs takes the photo...and is clearly affected by it (in a 
           good way).

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Helen Baxter.
                             (loses himself in the photo, then)
                        You’re Helen Baxter’s son?

           Peter smiles and nods, sharing a moment with the legend.  
           Kyle interjects --

                                 KYLE
                        I am too, sir.  We’re twins.

           Tibbs looks at Kyle briefly but returns to Peter.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        God, how is she?

                                 PETER
                        She’s good.  Different from how you 
                        remember her, probably.  

           As Tibbs returns to the photo...remembering the time they 
           spent together...he gradually comes to realize what’s going 
           on.  Why Peter is here.  Why they have a connection.
                                 JACK TIBBS
                        You’re my son, aren’t you?

           And the way Tibbs said it, it’s clear he views it as a good 
           thing.  Peter smiles big.

                                 PETER
                             (getting emotional)
                        I think so.  Yeah.  

           Tibbs gets emotional too.  Kyle again interjects --

                                 KYLE
                        I’m your son too.  We’re twins.  Not 
                        sure if you heard me say that before.

           Tibbs again barely acknowledges Kyle.  He turns to the Store 
           Manager.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Hey Phil, you mind if we cut this 
                        short?  I’ll come back next weekend.

           The manager is okay with it.  But as Tibbs gets up to leave, 
           his waiting fans GROAN.

                                 JACK TIBBS 
                        Hey, come on everybody, gimme a 
                        break.  I just found out I got a son.

                                 KYLE
                             (also addressing the crowd)
                        Two actually.  We’re both his sons.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I promise I’ll be back next weekend.

           The fans grudgingly accept this.

           EXT. THE SPORTS AUTHORITY -- DAY

           Kyle & a still-beaming Peter are in the parking lot, watching 
           Tibbs try to process it all.  He’s understandably blown away.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I had no idea she was even pregnant.  
                        You gotta believe me.  Helen never said 
                        anything.  One day we’re hanging out, 
                        partying like usual, the next day she 
                        just...vanished.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, no -- we know.  Please...don’t 
                        worry about it.  
                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I can’t believe this.  You’ve been 
                        out there the whole time...  
                             (then)
                        Jesus, I’m really getting emotional.  I 
                        mean, it’s not like I don’t already have 
                        a son.  I do.  Trent.  But he’s kind of 
                        a spoiled dick.

                                 PETER
                        So’s mine!

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Yeah?  

                                 PETER
                        Totally. 

           Kyle can see they have this connection...and it’s weird for 
           him.  At this point, though, he’s more confused than upset.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Hey, what are you guys doing now?  
                        You should come over for lunch.   

                                 PETER
                             (psyched)
                        Really?  We’d love that.  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        You drove, right?  Here, give me your 
                        phone, Pete, and I’ll plug in my address.  
                             (beat)
                        Or one of you can ride with me...

           Tibbs gestures to A BEAUTIFULLY RESTORED CLASSIC CORVETTE.  
           Peter’s eyes thrust wide when he sees it.

                                 PETER
                        You’ve got a ‘63 Split-Window ‘Vette?!  
                        That’s my all-time favorite car!

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Really?  That’s wild!  I know I probably 
                        shouldn’t be driving her around, but...

                                 PETER
                        Please.  You can’t keep a beast like  
                        that locked up in a garage.  Not driving 
                        a Corvette is like...not driving a 
                        Corvette!  It’s ridiculous!

           Tibbs beams and CHUCKS PETER THE KEYS.     
                                 PETER
                        No...I couldn’t.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Why not?  Donald can just follow us.

                                 KYLE
                             (finally getting a little annoyed)
                        It’s Kyle, actually.  My name.  

                                 PETER
                             (to Kyle)
                        Do you mind?

           Before he can even finish saying no, Peter & Tibbs are heading 
           to the car.  Being left out is a new experience for Kyle.

                                                                CUT TO:

           KYLE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE CORVETTE ON THE FREEWAY  

           He’s having a hard time, though, especially the way Peter is 
           passing cars, switching lanes...really experiencing the car.

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus, Pete, I’m in a Taurus here.

           INT. TIBBS’ CORVETTE (DRIVING) -- DAY

           Peter is on Cloud 9.

                                 PETER
                        Mr. Tibbs, this is...amazing.  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Call me Jack.  And feel free to give her 
                        some juice.  Really see what she can do.

                                 PETER
                        Okay!

                                                                CUT TO:

           KYLE’S POV:  AS THE CORVETTE ZOOMS OUT OF VIEW

                                 KYLE
                        And now they’re gone.  That’s great.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 KYLE 
                             (yelling over the traffic)
                        Pete, I lost you!  What exit do I take?!
           EXT. JACK TIBBS’ ESTATE -- DAY

           Peter & Tibbs have arrived at Tibbs’ oceanfront estate...and 
           have just parked the Corvette in his 10-car garage.  Peter’s 
           cell is at his ear, but Tibbs has all his attention.

                                 JACK TIBBS 
                        Wait -- so this prick’s throwing your 
                        son a Bar Mitzvah, and the kid’s not 
                        even Jewish?  That’s insane! 

                                 PETER
                        I know, right?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Sounds like my first wife’s husband.  
                        I call him Douche McGouche.

           Peter laughs.  Classic.

           EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- DAY

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, are you there?  Hello?

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

                                 PETER 
                             (returning to Kyle, annoyed)
                        Look, I’ll text you the address, 
                        alright.  Take a chill pill.

           Peter ends the call and angrily texts his brother.       

                                 JACK TIBBS
                             (chuckling)
                        Are you sure he’s not retarded?

           Peter gives Tibbs a “Tell me about it” look.

           INT. JACK TIBBS’ ESTATE -- DAY

           Peter is blown away by the amazing 20,000 square ft. mansion.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Karen!  I’m home!

           Tibbs’ wife calls back from another room --

                                 KAREN TIBBS (O.S.)
                        Wow, that was quick!  Did you pick up 
                        the fresh garlic I needed?   
                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Nope, sorry hon! I brought home 
                        something even better, though!  
                             (to Peter, excited)
                        I can’t wait to see the look on her 
                        face when we tell her.

           Pete is slightly more concerned.

                                 PETER
                        Are you sure she’s gonna be cool with it?

           As he gives Peter a “Please” look, HIS WIFE ENTERS IN AN APRON.

                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        What’d you pick up?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        A son!  His name is Peter!  Say hi, Pete.

                                 PETER
                        Hello Mrs. Tibbs.  It’s a pleasure to 
                        meet you.  You have a beautiful home.

           Karen looks back with an understandable amount of shock.   
           She is without words. 

                                 JACK TIBBS
                             (to Peter, loving it)
                        I told you this would be good.  Hon, 
                        your reaction is priceless.  Damn, I 
                        wish we were filming this. 

                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        This is a joke, right?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Nope.

           Beat.

                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        He’s your son?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        It sure seems like it.  His mother 
                        and I used to have unprotected sex 
                        back in the 70s.
                             (re: Peter’s look)
                        Don’t worry, Karen knows all about my 
                        crazy past.  Hell, she was a Solid Gold 
                        dancer herself!  Weren’t you, baby!

           Beat. 
                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        Can I have a word with you in the 
                        kitchen?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Sure thing.  Pete, just sit down, make 
                        yourself at home.  You want a drink?

                                 PETER
                        No, thanks -- I’m good.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I’ll make you a drink.

           Peter sits down on an uncomfortable chair in the foyer.  
           Doesn’t feel right entering the rest of the house.

           While he’s sitting there, though, 5 KIDS COME RUNNING IN 
           PLAYING FOOTBALL (3 BOYS, 2 GIRLS -- AGES 8 to 12).

           One of the girls (an adorable 9-yr-old) notices him.

                                 9-YR-OLD GIRL
                        Hey, there’s a strange man sitting 
                        over there.

           The other kids keep playing, but this little girl seems 
           intrigued by Peter.  He smiles and waves awkwardly.

                                 PETER
                        Hi, I’m Peter.

                                 9-YR-OLD GIRL
                        I’m Elizabeth.  Does Grandma Karen 
                        know you’re here?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I actually came with Jack -- 
                        well, Grandpa Jack.

                                 ELIZABETH/9-YR-OLD GIRL
                        Is he your Grandpa too?

           Peter chuckles.  She’s so cute.

                                 PETER
                        No.  He’s not.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How do you know him then?

                                 PETER
                        ...Well...I don’t know if I should be 
                        telling you this, but...I think he’s 
                        my father.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why shouldn’t you be telling me that?  
                        That would be awesome!  That would 
                        mean you’re my uncle, right?

                                 PETER
                        I guess it would.   

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ve only ever had one uncle.  Uncle 
                        Trent.  But he’s kind of a douche.  
                        You’re not a douche are you?

                                 PETER
                        I try not to be.

           She chuckles.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re funny.

                                 PETER
                        I am?

           She nods...but then laments --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Aw, I wish my mom was here to meet 
                        you too, but she had to fly back to 
                        San Jose for a few days.  That’s 
                        where we live.

                                 PETER
                             (after a beat)
                        You’re kidding, right?  I live in 
                        Sunnyvale.  That’s like...right next to 
                        San Jose!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I take ballet in Sunnyvale!  

                                 PETER
                        You do?  That’s crazy!  

           Before they can bond further, though, Jack returns.  He seems 
           a little dazed.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Wow.  She did not take the news like 
                        I thought she would.  She was 
                        actually kind of upset. 
                             (then)
                        She’ll come around, though, Pete.  
                        Don’t worry.
           Elizabeth runs to Tibbs and gives him a big hug.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Grandpa Jack!

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Hey sweetie.  Did you meet your Uncle 
                        Pete?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah!  He’s awesome!

           Jack’s wife then returns with a drink for Peter.  We can see 
           she’s still upset, but she’s trying to make the best of it 
           and be a good hostess.

                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        I hope you like daiquiris, Peter.  

                                 PETER
                        I do.  Thank you, Mrs. Tibbs.

                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        I’m sorry about before.  You 
                        just...caught me by surprise.

                                 PETER
                        I completely understand.  I was 
                        shocked too when my mother told me.

                                 KAREN TIBBS
                        Well, let’s just hope this is the 
                        last of your surprises today, Jack.  
                        Lunch should be ready soon.  

           As she returns to the kitchen, THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Little 
           Elizabeth opens it and finds KYLE STANDING THERE.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey little girl.

           Jack grimaces, realizing --

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I forgot to tell her about Donald.
                             (mulls it over, then)
                        We’ll wait till she’s finished cooking.  
                        Come on, let me give you guys a tour.

           As Tibbs leads the way, Kyle WHISPER-YELLS at his brother --

                                 KYLE
                        I can’t believe you left me.
                                 PETER
                        It’s not my fault you lost us.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s completely your fault.

                                 PETER
                        Look, we’ll talk about this later.

                                 JACK TIBBS (O.S.)
                        You coming, Pete?

                                 PETER
                        Be right there, Jack!

           Kyle just shakes his head.  His hurt feelings are finally 
           starting to show.

           EXT. TIBBS’ PRIVATE BEACH -- DAY

           Tibbs & the brothers are walking along the private beach 
           behind the mansion.  And, apparently, Tibbs is now relating 
           to Peter on a deeper level.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        You know something?  I had a colon 
                        cancer scare myself a few years ago.  

                                 PETER
                        Really?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Thank god I had a great GI doc.  I know 
                        you guys get a lot of shit, Pete -- in 
                        more ways than one -- but you picked a 
                        noble profession.  Noble as hell.

           Peter beams, not used to being respected.  Unfortunately, 
           Kyle redirects the conversation. 

                                 KYLE
                        Hey Jack, tell us more about our mom.  
                        What was she like back in the day?

           Clearly, it’s a topic Peter isn’t interested in discussing. 

                                 PETER
                        Jack, you really don’t need to go 
                        into detai--

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        God, your mother was something else.
                             (drifting off)
                        ...Nice, tight little ass...Hershey Kiss 
                        nipples...
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK TIBBS (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        You know, the kind you could just suck 
                        on for days...

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, we probably did.  Right Pete?  
                        When we were babies. 

           Peter just gives him a look.  “What’s wrong with you?”

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        But your mother was more than just a 
                        great ass and unbelievable tits.

           Peter is relieved to hear this.  That is, until Tibbs 
           finishes his thought.

                                 JACK TIBBS (CONT’D)
                        She also knew how to use them.  And 
                        that’s so rare with beautiful women.

                                 KYLE
                        It is, Pete.  He’s absolutely right.  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                             (chuckling)
                        I used to joke with Bruce Jenner that 
                        if “fucking” had been an Olympic 
                        event, your mother would have been 
                        the one on all the Wheaties boxes.       

                                 KYLE
                        Ha!  You hear that, Pete?  Ma would 
                        have won the Fucktathlon.

           Peter looks like he’s gonna be sick.  And Tibbs continues...

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I swear, some Sundays I couldn’t even 
                        think straight on the football field.  
                        Seriously.  That tongue practically 
                        cost us a Superbowl! 

           Peter tries to minimize his psychological trauma.

                                 PETER
                        But it wasn’t just a physical thing, 
                        right?  I’m sure you liked Mom as a 
                        whole too.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        She was more than just a hole, Peter.  
                        Helen Baxter was an amazing woman.  
                        You boys should be proud of her.
                                 KYLE
                             (putting an arm around his brother)
                        We are, sir.  We are.  

           Just then, TIBBS’ NEIGHBOR AND FORMER TEAMMATE, ROD HAMILTON 
           (think Samuel L. Jackson) CALLS FROM ACROSS THE SAND --

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Jack!  What’s goin’ on, man?!  We 
                        still on for golf tomorrow?! 

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Only if you feel like losing again!  
                        Hey, come on over!  

           As Rod approaches, Kyle recognizes...

                                 KYLE
                        Oh snap!  Is that Hall-of-Fame wide 
                        receiver Rod Hamilton?  You guys are 
                        neighbors? 

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I guess playing 10 seasons together 
                        wasn’t enough for this guy.  The 
                        bastard missed me so much, he moved 
                        in next door.

                                 ROD HAMILTON 
                        Don’t listen to him, fellas.  I told 
                        him about this beach a hundred times.  
                        Just ‘cuz he’s old as fuck and retired 
                        before me, he thinks he owns the place.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Ah, get out of here.  
                             (then)
                        Hey, does the name Helen Baxter ring 
                        a bell?

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Ring a bell?  It does more than ring a 
                        bell.  I think I just came in my pants!

           Tibbs and Hamilton share a laugh (Kyle joining in too).    
           And Rod goes on...  

                                 ROD HAMILTON (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn that woman could fuck.  I mean, 
                        I’ve been with, what, 400...500 women?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Conservatively.
                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        And no one -- I mean no one -- could 
                        take a dick like Helen Baxter. 

           Peter looks increasingly ready to vomit.  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Hey, do you remember the threesome we 
                        had in Atlantic City?

           Rod has to think back.

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        You sure that was me?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I thought it was.

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Nah...you’re probably thinking of Reggie.   

           Kyle interjects excitedly --

                                 KYLE
                        All Pro Tight End Reggie Harmon?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        You know something?  I think you’re 
                        right.  It was Reggie.  No--wait. Walt 
                        Johnson.  Walt always loved A.C.

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Right, ‘cuz all us black folk look alike.

           Rod gives Kyle & Peter a “Can you believe this guy?” look.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Come on, man.  Gimme a break. 

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Ah, you know I’m just breakin’ balls.
                        So what made you think of Helen?  I 
                        mean, besides your dick!

           Everyone except Peter laughs.  Still tickled, Kyle explains...

                                 KYLE
                        She’s our mother, actually.

           Despite Kyle’s comfort, Rod (unlike Jack) gets that it’s 
           wrong to be talking about banging a guy’s mother right in 
           front of him.  His face falls.    
                                 JACK TIBBS
                        No-no...it’s cool, Rod.  It turns out 
                        I’m their father.   

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                             (brightening)
                        Yeah?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        How wild is that?

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        That’s great, man.  Congratulations.  

           Jack puts an arm around each of his sons.  

           As Rod is taking in the trio, though, he seems to be noticing 
           something.  About Peter, in particular. 

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        What is it?  

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        No, it’s just...you know who he looks 
                        like?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Who?

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        You remember that Wall Street dude 
                        that used to follow us everywhere?  
                        Throwing his money around and shit?  

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        You mean Fuckface?  

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        No, not Fuckface. The other one.  
                        The one nobody liked.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Roland?

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Yeah, Roland!  This guy looks like a 
                        shorter, chubbier version of Roland. 

           Jack takes a good, long look at Peter and...although he hates 
           to admit it...

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        You’re right.  He does.
                                 PETER
                        Wait, no...I can’t look like--

                                 JACK TIBBS
                             (equally disappointed)
                        You do, Pete.  I’m sorry.  The 
                        eyes...the nose...

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        The mouth.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Yeah, the mouth too.

           Peter is unwilling to accept it.  Kyle, however, is curious.

                                 KYLE
                        And this Roland guy--

                                 JACK TIBBS
                             (remembering)
                        Roland Kemp.  That was his name.

                                 KYLE
                        He used to bang our mom too?

           Jack & Rod look at each other and reply simultaneously --

                                 JACK TIBBS/ROD HAMILTON
                        Definitely.

                                 PETER
                        But you said nobody liked him.  Why 
                        would she have slept with him?

                                 KYLE
                        Come on, bro.  You know how nice Mom is.  
                        She probably threw him a pity fuck.  That 
                        was probably like charity for her back 
                        then.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Plus, Roland always had the coke.  
                        And in the 70s, “The guy with the 
                        coke always got a poke”.

           Rod seems amused by this.

                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Was that an actual saying?

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I think so.  It should have been, at 
                        least.  
                                 ROD HAMILTON
                        Yeah, no, it makes sense.

           Peter looks absolutely crestfallen.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JACK TIBBS’ ESTATE -- DAY

           Jack is seeing the guys off.  He’s genuinely sad.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        I’m sorry you’re not my son, Pete.  
                        You too Donald.

           Peter does his best to accept it.  But it’s tough.  And 
           making it even harder...

           LITTLE ELIZABETH RUNS OVER TO SAY GOODBYE TOO.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Bye, Peter.  It was really nice 
                        meeting you.  I’d say we should hang 
                        out back in San Jose...but that’d 
                        probably be weird now, right?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  Probably.

           Jack tries to view the positive.

                                 JACK TIBBS
                        Hey, we had a great couple of hours, 
                        right?

           Peter nods.  But it’s little consolation.

                                 JACK TIBBS 
                        Say hi to your mother for me, okay?

                                 KYLE
                        We will.

           INT. PETER & KYLE’S RENTAL CAR -- DAY

           As Kyle drives them down Tibbs’ long driveway, Peter takes a 
           last look back at what could have been.  

           Kyle can tell this was tough for him.

                                 KYLE
                        You alright?
                             (not getting a response)
                        Hey...maybe you’ll get along even 
                        better with Roland.
           Peter half-laughs.  “Yeah right.”

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s possible, right?

                                 PETER
                        Look...I think we should just go home.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you kidding?

                                 PETER
                        You heard Jack.  Nobody even liked 
                        Roland.

                                 KYLE
                        So?  That was a long time ago.  
                             (beat)
                        Nobody liked Al Roker back in the 70s
                        and he went on to become our nation’s 
                        most beloved morning weather man.

           Peter just gives him a look.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Look, let’s at least Google the guy.  
                        See what he’s up to.
                             (with Peter still resistant)
                        Dude, you know you wanna know.  

           A beat.  Peter begrudgingly reaches for his iPad.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        That’s the spirit!  Grab that iPad!

           LATER

           Peter is reviewing the search results.

                                 PETER
                        Well, there are at least 6 “Roland 
                        Kemps” in the country.

                                 KYLE
                        Wow, just think, our last name could 
                        have been “Kemp”.  Kyle Kemp.  That 
                        actually sounds pretty good, right?  
                             (beat)
                        “The Honorable Kyle Kemp presiding”.

                                 PETER
                             (ignoring him, as usual)
                        Okay, here’s something.  There was a 
                        Roland Kemp who worked for the I-bank 
                        Hinley Taft back in the 70s.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        It says he was some kind of prodigy.  
                        Made his first million before he even 
                        turned 21.  

                                 KYLE
                        Does it say he was a wunderkind?  I 
                        fucking love that word.

                                 PETER
                        It does, actually.  It says that 
                        Roland was frequently referred to as 
                        a wunderkind.

                                 KYLE
                        Wow, really?

                                 PETER
                        No.

           Kyle just shakes his head.  

                                 KYLE
                        You know how gullible I am, dude.  
                        That’s not cool.

           Peter actually chuckles.

                                 KYLE
                        What else does it say?  For reals.

                                 PETER
                             (reading)
                        Well...he left Hinley Taft in ‘86... 
                        but there’s nothing after that.  It’s 
                        like he fell off the Earth.

                                 KYLE
                        Dang.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, wait.  Here’s something.  There’s 
                        a listing for a financial advisory 
                        firm called “Kemp and Associates”.  
                        It lists Roland as the principal.

                                 KYLE
                        Why would a financial advisory firm 
                        have a principal?  Are you sure it’s 
                        not a school?

                                 PETER
                        Principal also means owner.  

                                 KYLE
                        Oh.
                                 PETER
                        The website’s under construction... 
                        but there’s an address and a phone 
                        number.  It’s in Suffern, New York.

           From the two of them considering this --

           A PLANE LANDING AT JFK AIRPORT

           INT. JFK AIRPORT (NEW YORK) -- DAY

           Kyle & an annoyed Peter wheel their bags through the terminal.  

                                 PETER
                        I can’t believe you talked me into this.

                                 KYLE
                        Why not?  I’m very persuasive.  

                                 PETER
                        We’re not even sure he’s in New York.  
                        These finance guys travel all the time.
                             (beat)
                        And even if he is here, we’re not 
                        even sure he’s the right Roland.

           KYLE STOPS WALKING.  Peter doesn’t notice for a few paces... 
           but then turns around, impatient.  

           Kyle looks like he’s about to say something really important.

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, sometimes in life...you just 
                        need to do shit.

                                 PETER
                        That’s why you stopped walking?  To 
                        offer that pearl of wisdom?

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah.  I know I just made it up...but 
                        I think it’s pretty profound.

           Peter just shakes his head.  Idiot.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE GUYS GETTING INTO THEIR RENTAL CAR

           Kyle continues being optimistic.

                        Look, best case scenario, we meet this 
                        guy and he’s the dad we always wanted.  
                        Worst case scenario, we wind up driving 
                        this car off a cliff and die fiery 
                        deaths.  Either way, though, at least 
                        we fucking did shit, right?  

                                 PETER
                        Could we just not talk for a while?

                                 KYLE
                        Why?  You got a headache?

           Peter is behind the wheel, THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIRECTING 
           THEM TO SUFFERN.  

           Kyle is clearly bored.  

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, is your head feeling better?  
                        Can we start talking again?  

                                 PETER
                             (begrudgingly)
                        What would you like to talk about?

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t know.  
                             (searching for a topic)
                        What road is this?

                                 PETER
                        I-87.  The Thruway.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh yeah?  I’ve heard of that.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, it’s actually a pretty famous 
                        highway.  Apparently, it was built in 
                        the 1700s to help the Pilgrims smuggle 
                        monkeys into Canada.  

                                 KYLE
                        Seriously?  Wow.  I guess we’re 
                        really driving across history.

           Peter smiles to himself.  But after a few moments, Kyle 
           realizes --
                                 KYLE
                        Wait a second.  The Pilgrims didn’t 
                        even come to America until 1812.  
                        You’re such a dick.  

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I really am.  

           But Kyle takes it in stride.

                                 KYLE
                        No, you know what?  You got me again.  
                        You got me good, I’ll admit it.
                             (beat)
                        But just for that, I’m plugging in my 
                        iPod. It’s DJ Kyle on the 1 & 2’s, baby!

                        boom down!

           Peter looks ready to drive the car off the road.

                                 PETER
                        Do you only listen to white rappers?

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEW YORK -- DAY

           Peter and Kyle are now driving through the small town of 
           Suffern, New York.  

           INT. RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) -- DAY

           Peter surveys the town.  Nothing but small businesses...mom 
           and pop stores, etc.  Definitely not the kind of place you’d 
           expect to find a former Wall Street big swinging dick.

                                 PETER
                        This can’t be right. 

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, Navi knows what she’s doing.

                        See?

           Peter just shakes his head but adheres to the directions.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE RENTAL CAR ENTERING A DEVELOPMENT OF MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSES.

           INT. RENTAL CAR (DRIVING) -- DAY

           Peter looks increasingly skeptical as they pass 2-story 
           colonials...schoolkids playing football in the street... 

                                 NAVIGATION SYSTEM
                        Your destination is ahead on the right.

           Peter stops the car in front of AN AVERAGE-LOOKING HOME.  

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe it’s a satellite office. 
                             (off Peter’s look)
                        No?

           EXT. 2-STORY COLONIAL HOME -- DAY

           Kyle rings the doorbell.  No answer.  Rings again.  Still 
           nothing.
                                 PETER
                        Well, that was time well spent.

           Just as Peter is about to turn to leave -- THE DOOR OPENS AND   
           A TALL, SKINNY, BALD MAN ANSWERS, STILL IN HIS BATHROBE.

                                 ROLAND KEMP
                             (plainly)
                        What the fuck do you idiots want?

           Before they can even respond, he calls back into the house --

                                 ROLAND KEMP (CONT’D)
                        Susan!  There are two idiots here for 
                        you!
                             (explaining)
                        She’s always inviting idiots over.

           Kyle attempts to clarify.

                                 KYLE
                        We’re actually not idiots, sir.  
                        We’re actually--

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        Hel-lo!

           ...ROLAND’S CHEERFULLY OBLIVIOUS WIFE GREETS THEM.

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        Roland, you are such a bad host.  Why 
                        haven’t you invited our guests inside?

                                 ROLAND KEMP
                        Why would I invite these people into 
                        our home?  I have no idea who they are.  
                             (to the brothers)
                        You’ll have to excuse my wife.  She’s 
                        out of her fucking mind.

           Roland’s wife just gives him an “Oh you” look.

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        They’re here for my book club, Roland.  
                        You must be Connie’s friends.  

           Before Peter can correct her, Roland scoffs --

                                 ROLAND KEMP
                        “Book club”.  A weekly gathering of 
                        imbeciles is more like it.  Half of them 
                        are illiterate.  
                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        You boys are a little early.  The club 
                        doesn’t start for another 5 hours.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, we actually aren’t--

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        You’re welcome to join us for lunch, 
                        though. 

                                 ROLAND KEMP
                        Oh yes.  By all means join us.  What 
                        a treat this will be.  Sharing a meal 
                        with probable sociopaths.

           Roland just walks off into the house, resigned to the idea.

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        Come on in!

           Kyle starts to do so, but Peter stops him.

                                 PETER
                        Would you give us a minute, Mrs. Kemp?  
                             (waits for her to leave, then)
                        There’s no way this jerk is our father!  
                        I look nothing like him!

                                 KYLE
                        You’re kidding, right?  That guy’s you in 
                        25 years.  The resemblance is uncanny.  
                        The eyes...the nose...

                                 PETER
                        Are you trying to piss me off right now?  
                        Is that what you’re doing?

                                 KYLE
                        No.  
                             (beat)
                        Look, he probably just takes a while to 
                        warm up to people.  Just like you!  
                        Let’s at least give him a chance.

           As Kyle heads on into the house, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FOURSOME HAVING LUNCH IN THE DINING ROOM

           Peter is more than a little uncomfortable.  And the fact that 
           Roland is staring daggers at him while he eats isn’t helping.

           Kyle, on the other hand, is being a good guest.
                                 KYLE
                        Mmm, this is excellent, Mrs. Kemp.  
                        It’s meat, is it not? 

                                 MRS. KEMP
                        It is.  I’m so glad you like it.  

                                 ROLAND
                        Yes, she’s an amazing cook, my wife.  
                        I never thought I’d miss prison food
                        until we got married.

                        Oh, you were in prison?

           Roland’s wife grows nostalgic.

                                 SUSAN
                        That’s where we met, actually.  I was 
                        visiting my father -- who had been 
                        convicted of arson, of course.

                                 KYLE
                        Of course.

                                 SUSAN
                        ...When I locked eyes with this tall 
                        drink of water.    
                             (beat)
                        Do you remember what you were doing 
                        time for, baby?

                                 ROLAND
                        Gee, let me think...

                                 SUSAN
                             (like it’s a happy memory)
                        Embezzlement.     

           Peter just shakes his head.  Keeps getting worse.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        It was love at first sight.

           Roland just tries to ignore her.

                                 SUSAN
                             (getting up)
                        Would anyone like more meat?

                        I’d love some, ma’am, thank you.

           Once she leaves, Peter decides he’s reached his limit.
                                 PETER
                        Yeah, this was a mistake.

                                 KYLE
                        What my brother is trying to say, Mr. 
                        Kemp, is that we’re not actually here 
                        for your wife’s book club.  

                                 ROLAND
                             (indifferent)
                        Oh no?

                        We think we might be your sons.

           Roland stops chewing.  He looks more pissed than surprised.

                        What’s the take?  This is a con, 
                        right?  You guys are a couple of 
                        matchstick men.

                                 PETER
                             (just looking to get this over with)
                        Our mother is Helen Baxter.  Jack 
                        Tibbs said you used to “know” her.

           Peter hands Roland A PHOTO OF THEIR MOTHER.  

           Roland examines it, and it’s clear he remembers her.  In 
           fact, after a few beats...he actually grows wistful.  The 
           first sign of humanity he’s exhibited.

           Kyle gives his brother an encouraged look. 

                                 ROLAND 
                        ...God, she was something else...

                             (bracing himself)
                        Here we go.

                                 ROLAND
                        Here we go, what?
                                 PETER
                        Go ahead and describe what a great fuck 
                        she was.  How amazing her nipples were... 
                        How she could have won a “fucktathlon”...

           Roland looks back at Peter, disgusted.

                                 ROLAND
                        What the hell is wrong with you?  
                        This is your mother.

                                 KYLE
                        Pete’s just overtired.  It’s been an 
                        emotional trip.

           Roland keeps an eye on Peter as he returns to the photo.  
           Once he’s refocused on it, though, he confesses...

                                 ROLAND
                        Helen Baxter was the only woman I’ve 
                        ever loved.

                        but it’s great for us!

                                 ROLAND
                        The only woman who ever understood me.

                        Aww. See, Pete, he’s a sweetheart. 

                                 ROLAND
                        I hate to burst your bubble, though,     
                        but I couldn’t possibly be your father.

                                 KYLE
                        Why not?

                                 ROLAND
                        As much as I cared for your mother, she 
                        and I never did anything that could have 
                        resulted in pregnancy.

           Peter can’t help but feel relieved.

                                 PETER
                        So you two never hooked up?

                                 KYLE
                        No dude...I think he’s implying that 
                        he only buttfucked her.

                        Or that they just went down on each 
                        other.  Right, Roland?

                                 ROLAND
                        Well, I was trying to be a gentleman 
                        about it.

           PETER GETS UP TO LEAVE, but Kyle stops him.  

                                 KYLE
                        Pete, hold on.
                             (then)
                        Roland, how can you be so sure?  This 
                        was, what, 60 years ago?

                                 ROLAND
                        Have you ever heard of the term “vagina-
                        graphic memory”?

           Apparently, Kyle has.  

                                 KYLE
                        No...you?

                                 ROLAND
                             (proudly)
                        I can remember every vagina I’ve ever 
                        been in.  Since I’m 13.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m certain I was never inside your 
                        mother’s.  Not with my penis, at least.

           Kyle is more than a little impressed.

                                 KYLE
                        Wow.  A vagina-graphic memory.  I 
                        thought that was just a myth.

                                 ROLAND
                        No, it’s real.  It’s very real.  

           Kyle is pleased to hear it.  But something still bugs him.

                                 KYLE
                        What about the resemblance, though?  
                        You and Pete are like...goppeldangers.

                                 PETER
                        He means doppelgangers.  And he’s 
                        insane.  We look nothing alike.

           Roland is inclined to agree.
                                 ROLAND
                        Yeah, he looks more like a Dr. Seuss
                        character.    

           Kyle looks at his brother.

                                 KYLE
                        You do, actually.  The Mayor of Whoville.  
                        God, I can’t believe I never noticed 
                        that.  Good call, Roland!

                                 ROLAND
                             (looking at Kyle)
                        You remind me of someone, though.  

                                 KYLE
                        I do?  An actual person?  

                                 ROLAND
                        ...Yeah...you kind of look like this 
                        schmuck your mother and I used to party 
                        with.  A mutant version of him, at least.  

                                 KYLE
                        Did he fuck her too?

                                 ROLAND
                        Yeah, a lot.  
                             (beat)
                        Dammit, what was that schmuck’s name?   

                                 KYLE
                        If he had a vagina, you’d remember it.

           Kyle looks a little deflated until he notices the photo of 
           their mom and GETS AN IDEA!

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hey Roland -- do you have any photos?  
                        You know, from your party days?  Maybe 
                        we’d find a clue.  Something to jog your 
                        memory.  

           Roland isn’t generally one for helping...BUT WHEN HE HEARS 
           HIS WIFE GREETING SOME OF HER IDIOT BOOK CLUB FRIENDS AT THE 
           DOOR, he welcomes the escape. 

           ROLAND’S STUDY

           Roland pulls out A PHOTO ALBUM and begins flipping through 
           IMAGES OF HIS CRAZY PAST.  Partying at Studio 54...hobnobbing 
           with celebs (many of whom don’t seem to want him around)...
                                 KYLE
                        Oh snap, is that Liza Minelli? Is 
                        that you snorting cocaine off Liza 
                        Minelli’s ass?

           Roland beams proudly.  Peter, however, points out --

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I’m pretty sure that’s a guy.  

                                 KYLE
                        Get out of town.

                                 PETER
                        You can see his ballsack. Look.

           Kyle and Roland look where Peter is pointing.  Apparently, 
           he’s right.  Kyle feels bad.

                                 KYLE
                        It’s still pretty cool, Roland.

           Roland finally turns to A PHOTO OF A 20-SOMETHING, SHIRTLESS, 
           MUSTACHIOED MAN ON ROLLER SKATES (disco perm and all).

                                 ROLAND
                        Remind you of anyone?

           Kyle is blown away (despite there being little to no real 
           resemblance).

                                 KYLE
                        ...Jesus, it’s like looking at a 
                        young me...

           This annoys Peter to no end.

                                 PETER
                        You’re kidding me, right?  You look 
                        nothing like this person.  Not even a 
                        mutant version of him.  

           Kyle isn’t listening, though.  

           He’s captivated by the man.  Flips the page and finds another 
           snapshot -- this one of THEIR MOTHER WITH AN ARM AROUND EACH 
           OF ROLAND AND THE MUSTACHIOED ROLLER-SKATER.  

           There’s even a handwritten note beneath it that reads:    
           “Hey Rollerdick, who took my blow????”

           It seems to be jogging Roland’s memory.  
                                 KYLE
                        Roland, what is it?  Is the note jogging 
                        your memory?  It seems to be jogging it.  
                        Pete, check out Roland’s face.

                                 ROLAND
                        Rollerdick...That’s what I used to 
                        call him...    
                             (wheels turning)
                        ...His real name was something 
                        like... 

                                 KYLE
                             (on the edge of his seat)
                        What was it, Ro? What was his real name?

                                 ROLAND
                        It was a mick name...like Aidan...or 
                        Padraig.  No--wait, Dermot.  Dermot 
                        McCutchen.

           Kyle whips around to his brother --

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, we’re Irish!  We’re fucking

           Peter is indifferent, of course, not believing the guy is 
           their father.

                        I wonder what became of him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE TRIO IN FRONT OF ROLAND’S COMPUTER, WATCHING A YOUTUBE 
           CLIP ENTITLED: “GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN GETS HIT BY BIRD”

           ON SCREEN: Governor Dermot McCutchen (now perm & mustache-
           less) is addressing the graduating class at Boston University.

                                 GOVERNOR DERMOT MCCUTCHEN
                        And it is only by having the courage 
                        of your convictions that change is--  

           WHEN A BIRD FLIES INTO HIS HEAD, KNOCKING HIM OFF THE PODIUM.

           KYLE DIES LAUGHING.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh my god, that is hilarious!  Dude, 
                        we need to play that shit again.

                                 PETER
                        We’ve already watched it four times. 
           But Kyle is already replaying the clip.  

           And, this time, even Roland can’t help but chuckle.  Peter is 
           apparently the only one who doesn’t see the humor.  

                                 KYLE
                        Bro, if you can’t appreciate a bird 
                        flying into a guy’s head...why live?  
                        Seriously.  

                                 ROLAND
                        He has a point.

                                 KYLE
                        And Roland’s a miserable fuck!  What 
                        does that make you, Pete?  
                             (honestly worried)
                        What does that make you?

           EXT. THE KEMP’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Peter waits impatiently by the rental car while Kyle says 
           goodbye to Roland and his still-oblivious wife.

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        Oh, I just hate that you’re going to 
                        miss the book club.  Promise you’ll 
                        come to next week’s meeting.

                                 KYLE
                        I can’t make that promise, Mrs. Kemp.    
                        I live in Hawaii.

           But Roland assures him...

                                 ROLAND
                        She won’t shut up until you promise.  
                        Trust me.

           Kyle sees Mrs. Kemp is still looking at him, hopeful.  

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, I promise I’ll come.

                                 SUSAN KEMP
                        Oh that’s wonderful!

           Peter calls from the car --

                                 PETER
                        Kyle, come on!  It’s getting late!

           Kyle and Roland exchange a look.
           INT. RENTAL CAR -- DAY

           Kyle is hardly in the car when Peter starts pulling out.

                                 KYLE
                        Wow, somebody’s in a hurry to get to 
                        Boston.

                                 PETER
                        We’re not going to Boston.  We’re 
                        going home.

                                 KYLE
                        But back there you said we should go 
                        to Boston to meet our Dad.

                                 PETER
                        He’s not our Dad.  You guys look 
                        nothing alike.  I only said that so 
                        we could get out of there.

                                 KYLE
                        Aw, man, seriously?  You played me again?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  I played you again.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re really ready to give up?  
                        After all we’ve been through?  

                                 PETER
                        Mom was right.  We should have never 
                        even started this.  

                                 KYLE
                        Come on, Boston’s only like a 3 hour 
                        drive.  Let’s at least go meet the guy.  
                             (beat)
                        Look, even if you’re right and I don’t
                        look like him, there’s still a chance
                        he’s our Dad.  He did fuck mom, right?   

           Peter doesn’t answer.  Just keeps driving.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        How about this.  Come with me to 
                        Boston...and if Rollerdick doesn’t
                        turn out to be our Dad, I promise 
                        I’ll let this go.  

           Beat.

                                 PETER
                        You promise you’ll let it go.
                                 KYLE
                        Scout’s honor.   
                             (beat)
                        But you know something?  You might 
                        not want to let it go.  After all, if 
                        Roland’s not our dad and Rollerdick’s
                        not our dad...what’s to say Jack 
                        Tibbs isn’t still in the running?

           Peter considers this.  He won’t admit it out loud, of course, 
           but Kyle has a point.  

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m right, right? See?  You need to 
                        look at the bright side for once.   
                        Your attitude sets your altitude, bro.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE BROTHERS DRIVING TO BOSTON

           And initially it’s without drama.  Granted, they’re forced to 
           stop at A GAS STATION so Kyle’s bladder doesn’t explode...but 
           Peter uses the time to grab snacks.  The first real hiccup 
           they encounter is TRAFFIC GETTING BACK ON THE HIGHWAY.   

                                 PETER
                        I knew we shouldn’t have stopped.

                                 KYLE
                        You heard Navi -- the next rest area 
                        wasn’t for another 10 miles.  No way 
                        I’d have made that.  You’d be covered 
                        in piss right now.

           Kyle (who’s now driving) then notices something up ahead --     

           A SKETCHY-LOOKING MALE HITCHHIKER, not having any luck.   

                                 KYLE
                        Poor guy.  No one’s even hearing him out.

                                 PETER
                             (knows where this is going)
                        No.  It’s not happening.  We’re not 
                        picking up a hitchhiker.

                                 KYLE
                        Come on, you don’t even know where 
                        he’s going.

                                 PETER
                        That’s not the point.  
                                 KYLE
                        What’s he gonna do?  Rape us?  Kill 
                        us?  Rob us?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  All of the above.  Look at him.  

                                 KYLE
                        I had no idea you were so prejudiced.

                                 PETER
                        Against guys who look exactly like 
                        serial killers?  Yes, I’m prejudiced.  

                                 KYLE
                        But that’s how we know he’s harmless.  
                        He looks too much like a serial killer 
                        to actually be one.  You show me two 
                        hot blondes with big tits looking for a 
                        ride, though...

                                 PETER
                        And you’d pick them up too.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they 
                        tried to kill us.  I’d be ready for it.     

           Peter just shakes his head.  And as they roll closer to the 
           hitchhiker, KYLE STARTS LOWERING PETER’S WINDOW.

                                 PETER
                        I’m serious, Kyle.  If he gets in, I get 
                        out.

                                 KYLE
                        Let’s just hear his story. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                             (appearing in Peter’s window)
                        Hey, thanks so much for stopping, you 
                        guys.  Even if you don’t decide to give 
                        me a ride.  The gesture means a lot.

                                 KYLE
                        No problem.  Let me guess, car trouble?  

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Actually, I was trying to go green.  
                        Hopped on a bus to Worcestor -- hoping to 
                        make it home for my kid’s birthday -- but 
                        the driver started telling these really
                        racist jokes.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HITCHHIKER (CONT'D)
                        I asked her to stop, but the passengers 
                        were all enjoying them, so she wouldn’t.  
                        Ultimately, I decided to get off.

                                 KYLE
                        You did the right thing, man.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Unfortunately, the right thing isn’t 
                        always the easy thing.

           Kyle nods.  So true.  He clearly wants to help the guy...but 
           Peter is vehemently mouthing “No”.  

                                 KYLE
                             (humoring Peter)
                        Sir, are you a serial killer?  My brother 
                        here is worried that you are.  
                             (beat)
                        Clearly, he’s not without his own 
                        prejudices.  

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Hey, no, I completely understand.  You 
                        gotta be careful these days.  But I 
                        promise I’m not a serial killer.

           PETER GLARES AT KYLE.  And even Kyle has to acknowledge...

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, you just emphasized the word 
                        “serial”...which makes it seem like you 
                        are a killer.  Just not a “serial” one.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Oh my god, did I?  I swear, that was 
                        totally unintentional. 

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, it’s also kind of weird that 
                        you didn’t just say, “I promise I’m 
                        not a killer”.  It seems like that’s 
                        what a non-killer would have said. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                             (disappointed in himself)
                        Dammit!  You’re right.  God, I totally 
                        messed this up.  I’m such an idiot.    

           Kyle starts to feel bad for the guy again, though.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, come on.  Don’t do that.  Look,   
                        how about this.  We’ll give you a ride-- 
                                 PETER
                        Are you fucking crazy?!

                                 KYLE
                        You didn’t let me finish, Pete.  
                        We’ll give him a ride...BUT -- big 
                        “but” here -- only if he lets us tie 
                        him up.  That way he can’t rob, kill 
                        or rape us.

           Peter can’t believe his brother.  That he’d be willing to go 
           through all that trouble just to give this guy a ride.  The 
           hitchhiker, on the other hand, is impressed.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        I like it.  It’s an elegant solution 
                        to a difficult dilemma.

                                 KYLE
                        It is, right?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        But wait -- what if you guys are 
                        killers?  I’d be a sitting duck.  

                                 KYLE
                        Good point.  Guess that’s just a risk 
                        you’re gonna have to be willing to take.  

           From the hitchhiker thinking it over, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER IN THE DRIVE

           With Kyle still at the wheel, WE FIND THE HITCHHIKER RIDING 
           SHOTGUN, HIS UPPER BODY BOUND WITH A COMBINATION OF HIS OWN 
           JACKET AND A FEW OF THOSE P90X WORKOUT BANDS.  

           Peter is in the backseat, still in disbelief.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you okay?  The bands aren’t too 
                        tight, right?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Oh no.  I’m fine, thanks.  Hey, do 
                        you get a good workout with these?

                                 KYLE
                        They’re okay.  I take’em along when I 
                        travel, but it’s more psychological.  
                        I just hate feeling like I haven’t 
                        worked out.  You know?
                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Oh, totally.

                                 KYLE
                        Came in handy this trip, though, right?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        I’ll say!

           Just then, KYLE’S “ME SO HORNY” RINGTONE GOES OFF AGAIN.  

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, it’s Kaylani!  Pete, would you  
                        grab my phone out of my pocket?

                                 PETER
                        Why can’t you get it?

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, you know I always keep both 
                        hands on the wheel when I drive.

                                 PETER
                        Since when?  In high school you used to 
                        keep the wheel steady with your dick.

                                 KYLE
                        Bro, I got kids now.  I’m not the same 
                        carefree guy you grew up with.  I have 
                        responsibilities.

           Peter rolls his eyes.  “Yeah right”.

                                 KYLE
                        Damn -- it stopped ringing.

                                 PETER
                             (impersonating Kyle)
                        “Hey, look at the bright side, bro”.
                        Maybe she’ll think you’re busy banging 
                        another woman and love you even more.

           The hitchhiker notices...

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Whoa.  I am sensing a very disturbing 
                        vibe here.  Peter, are you upset with 
                        your brother about something?

           Peter tries to ignore the guy.

                                 HITCHHIKER (CONT’D)
                        Because I notice a lot of hostility 
                        emanating from you.
                                 KYLE
                        Ah, he’s probably just upset that we 
                        picked you up.  
                             (beat)
                        And that we’re going to Boston.  
                             (beat)
                        And that his marriage fell apart.   
                             (beat)
                        And that his son’s having a Bar Mitzvah.
                             (beat)
                        And that--

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        No, I’m sensing hostility toward you in 
                        particular, Kyle.  You don’t feel it?
                             (beat)
                        It’s like there’s this rage pulsing 
                        through his entire body.  

           Kyle glances at Peter through the rear view mirror.  

                                 KYLE
                        Is that what’s going on here, Pete?  

           And their banter is clearly only making Peter angrier.

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        I really think it is, Kyle.  Look, 
                        his face is filling with blood.

                                 KYLE
                        Pete, you okay?  You want me to open 
                        the window?

                                 HITCHHIKER
                             (like a therapist)
                        Peter, do you begrudge your brother’s 
                        happiness for some reason?

           PETER FINALLY EXPLODES --

                                 PETER
                        YOU’RE DAMN RIGHT I DO!  He’s done 
                        NOTHING to deserve it!
                             (beat)
                        The way he’s lived, he should be dead
                        or in prison -- not a millionaire 
                        living in Hawaii with his perfect wife 
                        and his perfect kids and his goddamn
                        BBQ sauce fortune even though he has 
                        NOTHING to do with the fucking sauce!  
                        Even though the image on the bottle 
                        could be of LITERALLY anyone!
           Kyle is clearly hurt.  HE ACTUALLY PULLS THE CAR ONTO THE 
           SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY.  

           He just sits there a long beat, before asking...

                                 KYLE
                        Is that why you’ve been avoiding me 
                        all these years?  Why you “couldn’t 
                        make it” to my wedding...or the 
                        births of my children?

           Peter’s silence gives Kyle his answer.   

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Peter, it’s not Kyle’s fault he’s 
                        been fortunate.

                                 PETER
                        Oh whatever!  He’s been rubbing it in 
                        my face his whole life!

                                 KYLE
                        Like when?!

                                 PETER
                        You screwed every girl I liked in 
                        high school!

           Kyle considers this.

                                 KYLE
                        That’s only because I screwed every 
                        girl who went to our high school.  It 
                        wasn’t to hurt you.

                                 PETER
                        Bullshit!  You knew I was in love 
                        with Pamela Hartley and you still
                        screwed her!

                                 KYLE
                        Pamela who?

           And the fact that Kyle doesn’t even remember her only 
           increases Peter’s rage.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m sorry I don’t have a vagina-
                        graphic memory like Roland.  What do 
                        you want from me?  

           Peter is fed up AND GETS OUT OF THE CAR.  
           Kyle looks to the hitchhiker.  “What the fuck?”

                                                                CUT TO:

           PETER FUMING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

           Kyle appears beside him.

                                 KYLE
                        Look, I’m sorry I fucked her.  Is 
                        that what you want me to say?

                                 PETER
                        Just once I wish you knew what it was 
                        like to be me.  To not have things go 
                        your way.  To be miserable.    

                                 KYLE
                        Come on, man.  Is it really that bad?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  It really is.  And having you 
                        as a brother only makes it worse.

           This is like a knife in Kyle’s heart.

                                 KYLE
                        Fuck.  That sucks.

           Peter agrees.  It does suck.

           Just then, THE HITCHHIKER JOINS THEM, HIS UPPER-BODY STILL 
           BOUND. 

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Guys, I’m really sorry.  I feel 
                        responsible for this.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, well, you are.

           The hitchhiker accepts this.  But he also notes --

                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Brothers are supposed to fight, though, 
                        right?  It’s in our genetic code.  
                             (beat)
                        Look at the Bee Gees...the Jacksons... 
                        the Osmonds...Cain & Abel...

                                 KYLE
                        Mario & Luigi?
                                 HITCHHIKER
                        Exactly.  Do you know how much I wish 
                        my brother was still alive to fight 
                        with?  I’d give anything for that.

           There’s an awkward moment until the guy clarifies --

                                 HITCHHIKER (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t kill him.  He died of 
                        leukemia when I was nine.
                             (beat)
                        Now come on.  Shake hands and let’s 
                        get back in the car.

           Peter and Kyle look at each other.  

           Kyle extends his hand...and Peter begrudgingly takes it.    
           An uneasy truce.

           As the guys walk back, Kyle can’t help but wonder...

                                 KYLE
                        How’d you get out of the car?  Your feet? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           PETER & KYLE DROPPING THE HITCHHIKER OFF AT HIS HOME.

           The brothers watch from the car as the guy’s wife & kids 
           greet him on the lawn.  It’s touching.  Peter finally 
           concedes --

                                 PETER
                        Alright, maybe he wasn’t a serial killer.

                                 KYLE
                        Really?  I’m kind of leaning the other 
                        way now.  Something about this house...  

           Peter just gives Kyle a look as he puts the car into drive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PETER & KYLE DRIVING INTO BOSTON

           Kyle is still riding shotgun and he’s psyched re: everything 
           they pass (whether it has significance or not).

                                 KYLE
                        Beantown, baby!  Beantown!

           Peter, of course, is slightly less excited.
           INT. THE LENOX HOTEL -- EVENING

           Peter & Kyle are checking in at the front desk.  Kyle can 
           tell his brother doesn’t want to be here.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey, thanks for humoring me on this. 

                                 PETER
                        I’m not humoring you.  Given your luck, 
                        I’m sure this guy is our father.  And 
                        I’m sure he’s gonna love you.  

                                 KYLE
                        He’s gonna love us, dude.  Us.

           Peter nods.  But he clearly isn’t hopeful.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           While Peter is soaking in the bathtub, a wet washcloth draped 
           over his face...

           REVEAL: KYLE IS ON THE TOILET...USING PETER’S IPAD.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, so...according to the Governor’s 
                        website, there’s been a schedule 
                        change.  He’s making an appearance 
                        tomorrow morning at an elementary 
                        school in Dorchester.  Apparently, some 
                        kids just won an award.  

                                 PETER
                             (with the washcloth still on his face)
                        Please tell me you’re not taking a shit. 

                                 KYLE
                        Beantown, baby!  Beantown!  

           On command, HE RIPS TWO FARTS (complete with “trucker honk” 
           arm gesture).  

           PETER CHUCKS THE WASHCLOTH AT HIM.

                                 PETER
                        GET OUT!!!  I’m serious!  God, it’s like 
                        you’re twel--
                             (then, smelling it)
                        Oh...God...I can taste it...

           Kyle dances from the throne.  Raise the roof, etc.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DORCHESTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- THE NEXT MORNING

           Governor McCutchen is finishing up a speech to an assembly of 
           4th graders.  Despite his audience, he’s still incredibly
           engaged & passionate (think Bill Clinton’s charisma and Mitt 
           Romney’s looks). 

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        You see...America is only as great as 
                        its citizens require it to be.  How 
                        great do you want it to be?

           The kids aren’t sure how to respond.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Come on, how great do you want 
                        America to be?

           KYLE CALLS OUT FROM THE BACK --

                                 KYLE
                        Really great, sir!

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Alright, that’s the spirit!  

           ON KYLE, captivated by the Governor.

                                 KYLE
                        I know why that bird hit him in the head, 
                        Pete.  It just wanted to be near him.  
                             (beat)
                        It just wanted to be near him.

           Peter rolls his eyes.

           LATER

           With his speech over, the Governor is glad-handing parents & 
           teachers, taking photos, etc.

           Kyle & Peter try navigating thru the sea of kids, but it’s 
           tougher than you’d think.  

                                 PETER
                        Look, we should probably just try 
                        setting a meeting through his office.

                                 KYLE
                        That’s crazy, dude.  He’s right here.
                             (calling out)
                        Governor McCutchen! Governor McCutchen!  
                        Look at my face, sir!  Look at my face!
           FROM GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN’S P.O.V., HOWEVER, KYLE LOOKS LIKE A 
           COMPLETE NUTJOB.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Does it look familiar?!  Look closely, 
                        sir!  Are you seeing it yet?!
                             (beat)
                        I’m worried you’re not seeing it!

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           where Peter & Kyle are sitting side-by-side (much like when 
           they were kids).  Apparently, MCCUTCHEN’S SECURITY is holding 
           them here until they can be questioned.  Peter is fuming.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, look, I’ll admit my actions 
                        were ill-advised.

                                 PETER
                        They weren’t advised, idiot.  You 
                        just did whatever you felt like 
                        doing.  Like you always do.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah and that usually works out great  
                        for me.  Hey, maybe I should be pissed at 
                        you.  You know, for fucking up my mojo. 
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I should stop being such a goddamn
                        sweetheart all the time!

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, maybe you should.

           GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN AND HIS TWO ADVISORS ENTER.

                                 PETER
                        Governor McCutchen, please excuse my 
                        brother’s--

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                             (directed at Kyle)
                        Who sent you?

                                 KYLE
                        Well, technically, Roland sent us.  
                        Roland Kemp.

           Beat.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        And how do you know him?
                                 KYLE
                        Well, we thought he was our father.  
                        Well, first we thought Jack Tibbs 
                        was...then Roland.  But now you, sir. 
                             (beat)
                        That’s what I was trying to tell you 
                        out there.  
                             (like it’s something magical)
                        You used to fuck our mother.  

                                 PETER
                        Her name was Helen Baxter, sir.  

                                 KYLE
                        You knew her back when you were 
                        Rollerdick. Show him the photo, Pete.

           Peter hands over THE PHOTO OF THEIR MOTHER WITH HER ARMS 
           AROUND A SHIRTLESS, DISCO-PERMED MCCUTCHEN AND ROLAND.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Helen Baxter is your mother?

           The Governor and his CHIEF OF STAFF (male, 60’s) share a 
           brief look.

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  See, she told us our father was 
                        a bicycle salesman who died before we 
                        were born...

                                 KYLE
                        But he wasn’t a bicycle salesman.  He 
                        was you.  I can feel it in my bones, 
                        sir.  Can’t you feel it in yours?

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           McCutchen and his two advisors are discussing the situation.  
           His DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF (female, 30’s) suspects...

                                 DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF
                        It’s a set-up.  Someone from Kellerman’s
                        camp must have sent them.  The photo is 
                        obviously doctored.  
                             (beat)
                        Right?  

           But McCutchen and his Chief of Staff share another knowing 
           look.  McCutchen concedes...
                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        The photo’s legit.    
                             (then, with difficulty)
                        You see, Jessica, for a brief period 
                        in the 70s...I went a little bonkos.

           His Chief of Staff puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        We all did, sir.  

           Jessica can’t believe what she’s hearing.

                                 JESSICA/DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Jesus.  You mean...you really were
                        Rollerdick?  

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Rollerstud, actually.  It was a nod 
                        to my unparalleled sexual and skating 
                        abilities.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        You should have seen this man skate, 
                        Jessica.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                             (nostalgic)
                        You should have seen me fuck.

           Jessica’s disbelief continues.

                                 JESSICA/DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF
                        So those two idiots might actually be 
                        your sons?

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        I’m afraid so.  I banged their mother 
                        a lot.  

                                 JESSICA/DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Well, we’re fucked.  We’re completely--

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Look, let’s not get carried away.  We 
                        have no reason to think these guys are 
                        looking to cause trouble.  My advice, 
                        sir, is to play nice.  At least until 
                        we know what we’re dealing with.  

           The Governor agrees.

           INT. THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Peter looks ready to strangle his brother.
                                 PETER
                        I swear, if you get us killed...

                                 KYLE
                        They’re not gonna kill us.  They’re 
                        Republicans.  Republicans don’t kill 
                        wealthy white dudes.  

                                 PETER
                        First of all, I’m not wealthy.  You 
                        are.  And second of all, they don’t 
                        know you’re wealthy.  Right?

           As Kyle considers this (finding it a little troubling),  
           GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN AND HIS ADVISORS RETURN.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Gentlemen, I-- 

                                 KYLE
                        We’re very wealthy, sir.  I just think 
                        you should know that before you decide 
                        anything.  

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Okay, that’s...good to know.  
                             (then, turning on the charm)
                        Look, I just wanted to apologize about 
                        before.  You caught me by surprise.
                             (beat)
                        After all, the 70s wasn’t exactly my 
                        finest decade.

                                 PETER
                        Governor McCutchen, let me assure you 
                        we have no intention of telling anyone 
                        anything about your past.  We’re 
                        honestly just looking to know if...

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        I’m your father.  Hey, I get it.  
                        It’s nice to know who your father is.  
                             (beat)
                        Unless, of course, he’s a belligerent 
                        drunk like mine.  

           They all share a laugh.  Peter & Kyle have definitely relaxed.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Look, how about this?  Why don’t you guys 
                        come back to my house.  That way, we can 
                        do a paternity test in private.  
                             (to his Deputy Chief of Staff)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN (CONT'D)
                        Jessica, would you see if Dr. Grant 
                        is available today?
                             (back to the guys)
                        If it turns out you’re my sons, terrific.  
                        We’ll celebrate.  If not, no harm no 
                        foul.

                                 PETER
                        That sounds...very sensible, sir.

                                 KYLE
                        That’s why he’s gonna be the next 
                        President, Pete.  That and his hair.
                             (examining it)
                        Jesus, it’s like he doesn’t even have 
                        a scalp.  It’s all hair.  

           EXT. THE GOVERNOR’S MANSION -- DAY

           The brothers get out of their rental car in front of the 
           mansion.  The Governor and his advisors exit a separate car.   

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                             (noticing thru the window)
                        Dammit, my wife’s home.  She was supposed 
                        to be at her mother’s till tomorrow.
                             (then, thinking)
                        Hey, would you guys do me a favor?

                                 KYLE
                        Name it.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        When you meet my wife, would you mind 
                        pretending you’re just...
                             (first thing he can think of)
                        a couple of reporters here to do a 
                        story on me?  I’d hate to upset her 
                        if we don’t have to.

           Before Peter can finish nodding “Sure”, KYLE CELEBRATES --

                                 KYLE
                        Dude, I’ve already got a character     
                        for this!  P.J. McGoldenrod!!  
                             (explaining to the Governor)
                        Sometimes I pretend I’m a reporter when 
                        I fuck my wife.  I usually wear a 
                        trench coat and a Fedora...but I’m sure
                        P.J. will still play without them.  
                        He’s really a fun character, sir.      

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Yeah, I don’t think we need to--
                                 KYLE
                             (but he’s already rolling)
                        Pete, you can be his partner...Oliver... 
                        Pennyswaggle.

                                 PETER
                        How about we just use our real names?

                                 KYLE
                        No, it’s too late.  That’ll just confuse 
                        me.  You’re Oliver Pennyswaggle. And you 
                        and I have this intense love-hate 
                        relationship.  You know, like those guys.  
                        You know the ones I’m talking about?  

           Peter just shakes his head.  Kill me now.

           INT. GOVERNOR MCUTCHEN’S MANSION -- DAY

           The Governor has just kissed his ATTRACTIVE, 50-SOMETHING
           WIFE hello.  Confused, however, she notes...  

                                 MRS. MCCUTCHEN
                        Dr. Grant’s waiting in your study.      
                        He said he stopped by to give you a 
                        physical?  

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Oh--yes, I’ve been putting that off.  
                        Looks like he finally caught me.

                                 MRS. MCCUTCHEN
                        He said you asked him to come.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Of course I did.  Obviously.  He 
                        wouldn’t just show up at our home in 
                        the middle of the day.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        The Governor was being facetious, 
                        Mrs. McCutchen.

           She accepts the Chief of Staff’s explanation...somewhat 
           warily.  She then notices Peter & Kyle standing by the door.  

                                 MRS. MCCUTCHEN 
                        Who are they?

           Before the Governor can even say a word -- 

                                 KYLE
                             (deep voice, debonair)
                        P.J. McGoldenrod, ma’am -- ace reporter 
                        for The White Bostonian.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        And this, of course, is my plucky 
                        partner--

                                 PETER
                        Peter Reynolds.  Hello.

                                 KYLE
                        He prefers to be called Oliver, though.  
                        One of his many interesting quirks.

           Before Kyle can go into them, the Governor explains (with 
           some hesitancy)...

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Yes, these gentlemen are writing an 
                        article on me.  I offered to give 
                        them a glimpse at our homelife.

           She nods.  Nothing too odd about that.

                                 MRS. MCCUTCHEN
                        Well, if they want a real scoop, they 
                        should talk to me.  After all, who 
                        knows the Governor better than his own 
                        wife?  Right?   

           Governor McCutchen reads this for sarcasm...but ultimately 
           concludes --

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        You know something?  That’s a great idea.  

           Kyle seconds this with A BIG BELLOWING LAUGH (one of “P.J.’s” 
           more colorful affectations, apparently). 

                                 KYLE
                        Indeed!  A great idea indeed!   
                             (then)
                        Oliver, why don’t you run along with the 
                        Governor...while I stay here and have my 
                        way with his lovely wife.

           A beat.  Furrowed brows all around. 

                                 MRS. MCCUTCHEN
                        I’m sorry...what newspaper did you 
                        say you were from?

           Kyle again responds with A BELLOWING LAUGH.
                                 KYLE
                        Indeed!  Oh, you are a live one, Mrs. 
                        McCutchen. A live one indeed!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY -- DAY

           With his advisors keeping watch in the hall, we find 
           McCutchen and Peter... 

           IN THE GOVERNOR’S STUDY

           ...about to have blood drawn by DR. GRANT.  They’re both 
           seated with their sleeves rolled up.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Your brother certainly is... 
                        interesting.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, he’s something else, alright.

           Dr. Grant then explains...

                                 DR. GRANT
                        So, Peter, before I draw blood, I’ll just 
                        need to take down a little information.

                                 PETER
                        Of course.
                             (to the Governor)
                        I’m actually a physician myself.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Really?  That’s great.

           They have a little moment.  Then--  

                                 DR. GRANT
                        When were you born? 

                                 PETER
                        December 26th 1975.

           While the doctor is jotting it down...

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Almost a Christmas baby, huh?

                                 PETER
                        Yep.  
                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Bet you got screwed when it came to 
                        presents.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah.  But we would have gotten screwed 
                        anyway.  Mom wasn’t a big gift giver.

           The Governor chuckles.  But as the information sits with 
           him...

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Wait a second.  What year was that again?

                                 PETER

           McCutchen considers this.  Something about it doesn’t make 
           sense.  

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        December 26th 1975?

                                 PETER
                        Uh huh.  

           Beat.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        That’s impossible.  

                                 PETER
                        Why?

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Well...I was “with” your mother two 
                        months before that...
                             (beat)
                        And she wasn’t even pregnant.

           Peter is understandably confused.

                                 PETER
                        How can you be sure?  It was 36 years 
                        ago.  

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        I’ll show you how I can be sure.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN’S SPORTS MEMORABILIA ROOM

           It’s a shrine to New England sports history.  The Celtics... 
           the Patriots...but primarily the Red Sox.
           The Governor grabs a mounted, autographed baseball off a 
           shelf and explains... 

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        October 21st 1975.  Game 6 of the 
                        World Series.  

           McCutchen’s Chief of Staff knows exactly where he’s going.  

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Carlton Fisk’s 12th inning home run. 

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        No self-respecting Sox fan would 
                        forget what he did that night.

           His Chief of Staff reminisces...

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        I was back in New York.  Had to watch 
                        it in a bar full of Yankee fans. 

           Dr. Grant remembers as well...

                                 DR. GRANT
                        I was in my 4th year of medical school.  
                        We actually brought a TV into the O.R.

                                 GOVERNOR MCCUTCHEN
                        Yeah, well, I was there.  At the 
                        game.  And so was your mother.

           McCutchen shows Peter A FRAMED PHOTO OF HIM AND PETER’S 
           MOTHER CELEBRATING AT THE GAME.  She’s clearly not 7 months 
           pregnant. (NOTE: she is, however, clearly wasted)  

           While Peter is in shock, trying to process what this means --

                        Oh, that is delightful, ma’am.  Just 
                        delightful.
                             (then)
                        Now if we could just switch gears a bit,  
                        I’d like to ask a few questions about the 
                        Governor’s hair.

                                 MRS. MCCUTCHEN
                             (confused)
                        His hair?
                                 KYLE
                        Indeed.  We at...my job...are eager to 
                        learn how the Governor has managed to 
                        keep his hair so thick and lustrous over 
                        the years.  Is there a particular shampoo 
                        he uses, or...?

           While she tries to understand the relevance, PETER APPEARS 
           AND POLITELY PULLS HIS BROTHER AWAY.

                                 PETER
                        Would you excuse us for a minute, 
                        Mrs. McCutchen? I just need to have 
                        a word with T.J.

                        my clothes off.
                             (beat)
                        Apparently, she sees me as a younger, 
                        more virile version of her husband -- 
                        you know, the one she never had a 
                        chance to fuck.

                        Yes.

                                 KYLE
                        Well...what does this mean then?

                                 PETER
                        It means Mom lied about our birthday.

                                 KYLE
                        Why would she do that?  To screw us 
                        out of presents?

           While the brothers consider this, MCCUTCHEN’S CHIEF OF STAFF 
           APPEARS.  Like they’re spies in some spy thing, he says--

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        We should talk.  

           EXT. GOVERNOR MCUTCHEN’S MANSION -- DAY

           Peter & Kyle are in front of the mansion, anxiously awaiting 
           what the man has to say.  It’s obviously something he doesn’t 
           want Governor McCutchen to overhear. 

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        I’ve been friends with the Governor a 
                        long time.  A long time.  He doesn’t know 
                        this, but...I used to “see” your mother 
                        too.

                                 KYLE
                        The airquotes mean you fucked her, right?

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Yes.  Anyways, when I called her a few 
                        weeks after the World Series...you know, 
                        to see if she might want to “see” me 
                        again...her roommate said she’d been 
                        checked into a detox center in 
                        Providence.  “New Beginnings”.
                             (beat)
                        I remember because I actually spent 
                        time there myself in the 80s.

           Peter & Kyle look at each other.

                                 KYLE
                        Looks like we’re going to Providence.

           Peter nods.  There’s no way he’s giving up now.
                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        Hey, how’s your mom doing, by the 
                        way?  She good?   
                             (beat)
                        Tell her The Jackhammer said hi, okay?

           INT. RENTAL CAR -- DAY

           Peter & Kyle pull up to the

           NEW BEGINNINGS REHABILITATION CENTER (PROVIDENCE, R.I.)

                                 PETER
                        What are the chances there’s anyone 
                        here who’ll even remember her? 

                                 KYLE
                        They’ll at least have a file on her, 
                        right?  

           INT. NEW BEGINNINGS REHAB CENTER -- DAY

           Peter & Kyle approach the front desk.  There’s a MALE 
           ATTENDANT on duty.  

                                 GUY AT RECEPTION DESK
                        Hi, can I help you?

           Kyle turns on the charm.

                                 KYLE
                        I sure hope so...Clyde.  Our mother 
                        was a patient here back in 1975.  We 
                        were wondering if you might have any 
                        information on her.  

                                 CLYDE/GUY AT RECEPTION DESK
                        Yeah...we’re not allowed to give out 
                        any information on our patients.  
                        And, even if I could, I doubt our 
                        files go back that far.

                                 KYLE
                        Aw, shucks.  It would just mean the world 
                        to us, though, if you checked.  Our 
                        mother is...well...the fact of the matter 
                        is, Clyde, she’s... 

                                 PETER
                        Dead.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, I don’t know if I feel 
                        comfortable going that far, Clyde.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Let’s just say she’s old...and that 
                        she has a few minor medical problems. 

           Peter just gives his brother a look.  Are you kidding me?

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        What?  I’m not gonna lie and say 
                        she’s dead, dude.  That’s bad kharma.  

           Fortunately, Clyde takes pity on them.

                                 CLYDE
                        Look, I shouldn’t be doing this, 
                        but...if your mother was a patient in 
                        the 70s, there’s one person here who 
                        might remember her.  

           INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY

           Peter & Kyle enter a breakroom and find a 70-SOMETHING FEMALE 
           STAFF MEMBER making herself some tea.

                                 PETER
                        Excuse me.  Dr. Cartwright?  

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        Yes?

                                 PETER
                        This is a longshot, ma’am...but we’re 
                        hoping you might remember our mother.  
                        She was a patient here in the 70s.  
                        Her name was Helen Baxter.

           After a long beat...Dr. Cartwright gradually smiles.  

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        So which one of you is Peter and 
                        which one is Kyle? 

           THE BROTHERS’ JAWS DROP.  

                                 KYLE
                        No way.  You remember us?

                                 PETER
                        How is that...possible?

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                             (still smiling)
                        Let’s take a walk.
           EXT. NEW BEGINNINGS REHAB CENTER -- DAY

           Peter & Kyle walk with the woman thru the Center’s 
           beautifully landscaped gardens.

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        How is your mother?

                                 PETER
                        She’s good.  Married...healthy...

           Dr. Cartwright looks at them.

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        She doesn’t know you’re here, does she?

                                 PETER
                        No.  
                             (beat)
                        See, she recently revealed to us that 
                        the man we spent our whole lives 
                        thinking was our father wasn’t really 
                        our father...

                                 KYLE
                        And we’ve been on a quest to find the 
                        guy ever since.  
                             (beat)
                        Technically, it’s only been since last 
                        Friday.  But it feels longer.  I miss 
                        my wife and kids.

           The woman smiles.   

                                 PETER
                        We think she also lied about our 
                        birthday.  She told us it was December 
                        26th, 1975...but we saw a photo of her 
                        from around that time, and she wasn’t 
                        even pregnant.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, I never got to see the picture.  
                        But I trust Pete.

                                 PETER
                        When were we born?

           The woman is clearly conflicted about what to tell them.

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        I’m not sure you boys will want to 
                        hear this.
                                 KYLE
                             (fearing the worst)
                        We’re 40, Pete.  She’s gonna tell us 
                        we’re actually 40.

           Peter ignores his brother.  He begs the doctor...

                                 PETER
                        Please.  We’ve been lied to our entire 
                        lives.  We just want the truth.  

           She can see how much this means to them.  After a long beat...

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        When your mother arrived here -- in 
                        November 1975 -- she was in a very 
                        bad condition.  I’ll spare you the 
                        details...but we had to isolate her 
                        and keep her in her own room, until 
                        she got clean.

           The guys nod.  Okay so far.

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Once she made it past the withdrawal 
                        period, however, we moved her in with 
                        another patient.  A woman.  

           Dr. Cartwright hesitates...which confuses the brothers.

                                 PETER
                        Okay...

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        A woman who happened to be 8-months
                        pregnant.

           She lets this sit with them.  Peter is the first to realize 
           what it means.

                                 PETER
                        Ho-ly shit.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you holy shitting what I’m holy 
                        shitting?  In my head, I mean? 

           Peter is too blown away to respond.

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT 
                        Your mother and this woman became 
                        very close.  They got clean together.  
                             (beat)
                        They basically became like sisters.
                                 KYLE
                        Did mom steal us?  Is that where this is 
                        going?  Please let it not be going there.  

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        There was a terrible blizzard that 
                        Christmas...and when the woman went 
                        into labor, it wasn’t possible to get 
                        her to the hospital.  So...we did the 
                        best we could.
                             (then, smiling)
                        And two beautiful boys were brought 
                        into the world. 

           ON PETER & KYLE processing this.  Dr. Cartwright’s smile 
           fades, however, in revealing...

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        Unfortunately, due to her history of 
                        drug abuse and...
                             (delicately)
                        several other medical issues...she was 
                        still very weak...and didn’t survive 
                        the delivery.    

           ON PETER & KYLE...as this sinks in.  About as bad as it gets.   

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT (CONT’D)
                        Legally, we were expected to deliver 
                        you to social services...to be placed 
                        into foster care.  
                             (beat)
                        But Helen couldn’t stand the thought.  
                        And she promised to take care of you and 
                        raise you as if you were her own.
                             (beat, smiles again)
                        You boys actually spent the first 6 
                        months of your lives right here at 
                        the Center...just so we could make 
                        sure she was fit to raise you.

           The brothers are absolutely blown away.  

           Peter is the first to come to.  Weakly, he asks...

                                 PETER
                        Our biological mother.  What was her 
                        name? 

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        Well...I’m certain the name she gave 
                        us wasn’t her real name.
                                 PETER
                        How do you know?

           But Dr. Cartwright doesn’t respond.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Please.

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        Because she was a prostitute, Peter.   
                        And she was afraid that elements from 
                        that world might come to hurt her.  And, 
                        more importantly, you.     

           The brothers digest this.  Kyle looks especially phased.

                                 PETER
                        And our father...?

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        She believed he was her pimp.     

           Peter nods...accustomed to disappointment by this point.  
           It’s still new for Kyle, though.  He tries rationalizing...  

                                 KYLE
                        He was probably a nice pimp, though, 
                        right?  You know, one of the ones 
                        with goldfish in his shoes...and...a 
                        cool cane...  

           But by the Doctor’s face, it’s clear that wasn’t the case.  
           Kyle is visibly weakened.  

           Just then, CLYDE FROM THE FRONT DESK INTERRUPTS--

                                 CLYDE FROM THE FRONT DESK
                        Excuse me, Dr. Cartwright, but they 
                        need you inside.

           Dr. Cartwright nods.  She looks at the brothers.  Clearly, 
           they’re still in shock.  

                                 DR. CARTWRIGHT
                        I hope you view the truth as I view it.  
                             (beat)
                        Helen Baxter was one of the most 
                        remarkable women I’ve ever met.  

           Dr. Cartwright leaves...and the brothers just sit there.  
           They couldn’t move even if they had to.

           But, apparently, they do have to, as Clyde adds...
                                 CLYDE FROM THE FRONT DESK
                        Sorry guys...but you can’t be here alone.

           EXT. NEW BEGINNINGS REHAB CENTER -- DAY

           The brothers finally exit the Center.  Their emotional tanks 
           are clearly empty.   

           Kyle looks particularly defeated, though...and just plops 
           down on the steps.  He sums it all up.

                                 KYLE
                        So, basically...our mother was a 
                        whore...our father was a pimp...and 
                        we killed our whore-mother, just by 
                        being born.

           Peter watches as his brother’s eyes actually begin to water.  
           It’s something he can’t remember ever seeing.  

           And as the harsh truth continues sitting with Kyle...

                                 KYLE
                             (”sunny”)
                        Hey, guess this explains why we’re 
                        such fucking losers, right?

           This stymies Peter.  Since when does Kyle think he’s a loser?

                                 PETER
                        Come on...what are you talking about?  

                                 KYLE
                        You were right about me, Pete.       
                        I should be dead or in prison.  
                             (beat)
                        Hell, it turns out it’s my birthright!  

           And it’s here that Peter begins to feel guilty.  Both for 
           what he said...and, more importantly, what he’s wished.  His 
           whole life.       

                                 PETER
                        Look...I didn’t mean that.  I was 
                        just jealous...and sad...and I took 
                        it out on you.

                                 KYLE
                        No, you hit the nail on the head.  I’m 
                        a handsome idiot who’s contributed 
                        nothing to the world.  

                                 PETER
                        What about your sons?  
                                 KYLE
                        What about them?  Kaylani does all the 
                        work.  I’m just the big dumb howlie who 
                        got her pregnant.

                                 PETER
                        That’s not true.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah it is.
                             (beat)
                        And you know what the worst part is?  I 
                        probably did know you had a crush on that 
                        Pamela chick when I fucked her.  She used 
                        to wear pink Cavariccis, right?

           Kyle takes Peter’s non-response as confirmation and hates 
           himself even more.  And it’s here that the waterworks really 
           start flowing.

                                 PETER
                             (hates watching it)
                        Oh God...don’t cry.

                                 KYLE
                        I can’t help it!  The tears just keep 
                        coming.

           PASSING EMPLOYEES can’t help but stare.  

                                 KYLE
                        That’s right!  Look at the handsome 
                        idiot crying!  Look at him getting 
                        what he deserves!

                                 PETER
                        Kyle, look at me.  Look at me!

           Kyle obeys...tears still streaming.  

                                 PETER
                        You have no reason to feel bad about 
                        yourself.  You’re literally the nicest 
                        guy I’ve ever known.  You’re a terrific 
                        father and a devoted husband.

                                 KYLE
                             (salt in the wounds)
                        I couldn’t even cheat on her!  This 
                        whole trip I couldn’t even do it!  
                        Not even a hand job!  
                                 PETER
                        That’s not a bad thing.  That’s just 
                        a testament to what a great guy you 
                        are and how much you love Kaylani and 
                        your sons.

                                 KYLE
                             (brightening a bit)
                        It is?  It’s a testament?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.  She’s lucky to have you as a 
                        husband.  Those kids are lucky to have 
                        you as a father.  
                             (beat)
                        And I’m lucky to have you as a brother.

           And this means more to Kyle than practically anything.

                                 KYLE
                        Really?  Even after Pamela Whats-her-
                        face?

                                 PETER
                             (finally admitting it)
                        I never had a chance with her anyway.  
                        She was just an easy excuse for me to 
                        hate you.

           Kyle appreciates this.  And Peter continues...

                                 PETER
                        You know what?  I think you need to 
                        start taking your own advice.  

                                 KYLE
                        What advice?  

                                 PETER
                        Look at the bright side here.  Just 
                        think about what Mom did for us.

                                 KYLE
                        Which Mom?  Whore Mom?   

                                 PETER
                        Both Moms.  But Mom Mom, in particular.  
                        She gave up her whole life for us.  And 
                        she had zero obligation to do that.     

           Kyle considers this.  It really is amazing.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        All those stories she made up about 
                        Dad...she really was trying to protect 
                        us.   
                             (beat)
                        Hell, she even decided to reveal her 
                        own ridiculously embarrassing sexual 
                        history rather than have us know the 
                        truth.

           Kyle marvels at it too.  Unbelievable.  Then --

                                 KYLE
                        Guess you really owe her an apology, 
                        huh?  
                             (beat)
                        You know, ‘cuz you were such a dick 
                        to her about that. 

           Peter is fully aware of this.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, there were times in that whole 
                        exchange where I was like, “Damn, Pete’s 
                        really being a dick about this.”  I 
                        almost hit you, actually.

           Peter takes his lumps well.  Knows he deserves it. 

                                 PETER
                        Are you ready to go home?

                                 KYLE
                        I was born ready.  To go home.

           BEGIN MONTAGE OF THE GUYS HEADING HOME

           1. Driving to the airport...Peter actually enjoying Kyle’s 
           rap stylings.    

           2. Walking thru the terminal in slow-motion, bad asses that 
           they are.

           3. Toasting drinks at an airport bar...and cracking everyone 
           up with tales of their adventures.  And Peter is just as 
           involved as his brother.  They’re a dynamic duo.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY

           With the plane in mid-flight, we find Kyle sitting in First 
           Class, enjoying the window view.

           When Peter sits down beside him, however, Kyle realizes--
                                 KYLE
                        Dude, we never got you laid!  The 
                        whole sub-mission of the larger 
                        mission was a failure.

           Peter grins, though.

                                 PETER
                        Was it?  Guess who just became the 
                        newest member of the Mile-High Club.

                                 KYLE
                             (in utter shock)
                        No.  

           Peter smiles and waves at a pretty stewardess.  She smiles 
           back.  Kyle remains stunned.

                                 KYLE
                        Seriously?  You just fucked that 
                        flight attendant?

                                 PETER
                             (after a beat)
                        No.

           Kyle shakes his head, “pissed”.  

                                 KYLE
                        Dammit!  You got me again!  I gotta be 
                        the most gullible person alive.  

           Peter chuckles.

                                 PETER
                        I did get her number, though.

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t play me again, Pete.  I’m 
                        begging you.  My heart can’t take it.

                                 PETER
                             (displaying a napkin with the digits)
                        Does it look like I’m playing you?

                                 KYLE
                        Sweet!  
                             (but then)
                        Wait a second.  How do I know you 
                        didn’t just write those numbers 
                        yourself?  See, you are playing me.    

           Peter just continues beaming.  Whether he’s “playing” Kyle or 
           not may be a mystery...but he’s clearly enjoying his company.  
           EXT. THEIR MOTHER’S HOUSE -- DAY

           Peter & Kyle get out of Peter’s Prius and head toward their 
           Mom’s house.  Pastor Gene is waiting for them on the porch.  

                                 PETER
                        Hey Gene.  Where is she?

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        I’m not going to lie to you guys.  
                        Your mother isn’t doing well.

           Peter and Kyle look at each other.  Shit.

           THE BACKYARD

           Pastor Gene leads the brothers behind the house...where they 
           find THEIR MOTHER -- SITTING IN A LONE CHAIR AT THE END OF 
           THE YARD, STARING OFF AT NOTHING.  It’s very dramatic.    

                                 KYLE
                        How long has she been like this?

           Gene sees how concerned they are, though, and confesses --

                                 PASTOR GENE
                        Okay, look.  Honestly, she just came 
                        out here ten minutes ago when I said 
                        you were on your way.  But don’t tell 
                        her I told you.  This really has been 
                        rough on her.

                                 PETER
                        We know it has.  Thanks, Gene.

           ON MRS. REYNOLDS staring off into the distance sadly...when 
           Peter & Kyle appear beside her.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                             (without looking at them)
                        Well, well, well. To what do I owe 
                        the honor?     

           Peter isn’t bothered by her self-indulgence.  He simply 
           kneels down before her and tells her sweetly...

                                 PETER
                        You are, without question, the 
                        greatest mom in the world.

           She tries to remain unmoved (but we can tell the words have 
           affected her).  Kyle kneels down as well and adds...

                                 KYLE
                        Ma, we love you more than anything.
                                 PETER
                        Besides Jesus, of course.

                                 KYLE
                        Right, besides Jesus.  
                             (beat)
                        And, well, obviously we’re both 
                        fathers, so...
                             (beat)
                        But you know what we’re saying.  She 
                        knows what we’re saying.

           And Peter continues...

                                 PETER
                        We’ve taken you for granted our entire 
                        lives.  Me especially.  But it ends now.
                             (beat)
                        We’d be nothing without you.  

                                 KYLE
                        No, we’d be less than that.  We’d be 
                        less than nothing.    

           She continues not giving them eye contact.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        I take it things didn’t go so well 
                        with Jack Tibbs.

                                 PETER
                        Things went fine with him.
                             (beat)
                        But he’s not our family.  You are.

           She finally looks at her boys.  The emotion of the moment 
           takes over and she starts to cry.

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        Are you going to hug your mother or not?

           Peter & Kyle are more than happy to oblige.  

           And, as the embrace continues, KAYLANI AND THE KIDS RETURN 
           FROM THE GROCERY STORE.

                                 KAPONO/KEANU
                        Daddy’s home!!!

           Kyle ends his hug, but only so his boys can run into his arms.

           And the sight doesn’t even make Peter jealous.  He actually 
           smiles.  His mother notes this and tells him softly...
                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        You’re the best thing that ever  
                        happened to me.  You know that, right?

           Peter looks back at her.  He does.  And it’s from this 
           idyllic moment...with everything right in the world that we -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           PETER’S SON’S RIDICULOUSLY OVER-THE-TOP BAR MITZVAH RECEPTION

           12-person band...party-starters...fire-breathers...the works.

           We find Peter seated at a table with his family (mom, Pastor 
           Gene, Kyle, Kaylani & the kids).  He’s actually handling the 
           occasion pretty well, too.  Seems to have made peace with it.  

                                 MRS. REYNOLDS
                        I’m still confused.  Is Ethan Jewish now?  

                                 PETER
                        He just wanted a party, Mom.  It’s okay.

           She nods...but she’s still confused.  

           ANGLE ON ETHAN, STEPPING UP TO THE BAND’S MIC.

                                 ETHAN
                        Everyone, everyone...if I could have 
                        your attention...

           The room quiets down to hear the precocious young man speak.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m so grateful that you were all 
                        able to come out and share this 
                        special day with me.  

           Kyle makes the “jerking off” hand gesture.  It amuses Peter.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, I’ll let you get back to dancing 
                        and eating in a second...but I couldn’t 
                        forgive myself if I didn’t thank the 
                        people responsible for making me the man 
                        I am -- or rather, became -- today.  
                             (beat)
                        Mom...Joel...I love you both.  Thank you 
                        for making this amazing dream a reality.  

           The entire room “awwwwws”...except for Peter’s table.  
           They’re waiting for Ethan to at least acknowledge his father.  
           But, of course, he doesn’t.
                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s kick this party up a notch!

           Everyone CHEERS!  Except at Peter’s table.

                                 KYLE
                        Is he fucking kidding me?

           Peter gestures “Don’t worry about it”.  But that’s not 
           exactly in Kyle’s nature.  

           So, as Ethan joins his friends on the dance-floor...

           KYLE APPEARS AT THE MIC. 

                                 KYLE
                             (all smiles, champagne in hand)
                        The Bar Mitzvah Boy, everybody!  
                        Let’s give him another hand!

           The guests oblige...unsure what’s going on.  Is he drunk?

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        For those of you who don’t know me, 
                        I’m Ethan’s uncle.  I’m goyim, but 
                        don’t hold it against me, okay! 
                             (taking the mic off the stand, 
                              settling in)
                        Gosh, this really is an amazing day.  
                        Ethan becoming a man.  I knew you 
                        could do it, buddy!  Lots of mazel!

           Ethan feigns a smile for his guests, but he clearly wants his 
           uncle off the mic.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        But you know something, Ethan?  “Being 
                        a man” isn’t just about growing facial 
                        hair...and chasing tail...and worrying 
                        about the size of your penis. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s not just about getting to read 
                        from the holy Torah for the first 
                        time...which I know you chose not to 
                        do today, due to “time constraints”.
                             (beat)
                        Being a man is also about appreciating 
                        the people who’ve always been there for 
                        you. 
                             (beat)
                        And not just the ones who drop 80 grand 
                        on a silly party.  

           And, as if the implication wasn’t clear enough, he adds...
                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Stop being a dick to your father, Ethan.  
                        You’re lucky to have him.

           With the comment still in the air --

                                 KYLE
                        L’Chaim!  Come on, L’Chaim, everybody!  
                        That means drink up!

           As the guests hesitantly obey, Kyle winks at his brother.  
           And we can tell Peter appreciates the effort.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- DAY

           Peter is dropping Kyle and his family off at the airport for 
           their flight back to Hawaii.  They share a final moment. 

                                 KYLE
                        I’m gonna miss you, man.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, I’m gonna miss you too.

           And we can see Peter actually means it.  Kaylani adds...

                                 KAYLANI
                        You’re coming to visit in December, 
                        though, right?

                                 PETER
                        Mom and I bought our tickets last night.  

           Kyle smiles.  Before they leave, though, he makes a request.

                                 KYLE
                        Would you do one thing for me, Pete?

                                 PETER
                        What’s that?

                                 KYLE
                        Would you please fuck that flight 
                        attendant?  

                                 PETER
                             (smiles)
                        We’ll see.

                                 KYLE
                        No, not “we’ll see”.  Fuck.

           Even little Keanu and Kapono apply the pressure.
                                 KEANU
                        Fuck her, Uncle Pete.  

                                 KAPONO 
                        Do it for us.

                                 PETER
                        Now how can I say no to those faces?

                                 KYLE
                        You can’t.  Welcome to my world.

           Kyle gives his brother one last hug.  It lasts a while, but 
           Peter doesn’t mind...much.  Kaylani finally has to end it.

                                 KAYLANI
                        I’m sorry, you guys, but we really 
                        need to go.

           Peter watches them head off.  

           Granted, he’s come a long way, but he clearly still longs for 
           what Kyle has.  A happy, loving family.  Before he gets too 
           down about it, though...

           A LITTLE GIRL’S VOICE CALLS OUT -- 

                                 LITTLE GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Peter?

           He turns around...and, who of all people should be standing 
           there, BUT JACK TIBBS’ ADORABLE GRANDDAUGHTER.

                                 PETER
                             (in utter shock)
                        Elizabeth?  What are doing here?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I live in San Jose, remember?  We 
                        just flew back.

           “We?”  

           Elizabeth gestures back to HER EQUALLY ADORABLE MOTHER, 
           struggling to keep their luggage balanced on a Smarte Carte.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mom!  Guess who I ran into!

           Elizabeth’s mother looks confused, seeing her daughter 
           standing with a strange man.  

                                 ELIZABETH’S MOTHER
                        Elizabeth, what’s gotten into you?
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Mom, this is Peter!  You know, the guy 
                        Grandpa Jack and I told you about...    

           Peter and Elizabeth’s mother meet eyes...and, continuing his 
           track record with the family, there’s an instant connection.

                                 PETER
                        Hi.

                                 ELIZABETH’S MOTHER
                        Hi.

                                 PETER
                             (in disbelief)
                        They told you about me?

                                 ELIZABETH’S MOTHER
                        Please -- they wouldn’t stop telling 
                        me about you.  

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s true.  We wouldn’t.  So how’s 
                        Donald?
                             (explaining)
                        Donald’s his brother.

                                 PETER
                        I actually just dropped him off.  
                        That’s...why I’m here.

           Peter and Elizabeth’s mother share another moment.  This is 
           crazy. 

                                 ELIZABETH’S MOTHER
                        I’m Julie, by the way.

           They shake warmly.  He does a little fishing...

                                 PETER
                        So...is your husband picking you up, 
                        or...?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Nope, Mom’s divorced.  We were just 
                        gonna grab a taxi.  

           Peter considers this.  

                                 PETER
                        I could give you a ride.  I mean, if 
                        it’s that not weird...  

           Elizabeth reacts instantly--
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why would that be weird?  
                             (then)
                        Mom, what are you waiting for?  Say yes.
