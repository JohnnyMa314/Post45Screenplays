           INT. BANK - VAULT - NIGHT

           Sparks fly, reflected in the welding goggles of MICHAEL 
           KITSON (35).  What we can see of his face is a mask of 
           seriousness.

           Reveal:  TEN FOOT HIGH ROUND VAULT DOOR.  Michael drills a 
           FOURTH hole - about the width of an aerosol can.  There are 
           several dead DRILL BITS on the ground around him.  We are in 
           the VAULT ANTEROOM.

           A SECOND MAN - JUDE CHAVRON (33), also wearing goggles, feeds 
           water into the spinning drill, cooling it.

           On the ground, well behind them, are two GUARDS, bound, 
           gagged and unconscious - EYES TAPED SHUT.

           Michael pulls the glowing RED drill bit out of the hole, 
           rolling back the drill on it’s casters...

           Michael examines the hole, turns to Jude, nods.  Jude shuts 
           off the water, opens a LARGE BLACK CASE containing FOUR 
           IDENTICAL CHROME TUBES --  each one individually wired.

           EXT. LA BANQUE DE PALLION - PARIS - NIGHT

           Two CITY SEWER WORKERS stand over a FLAGGED man hole, their 
           CITY TRUCK parked to protect them from LIGHT traffic.

           A POLICE CAR rolls up, lights on.  One of the construction 
           worker, FINN LOWRY (29) stands - COOL AS A CUCUMBER.  The 
           other worker, JEAN-LUC PINOT (45) speaks low...

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        It’s nothing.  Keep the plan.

           As the POLICE OFFICER gets out, Jean-Luc waves to him.

                                 JEAN-LUC (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Appreciate the lights, almost been 
                        killed here tonight.

           The Officer waves.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        Fucking sewers again?  My wife is 
                        always complaining about the 
                        toilet.  If she cleaned it, 
                        maybe...
           The men laugh.  Jean-Luc produces a cigarette, offers one.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        I shouldn’t.

           He takes it.  Jean-Luc lights it.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        How much longer?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Who knows?  Don’t kill the job, 
                        right?

           Finn smiles, turns back to the man hole...

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        Not so friendly, huh?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        He’s mad about the shift, he has a 
                        girlfriend...

           Off the Police Officer’s interest...

           INT. BANK - VAULT - SAME

           Michael and Jude carefully slide the fourth CHROME TUBE into 
           the hole in the safe.  It’s a perfect fit.

           Michael wires it to the others - all the tubes now connected - 
           creating a perfect square around the center of the VAULT.  
           The wires running to a hand-held detonator.

           They stand back, Jude nods, ready.  Michael detonates - FOUR 
           QUICK POPS - followed by a HISS - as the SQUARE FROSTS OVER --

           After a beat - Michael inspects it, turns to Jude, nods.  
           Jude CLICKS HIS WALKIE --

           EXT. LA BANQUE DE PALLION - NIGHT

           -- Finn hears the double click on his walkie.  

                                 FINN
                             (French)
                        Hey, I smell something funny...
           BY POLICE CRUISER

           The officer chuckles...

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        It’s a sewer, dummy.

           Jean-Luc knows why Finn is calling.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        I better get over there.  They’ll 
                        be shit running in the streets.

           The Police Officer gets in his cruiser as Jean-Luc looks to 
           Finn - nods curtly.  Finn removes a small detonator.  

           REVEAL:  Small C4 PACKAGES dot the sewer line under the 
           street.

           Jean-Luc turns to wave at the Police Officer.  Flicks his 
           cigarette butt into the open sewer.

           Finn presses the detonator - THE STREET EXPLODES -- 

           INT. BANK - VAULT - SAME

           Under the cover of the explosion - Michael and Jude, each 
           holding a SLEDGE HAMMER - SMASH the FROSTED PART of the safe - 
           CHUNKS of THICK METAL BREAK AWAY -- 

           EXT. LA BANQUE DE PALLION - NIGHT

           The fires runs the length the bank -- A BUS STOP DESTROYED.  
           The Police Officer gets up...

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        What the hell?

           Jean-Luc, panic --

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Call the fire department, we hit a 
                        gas line...

           The Police Officer stumbles to his feet - Finn PRESSES the 
           detonator again, a SECOND ROUND of EXPLOSIONS strikes further 
           down the street - CARS SCRAMBLE to avoid colliding.
           INT. BANK - VAULT

           The center of the VAULT DOOR smashed out - they work quickly, 
           efficiently - Michael mounts a HEAD LAMP - Jude places a 
           small ladder --

           -- Michael shimmies through the hole into the dark vault --

           INT. VAULT

           -- Michael’s head lamp illuminates stacks and stacks of EURO 
           CURRENCY - neatly wrapped on two long risers.  He moves right 
           past them --

           -- Back wall of vault contains a SERIES of SMALLER SAFE DOORS 
           - DIGITAL PADS - Michael finds the one he’s looking for --

           -- Lifts the back of his glove, reads a number, enters the 
           code, the SAFE DOOR POPS OPEN --

           -- Michael removes TWO 100 EURO PLATES - this is what he came 
           for, he slides them into his jacket --

           EXT. LA BANQUE DE PALLION - NIGHT - BY MAN HOLE

           Several FIRE TRUCKS and more POLICE CARS block the area.  
           Hoses spray water on the burning BUS STOP.  Jean-Luc examines 
           a map of the SEWER SYSTEM with a FIREMAN.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        The gas line was to be shut off.  
                        We told them three times.

                                 FIREMAN
                             (French)
                        We’ve got a call into them.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Those sons of bitches will be home 
                        in bed.

           EXT. LA BANQUE DE PALLION - NIGHT

           A large crowd has gathered to watch the FRENCH FIRE BRIGADE 
           put out the “gas” fire.  Between the noise and the commotion, 
           MICHAEL and JUDE quietly exit the bank -- now both wearing 
           BANK SECURITY GUARD UNIFORMS.
           Finn catches them slipping away - spots the POLICE OFFICER 
           APPROACHING THEM -

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        Hey, you two --

           Michael and Jude stop, turn to face the officer --

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Bank Security, just making sure 
                        we’ve covered the perimeter.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        ID, now.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        It’s not problem, of course.  We’re 
                        fine here.

           Michael PRODUCES his papers.  Jude reaches for his, the 
           SILVER GLINT of a SIDEARM showing inside his jacket -- 
           Michael SEES IT, moves to step in front of Jude, taking his 
           papers to hand them --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Alarms got tripped.  Motion 
                        detectors go off if a cockroach 
                        gets to close, let alone --

           Michael waves to the commotion, drawing the Officer’s eyes 
           from them.

           The Officer reviews the papers, gives Michael and Jude a long 
           stare - Michael takes it in stride, Jude not so much...

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                             (French)
                        I gotta call it in.  

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Sure.  Of course.

           The Police Officer moves away, using the WALKIE TO call in 
           the names - a SEDAN PULLS UP in the distance - A MAN (60s) 
           gets out - SUIT AND TIE - rushes to the nearest UNIFORM.

                                 JUDE
                        That’s the bank manager.
           Michael sees him...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Everything is fine.  Breath.

           The BANK MANAGER GESTURES wildly at the bank, Michael watches 
           him, steals a GLANCE AT JEAN-LUC -- something passes between 
           them - Jean-Luc sees the BANK MANAGER --

                                 JUDE
                        I don’t like this.

           The Uniform finds the POLICE OFFICER - they trade 
           information, the Police Officer turns to LOOK DIRECTLY AT 
           MICHAEL and JUDE -- Jude, steps out - UNZIPS HIS JACKET --

           -- Jude, PULLS his .45 -- Michael realizes a moment too late.

           -- Jude FIRES -- MISSES WIDE - CHAOS as POLICE SPIN --

           -- FINN PRESSES his DETONATOR - a THIRD EXPLOSION LIFTS A 
           FRENCH POLICE CAR OFF THE GROUND - SHOP WINDOWS SHATTER --

           -- A SECOND and THIRD OFFICER raise MP5s FIRING as ONLOOKERS 
           SCREAM and run in all directions -- Jude, FIRES AGAIN, 
           BLINDLY THIS TIME for cover - RUNS --

           -- Jean-Luc and Finn disappear, - Michael and Jude separate, 
           ALL FOUR RUNNING in OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS -- 

           EXT. PARIS STREETS / ALLEYS - NIGHT

           As Michael RUNS - taking LEFTS and RIGHTS quick, determined --

           -- TWO POLICE OFFICERS behind - THEY FIRE THEIR GUNS - BRICK 
           CHIPPING as Michael drops and DODGES - cutting down an alley 
           while STRIPPING OFF HIS JACKET --

           -- He PRESSES himself against a DOOR FRAME as TWO POLICE CARS 
           FLY BY - LIGHTS & SIRENS --  Michael waits a beat --

           -- Bolting across the STREET to an alley, down in the 
           darkness -- UP AND OVER A FENCE --

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           -- And HE CRASHES into a PILE OF WOOD CRATES - TWISTING HIS 
           KNEE as he SLAMS into the GROUND --

           Michael MOANS as he CLUTCHES his leg - finally stands - 
           checks the GROUND, makes sure he hasn’t lost anything...
           WALKS / LIMPS out of the alley a MAIN STREET --

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Busy with TRAFFIC, no one notices him - Michael’s LOOK now 
           different as he pulls a HAT on - the SECURITY OUTFIT dumped - 
           under it he wears a DARK PULLOVER --

           -- Michael LIMPS, the NOISE of the CARS and BUSES drowning 
           out his pain.

           INT. TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Michael, with great effort, pushes open the thick glass doors 
           to his townhouse - searches for his keys as the INTERIOR DOOR 
           of the townhouse opens --

           -- Revealing a DARK HAIRED BEAUTY, her face a mix of ANGER 
           and CONCERN.  This is ELISE BOUTIN (30s), Michael’s WIFE.

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        My God, what happened?

           Michael smiles weakly, falls to her...

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael slouches in a chair, Elise enters with scissors.  

                                 ELISE
                        Can you bend it?

           Michael lifts his leg, BITES DOWN ON THE PAIN -- Elise kneels 
           in front of him, CUTS THE PANTS AWAY - REVEALING A VERY 
           BRUISED KNEE -- SCRAPED and BLEEDING --

           She addresses it, her hand carefully working the tendon...

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        What happened?  

           Michael reaches into an INTERIOR POCKET, removes the TWO 100 
           EURO PLATES, each WRAPPED for protection.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        We were clear.  Jude got...  
                        Stupid.  

           Michael sets the EURO PLATES down on the kitchen table.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        What’s the prognosis, doc?

           Elise gently BENDS his LEG, Michael catches his breath.

                                 ELISE
                        You need an MRI.

           Michael moves the leg, checking it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You know that’s not going to 
                        happen, baby.

           She sits back, looks at her husband.

                                 ELISE
                        We could say you slipped.

                                 MICHAEL
                        First thing they check is hospital 
                        records.

           Elise pulls a ICE PACK from the freezer, places it gently on 
           Michael’s leg - opens a DRAWER looking for a DISH TOWEL, 
           utensils INCLUDING FORTY MISMATCHED ESPRESSO SPOONS...

                                 ELISE
                        Couple of days, maybe we’ll revisit 
                        this...

           Michael takes her hand, holds it...

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Gonna need to stay off it...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Just have to do the drop and pay 
                        them out, then you’ll have me all 
                        to yourself.

           Elise smiles, knows it’s bullshit.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not kidding. 

           With some effort, Michael gets up, Elise steadies him.

                                 ELISE
                        What are you doing?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Be right back, don’t go anywhere.
           He exits the kitchen into the dining room, opens the CABINET 
           and takes something.  Limps back to the LARGE WOOD BLOCK 
           KITCHEN TABLE and sets the envelope down.

           Elise stares at it.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.

           She waits a beat, then opens the envelope, inside TWO PLANE 
           TICKETS, BROCHURE on a RESORT...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Five years late.  Our honeymoon.

           Elise studies the tickets...

                                 ELISE
                        These tickets have an open return.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s right.

           She turns to him, not understanding.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Before this happened...I had 
                        already decided.  I was going to 
                        surprise you.  

           Elise locks eyes with her husband and then she jumps too him, 
           literally KNOCKING HIM OVER - kissing him.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michael in bed, eyes open.  Elise slips into bed next to 
           him...

           She rolls over to face him.  He keeps his eyes pinned on the 
           ceiling.  She moves closer, puts her hand on his chest.  He 
           covers it with his own.

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        You make me happy.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        I love you, too.  Wife.
           EXT. LA BANQUE DE PALLION -  VAULT - MORNING

           The VAULT ANTEROOM, busy with FRENCH POLICE and INVESTIGATORS 
           - some DUST for prints, others scan the GROUND with HI-TECH 
           CAMERAS searching for FIBERS or CLUES.

           PHILIP RENLOW (30s), H. Huntsman suit, handkerchief elegantly 
           placed in his breast pocket, makes his way through the 
           SECURITY - BADGE OUT, confident -- 

           The 10 FOOT DOOR now open, YELLOW TAPE across the front to 
           prevent entry.  Renlow glances around, sees REMAINS of the 
           THIEF’S WORK (Drill, spent drill bits, water system, etc).

           A 2nd UNIFORM stops Renlow, he FLASHES HIS BADGE.  CAPTAIN 
           HENRI LENZ (50s) a BEAR OF A MAN, thick MOUSTACHE yellowed 
           from years of smoking, waves him over.

                                 LENZ
                        Philip.

           Renlow allows a small smile, folds his badge and slides it 
           into his jacket.

                                 RENLOW
                        Thank you for the call, Henri.

                                 LENZ
                        You would have gotten it anyway.  
                        Were you already in Paris?

                                 RENLOW
                        Flew in this morning.

           They walk to the VAULT DOOR - the GAPING SQUARE SHAPED HOLE 
           all Renlow can see...

                                 LENZ
                        Liquid nitrogen is our guess.

                                 RENLOW
                        How was it delivered?

           Lenz waves to a TECH who hands him one of the SILVER 
           CANISTERS - now EXPLODED OPEN.  Renlow examines it.

                                 LENZ
                        Electric detonation, four in total.  
                        Timed, no doubt.  Very 
                        sophisticated.

                                 RENLOW
                        Had to - needs an even 
                        disbursement.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RENLOW (CONT'D)
                             (re: the vault)
                        What’s inside?

           Lenz lifts the tape, they ENTER THE VAULT.

           INT. VAULT

           Now, lights on, we SEE THE HUGE AMOUNTS of CURRENCY lining 
           the walls - neatly stacked and bound.

                                 LENZ
                        Whatever they were after, they left 
                        a lot behind.

           Renlow PULLS ON LATEX GLOVES.

                                 RENLOW
                        Currency is big...and heavy.  And, 
                        sequential.  Hard to wash.  They 
                        were using a cover, the sewer 
                        company?  Couple of guys with big 
                        bags would draw attention.

           Renlow walks to the back of the VAULT - a FULL WALL of small 
           digital SAFES - one open.  He taps it.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Just this?

           Lenz nods.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        What was inside?

                                 LENZ
                        Bank is withholding that 
                        information until its lawyers have 
                        reviewed the subpoena, citing Euro 
                        banking privacy laws...
                             (off Renlow’s look)
                        All they’ll say is they have no 
                        rental information on the box.

                                 RENLOW
                        Something they shouldn’t have had?

           Lenz shrugs.

                                 LENZ
                        Or something they didn’t want 
                        anyone to know they had.  
                             (re: busted vault)
                        What do you think?
                                 RENLOW
                        I think it’s an awful lot of work.

           Renlow steps back, examines the hole in the VAULT DOOR.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        That’s a two foot thick titanium 
                        alloy, with a Miller-Cross locking 
                        mechanism and three separate timed 
                        locks - CAD designed down to the 
                        width of the chrome plating.  Not 
                        that it matters, but it’s the same 
                        technology that protects nuclear 
                        warheads from showing up at 
                        international flea markets.

           Renlow steps forward, runs his hand over the RIDGES of the 
           SQUARE HOLE --

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        You can’t pick it and you can’t 
                        blast it.  And, there are only a 
                        handful of places which you can 
                        drill, all of them meaningless. 
                        Unless--

                                 LENZ
                        --Unless you tied them together 
                        with a purpose.  Like spraying the 
                        interior of the door with liquid 
                        nitrogen.

                                 RENLOW
                        Effectively changing the alloy to 
                        glass block.  

           Renlow nods, WATCHES as Lenz’ team works the BANK - gathering 
           as much information as they can of the limited CLUES.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        The drill bits alone probably cost 
                        more than my yearly salary.  I 
                        don’t even have to examine them to 
                        know they were machined by hand.  
                        Takes time, dedication, patience.
                        These gentlemen did everything 
                        right.  Except one thing.

           Lenz nods, looks up to the street level...

                                 LENZ
                        The shooter.

           Renlow takes a final look, turns to Lenz.
                                 RENLOW
                        It’s a start.  INTERPOL would like 
                        to offer it’s full cooperation.  

           It’s presented as help, but Lenz knows what he means.

           EXT. RUE DE HENRI REGNAULT - LA DEFENSE - PARIS - DAY

           Michael USES A CANE to support his INJURED LEG, exits a 
           SUBWAY stop and heads to a REFINED THREE STORY BUILDING - 
           ORNATE columns and THICK WOODEN DOORS.

           Michael passes TWO FRENCH POLICE - MP5s SLUNG low, eyes 
           watching the street.  

           REVEAL:  A BRASS PLACARD identifying the building as the BANK 
           OF MUNICH - PARIS.

           INT. BANK OF MUNICH - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael crosses the large impressive marble lobby to a MODERN 
           CONCIERGE DESK - the marriage of old and new perfectly 
           aligned.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (German)
                        Michael Kitson to see Mr. Jurgen 
                        Becker, please?

           The ATTRACTIVE ATTENDANT smiles as she types.

                                 ATTENDANT
                             (German)
                        One moment...

           INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - BANK OF MUNICH - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael enters the office led by ANOTHER ASSISTANT - behind a 
           LARGE DARK WOOD DESK, JURGEN KITSON (40s) - slight like a 
           cobra, he stands - welcoming Michael.

                                 BECKER
                        Michael, so good to see you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jurgen.

           They do not shake hands.  They are not friends.

                                 BECKER
                        Coffee?
           Michael casually glances behind him, sees the door is closed.  
           He reaches into his jacket, carefully removes the TWO EURO 
           PLATES - WRAPPED IN CLOTH.  Sets them on the desk.

           Becker opens the cloth, examines them.

                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                        I understand you had a problem.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m handling it.

           Becker places the PLATES in his LEATHER ATTACHE.  Turns to 
           his COMPUTER, types...

                                 BECKER
                        Account numbers?

           Michael hands Becker a small piece of paper.  Becker types 
           while he talks.

                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                        I have something for you.

                                 MICHAEL
                        A bonus?

                                 BECKER
                        Of sorts.

           Becker reaches into his attache, pulls out a RED FOLDER, 
           places it in front of Michael - finishes typing.

           Michael looks at it, doesn’t touch.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What is it?

           Becker HITS RETURN - faces Michael.

                                 BECKER
                        A job.  The French Blues.

           Michael shakes his head.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Mythical diamonds stolen from a 
                        private collector and lost to 
                        history.  That’s not a job, that’s 
                        a white whale.  

           Becker waits, a man used to using patience as a tool.  
           Michael finally picks up the folder.
                                 BECKER
                        They’ve resurfaced.

           Michael flips PAGES OF DATA quickly.

                                 MICHAEL
                        One of these houses belongs to 
                        Garlon Vance.

                                 BECKER
                        You know him?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I met him once, years ago.  They 
                        think he has the Blues?

           Becker shrugs.  

                                 BECKER
                        It’s an initial inquiry.  After you 
                        accept the job, I’ll do a full work 
                        up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Pretty thin.  One of three places, 
                        limited time frame.  You’re gonna 
                        need housing plans from owners who 
                        shoot architects, guard schedules, 
                        at least three escapes - from each 
                        location until you nail it.  And, 
                        if the French Blues really are out 
                        there, they aren’t going to be 
                        sitting on the bureau in the dining 
                        room.  That means vault doors, 
                        motion alarms, heat sensors, laser 
                        arrays, the air moves and it brings 
                        the weight down on me.  These guys 
                        are showing off the box when they 
                        bring out the shoes.

           Michael hands the folder back.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Pass.

                                 BECKER
                        Fourteen million Euro.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Pass.

                                 BECKER
                        You don’t even want to consider it?
                                 MICHAEL
                        Consider what, how much a cloud 
                        weighs?  It’s a lottery ticket, 
                        forget it.

           Becker smiles pleasantly.

                                 BECKER
                        It’s a Gordian knot, your favorite 
                        kind.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not anymore.
                             (beat)
                        I’m retiring.

           Becker, a man whose face rarely reveals his true emotion, 
           let’s his surprise escape.

                                 BECKER
                        Really?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.

           Becker continues to stare at Michael, who holds his gaze.

                                 BECKER
                        I do not know what to say.

           Michael glances at the RED FOLDER, his mind wandering.

                                 MICHAEL
                        My wife and I are going to travel.

                                 BECKER
                        Sounds lovely.  

           A moment between them.  Michael finally stands.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, well...take care, Jurgen.

           Becker comes around the desk, extends his hand.  Michael 
           takes it.

                                 BECKER
                        Take care of yourself, Michael.

           Michael nods, walks out...
           EXT. RUE DE MARTIN - PARIS - MORNING

           The day just beginning for the various business and cafes as 
           PEOPLE walk their dogs and head to WORK.

           Michael heads to a door, fishes out his keys - UNLOCKING the 
           GATE, he slides it aside - unlocks the INTERIOR GLASS DOOR 
           and enters - pulling the GATE CLOSED and locking it.

           REVEAL: the STOREFRONT - KITSON MOTORS - two LARGE PLATE 
           GLASS WINDOWS reveal --

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - MOMENTS LATER

           The interior of Kitson Motors is MOSTLY A SHOWROOM - white 
           tile to better reflect light onto the 1965 MIDNIGHT BLUE 
           CHARGER GTO - Cherry in every way.  

           Parked next to it, A 1956 THUNDERBIRD COUPE - METALLIC BRONZE 
           paint highlighting it’s design.  Michael barely registers 
           them.

           Michael heads to the back - through a DOOR into ---

           INT. KITSON MOTORS -  BACK GARAGE - SAME

           1969 FORD MUSTANG sits on a LIFT - undergoing a serious 
           RENOVATION - Michael unlocks the GARAGE DOOR - PUNCHES a 
           THICK BUTTON on the wall and the GARAGE opens - 

           - revealing Jean-Luc, Finn and a contrite Jude standing in 
           the alley.  Jean-Luc carries two coffees.   They enter and 
           Michael CLOSES the door behind them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Any trouble?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        No.  

           Michael looks to Finn, he shakes his head.  Finally let’s his 
           gaze settle on Jude, who avoids eye contact.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look at me.

           Jude does.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re finished.  
                                 JUDE
                        Michael, we were pinned, if that 
                        bank manager --

                                 MICHAEL
                        -- Stop talking.  You’ve been on 
                        this crew for a long time, don’t 
                        play ignorant, makes you a liar and 
                        an idiot.

                                 JUDE
                        Michael--

           Michael steps forward, his anger now apparent.  Jean-Luc sets 
           his coffee down, ready for anything.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What did I tell you?

                                 JUDE
                        I was trying to help --

                                 MICHAEL
                        -- No guns.  In all the time you’ve 
                        known me, you ever see a gun my 
                        hand?

           Jude refuses to answer, the pride of an outlaw coming 
           forward.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And, you’ve never seen me in jail.  
                        They’re connected.
                             (beat)
                        Don’t let me hear you’re dropping 
                        me or this crew as a hole card when 
                        you get pinched.  And you will get 
                        pinched, sure as I’m standing here.  
                        As a courtesy I paid you out.  You 
                        see me again, you go the other way. 

           Michael punches the GARAGE BUTTON - the door OPENS.  Jude 
           spits.

                                 JUDE
                        Eight fucking years.

           Jean-Luc steps in between Jude and Michael - his eyes flat 
           but his intent clear.  Jude recognizes the look, steps back.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Time to go.
           Jude smirks, shakes his head, turns and walks out.  The door 
           closes behind him.  Finn waits for the tension to deflate.

                                 FINN
                        How’s your leg?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll live.  Package survived, not a 
                        scratch.  Check your accounts by 
                        close of business.

           Jean-Luc lights a cigarette.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        What’s next?

           Michael sets his coffee down, leans on a TOOL CHEST.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Go on vacation.  Get lost.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        For how long?  

                                 MICHAEL
                             (beat)
                        Forever.

           Jean-Luc laughs.  Finn studies Michael’s face.

                                 FINN
                        What’s on your mind, boss?

           Ten years he’s known these guys, the words come hard.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I made a decision, I’m hanging up 
                        my cleats.

           Jean-Luc stops laughing.  Michael sips his coffee.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        We’ve done well.  Smart money 
                        leaves the casino when it’s up.

           For a moment, the words and Jean-Luc’s smoke hang in the air.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Just like that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re hearing it fast, it wasn’t 
                        easy.  
           For a moment, the men simply regard each other.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I put something extra in your 
                        accounts.  Call it severance.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        If there’s nothing we can say...

                                 FINN
                        We had a good run.  

           Michael smiles...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Take care of yourself.

           Michael hits the GARAGE DOOR BUTTON...

           EXT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           Michael, carrying fresh groceries, enters the townhouse.  Out 
           of habit, he uses the glass of his door to scan the street.  
           Enters..

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE  DAY 

           SOFT MUSIC plays as Michael prepares dinner.  He CHOPS 
           expertly, occasionally stopping to sip WINE.

           He glances at his watch, picks up his CELL, dials.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, it’s me.  They got you 
                        changing bedpans again?  Follow the 
                        smell of garlic soaked in browned 
                        butter, asparagus tips and filet.  
                        I’m even baking bread.  Yeah, it’s 
                        like that tonight.  Get home, I 
                        need someone to set the table.

           He sets the cell down, pours a refill...

           EXT. ST. MARY’S ASSISTED LIVING - MORNING

           Michael jogs up the steps to the GLASS DOORS - hits the 
           BUZZER.  Waits.

           Marianne approaches, sees Michael, unlatches the door.
                                 MARIANNE
                             (French)
                        Good evening?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello, Marianne.  Is my wife here?

           Marianne gives Michael a quizzical look.

                                 MARIANNE
                        She left at her regular time, 
                        six...

           Michael considers.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Did she...give any indication where 
                        she was going? 

           Marianne shakes her head. 

                                 MARIANNE
                        I’m sorry.  You want me to check 
                        with the rest of the staff?

                                 MICHAEL
                        If you wouldn’t mind.

           He enters...

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Michael paces, cell pressed to his ear - he’s been at it for 
           awhile.

                                 MICHAEL
                        --if you see her, will you tell her 
                        to call? --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        -- They said around six.  I left 
                        several voice mails --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        -- Twenty four hours before they’ll 
                        do anything --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        -- All right, if you hear 
                        anything...
           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE  KITCHEN - NIGHT - TIME CUT

           Michael sits, CELL PHONE on the wooden butcher block table.  
           He never takes his eyes off it.  IT VIBRATES IT --

           REVEAL:  Call from ELISE

           Michael SNATCHES the phone --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Elise, my god where have you--

           Elise, GREAT STRAIN in her voice--

                                 ELISE
                        Michael....

           A MUFFLED NOISE - and then:

                                 DIGITAL VOICE
                        Michael Kitson.

           Michael STANDS, RUNS to the BUREAU, GRABS PAPER - NOTES THE 
           TIME --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who is this?

                                 DIGITAL VOICE
                        The French Blues.  You will do the 
                        job.  

           Michael strains to take in every sound - the background, the 
           voice, can he hear traffic?  He scribbles everything...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want to speak with her.  Now.

                                 DIGITAL VOICE
                        Do the job, get her back.  Don’t do 
                        the job, get her back in pieces.

           CLICK - the TRANSMISSION is cut.  Michael GRABS HIS JACKET 
           AND RUNS --

           EXT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           -- Out the FRONT DOOR and DOWN THE STREET --
           EXT. STREETS - PASSY DISTRICT - PARIS - NIGHT

           -- Paris’ wealthiest DISTRICT, multi-million Euro CHATEAUS 
           line the street, VARIETY OF EXPENSIVE cars dot the 
           neighborhoods. 

           -- A MAN, smoking, CURBS HIS DOG - behind him, silent as 
           SMOKE, Michael slips into the neighborhood.

           EXT. FRENCH CHATEAU - PASSY - NIGHT

           A FRONT DOOR, lock JIMMIED --

           INT. FRENCH CHATEAU - PASSY - SAME

           In the FOYER - a COMPLICATED SECURITY PANEL - OPENED with 
           WIRES YANKED out --

           INT. KITCHEN

           Jurgen Becker CLOSES the REFRIGERATOR, having just poured 
           himself a glass of MILK --

           -- He DRAINS the GLASS setting it down and NOTICING one of 
           HIS KNIVES is MISSING FROM WALL MAGNET.

           -- Suddenly he becomes VERY AWARE of his SURROUNDINGS - moves 
           SLOW --

                                 BECKER
                        Was the plan to stab me in the 
                        back?

           REVEAL: Michael behind him, EYES - EXPRESSIONLESS - a 
           DARKNESS in them...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where is she?

                                 BECKER
                        Where is who, Michael?

           Michael steps forward, WIELDING the BLADE like a 
           PROFESSIONAL, he holds the POINT at Becker’s jugular.

                                 MICHAEL
                        My wife.  Where is she?

                                 BECKER
                        I have no idea.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Your wife is upstairs, perhaps I 
                        should ask her...

                                 BECKER
                        I can assure you she will give you 
                        the same response.

           Becker TURNS carefully, no sudden movements - he faces 
           Michael.

                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                        Elise is missing?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Taken.

           Becker processes that.

                                 BECKER
                        Did you receive ransom 
                        instructions?

           Michael lowers the blade a bit.

                                 MICHAEL
                        The French Blues.

           Becker sighs.  

                                 BECKER
                        They will have my wife next.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t give a shit about your 
                        wife, Becker.  I care about Elise.  
                        I want her back.  

                                 BECKER
                        I do not know the client.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is the wrong time to lie to 
                        me.

                                 BECKER
                        I am not lying and you know it.  
                        The request came through a fence in 
                        London.  I assume there is another 
                        fence behind that one.  I will make 
                        discreet inquires. 

           Becker does not shift his gaze, Michael lowers the KNIFE, 
           sets it on the nearest table.
                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                        What now?

                                 MICHAEL
                        They’ll call.  Tell them I want 
                        proof of life, everyday at eight 
                        AM.  They can use different phones, 
                        change her location, I don’t care.  
                        But, it’s her voice or I bring the 
                        whole thing down.  The call comes 
                        at 8:01, I bring the whole thing 
                        down.  She’s hurt and I bring the 
                        whole thing down.  I’ve kept 
                        detailed notes on multiple jobs.  
                        Am I being clear?

           Becker nods.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        When I have it figured I’ll reach 
                        out.  I need the file and 
                        everything else you have.  

                                 BECKER
                        It will be delivered to your home 
                        tonight.

           Michael nods, turns --

                                 MICHAEL
                        I want her to tell me the story of 
                        how we met, only she knows it.

           Michael walks out.  

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - WORK ROOM

           In a WINDOWLESS room which operates as Michael’s PRIVATE WORK 
           AREA, he sits - The FILE OPEN - various PAPERS SPILLING OUT 
           on a table - MICHAEL has already MADE COPIOUS NOTES -- He 
           WORKS to keep his mind clear -- 

           -- MAPS on the wall, UNMARKED.

           MICHAEL STARES at a DIGITAL CLOCK - it HITS 8:00 -- His PHONE 
           VIBRATES - Michael GRABS the PHONE --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Elise, baby?--

           Strained breathing, and then his WIFE’S VOICE - she’s clearly 
           had the worst night of her life.
                                 ELISE (O.S.)
                        We met...at Leon’s birthday party.  

           Michael JUMPS UP - a MIXTURE of ANGER and FEAR.

                                 ELISE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I was drinking...apricot brandy... 
                        you made fun--

           The LINE IS TERMINATED.  Michael STARES at the PHONE.  Gently 
           sets it down like it’s a TALISMAN.  

           He SWEEPS EVERYTHING off the table --

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT -  TWO NIGHTS AGO - FLASHBACK

           -- The LIGHT on the night table CRASHES to the FLOOR as 
           MICHAEL and ELISE make love -- moments LATER THEY BOTH FALL 
           off the bed, Elise laughing --

           -- They continue on the floor, animal attraction draws them 
           together but something deeper bonds them - it’s the way Elise 
           looks into Michael’s eyes...

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        Kiss me...

           He does, his hand cupping her neck and face.  Elise opens her 
           mouth to speak, Michael kisses her again, not letting her 
           talk.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I think you broke my other knee.

           She rolls on top of him, playfully holds his hands back.

                                 ELISE
                        Good, then you can’t run away.

           He leans forward, kissing her again, she wraps her arms and 
           legs around him -- 

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        I want to please you...

           She is pleasing him and she knows it.  He kisses her again, 
           strong, passionate - a finish - she collapses on him, heavy 
           breath --
           After a moment, she gets up, walks to the bathroom, a slight 
           turn of her head to see if Michael’s watching - he is - a 
           smile and the door closes.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Now that you are retired I assume 
                        you can cook for me every night?

           Michael laughs, crawls back into bed.  The bathroom door 
           opens --

           -- Elise slips into bed next to him...(this is the tail end 
           of a moment we already saw).

           She rolls over to face him.  He keeps his eyes pinned on the 
           ceiling.  She moves closer, puts her hand on his chest.  He 
           covers it with his own.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        You make me happy.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        I love you, too.  Wife.

           INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - 12TH FLOOR - MORNING

           Michael STANDS by a FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW, looking out - 
           piles of DRYWALL and construction TOOLS dot the large empty 
           space...

           REVEAL:  Michael watches as A BLACK LIMOUSINE stops in front 
           of the building across the street.  AN OLDER MAN gets out, 
           everything about him: POWER and CONFIDENCE.  This man is 
           GARLON VANCE (60s).

           Behind Michael -- ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN - Jean-Luc and Finn 
           exit. 

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Let’s kill the son of a bitch.

           Michael turns, almost smiles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wish it were that easy. 

           Jean-Luc gives Michael a hug.
                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        She’s strong and she’s smart. 

           Michael, TOUCHED, Jean-Luc releases him, peers out the window 
           - sees VANCE.

                                 JEAN-LUC (CONT’D)
                        Who is that?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Garlon Vance. 

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        He has the diamonds?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.  He has Elise.

           Jean-Luc turns to Michael, eyes INCREDULOUS --

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        What are we waiting for?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know where he has her or 
                        under what circumstances.  I can’t 
                        risk hitting him.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        How do you know it’s him?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because he asked me to steal them 
                        years ago and when I refused he 
                        took it poorly. 

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        He asked you to steal them?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It was before your time.  

           Michael steps to a CONSTRUCTION TABLE, unfolds a HAND DRAWN 
           DIAGRAM - it’s a CRUDE IMAGE of the FRENCH BLUE DIAMOND and 
           ACCOMPANYING JEWELRY. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        The French Blues are the rarest set 
                        of diamonds in the world.  My 
                        calculations puts it around twenty 
                        plus carats.
                                 FINN
                        Twenty carats?  Seems like a lot of 
                        trouble...

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not the weight. It’s the cut 
                        and color - The Hope Diamond was 
                        cut from them.  Fell into private 
                        collection and then disappeared.  
                             (re: another diagram)
                        Three possibles, Vance included 
                        himself as a decoy.  His network is 
                        as deep as it is vast - Elise could 
                        be anywhere.  We have to get the 
                        stones.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        So, which of the other two?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m working on it.
                             (beat)
                        Yesterday it was a fourteen million 
                        job, today it’s nothing.  I’ll give 
                        you everything I have, the 
                        apartment, all my money.  I need 
                        your help.

           Jean-Luc takes a careful step forward, he can see the WEIGHT 
           on his FRIEND.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Money?  What the hell are you 
                        talking about?  It’s Elise.  We’ll 
                        do it.  No questions.

           Michael, in so much as he can express gratitude, accepts 
           that.  Finn nods.

                                 FINN
                        All in.

           Jean-Luc lights a cigarette, shaking out the match.  He keeps 
           his eyes pinned on the Michael’s hand drawn diagrams.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        We’re gonna need a fourth.  

           The subtext is clear - Michael crosses his arms.

                                 MICHAEL
                        If you’re thinking Jude, forget it.
                                 JEAN-LUC
                        I wasn’t thinking Jude.

           Michael takes a long beat...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t want to misunderstand you--

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Charlie.

           A long beat as the men remain locked on each other - 
           something flickers behind Michael’s eyes, he buries it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        He’s the best option we have.  He 
                        knows how you work and you’re going 
                        to need a number two. You can trust 
                        him--

                                 MICHAEL
                        --Forget it, we’ll do it with 
                        three.

                                 FINN
                        You guys want to fill me in?

           Michael turns back to the window, Jean-Luc studies him, 
           ignores Finn.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        He’ll do it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ve spoken with him?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        No, but I know him.  So do you.  
                        And, we can’t do this job with 
                        three.  I don’t even need to see 
                        the inside of any of these houses 
                        to know that.  Two at the vault and 
                        there’s no time to train either of 
                        us.

                                 FINN
                        Guys, hello?

           Jean-Luc glances at Finn.
                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Charlie.  Michael’s brother.

                                 FINN
                        You have a brother?

           Off that...

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

           CHARLIE KITSON (30s), rakish good looks complimented by the 
           always present twinkle in his eye, he smokes a cigarette in 
           bed, sheets tossed about as he stares at the ceiling.  

           Next to him, face down, the THIN CURVE of a WOMAN’S BACK - 
           she sleeps.

           Charlie’s cell phone vibrates - he glances at it, finally 
           picking it up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah?

           For a moment, silence, then...

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Charlie.  It’s Michael.

           Charlie sits up in bed, flicking his cigarette out the open 
           window.  The WOMAN moans a complaint, pulls the SHEET UP.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus, Michael, how are you?

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - SHOWROOM - SAME

           INTERCUT

           Michael sits at his desk - lights off, the showroom is 
           closed.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need your help.

           EXT. STREET - PARIS

           Michael sits in his SEDAN, waiting, his EYES LOCKED onto a 
           FRONT ENTRANCE OF A LUXURY APARTMENT BUILDING - and then, 
           GARLON VANCE exits, TWO BODYGUARDS - Russian, by their look.
           Michael raises a SMALL DIGITAL CAMERA - snaps off several 
           shots and then records VANCE and his men getting into a BLACK 
           LIMOUSINE - Michael focuses on the LICENSE plate - snapping 
           off a few shots before it pulls off...

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DARK

           Elise, dirty, face swollen from crying, wakes to a BANGING - 
           she orients herself:

           The ROOM, small, concrete, two SLATS for LIGHT, the DOOR 
           METAL.  TWO MORE BANGS --

                                 VOICE
                             (French)
                        Face the wall.

           Elise tries to stand, falls, tries again - the BOLT IS 
           THROWN, the DOOR OPENS HARD - someone is ON HER - PULLING A 
           DARK BURLAP SACK OVER HER HEAD --

           -- A CELL PHONE IS PRODUCED...

                                 ELISE
                        Please...

                                 VOICE
                             (French)
                        Shut it.

           The PERSON CHECKS the time, dials - HOLDS THE PHONE TO 
           ELISE’S EAR - through the sack --

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Elise?

           Elise, HOLDING IT TOGETHER but BARELY --

                                 ELISE
                        You made fun of my apricot brandy.  
                        You told me a joke...about nuns and 
                        priests--

           THE PHONE IS PULLED AWAY, the call terminated.  

                                 VOICE
                        Face the wall.

           She is SPUN to the wall, FOOD IS DROPPED ON THE GROUND - the 
           SACK RIPPED OFF - the DOOR SLAMS SHUT - and then silence.

           Elise breaks down --
           INT. MICHAEL’S SEDAN - MORNING

           Michael closes the phone, processes the sound of his wife’s 
           voice -- 

           EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - PARIS - MORNING

           -- He’s at AIRPORT PARKING, he heads into the airport.

           INT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - PARIS

           Michael waits as PASSENGERS EXIT through CUSTOMS.  CROWDS OF 
           PEOPLE pass him, his eyes scan - and then a TAP --

           -- He turns, CHARLIE smiles, leather jacket, jeans, unlit 
           cigarette in his mouth.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Brother, been a long time.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.  
                             (beat)
                        You look good, Charlie.  

           Charlie hugs Michael, who finally hugs back - then pulls 
           back.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Bags?

           Charlie motions to AN OLD KNAPSACK on his shoulder.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just this.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Come on...

           INT./ EXT - MICHAEL’S SEDAN -  DRIVING

           Michael keeps his eyes on the road, Charlie pulls out a smoke 
           -- lights up without asking.

           Micheal cracks his window...

                                 CHARLIE
                        You hear anything?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She calls every morning.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        They let you talk to her?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not exactly.  You have any problem 
                        getting over?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not at all.  Easy peasey.  You got 
                        any ideas who put you in this jam?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Turns out rich guys don’t like the 
                        word “no.”  She’s out there and 
                        I’ve made sure he doesn’t hurt her, 
                        but I’m gonna have to deliver.

           For a moment, they drive in silence.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nine fucking years, man.

           Michael doesn’t comment.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I see you’re still the great 
                        communicator.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I got a lot on my mind.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure.  You get the picture?

           Michael nods.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You got my cards, right?

           Charlie finishes his smoke.  Michael hangs a left, Charlie’s 
           tries to gauge him...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are we going to fucking talk about 
                        it or not?

           Michael PULLS THE CAR over hard, screeches into a parking 
           spot, tosses the gear shift into park - turns to Charlie.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I appreciate you helping me, I do.  
                        But, this isn’t a family reunion.  
                        We’re blood, that still means 
                        something to me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                        But, I’m not the forgetting type.  
                        I only have one rule --

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- I did it for you --

                                 MICHAEL
                        -- And, you broke it in the worst 
                        possible way.  
                             (beat)
                        I need your help, Charlie.  I’m 
                        counting the people I can trust on 
                        one hand.  They have my wife...do 
                        you understand?  My wife.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, I’m here.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You are, and I appreciate it.  
                        Maybe on the other side of this, 
                        we’ll work out our shit.  Until 
                        then, I need to know I can trust 
                        you.

           Charlie fishes out another cigarette, Michael takes from him 
           before he can light it.  In another place, Charlie is an 
           ALPHA, but not here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Say it.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (beat)
                        You can trust me.

           Michael hands the cigarette back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You should quit.

           Charlie lights it - exhales hard - tension streaming out with 
           the smoke...

                                 CHARLIE
                        That a rule, too?

           Michael drops the car into gear.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.  I just worry about you.
           He pulls back into traffic...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I got to run some errands, I’m 
                        gonna drop you with Jean-Luc.

           Charlie says nothing, smokes his cigarette.  Michael turns to 
           look at him...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you’re here, Charlie...

           Off that --

           INT. POLICE STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM - PARIS - DAY

           Amidst the coffee mugs a full ashtrays - Philip Renlow works - 
           the walls covered in MAPS and DATA regarding the HEIST.

           Lenz enters, fresh coffee, lit cigarette in his mouth.

                                 LENZ
                        Marx says you got something.  On 
                        the shooter?

                                 RENLOW
                        Not yet.  But, take a look at 
                        this...

           Renlow hands Lenz a document.  Lenz scans it as Renlow takes 
           his coffee.

                                 LENZ
                        Plates?

                                 RENLOW
                        Brand new, latest anti-
                        counterfeiting technology.  Bank 
                        didn’t record it to the box because 
                        they were trying to contain it.  
                        Loose lips and all that.

                                 LENZ
                        Appears they didn’t contain it 
                        enough.  How many people knew?

           Renlow shuffles some pages on the table.

                                 RENLOW
                        That’s the interesting part, only a 
                        handful of high level banking 
                        execs.

                             (finds the document)
                        Seven to be exact.

           Lenz stabs out his cigarette.

                                 LENZ
                        Did you set up interviews?

                                 RENLOW
                        I was waiting for you.

                                 LENZ
                        That was polite.

                                 RENLOW
                        I am British.

           Lenz smiles.

                                 LENZ
                        You want to surprise them, eh?  
                        You’re going to make a lot of 
                        important people upset.

           Renlow gathers his things, slips his WALLET into his jacket.

                                 RENLOW
                        You’d be surprised how fast my 
                        identification mollifies me against 
                        caring about that sort of thing.

           Lenz follows him out.

                                 LENZ
                        British...

           EXT. PARIS LOCATION - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Michael walks counting his steps, he makes a mental note.

                                 ELISE (O.C.)
                        You said we were going to the 
                        market?

                                  MICHAEL
                        Forty seven...

                        Fifty six across, I count four man-
                        holes.
           Michael OPENS a TOURIST MAP - adds the DATA in the margin.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let’s get some pictures.

           At this, Elise perks up.  Michael hands Jean-Luc his CAMERA. 
           He POSES with Elise - Jean-Luc SNAPS AWAY.

                                 ELISE
                        Do you find it odd?

                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s that, dear?

                                 ELISE
                        That every photograph we have of 
                        each other, one of your jobs is 
                        behind it?

           REVEAL:  They are STANDING in front of LE BANC DE PALLION - 
           the same bank Michael and crew robbed in the opening.

           Michael smiles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Say fromage.

           Jean-Luc snaps more, the BANK, the ENTRANCE, the TWO GUARDS, 
           the MAN HOLE COVERS, the AREA...

           EXT. STREET BY PARK - WALKING - FLASHBACK

           Michael and Elise walk, holding hands.  Jean-Luc smokes a 
           cigarette.

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        When are you going to get a wife, 
                        Jean-Luc?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        He gets a lot of wives...

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        I meant one of his own.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        I like being single.  No one tells 
                        me what to do.
                                 ELISE
                        I don’t tell Michael what to do.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Not with words, no...

           Elise laughs, playfully slaps Jean-Luc’s arm.

                                 ELISE
                        How dare you...

           Jean-Luc smiles, flicks his butt.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        I gotta go to work.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You meeting Finn?

           Jean-Luc nods.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Make sure he measures twice, I 
                        don’t want him blowing up half of 
                        Paris.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Of course.   

           He kisses Elise on the cheek and with that, crosses the 
           street and disappears down a subway stop. 

                                 ELISE
                        We need to find him a woman.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, we don’t.

                                 ELISE
                        He’d be happier.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s plenty happy. 

           They CROSS at a LIGHT...

                                 ELISE
                        How long to plan?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (beat)
                        It will be a little over five 
                        months all in.  Three to go...
                                 ELISE
                        Seems like a lot of work.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Rather do five months than five 
                        years.

           Elise WINDOW SHOPS as they walk.

                                 ELISE
                        Look...

           They STOP AT A TRAVEL AGENCY WINDOW - Elise scans the PHOTOS 
           of CITIES.  She points at ATHENS.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Never been, you?

           Michael shakes his head.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        We never had a proper honeymoon.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about Rome?

                                 ELISE
                        You mean when you stole the 
                        Raphael?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It was a Caravaggio.

           Michael kicks an invisible stone.  Elise takes his hand.

                                 ELISE
                        Rome was lovely.

           They walk off, hand in hand...

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - SHOWROOM

           Michael stares at a THE PICTURE of HIM AND ELISE by the BANK.  
           He can hear CHARLIE LAUGHING in the other room with Jean-Luc 
           and Finn.  Michael grabs a water, heads back...

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - GARAGE

           Michael enters, closes the door to the showroom.  Charlie and 
           Jean-Luc have slipped right back into their old relationship.  
           Finn regards them, an outsider.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Everyone caught up?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Son of a bitch hasn’t aged a day.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        French living.  Women, real butter, 
                        wine.

           Finn laughs.  Charlie smiles, not understanding.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fucking French...

           Michael pulls A HIDDEN CHAIN - releases the WALL OF TOOLS - 
           he GENTLY SWINGS THE false wall aside --

           REVEAL:  COMPLICATED DIAGRAMS and BLOWN UP GOOGLE IMAGE 
           PHOTOS of the three separate houses - each one with DATA 
           written underneath.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Yow.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not as bad as it looks.  The 
                        first one belongs to Vance.  This 
                        other one belongs to Dr. Rene Bell, 
                        import export specializing in 
                        antiquities.  He was a leading 
                        candidate until I found him in 
                        hospice.  Cancer.  That leaves --

           He points at a LARGE TUDOR in the CENTER - FLAT GRASS IN ALL 
           DIRECTION, long ASPHALT DRIVEWAY - GUARD GATE clear as day.

           Michael reads out of a LEATHER BINDER...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        -- Sir Gregory Winston, British ex-
                        pat now living in Lyon, made his 
                        money the old fashioned way, he 
                        stole it.  Started out at MI-5 and 
                        went private, took his rolodex of 
                        bad guys and began trading them 
                        like baseball cards.

           Jean-Luc takes in the board, the complexity of Michael’s 
           notes, all done in a short period of time.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        How did you isolate it?
                                 MICHAEL
                        In a second.  Becker is getting me 
                        the real plans, but according to 
                        sat photos avail online, Sir 
                        Gregory’s house sits in the center 
                        of five kilometers of grass and 
                        flat land.  I don’t need to see the 
                        specs on the house to know he’s got 
                        infrared and sonar out in that 
                        field.  No way we can come in 
                        anywhere but the road.

           Charlie steps forwards, studying the long asphalt.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Line of site looks like a thousand 
                        yards.
                             (beat)
                        How much you want to bet all the 
                        guards are rated for sharpshooting. 

                                 FINN
                        Speaking of guards, how many?

           Michael makes a notation in HIS LEATHER BINDER.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m going to find out, but it’s at 
                        least six.  Probably double for 
                        special occasions.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you know this is the house?

           Michael pulls A FRENCH NEWSPAPER, open to the SOCIAL PAGE.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because he’s throwing a party.

           REVEAL:  Article about Sir Gregory Winston and his wife’s 
           anniversary party.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Just because he makes his money 
                        illegally doesn’t mean he’s not 
                        trying to be legit.   

           Jean-Luc examines the article.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Son of a bitch.
                                 FINN
                        What do you get for the lady who 
                        has everything?

                                 MICHAEL
                        The French Blues are unique, there 
                        is only one set in the world.  You 
                        don’t obtain them unless you’re 
                        planning on showing them.  He’s 
                        throwing a party for his wife, but 
                        the guest of honor will be the 
                        diamonds.

           Everyone remains silent, waiting.  Jean-Luc lights a 
           cigarette.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        How hard is it to get invited to 
                        that party?

           Michael turns back to the wall...

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s going to be impossible.

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

           Elise, food barely touched, bangs on the thick door.  She 
           sees it’s made of thick wood - something carved into it from 
           long ago...

           No one responds to her banging.  She surveys the rest of the 
           room - STONE walls, thin mattress on the floor - high window, 
           out of her reach or view.

           She HEARS FOOTSTEPS...

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        Hello?  Is anyone there?

           Nothing.  She examines the room again, listens INTENTLY.  In 
           the DISTANCE she can hear WATER, a river?  She can’t be sure.

           She finally leans against the stone wall, begins humming a 
           song...

           INT. HALL OUTSIDE ELISE’S DOOR - SAME

           A MAN, MASK pulled down, listens...
           EXT. BANK OF MUNICH - PARIS

           Michael LIMPS up the STAIRS as RENLOW and LENZ are EXITING - 
           Renlow holds the door as Michael enters...

                                 RENLOW
                             (French)
                        Futball?

           Michael looks up, takes in Renlow - the tie, the suit, the 
           expensive shoes...

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Icy steps, it’s a few years old.

           Michael enters, the door closing behind him -- Lenz lights up 
           another cigarette.

                                 RENLOW
                        You realize you probably already 
                        have cancer.

                                 LENZ
                        Then no reason to quit, eh?

           Renlow can’t help but smile, his eyes looking back at the 
           door.  

                                 RENLOW
                        Let’s get a list of Herr Becker’s 
                        clients and see what we can see.

           INT. BECKER’S PRIVATE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The door CLICKS shut, Becker stands by a BUREAU, his back to 
           Michael.

                                 BECKER
                        How’s Elise?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who was the cop?

           Becker turns.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Interpol?

                                 BECKER
                        How did you know?
                                 MICHAEL
                        He wasn’t French. And his Huntsman 
                        suit was frayed by the lapel, I 
                        assume from pulling his badge out. 

                                 BECKER
                        He did seem rather fond of it.  His 
                        name is Renlow, he was here about 
                        the thing from the other day.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah?

                                 BECKER
                        Not to worry.  It was a fishing 
                        expedition.  And, it was expected.

           Becker removes a THICK rolled SCHEMATIC from his bag.  Both 
           men approach his desk.  Becker rolls it out as Michael pulls 
           MEASURING TOOLS from his jacket.

           REVEAL:  It’s a DIAGRAM from SIR WINSTON’S HOUSE.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where did you get them?

                                 BECKER
                        They’re real.

           Michael scans the DIAGRAM.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I see Sir Winston spares no 
                        expense.  Looks like a Bradley.

           Becker peers at the diagram.

                                 BECKER
                        That’s unfortunate.

           Michael studies the rest of the layout, pays close attention 
           to the kitchen.

                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                        How will you get in?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m working on it. May I keep 
                        these?

           Becker nods, Michael rolls the DIAGRAM.

           Michael fishes out a THIN ENVELOPE from his jacket - hands it 
           to Becker.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I need you to get into this.  Full 
                        work up, mainly the guys in his 
                        inner circle.

           Becker opens the envelope, glances at the info -- PHOTOS OF 
           GARLON VANCE, HIS TEAM, HIS SUV, LICENSE PLATE, ETC..

           -- folds it and places it inside his jacket.

                                 BECKER
                        I’ll have it in forty eight hours. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Use the drop.  If Interpol is 
                        fishing, they might get lucky.  
                        Better if we don’t do the face to 
                        face for a bit.

           Michael turns to leave.  Becker walks him to the door.

                                 BECKER
                        Will you be able to pull this off?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Do I have a choice?

           Off that...

           EXT. BANK OF MUNICH - PARIS

           Michael hobbles down the steps, Jean-Luc and Charlie share a 
           smoke at the car.  Finn sits in the driver seat.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        What’d we find out?

                                 MICHAEL
                        A Bradley.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fucking hell, why not just swallow 
                        them?

           Jean-Luc spits, Finn gets out of the car...

                                 FINN
                        What’s a Bradley?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Bradley safe, each one individually 
                        cut - no plans, no design.
                                 JEAN-LUC
                        No way to know what we’re dealing 
                        with until we see it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And even then...

           A pregnant beat.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We can’t pack for a trip like this.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        We could wait for them to be on 
                        display, he’s gonna show them...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Too many people, lots of semi-
                        automatics with the safeties off.  
                        Being afraid is part of the 
                        display.

                                 CHARLIE
                        For Elise...maybe it’s worth it.

           Michael gets suddenly irritated --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Worth it how?  Pulling back to back 
                        life stretches?  Guy’s got a 
                        terabyte of pipeline running from 
                        his house you don’t think he’s 
                        streaming every square inch to 
                        several locations?  Even if we shot 
                        our way out of there we wouldn’t 
                        get to Belgium before our faces 
                        would be on every watchlist in six 
                        countries.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus, man, relax...it was an idea.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s not an idea, it’s a death 
                        sentence.  When you’re a gun every 
                        solution is a bullet.  The guy’s 
                        British Intelligence, not some 
                        liquor store.  Use your head.  We 
                        can’t cowboy our way in there.
                             (beat)
                        I gotta think.  I’ll meet you guys 
                        at the pub later.
           Michael limps away, Jean-Luc and Charlie share a look.  
           Charlie and Finn get into the car, Jean-Luc jogs after to 
           Michael...

           EXT. STREETS - PARIS - VARIOUS

           Michael is easy to catch, Jean-Luc makes no effort to stop 
           him, instead matching his stride.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        I’ll keep you company.

           Michael keeps moving.

                                 JEAN-LUC (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t know any better.

           Michael shakes his head, incredulous.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who are you talking to?--

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        --He’s impulsive.  And, with Jude 
                        gone, we need him.

           Michael studies the PEOPLE as they pass him - he spots a 
           BAKED GOODS SHOP, lets his eyes stay on it for a beat...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m not mad at him.  Charlie is who 
                        he is...I don’t expect anything 
                        from him.  When it counts, he’ll be 
                        there, I know...

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Then what?  The Bradley?  We’ve 
                        dealt with worse.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, we haven’t.  Not with so much 
                        to lose.  Two weeks to plan a job I 
                        wouldn’t take if I had a year.  

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        You’re going to get your wife back.  
                        You have my word.

           Michael stops at a corner, waits for traffic.
                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Appreciate that, Jean-Luc.  
                             (English)
                        I’ll see you at the pub at nine.

           Jean-Luc nods, heads off.

           INT. LE TRAIN BLEU AT GARE DE LYON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT - 
           FLASHBACK

           Perhaps the most refined restaurant in PARIS, Le Train Bleu 
           was built for the 1900 World’s Fair and still contains the 
           elegance of the time --

           -- Large beveled MIRRORS and HUGE WINDOWS frame the room, the 
           VIEW OF THE TRAIN STATION, lit for the night, give the 
           evening a MAGICAL FEELING.

           Elise, GORGEOUS in her SIMPLE WEDDING DRESS, lights the room 
           with her smile. 

                                 JEAN-LUC (O.C.)
                             (French)
                        You are a lucky man.

           Michael, several steps away, elegant in his BLACK TUXEDO, 
           perfectly at home in a bow tie, sips his CHAMPAGNE and 
           watches his NEW WIFE work the room.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.  The luckiest, I think.

           Jean-Luc, also in a tuxedo and ever present CIGARETTE, holds 
           a ROCKS GLASS.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        So you told her...everything?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.  

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        And she stayed?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You see her there, right?

           Jean-Luc chuckles, Jude and Finn approach.  A FEW OTHER BLACK 
           TIE GUESTS offer their CONGRATULATIONS as they pass.  
           Michael, all smiles...
                                 JUDE
                        We should rob this place, there 
                        must be ten bottles of Romanee-
                        Conti behind the bar.

           Michael chuckles.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        What?  They’re worth like twenty 
                        thousand Euro a piece.

           Jean-Luc stabs out his cigarette into an ashtray.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        What do you say, Michael, want to 
                        take down a quick score before 
                        Rome?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I was already planning on skipping 
                        on the check, so...

           Finn raises his glass.

                                 FINN
                        To Michael and Elise...not sure who 
                        stole whose heart, but I’m glad for 
                        both of you.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        I thought the Irish were supposed 
                        to be poetic?

           Michael raises his glass, the men do the same.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fellas, couldn’t imagine it without 
                        you.  Cheers.

           They drink.  

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Where are we with the uniforms?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Done, they’ll be waiting for us at 
                        the hotel. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Double check the route when you get 
                        there, I’m worried about timing.  
                        Six blocks from St. Peters the 
                        police tend to --
                                 JEAN-LUC
                        -- Michael, it’s your wedding.  
                        Forget it, we work tomorrow.

           Michael sets his glass done, sees Elise motioning for him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thanks.

           Michael, happy as he’s ever been, goes to his wife.

                                 JUDE
                        And so it begins...

           INT. LE TRAIN BLEU - MAKE SHIFT DANCE FLOOR

           Michael and Elise dance, unaware of the fifty BLACK TIE 
           GUESTS watching them.  Elise keeps her eyes locked on her 
           husband.

                                 ELISE
                        This is too much...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Now you tell me.

           She hugs him as they dance.  

                                 ELISE
                        I know it’s too much to ask that it 
                        always be like this...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Be like what?

                                 ELISE
                        Safe.  With you...

           Michael kisses her cheek, holds her...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I won’t let you go.

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        I love you.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        I love you, too.  Wife.

           She kisses him as the GUESTS APPLAUD - lights FLASH AS WE --
           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT

           Michael’s PRIVATE work area - the SOLID STEEL DOOR is AJAR - 
           letting AIR in...Michael dials a LAND LINE...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, it’s Michael...yes, thank 
                        you...thought maybe I’d come visit.
                             (long beat)
                        Then I guess you know how important 
                        it is...tomorrow, and I’m bringing 
                        a guest.  Don’t get your hopes up. 

           He hangs up.

           We SEE:  MAPS AND DATA covers the WALL - a FEW AREAS 
           HIGHLIGHTED IN BELGIUM - the NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES also 
           present.

           A LARGE X through the U.K.

           Michael MACHINES something, a LONG CHROME TUBE, FIVE 
           CENTIMETERS in DIAMETER - he BRUSHES an END, blowing the dust 
           away - checks to see if a THIN METAL ROD will fit inside - 
           the MEASUREMENT is EXACT.

           He sets it down next to THREE MORE.  Picks up his LEATHER 
           BINDER, makes a NOTATION - we SEE MICHAEL’S NOTES for the 
           first time, written in SOME SORT OF CODE.

           Michael turns to STARE AT THE WALL, he studies the map.  
           Stands, runs his fingers over various locations.  Finally, 
           settling in LYON, represented by a SMALL PHOTO of SIR 
           WINSTON.

           He sets those thoughts aside, checks on an EPOXY he’s been 
           mixing - it’s the color of WET SAND.  He uses a ROD to test 
           it’s THICKNESS.  It’s too SOUPY, he rechecks his calculations 
           and begins mixing a NEW BATCH...

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION

           Elise opens her eyes, GLASSY AND RED, she rolls over, there’s 
           FRESH FOOD - a HUNK OF CHEESE, some BREAD.  She picks up the 
           bread, eats it.

           She PICKS UP THE CHEESE block, removes a TORN PIECE OF 
           WRAPPER - EXAMINES IT, as she BITES THE CHEESE.
           INT. FRENCH PUB - NIGHT

           Charlie, Jean-Luc and Finn are all drinking when Michael 
           arrives.  He walks right to Charlie.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sorry about today.  As you can 
                        imagine--

                                 CHARLIE
                        -- Forget it, forget it.  You love 
                        her.  I shouldn’t open my big mouth 
                        before thinking.

           Michael hugs CHARLIE - Charlie surprised, HUGS HIM BACK.  
           Jean-Luc takes it all in.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Two Americans hugging in a French 
                        bar...

           Finn laughs.  Michael releases Charlie, slapping his back, 
           pulls a HAND WRITTEN NOTE from his pocket - hands it to Jean-
           Luc who reads it.

                                 JEAN-LUC (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have it by the weekend. What 
                        are you going to do?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Charlie and I are taking a trip.
                        Make sure you get him to the Orly 
                        at nine.  

           Jean-Luc, surprised...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where we going?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Dublin. 

           Finn perks up.  

                                 FINN
                        Really?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Bad call, Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t have a choice. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Dublin?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sure Jean-Luc will fill you in.  
                        Don’t stay out too late tonight.  
                        Nine am, see you tomorrow.

           With that, Michael exits.  Jean-Luc studies him as he leaves, 
           his face darkening...

           EXT. AIR FIELD - MORNING

           A PRIVATE PLANE SITS, stairs down.  Michael, alone, EAR BUDS 
           IN, LISTENING to something...

                                 ELISE
                             (recorded)
                        You made a joke, your friends 
                        laughed...but I didn’t.  I asked 
                        you where you were from --

           *CLICK* the call cuts off - Michael taps his phone, the 
           recorded call replays...

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                             (recorded)
                        You made a joke, your friends 
                        laughed...but I didn’t.  I asked 
                        you where you were from --

           Jean-Luc’s BLACK BMW pulls up, Charlie gets out with Jean-
           Luc.  Michael waves Charlie to the plane, Jean-Luc 
           approaches.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Let’s find another way.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is no other way and we need 
                        what he knows.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        O’Shea is a liar, a thief and a 
                        killer.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And what are we? 

           Michael heads to the plane.  Charlie catches up to him.
                                 CHARLIE
                        This O’Shea, I’m getting the idea 
                        Jean-Luc ain’t a fan.

           Michael glances back, Jean-Luc looking the other way, 
           smoking.

                                 MICHAEL
                        O’Shea and Jean-Luc were partners, 
                        back in the old days...

                                 CHARLIE
                        So?

                                 MICHAEL
                        O’Shea accused Jean-Luc of ripping 
                        him off, they had a...disagreement.
                             (beat)
                        Jean-Luc shot him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And you still work with him?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It was before my time.

           Michael gets in the plane.  Charlie looks to Jean-Luc who is 
           finishing a smoke.  He flicks the butt and heads back to his 
           car.

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY THROUGH TO CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Renlow picks up Lenz as he’s adding SUGAR to his morning 
           coffee.

                                 RENLOW
                        I brought you one.

           Reveal:  Renlow carrying two coffees.

                                 LENZ
                        I take it a certain way.

           Renlow tosses it in the trash.

                                 RENLOW
                        Got the banker’s list.

                                 LENZ
                        And?
                                 RENLOW
                        Usual boring rich guys, a Saudi 
                        prince, heiress to something or 
                        other...and one used car salesman.

           Beat.

                                 LENZ
                        You have a thing about teasing out 
                        information, anyone ever told you 
                        that?

                                 RENLOW
                        Michael Kitson, American Ex-Pat, 
                        runs a car dealership if you can 
                        believe it.  Kitson Motors. 

                                 LENZ
                        And...

                                 RENLOW
                        Sells American muscle cars, my 
                        favorite to be honest.  Only thing 
                        Americans do truly well, besides 
                        blowing things up.

                                 LENZ
                        So, Becker has a client who’s 
                        American, so what?

                                 RENLOW
                        Kitson has a record.  

           Renlow hands Lenz a file, Lenz scans it...

                                 LENZ
                        It says here it was expunged.

                                 RENLOW
                        Membership has its privileges.  I 
                        wouldn’t even have found it except 
                        I did a cross check for family and 
                        discovered it through his brother.  

           Another beat...Lenz rolls his eyes, waves his hand.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Charlie Kitson, lives in New York, 
                        arrested nine years ago, assault 
                        with intent, security guard, gold 
                        depository. 

           Lenz stops, finishes reading the file.
                                 LENZ
                        Doesn’t say anything about a 
                        robbery here.

           Renlow produces a COMPUTER PRINT OUT from the NEW YORK TIMES.  
           The headline:  DIAMOND HEIST DISRUPTED BY OFF-DUTY GUARD.

                                 RENLOW
                        That’s because they didn’t get to 
                        rob it.  Guard forgot his lunch 
                        pail.  You have to love that, four 
                        million dollars in bullion saved by 
                        an empty box.  Anyway, he surprised 
                        them, everyone scattered but not 
                        before the guard got a look at 
                        Michael Kitson.  He files a report, 
                        three days later he gets his face 
                        kicked in by Charlie Kitson.  
                        Recants the whole thing.  Michael’s 
                        indictment expunged, Charlie gets 
                        charged, does a week in the pen and 
                        the security guard disappears.

           Lenz sets down his coffee, lights a cigarette - Renlow 
           DRAMATICALLY OPENS A WINDOW begins waving air in...

                                 LENZ
                        Pretty thin.  Young guy makes a 
                        mistake, moves to Paris to start 
                        over, runs a respectable auto 
                        dealership, pays our outrageous 
                        taxes on time, even says here he’s 
                        married.

           Renlow flips the file, points.  Lenz reads --

                                 LENZ (CONT’D)
                        Left his tools behind, so...
                             (then)
                        Oh.

                                 RENLOW
                        That’s right.  Hand made drill bit, 
                        signature stuff.  Recognize the 
                        signature?

           Lenz PULLS A PHOTO of the LARGE DRILL BIT, PINS IT to a PUNCH 
           BOARD.  Takes a PHOTO FROM THE BANK OF PALLION, places it 
           next to the OLD PHOTO - THEY’RE THE SAME DRILL BIT.

                                 LENZ
                             (French)

                                 RENLOW
                        Want to see dessert?

           Renlow holds up his SMART PHONE - Lenz looks at the picture - 
           a STILL FROM AN AIRPORT SECURITY CAMERA - IT’S CHARLIE.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Charlie’s in Paris.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN

           SEVERAL COPS are GATHERED -- Renlow stands in front --

                                 RENLOW
                        Round the clock surveillance on 
                        everything he does, who he talks to 
                        and who they talk to--

                                 FRENCH CHIEF
                             (French)
                        And who is paying for this?

                                 RENLOW
                             (French)
                        INTERPOL will cover all overtime 
                        and additional expenses.
                             (English)
                        Soon as we locate the brother we 
                        run the same set up on him.  These 
                        jobs are complicated and I’ve 
                        already IDed several more he might 
                        have had a hand in - I expect it 
                        will be a tight crew, probably no 
                        more than four.  We need them all, 
                        they won’t all be as smart as him.

           A FRENCH POLICEMAN raises his hand, Renlow nods.

                                 FRENCH POLICEMAN
                             (French)
                        Says here the wife works at a 
                        retirement home?  

                                 RENLOW
                        Yes, let’s get a body on her as 
                        well.  No way he’s been doing this 
                        for this long without her consent.  
                        Wives make good wedges, trust me.

           A FEW CHUCKLES --
                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, everyone regards the 
                        Parisian Police as some of the best 
                        in the world.  Michael Kitson has 
                        been living here for eight years 
                        stealing what he wants, when he 
                        wants.  That makes him smart and 
                        pragmatic.  He makes us, he’ll be 
                        gone.  Let’s be invisible.  That’s 
                        it. 

           The ROOM breaks up.  Lenz catches Renlow as he’s packing up 
           his presentation.

                                 LENZ
                        Best in the world?

                                 RENLOW
                        Sometimes you have to see them for 
                        who they want to be. 

           EXT. TEMPLE BAR REGION - DUBLIN - DAY

           Amidst the COBBLESTONE streets and 18th century houses, 
           Michael and Charlie get out of an AUDI A8, Michael driving.

           Michael heads for an OLD WOODEN DOOR -- Charlie right 
           behind...Michael PRESSES a BUZZER - the BOX CLICKS --

                                 VOICE
                        Yes?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s me.

           The DOOR BUZZES --

           INT. DUBLIN HOUSE - SAME

           If the outside is 18th century, the INSIDE IS 22nd.  Smooth 
           concrete floors, glass partitions - and RAMPS instead of 
           stairs...everything white and pristine.

                                 CHARLIE
                        O’Shea into roller blading?

           At that,  DOUGLAS O’SHEA (50s) rolls out in his WHEELCHAIR.  
           Even though he’s older, his HAIR BLACK AS NIGHT, SLICKED and 
           trimmed.  

           Michael walks right to him, hand out - O’Shea takes it.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Good to see you.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Where’s the marksman?

                                 MICHAEL
                        In Paris.  

           O’Shea looks to Charlie.

                                 O’SHEA
                        And whose this?

           Michael steps back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        My brother, Charlie.

           At this, O’Shea smiles -- rolls close to Charlie for a closer 
           look.

                                 O’SHEA
                        He’s better looking than you, 
                        Michael.  Keep your eye on him.

           Charlie smiles...

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ve heard a lot about you.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Oh, I doubt that.

           O’Shea spins his chair, faces Michael.

                                 O’SHEA (CONT’D)
                        No time for chit chat, I assume.  
                        Follow me...

           He ROLLS down a LONG RAMP - the men follow...

           INT. O’SHEA HOUSE - COMPUTER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           After everyone is inside...

                                 O’SHEA
                        Michael, close the door, would ya?

           Michael does - the CLOSED DOOR FORMS A SEAL and all the 
           COMPUTERS COME TO LIFE --
           -- Michael takes in the room, the clean lines, nothing 
           wasted.  Walks to a GLASS TABLE, low to the ground for 
           O’Shea.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice set up. 

                                 O’SHEA
                        Cell and radio blocker, nothing 
                        getting in or out.  Let’s see it.

           Michael rolls out the DIAGRAM of SIR WINSTON’S HOUSE -- 
           O’Shea studies it...

                                 O’SHEA (CONT’D)
                        Where did you get these?

           Michael doesn’t answer.  O’Shea points to the LAND, examines 
           the LINES leading back to the house.

                                 O’SHEA (CONT’D)
                        He lit the lawn.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Meaning what?

                                 O’SHEA
                        By the looks of the it I’d say he’s 
                        got it wired every three feet or 
                        so.  Means unless you can do the 
                        geal-ruith you’re taking a 
                        different way in.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Geal-ruith?

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re going in a different way.

                                 O’SHEA
                        How?

           Michael ignores the question, points to the KITCHEN.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What can you tell me about this?

                                 O’SHEA
                        It’s a kitchen, I assume for 
                        cooking.

           Michael points more directly...
                                 MICHAEL
                        The box underneath it, three meters 
                        south.  The Bradley.

           O’Shea takes a closer look, pulls back LOCKING EYES with 
           MICHAEL.  Opens a drawer, removes a SMALL MAGNIFYING GLASS, 
           PRESSES it over the spot.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Sonofabitch, a Bradley.  When was 
                        the house built?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh-five.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Any work since?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not that I can find.  It’s in 
                        France, Lyon.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Who owns it?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’d rather not say.

                                 O’SHEA
                        All you have is a year?  That’s not 
                        giving me much.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s British.  

           O’Shea types, the computer hums...

                                 O’SHEA
                        Sir Gregory Winston.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus, how did you do that?

           O’Shea chortles.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Kiddo, when you spend all day in a 
                        chair, you find ways to amuse 
                        yourself.  The data is out there, 
                        all of it.  Trust me.
                             (to Michael)
                                 (MORE)
                                 O’SHEA (CONT'D)
                        Winston was MI-5, means he’s 
                        think’s he’s royalty and that makes 
                        him a snob.  Means he’d use someone 
                        he knows...and it will be someone 
                        from the Ilse.

           O’Shea spins back, takes another look at the BLANK SPOT on 
           the diagram. 

                                 O’SHEA (CONT’D)
                        Thomas Kaide.  Works out of 
                        Kensington, did a Bradley about 
                        this size for Astin of Astin 
                        Martin.  I imagine with a bit of 
                        digging you can place him in Lyon 
                        around the time of construction.

           Michael MAKES NOTATIONS IN HIS LEATHER NOTEBOOK.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Kaide...you’re sure?

                                 O’SHEA
                        You do your thing, I do mine... 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where do I find him?

           Beat.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Tennyson Cemetery, plot G 54.  Died 
                        of lung cancer two years ago.

           Michael let’s that sit, his mind processing.  Charlie, 
           clearly dejected...

                                 CHARLIE
                        This keeps getting better and 
                        better. 

           O’Shea leans back, takes in Charlie.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Cheer up, dear boy.  It’s not the 
                        end of the rainbow.  Safe builders 
                        are artists...

           Michael locks eyes with O’Shea...

                                 MICHAEL
                        When you master oils, you don’t 
                        switch to watercolor.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        Fellas, I don’t mind saying, I 
                        don’t know what the hell you’re 
                        talking about.  Do we have a way 
                        through the Bradley or don’t we?

           O’Shea smiles...

                                 MICHAEL
                        You knew him?  Kaide?

                                 O’SHEA
                        Not particularly...but I knew his 
                        work.  In detail.

           For a moment, nothing but the humming of the computers.  
           O’Shea gives Michael an amused look.

                                 MICHAEL
                        -- How much?

           O’Shea’s eyes flicker to Charlie.  Michael opens the DOOR - 
           the COMPUTERS ALL SHUT off...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Charlie, you mind?

           Charlie gets it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure, was gonna have a smoke 
                        anyway.

                                 O’SHEA
                        Take it outside, if you please.  A 
                        minute of pleasure leaves me a 
                        day’s worth of smell.

           Charlie exits, Michael pulls the door closed...

           INT. DUBLIN HOUSE - FROM COMPUTER ROOM TO FRONT DOOR

           Charlie LIGHTS his CIGARETTE in the house, exhaling SMOKE as 
           he does...he drops the extinguished match on the floor, 
           exits...

           INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SAME

           O’Shea looks to Michael.

                                 O’SHEA
                        So, the Bradley.
                                 MICHAEL
                        The Bradley...

           EXT. O’SHEA’S HOME - DUBLIN - LATER

           Michael finds Charlie smoking, leaning against the Audi.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can see why Jean-Luc shot him.
                             (beat)
                        How much the cripple bastard 
                        charging us?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ten points --

           Charlie whistles...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        It was worth it, trust me.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Quarter plate, titanium skin 
                        wrapping half a meter stainless 
                        spikes.  Six, possibly eight.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Timed?

           Michael nods.

                                 MICHAEL
                        If previous work holds up, multiple 
                        cell and hard lines - but, no heat 
                        sensor.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Means we can work hot.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And fast. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Great, let’s get started.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I gotta work solo for a bit, half 
                        the supplies need to be collected 
                        by hand.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s use the G-5.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Can’t.  Flight plans, airfields, 
                        security personal...might as well 
                        leave bread crumbs.
                             (beat)
                        And, we have no time to spread it 
                        out.

           Michael tosses Charlie the keys.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        The jet will take you back.  I’ll 
                        fly commercial.  I’ve got a few 
                        passports, I can keep it 
                        interesting.  I’ll phone if I get 
                        in a jam.  Jean-Luc will have a few 
                        things to do, he’ll need your help.

           Michael’s already walking.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When are you getting back?

                                 MICHAEL
                        When I get back...

           Off that...

           INT. POLICE STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM

           Renlow stares out the window at the CITYSCAPE - his mind 
           chews something...Lenz and a FRENCH DETECTIVE (HANNAH NOEN, 
           30) enter.

                                 LENZ
                        Philip?

           Renlow turns, charm turning on for Hannah...

                                 RENLOW
                        Yes?

                                 LENZ
                        Detective Noen, go ahead.

                                 HANNAH
                        I paid a visit to the wife’s job, 
                        acting as a concerned daughter 
                        looking for a home for my dad.

           Renlow smiles warmly...
                                 RENLOW
                        Clever.

           Lenz rolls his eyes.  Hannah continues...

                                 HANNAH
                        Told them I’d heard good things 
                        about the staff, particularly Mrs. 
                        Kitson.  I asked to meet her.  
                        Turns out she hasn’t been around 
                        for a few days.  One of the nurses 
                        confided that her husband even came 
                        by looking for her...

           Renlow stops smiling--

                                 RENLOW
                        Looking for her, as in she left 
                        him?

                                 HANNAH
                        It was girl talk, but the nurse 
                        said he was very concerned.  And, 
                        according to her, this is not a guy 
                        who gets concerned.

           Off Renlow considering....

           INT. PUB - DUBLIN

           The late day PUB crowd thin -- Michael works in a corner, 
           DARK STOUT parked on his table - SMALL EURO MAP open in front 
           of him - he works without taking notes.

                                 ELISE (V.O.)
                        ...I didn’t laugh.  You complained 
                        about the food.  I thought you were 
                        rude, but cute...

           -- Michael folds the map, puts it in his pocket --

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - LATE DAY

           Michael changes clothes in the stall -- stuffs the dirty 
           clothes into his PACK - reviews VARIOUS PASSPORTS - settles 
           on a GERMAN ONE --

           INT. DUBLIN AIRPORT -  LUFTHANSA DESK

           Michael steps to the counter - presents his passport --
                                 MICHAEL
                             (German)
                        Six fifteen have any seats?

           The GERMAN DESK CLERK types --

                                 DESK CLERK
                             (German)
                        Yes, Mr. Franks.  Returning?

           Michael hands SEVERAL HUNDRED EURO --

           INT. LUFTHANSA AIRLINE - FLYING - EVENING

           Michael, EAR BUDS IN - listens to ELISE’S VOICE - the small 
           bits of her voice comforting --

           He WRITES A LIST in his LEATHER BINDER -- 

           EXT. EAST BERLIN - MORNING

           Michael jumps off a CITY BUS, walks a short distance - 

                                 ELISE (V.O.)
                        ...It was already late, I was 
                        tired, but you were persistent.  
                        Your friends disappeared...it 
                        seemed like it was just you and 
                        I...

           He PASSES SHUTTERED STORE FRONTS, garbage litters the street 
           matched only by the unreadable graffiti on the walls--

           INT. HEIFLER METALS - DAY

           Michael enters on a BELL - the VERY OLD SHOP, every square in 
           covered in METAL PARTS and JUNK - barely any room to find the 
           counter.

           IVAN HEIFLER, 27, ARMS COVERED in TATOOS, EARRINGS, SILVER 
           SPIKE through one EYEBROW --

                                 IVAN
                             (German)
                        You lost?

           Michael takes Ivan in - 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (German)
                        Looking for Jan.
                                 IVAN
                        American?

           Michael nods.  Ivan switches to fluent English, with almost 
           no accent...

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        He’s dead.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

           For a moment, Michael considers his options.

                                 IVAN
                        Something I can help you with?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Maybe, I have a welding question.  
                        Specifically burn ratios on a Denzo 
                        welding rod.

                                 IVAN
                        What’s the metal?

           Michael opens his LEATHER BINDER, spins it so Ivan can see.  
           Ivan takes a long look.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Titanium alloy.

                                 IVAN
                        Vault?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Does that matter?

                                 IVAN
                        Plates can run thick, but usually 
                        nothing behind it, you get weld 
                        drips in there might seal up a gear 
                        head, makes the vault hard to open.

           Michael shifts, uncomfortable.  Ivan notices.

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s a family business.
                             (then)
                        I wouldn’t use the Denzos for this.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need a fast burn.
                                 IVAN
                        How fast?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hundred and twenty seconds.

           Ivan lets up a low whistle.

                                 IVAN
                        You’re talking twelve hundred 
                        degrees, maybe more.  Hope there’s 
                        no paper inside.

           Michael says nothing, waits --

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        How many you need?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Three, plus a backup.

                                 IVAN
                        When?

           Michael takes a beat.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Five days.  

           Ivan closes the binder, hands it back.

                                 IVAN
                        I’m going to have to make them by 
                        hand.  Ten thousand a piece.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Send the account number here, 
                        you’ll have the money in twenty 
                        four hours.  Ship them to the 
                        address on the back.  Discretion is 
                        appreciated.

                                 IVAN
                        Like I said, it’s a family 
                        business.

           Michael stuffs the LEATHER BINDER INTO HIS JACKET, exits as 
           the BELL RINGS above the door--
           INT. APARTMENT  - NIGHT - RAINING  - FLASHBACK

           Michael enters quietly, Elise sits in the living room, glass 
           of wine and a cigarette.  Michael leans against the door-
           frame.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I figured you’d be gone.

           Elise nods.  He looks down, sees HER SUITCASE.

                                 ELISE
                        You said you had something to ask 
                        me.  

           Michael shifts, water puddling up on the floor by his feet.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Well?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It can wait.

                                 ELISE
                        Can it?

           Michael sets his things down, approaches her cautiously, sits 
           across from her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It wasn’t fair to lie to you and I 
                        apologize.  It’s not the kind of 
                        thing you print business cards for.

           Elise stabs out her cigarette.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never told anyone before --

           Elise looks up at him.

                                 ELISE
                        -- That you’re a thief? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t have any sort of jail yard 
                        philosophy about it and I’m not 
                        Robin Hood.  It’s a job...and I’m 
                        very good at it.

                                 ELISE
                        What happens if you get arrested --
                                 MICHAEL
                        -- I won’t.

                                 ELISE
                        Or shot.  Maybe you can outsmart 
                        the police but you can’t outsmart a 
                        bullet.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (beat)
                        I can.

           For a moment, the only noise is the rain.

                                 ELISE
                        I don’t know what hurts me more, 
                        that you lied to me or that you 
                        didn’t trust me.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Elise...

                                 ELISE
                        You made an assumption about me, 
                        that I wouldn’t love you...that I 
                        would leave you.  It makes me feel 
                        like you don’t know my heart.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I told you because I am in love 
                        with you.  I told you because I 
                        trust you.

           Elise gets that, softens a bit at hearing it.

                                 ELISE
                        What was the question?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It can wait.  Really.

                                 ELISE
                        Michael, ask me the question...

           Michael exhales slowly, reaches into his jacket and produces 
           a small velvet box - he slides off the chair onto one knee.  
           Elise covers her mouth - afraid she might scream...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wanted to know if you would do me 
                        the honor of being my wife.
           He opens the box - a VINTAGE RING, CARAT and A HALF, nothing 
           flashy but QUITE BEAUTIFUL.  Elise stares at it for a long 
           time.

                                 ELISE
                        Yes.

           She falls into his arms, KNOCKING HIM OVER, KISSING HIM --

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Wrapped up in the SHEETS, Elise rests her head on Michael’s 
           chest, she admires the ring now on her finger.

           Michael strokes her hair, his eyes on the rain splattering 
           the window pane.

                                 ELISE
                        It’s a beautiful ring.

           A long beat.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not stolen.

           They both laugh.  She KISSES HIM - holds his face.

                                 ELISE
                        No more secrets, okay?

           Michael nods.  Elise puts her head back on his chest.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re going to be okay with this?

                                 ELISE
                        My mother would have preferred a 
                        doctor, but...yeah, I will be okay 
                        with it.  As long as you don’t lie 
                        to me about it...I don’t want to be 
                        married to a spook.

           Michael slides her off and reaches for a GLASS OF WATER, 
           drinking.  He leans up on the headboard...

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Is there something else?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes. If we’re going to do this.  If 
                        you’re going to know who I am and 
                        what I do, and people are going to 
                        know you’re my wife...
           Michael takes a moment, trying to find the correct way to 
           phrase it...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Because of what I do, there is a 
                        chance, however small, that someone 
                        might use you to get me.
                             (bear)
                        Someone might take you, do you 
                        understand?

           Beat.

                                 ELISE
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good.  Then we’re going to need a 
                        story.

                                 ELISE
                        A story?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, a story you can tell me...so I 
                        can come find you.

           Off that...

           INT. AIRLINE - BOARDING - NIGHT

           Michael, in FIRST CLASS, LEATHER BINDER open - we now 
           understand the MAPS - he’s trying to find ELISE -

           Key words are written - APRICOTS, NUNS & PRIESTS and then 
           “MONASTERY?” circled -- the word ALONE, EMPTY and the 
           “DANCING?”

           --  SIX hour circumference from Paris makes for a lot of 
           choices --

           INT. AIRLINE - EXITING

           Michael gathers his things, the PA ANNOUNCEMENT welcomes the 
           passengers to PARIS.

           INT. CHARLES DE GALLE AIRPORT - CUSTOMS

           Michael, HAT PULLED down, keeps himself a bit turned from the 
           various cameras -- gets to his AGENT.
                                 FRENCH CUSTOMS
                             (French)
                        Passport?

           Michael hands him his FRENCH PASSPORT - the Customs Officer 
           runs it, hands it back.

                                 FRENCH CUSTOMS (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        You mind stepping over there, sir.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Problem?

                                 FRENCH CUSTOMS
                             (French)
                        Step to the side, sir.

           Michael, exhausted, collects his passport, heads TO WAITING 
           CUSTOMS AGENTS.

           INT. PARIS HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lenz, having just been awoken himself an hour earlier, raps 
           on a door - he HAS TWO UNIFORMS WITH HIM.

           He RAPS AGAIN, hears RUSTLING, then -- RENLOW, boxer shorts 
           and a T-shirt.

                                 RENLOW
                        Yes?

                                 LENZ
                        Sorry about the hour, Philip.  
                        Something happened.  We need you at 
                        the airport.

           Renlow rubs his eyes.  Lenz remains standing...

                                 RENLOW
                        What is it?

                                 LENZ
                        Tell Detective Noen her presence is 
                        not required.

           Renlow shifts his head, we SEE A WOMAN’S LEGS on the bed.  
           Off that -- 

                                 LENZ (CONT’D)
                        I’ll wait for you downstairs.  Soon 
                        as you can.
           INT. AIRPORT CUSTOMS - VIEWING ROOM

           Renlow studies MICHAEL through the TWO WAY MIRROR --

           INT. AIRPORT CUSTOMS - INTERROGATION

           Michael sits, resting heart rate very low - lets his mind 
           drift - he’s aware he’s being watched.

           INT. AIRPORT CUSTOMS - VIEWING ROOM

           Lenz hands Renlow MICHAEL’S LEATHER BINDER -- Renlow flips 
           through it...

                                 RENLOW
                        My God.

                                 LENZ
                        We had his name flagged, we’re 
                        holding him while we check his 
                        naturalization papers.  We’ve only 
                        got a few more minutes before he 
                        realizes--

                                 RENLOW
                        He knows right now.  Look at him, 
                        I’ve never been that relaxed in my 
                        life.

           Renlow turns to the BINDER --

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Rudimentary code, probably for 
                        public writing.  This is definitely 
                        a vault door, man sized - small 
                        shop, maybe even a home.  
                             (then)
                        Maps too, all hand drawn, he’s got 
                        a six hour radius from Paris.

                                 LENZ
                        Maybe he’s scouting.

                                 RENLOW
                        You don’t go looking for a door 
                        like that - besides, he has three 
                        locations pinpointed.

                                 LENZ
                        How can you tell?
                                 RENLOW
                        The code is simple, it’s the 
                        Freemason’s cypher.  We studied it 
                        in school.

                                 LENZ
                        He’s a freemason?

           Renlow watches as Lenz places a cigarette in his mouth.

                                 RENLOW
                        Do you mind?  I don’t want to have 
                        to shower again today.

           Lenz considers, puts the cigarette away.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        What’d you have on the brother?

           Lenz hands Renlow NEW DIGITAL PHOTOS, Charlie, Jean-Luc and 
           Finn heading into LE DOUX MAISON--

                                 LENZ
                        Yesterday morning.  We sent a team 
                        in after, manager was roughed up 
                        but no one else.

                                 RENLOW
                        Who are the other two?

                                 LENZ
                        I’m on it, nothing so far.

                                 RENLOW
                        Anything taken?

                                 LENZ
                        No one would talk.  

                                 RENLOW
                        Put a pin in it.
                             (back to leather binder)
                        Have we copied this?

                                 LENZ
                        Yes.

           Renlow hands THE BINDER to Lenz.  

                                 RENLOW
                        Then let him go.

           Renlow exits.
           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

           Michael drops his bag, grabs a bottle of wine -- a TAP at his 
           door --

           He opens it, Jean-Luc enters.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where’s Charlie?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Left him at the hotel a couple 
                        hours ago.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You get the stuff.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Yes, it’s under the bench.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How many?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Four, like you asked.  I left the 
                        measurements, too.  

           Michael nods, uncorks the wine, pours Jean-Luc a small glass, 
           one for himself.

                                 JEAN-LUC (CONT’D)
                        You were gone a couple of days.  
                        Any problems?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not at all.  Lot to put together in 
                        a short time.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Can we do it?

           Michael drinks.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.  Still working out the exit. 
                        The others ready?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Finn would follow you into the 
                        fires of hell. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let’s hope that doesn’t happen.  
                        Charlie?
                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s ready.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Anything else?

           Jean-Luc finishes his wine.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Two days.  We meet at the 
                        warehouse.  Have Finn get the van 
                        as late as he can...

           Michael opens the door, Jean-Luc passes...

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        It’s almost over.

           Off that...

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - WORK ROOM  - LATER

           Michael pulls the door shut, sealing the room - he FLIPS ON 
           MONITORS, SECURITY CAMERAS around his TOWNHOUSE come to life - 
           he KEEPS HIS EYE ON A BROWN SEDAN parked three cars down off 
           his front door.

           Michael pulls on LATEX GLOVES, CAREFULLY opens HIS BAG, 
           letting the LEATHER BINDER SLIDE OUT, with OTHER BOOKS and 
           MAGAZINES - onto his clean work table. 

           He STARES AT IT for a LONG TIME, his mind turning it over.

           DIGS under his table, PULLS OUT A METALLIC FLASHLIGHT - SHUTS 
           off the overhead and flips on the flashlight --

           -- A BLUE BEAM, he RUNS IT OVER THE BOOKS - it’s DIRTY WITH 
           FINGERPRINTS, they can be clearly seen.  

           -- Michael shifts the LEATHER BINDER to the front - SLOWLY 
           RUNS THE LIGHT UP AND DOWN , nothing --

           -- FLIPS IT OVER and DOES the SAME, and at the EDGE he sees 
           it - NOT A SINGLE PRINT -- it’s been WIPED --

           INT/EXT. BROWN SEDAN - IN FRONT KITSON TOWNHOUSE  - NIGHT

           Renlow and Lenz sit.

                                 LENZ
                        What do you think he’s doing?
                                 RENLOW
                        If he’s smart, he’s burning 
                        everything in his house which might 
                        tie him to the job.

           Lenz looks at the townhouse--

                                 LENZ
                        And why are we sitting out here?

                                 RENLOW
                        Because we’re smart, too.  We can 
                        arrest him but all that’s going to 
                        get us is intent, maybe.  We know 
                        who he is and what he is.  Soon as 
                        we figure out the target, we’re 
                        gonna know where he’s going to be 
                        at the exact moment he’s taking the 
                        score.

                                 LENZ
                        What’s to stop him from walking 
                        away?

                                 RENLOW
                        That’s what we’re here to find out.

                                 LENZ
                        You can tell all that from reading 
                        his Masonic code?

                                 RENLOW
                        No, I can tell all that from the 
                        fact that he doesn’t need the money 
                        and he still does it.  His bank 
                        records show wealth, in the last 
                        eight years he hasn’t had so much 
                        as a parking ticket.  
                             (beat)
                        And, if he did the bank job a week 
                        ago and is already setting on 
                        another one, then he’s doing it for 
                        a reason.  And I think I know what 
                        it is...

           A long beat as Lenz examines Renlow, then:

                                 LENZ
                        I’m just gonna wait this time for 
                        you to tell me, I don’t want to 
                        seem over eager.

                                 RENLOW
                        The missing wife.
           Lenz sips is coffee.

                                 LENZ
                        You already slept with Hannah, you 
                        don’t need to support that theory 
                        anymore.

           Renlow doesn’t take his eyes on Michael’s townhouse.

                                 RENLOW
                        Completely unrelated, but noted.  
                        This fellow's life is textbook 
                        perfect, he’s been pulling scores 
                        for at least nine years, probably 
                        longer and his wife decides to 
                        leave him a week ago?  

                                 LENZ
                        Just because your wife is in the 
                        dark doesn’t mean Kitson’s was. 

           Renlow turns, locks eyes with Lenz.

                                 LENZ (CONT’D)
                        You’re not the only detective in 
                        the car, Philip.  

                                 RENLOW
                             (shifting)
                        We set up on the German banker?

                                 LENZ
                        Yes, everything but the computer.  
                        Couldn’t get a warrant.  

           Renlow nods.

                                 RENLOW
                        Then we wait...

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Michael, dressed for the day, hair wet from showering, he 
           sips his coffee, waits...

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - SAME

           Elise, the OPPOSITE in every way - hasn’t seen a shower in 
           over a week, underfed, exhausted - she stands, facing the 
           wall - a SACK PULLED over her head, handed a phone -- she 
           hears it ringing --
           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - SAME

           Michael stares at the vibrating phone, finally picks it up.

                                 ELISE (O.S.)
                        Michael?

           Michael hears RUSTLING - then, MUFFLED TALKING in FRENCH.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Elise?  Baby?

                                 ELISE (O.S.)
                        -- You kept saying fromage because 
                        you thought it was a funny word.  
                        You made me laugh, Michael.  I 
                        think that’s the reason why I 
                        married --

           The call cuts.  Michael holds the phone a moment, closes it 
           slowly.  Opens the LEATHER BINDER, flips to a page and makes 
           a note --

           EXT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE

           Renlow and Lenz watch as Michael exits his house and walks 
           (still using his cane) towards a METRO STOP.

                                 RENLOW
                        Looks like we do this on foot.

           Renlow gets out, Lenz slides over.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Keep your cell on, I’ll call if I 
                        get anything...

           Renlow moves off towards the same Metro.

           INT. METRO STOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael waits for the train.  Renlow comes down the stairs, 
           NEWS HERALD under his arm, he picks a spot, reads until the 
           train comes.

           Moments later, the TRAIN ARRIVES - Michael boards, Renlow 
           boards a different car --

           INT. METRO CAR - MOVING

           Michael sits, rubs his knee --
           -- Through the GLASS, Renlow stands, still “reading.”

           INT. DIFFERENT MRTRO STOP - LATER

           Michael moves SLOWLY UP the stairs, people PASS --

           -- Renlow, FORCED TO PASS or be seen, does so, splitting off 
           to the right of the LARGE UNDERGROUND STOP --

           INT. METRO STOP - PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

           Crowded with HUNDREDS of PEOPLE, Michael limps towards an 
           EXIT - Renlow purchases a CANDY BAR, follows - the CROWD 
           crossing in front - Michael coming and going from Renlow’s 
           VIEW --

           EXT. METRO STOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Renlow pops up to the street, head on a SWIVEL, no Michael 
           anywhere.  He SCANS, sees a CAB PULL OFF, makes a judgement 
           call - moves after it --

           INT. METRO STOP - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - SAME

           Michael watches RENLOW head away, he turns back to the 
           SUBWAY, NOT LIMPING AT ALL...

           EXT. BANK OF MUNICH - PARIS - MORNING

           Jurgen Becker gets out of a BLACK CAR, morning paper folded 
           under his arm --

           -- TWO PHONE UTILITY MEN work a STREET BOX, they bullshit to 
           each other, but WEAR SMALL LISTENING DEVICES in their EARS --

           Becker, oblivious, dials his PHONE as he walks to the 
           entrance - GETS BUMPED by a SHABBILY DRESSED MAN --

                                 SHABBY MAN
                             (French)
                        Sorry...

           He keeps walking, Becker shakes his head in disgust, enters 
           the bank - 
           INT. BANK OF MUNICH - PARIS - LOBBY

           The MOMENT HE’S INSIDE the empty lobby, he looks to his HAND 
           to what Michael placed in it...

           Reveal:  SMALL NOTE which reads:  YOU’RE GREENLIT.  
           Underneath it, A SIM CARD.

           Becker walks straight to his office, his ASSISTANT takes his 
           jacket --

           EXT. BANK OF MUNICH - PARIS - SAME

           Michael (the SHABBILY DRESSED MAN) walks right past the TWO 
           DETECTIVES acting as UTILITY MEN --

           -- They DON’T PAY ANY ATTENTION to him as he PASSES...

           INT. BECKER’S PRIVATE OFFICE

           Becker closes the door, walks right to his desk, opens a 
           PRIVATE SAFE --

           -- Removes THREE CELL PHONES, all BRAND NEW, POPS the SIM 
           card into the PHONE, DIALS --

           EXT. ALLEY - PARIS

           Michael drops the DIRTY CLOTHES into a DUMPSTER as he PASSES - 
           he now wears what we saw him in earlier...HIS CELL BUZZES - 
           he holds it to his ear as he walks.

           INTERCUT

                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t speak, assume your office is 
                        bugged, your computer, your phones, 
                        everything.  I don’t know how they 
                        got onto me, but if they have me, 
                        they have you.  Keep this phone on 
                        you at all times, the SIM is clean.  
                        Job falls as planned, I don’t have 
                        a choice.  Anyone calls this number 
                        going forward you answer it Le Doux 
                        Maison and you vouch for whatever 
                        you are asked.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll check the drop at midnight 
                        tonight for the Vance data.
                             (beat)
                        It’s almost over.
           Michael hangs up, removes the SIM, SPLITS IT IN HALF - toss 
           it in TWO DIFFERENT trash cans as he PULLS OUT HIS CANE and 
           STARTS LIMPING...

           EXT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - ROOFTOP DECK - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Michael has gone all out, CANDLES around the deck, speakers 
           SOFTLY PLAYING music - Paris, CITY OF LIGHTS, framing the 
           evening --

           The meal, finished, Michael pours Elise ANOTHER GLASS OF 
           WINE.

                                 ELISE
                        You do realize I’ve been drinking 
                        this since I was nine...so if your 
                        plan is to get me drunk...

           Michael pours himself a refill.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m not big on re-corking bottles.

           Elise sips her wine...

                                 ELISE
                        An American in Paris.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sort of a cliche, I know.

                                 ELISE
                        You cook like a native.  Where did 
                        you say you were from?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Boston, originally.  But, really 
                        all over the east coast.

           Elise studies Michael over her wine.

                                 ELISE
                        Does pretending to be mysterious 
                        usually work for you?

           Michael keeps her gaze.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So far.

                                 ELISE
                        Do you miss home?
                                 MICHAEL
                        This is home now.

                                 ELISE
                        No “Mrs. Mysterious” back on the 
                        east coast?

           Michael laughs...

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.  Just a brother somewhere.  We 
                        don’t keep in touch.

                                 ELISE
                        What’s his name?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Charlie.

           For a moment, the sip their wine in silence.

                                 ELISE
                        It’s getting late, isn’t it?

           Michael doesn’t reply...he keeps his eyes on Elise.  She 
           looks around at the dinner...

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you with this?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll take care of it.

           They stand, an awkward moment, Michael offers his hand - they 
           walk to the ROOF TOP DOOR --

           BY DOOR - FLASHBACK

           Michael pulls the HANDLE - it DOESN’T MOVE - he YANKS IT 
           AGAIN --

                                 ELISE
                        Clever, lock us on the roof, keep 
                        me longer.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Much as I’d like you to stay 
                        longer, this isn’t the way I’d do 
                        it.

           Michael looks around, looks at Elise.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        May I?
           He REMOVES ONE OF HER HAIR BARRETTES - her hair falls a bit, 
           she actually looks better, more relaxed...

           Michael bends over to address the lock.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You should wear it like that.  
                        Frames your face nicely...

           She UNCONSCIOUSLY touches her hair, watches as Michael use 
           the BARRETTE, THREE QUICK adjustments inside the LOCK - OPENS 
           THE DOOR.

           He hands the barrette back, she holds his hand - a LONG 
           MOMENT - he LEANS FORWARD, KISSES ELISE.

           She KISSES HIM BACK, HARDER, more URGENT --

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - WORK ROOM - LNIGHT

           The VANCE FILE from BECKER, OPEN on MICHAEL’S WORK STATION --

           -- IMAGES of VANCE, ADDRESSES, PHOTOS OF HIS HOUSE, CAR -- a 
           PHOTO OF VANCE with his WIFE AND YOUNG SON.

           -- HIS BODYGUARDS - TIGHT SHOTS of the HARDWARE they CARRY.

           Michael WORKS on A BADGE - carefully DESIGNING and INKING IT - 
           - SEALS THE BADGE with a SMALL PASSPORT PHOTO of himself --

           REVEAL - an INTERPOL ID with the name HARRY LIME.

           -- Michael UNROLLS the PACKAGE FROM BERLIN - FOUR LONG DARK 
           RODS, GROOVED at one end --

           -- HE SLIDES them into CHROME TUBES, PLACES A PIN to HOLD 
           THEM on both sides -- 

           -- PLACES the FOUR CHROME TUBES off to one side --

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - NIGHT

           Elise, eyes open, waits -- THE DOOR UNBOLTS, FOOD is SLID IN, 
           DOOR PULLED SHUT, BOLT THROWN -

           Elise gathers herself, gets the food - PEELS THE SMALL 
           PLASTIC PIECE of WRAPPER OFF THE CHEESE, carefully carries it 
           to her “bed” --

           -- She LIFTS THE MATTRESS, slides out a TORN PIECE OF 
           BEDDING.
           REVEAL:  Elise has been collecting the BITS OF WRAPPING from 
           the CHEESE, she’s been piecing it together.  She places the 
           piece next to the others, HANDS SHAKING --

           -- the WRAPPER ASSEMBLES to REVEAL:  FRENDAL’S GROCERY

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - GARAGE - NIGHT

           LIGHTS OFF --

           Michael PULLS out the BAGS from LE DOUX, reads a handwritten 
           LIST OF NUMBERS...gathers it all and loads it into his 
           RUNNING SEDAN located OUTSIDE THE OPEN BAY DOOR --

           -- Goes back in GARAGE - opens a TRUNK, PLACES A LARGE VELVET 
           BOX inside, slides it back, UNDER PAPERS --

           -- Closes the trunk, replaces it under the work bench --

           -- Shuts the bay door on his way out...

           INT. SEDAN - STREET - PARIS - MORNING

           Michael sits, his PLAIN SEDAN (never seen before) on a TREE 
           LINED STREET - the VANCE FILE open on the passenger seat.

           He holds his PHONE - it VIBRATES, he accepts the call --

                                 ELISE (V.O.)
                        ...I’m not s..s..sorry, Michael, 
                        that I met you that night.  You are 
                        my best...friend...

           The CALL CUTS -- Michael sets the phone down, makes a note in 
           his binder --

           -- WATCHES as a BLACK MERCEDES PULLS into a DRIVEWAY --

           -- Michael GLANCES at the FILE - PULLS THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER, 
           gets out of his car and HEADS TOWARDS THE HOUSE --

           INT./ EXT. SEDAN - KITSON TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

           Renlow waits in his car, Lenz gets in with TWO COFFEES.

                                 RENLOW
                        Just got here, he’s been in all 
                        morning.
                                 LENZ
                        Nothing on his phones, nothing from 
                        my people on his showroom.

           EXT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - BACKYARD

           Michael WALKS the TALL BRICK WALL in his NEIGHBOR’S YARD - he 
           keeps to the THICK VINE - OPENS an obscure door which lets 
           him into a THIN BACK alley behind his home - 

           -- Invisible from the street on all sides, he is easily able 
           to enter the basement of his house --

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael peers out the KITCHEN WINDOW, sees a PLAIN SEDAN, 
           PLACES a NEW SIM card into a phone, dials.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s me.  Do me a favor and double 
                        check the Winston address, use your 
                        landline...do you understand?

                             (beat)
                        You’re sure?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes.

           Michael cuts the connection - removes the SIM, drops it into 
           his garbage disposal - GRINDS IT --

           Jurgen places the phone back into his jacket, picks up his 
           regular line - dials.

                                 BECKER
                             (German)
                        Good morning, remember that buyer I 
                        called you about?  He’s interested 
                        but is concerned the --
                             (English)
                        Of course my apologies.  The 
                        interested party for that real 
                        estate transaction?  Sir Winston’s 
                        estate in Lyon, correct.

                        He was wondering if the plans had 
                        been altered?  Could you double 
                        check for me.  Thank you.

           Jurgen hangs up.  Stares at the phone for a beat.

           Michael SEWS, by hand, pulling THREAD THROUGH a WHITE JACKET.

           His eyes never leave his WALL MAP, the FOCUS now FRANCE and

           Michael GATHERS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS - ALL LOADED into a LARGE 
           CANVAS BAG --

           -- He GRABS A PICTURE OF ELISE from the MANTEL, gives it a 
           look and TOSSES it in as well.  

           -- Picks up ANOTHER PICTURE, it’s OLDER - MICHAEL & CHARLIE, 
           10 years ago - BOTH SMILING AND HAPPY, he stares at it for a 
           LONG TIME - sets it back on the mantel...

           -- AS HE ZIPS THE BAG we see - STACKS AND STACKS of SHRINK

           sedan.

           OVER A BLOCK away, the PLAIN SEDAN sits, Michael doesn’t even 
           GLANCE at it --
           -- Gets in and pulls away --

           INT. SEDAN - STREET IN FRONT OF KITSON TOWNHOUSE

           Renlow looks at his watch, back at the house.  Lenz sips his 
           coffee...

           Renlow opens his door, exiting--

                                 LENZ
                        Be patient.

                                 RENLOW
                        He hasn’t so much as made a peep in 
                        twenty hours. 

           Renlow exits, Lenz shakes his head, gets out --

           EXT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE

           Renlow RAPS on the front door - no response.  He PULLS HIS 
           BADGE -- Lenz notices.

                                 RENLOW
                        You smell that?

                                 LENZ
                        Smell what?

                                 RENLOW
                        Smells like smoke?  Better make 
                        sure Mr. Kitson is okay --

           Renlow kicks the door jam, it SPLINTERS open -- Renlow steps 
           back...

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Interpol are not allowed to carry, 
                        as you well know.

           Lenz pulls his WEAPON, enters first --

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE

           Lenz and Renlow look around, no one there --

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN

           Empty, food still in the refrigerator, fruit in a bowl.
           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Nothing out of place --

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - WORK ROOM

           Renlow pokes his head around, sees the LARGE STEEL DOOR, 
           unbolts it, YANKS IT OPEN -- 

           -- Completely BARE, some DIRTY TOOLS - all of MICHAEL’S WORK 
           is gone.  Renlow takes a quick glance, sees nothing 
           suspicious, exits --

           He heads up the stairs - missing the FURNACE, bits of PAPER 
           STILL BURNING inside of it --

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN

           Lenz grabs an apple, bites into it.  Renlow enters.

                                 RENLOW
                        He’s not here.

                                 LENZ
                        I’d be surprised if he was ever 
                        here.  

           Lenz cell CHIRPS - he picks it up --

                                 LENZ (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Lenz...when?  Gather the staff, 
                        canvas the area, he couldn’t have 
                        gotten far.
                             (beat)
                        It’s probably nothing, I’ll check 
                        it out.

                                 RENLOW
                        What?

                                 LENZ
                        They lost the brother.  He went 
                        into the cafe rest room and never 
                        came out.

           Renlow looks around the house, puts it together...SLAMS THE 
           KITCHEN TABLE --

                                 RENLOW
                        They’re going...it’s happening 
                        today.
                                 LENZ
                        My guy on the German banker’s phone 
                        said he made a strange call.  
                        Something about housing plans for a 
                        Sir Winston?  Mean anything to you?

           Renlow processes it.

                                 RENLOW
                        Let’s go find out.

           Off that...

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           The WHITE LE DOUX MAISON VAN, back open --

           Jean-Luc and Finn PULL CATERING TABLES APART - UNSCREW the 
           LEGS - MICHAEL loads FOOD (uncooked) into the SIDE DOOR --

           -- Jean-Luc LOADS the last of the catering tabless --

           -- Finn replaces the PHONE NUMBER on the SIDE OF THE VAN --

           -- Michael tosses them their UNIFORMS from the LE DOUX bag.

           -- Everyone undresses, pulls on the new clothes --

           -- Jean-Luc and Finn, finish --

           -- Charlie’s JACKET is too small -- sleeves are a bit short -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, Mom, we got a problem.

           Michael comes over, checks the JACKET, gives it a gentle 
           YANK, pulls the back - HIS HAND BRUSHES UP AGAINST SOMETHING. 

           Michael steps back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What the fuck, Charlie?

           Jean-Luc recognizes the tone, steps out of the van.  Charlie, 
           all smiles.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Take it easy, Michael.  We’re a 
                        long way from the reservation on 
                        this one.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We had a deal.
                                 CHARLIE
                        My deal includes not going to jail.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Give it to me.

           Charlie steps back, pulls his JACKET OFF - the GUN TUCKED 
           into the back of his pants.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.  I’m not taking any chances.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you out of your mind?  You’re 
                        gonna bring a gun into a house 
                        where I personally guarantee you 
                        will be frisked, probably more than 
                        once?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ve talked my way out of worse.  
                        Hell, I could probably get through 
                        airport security with--

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re not going through airport 
                        security - you aren’t gonna miss 
                        your flight if these guys catch you 
                        with that.  You’re gonna get us all 
                        killed.    
                             (never taking his eyes off 
                              Charlie)
                        How much time you done working with 
                        me, Jean-Luc?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        None.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Finn?

                                 FINN
                        Never.

           Charlie stands, defiant.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You willing to risk never seeing 
                        your wife again if it’s between the 
                        diamonds and a bullet?
                                 MICHAEL
                        These guys carry the big iron - and 
                        they’re not going to stop to check 
                        the rest of us before they shoot.  
                        We’ll be sitting ducks.

           Charlie doesn’t like it, but he’s seeing Michael’s point of 
           view.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to hang my brother 
                        and  two best friends out if the 
                        heat comes down.  I’ll take it, all 
                        of it.  She would understand, 
                        believe me.
                             (beat)
                        You need to trust me.

           For a long moment, no one says anything, Charlie pulls the 
           gun, flips it and hands it butt first to Michael.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I better be able to.

           Michael walks to his jacket, tosses it to Charlie.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You were wearing my jacket, that 
                        one is yours.

           Charlie pulls it on, perfect fit.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s get this over...

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The LE DOUX VAN PULLS INTO TRAFFIC and heads towards the 
           FREEWAY --

           INT. BECKER’S PRIVATE OFFICE

           Renlow and Lenz (with TWO UNIFORMS) burst into Becker’s 
           office--

           -- Becker stands, TWO CLIENTS in his sitting area.

                                 BECKER
                        Gentlemen?

           His assistant behind Renlow, her face pleading...
                                 RENLOW
                        Time to go, Herr Becker.

                                 BECKER
                        Go where?

           OTHER AGENTS SWEEP IN, the assistant ushers out the CLIENTS - 
           Becker’s computer, effects are taken - Renlow CUFFS him.

                                 RENLOW
                        Let’s talk somewhere more 
                        appropriate.

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION

           Becker sits, looking BEMUSED by his surroundings - Renlow 
           sits in front of him, FILE open.  Lenz stands, unlit 
           cigarette in his mouth.

           Becker smiles at him.

                                 BECKER
                        Feel free to smoke, Captain.  It 
                        won’t bother me.

           Lenz puts the cigarette away.

                                 RENLOW
                        How long have you been working with 
                        Michael Kitson?

                                 BECKER
                        Almost eight years.

                                 RENLOW
                        And what do you do for him?

                                 BECKER
                        Handle his business accounts, 
                        mostly.  Some checking.  I got him 
                        a rate on his mortgage --

                                 RENLOW
                        Mr. Becker, we know who Michael 
                        Kitson is.

                                 BECKER
                        Who is he?

           Renlow shifts gears.
                                 RENLOW
                        Which client was interested in Sir 
                        Winston’s home in Lyon?

           Becker smiles pleasantly.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Becker you realize terrorism 
                        laws have made my job quite a bit 
                        easier.

                                 BECKER
                        I would have thought terrorism 
                        would have made everyone’s job 
                        quite a bit harder.

           Renlow shuffles paper, pulls ONE --

                                 RENLOW
                        International banking oversight, in 
                        particular.  Recognize this?

           He slides the document to Becker, he glances at it.

                                 BECKER
                        Looks like a bank transaction?

                                 RENLOW
                        One point two million euro into 
                        your account and then dispersed 
                        three ways into numbered accounts.

                                 BECKER
                        It is a bank, after all.

                                 RENLOW
                        You approved these transactions, 
                        the day after the Bank of Pallion 
                        was robbed.

                                 BECKER
                        I assure you I approved hundreds of 
                        transactions that day, I am bank 
                        manager.  Half of them I don’t even 
                        see.  I’d be happy to investigate 
                        further if you think a crime has 
                        been committed.

                                 RENLOW
                        Which one of your clients asked 
                        about the Winston house in Lyon?
                                 BECKER
                        If you are as well versed in 
                        international banking law as you 
                        pretend, you know I am not going to 
                        answer that.  I will tell you it 
                        was not Mr. Kitson, if that will 
                        expedite things...

                                 RENLOW
                        Maybe we’ll send a few men to his 
                        house just to let him know he has 
                        an interested buyer.

           Becker shrugs -- Off Renlow’s frustration --

           EXT. ROAD TO SIR WINSTON’S - DAY

           The Le Doux Van pulls up to the GUARD STAND at the OUTER RIM 
           of Sir Gregory Winston’s Summer home...

           Michael rolls the window down, hands over paperwork - the 
           CHEERLESS GUARD takes it, another GUARD walks the VAN, using 
           a mirror to see underneath it --

                                 GATE GUARD
                             (French)
                        Open it.

           Michael gets out, walks to the back, OPENS the REAR of the 
           VAN - 

           BY REAR OF VAN

           CATERING TABLES STACKED neatly to one side, some STERNO CANS 
           and HOLDERS - FOOD, NEATLY STACKED IN CARTS --

           -- The Guard looks it over -- 

                                 GATE GUARD (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Close it.

           Michael does as he’s told.  Comes around the front of the 
           van.

           Michael gets back in front.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        All good?
           The Gate Guard says nothing, GETS a PHONE from the Guard 
           Stand, reads the number on the VAN under the restaurant name - 
           dials --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        We’re a few minutes late,  he’s 
                        gonna know we fudged the time card, 
                        can you give us a break --

           The Gate Guard’s look tells Michael to SHUT UP - 

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION

           Becker sits, same pleasant smile on his face...Lenz finally 
           lights his cigarette.  Renlow leans in --

                                 RENLOW
                        You know, once I go all in, I’m 
                        going all in.  I’ll get into your 
                        personal finances, your wife’s, 
                        anyone you’ve ever met.  I’ll be 
                        like a tick and it will be 
                        unpleasant for you.

                                 BECKER
                        More unpleasant than this?

           Renlow smiles, he knows he’s not going to crack Becker today.

                                 RENLOW
                        Okay, Mr. Becker, do me a favor and 
                        turn in your passport on your way 
                        out.  Hate to have you leave --

           Becker’s CELL PHONE CHIRPS.  Renlow pauses, Becker makes no 
           effort to answer it.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.

                                 BECKER
                        I’m sure they’ll call back.

           It chirps again--

           EXT. GUARD STAND - SAME

           The Gate Guard hangs up.
                                 GATE GAURD
                             (French)
                        No one answered.  You have another 
                        number?

           Michael smiles, shakes his head.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Probably not open yet.

           The Gate Guard re-dials --

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION

           Becker’s PHONE CHIRPS again - Renlow studies him.

                                 RENLOW
                        Answer it.  Please.

           Becker pulls the phone from his jacket, holds it to his ear.

                                 BECKER
                             (French)
                        Yes?

           Listens.

                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Le Doux Maison, yes.  Four.  
                        Correct.  Thank you.

           He replaces the phone.

                                 BECKER (CONT’D)
                        Confirming a dinner reservation.

           Lenz opens the door, Becker walks out.  Lenz waits as Renlow 
           gathers his things.

                                 RENLOW
                        Might as well pay a visit to Sir 
                        Winston, find out if he’s holding 
                        anything someone might want to 
                        steal. 

           Renlow passes Lenz --

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        You eat yet?  We can grab something 
                        on the way...
                                 LENZ
                        Le Doux?

                                 RENLOW
                        I think that might be a bit pricey 
                        for road food, but --

           Lenz puts his hand on Renlow’s arm.

                                 LENZ
                        Le Doux...Charlie Kitson, remember?  
                        They were there a few days ago, 
                        gave the manager a tune-up?

           Renlow’s EYES GO WIDE - he dashes out of the Interrogation 
           room --

           INT. POLICE STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM

           -- Renlow SHUFFLES PAPERS on the conference table, Lenz and A 
           DETECTIVE COME in behind him --

                                 LENZ
                        What are you looking for?

           Renlow shuffles, finds a NEWSPAPER --

                                 RENLOW
                        This.

           He opens it, two pages in - folds it, holds it up --

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Sir Winston is throwing a party for 
                        his wife today.  Want to bet whose 
                        doing the catering?

           Lenz turns to the Detective - 

                                 LENZ
                             (French)
                        Get Sir Winston on the phone, tell 
                        him to detain--

                                 RENLOW
                        No!

           Lenz turns.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        He has to do the job.
                                 LENZ
                        Have you lost your mind?

                                 RENLOW
                        Until he does the job, we don’t 
                        have anything.  How far is Lyon?

                                 LENZ
                        By helicopter?  Twenty five 
                        minutes.

           Renlow grabs his PHONE --

                                 RENLOW
                        Call the Lyon police, tell them to 
                        call everyone in and be ready to 
                        move on a dime.  I’m going to call 
                        INTERPOL and get us some air cover 
                        for the raid?

                                 LENZ
                        Air cover?

                                 RENLOW
                        Winston was MI-5, I’m not taking 
                        any chances on this one...

           Off that --

           INT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE - SERVANT ENTRANCE

           Michael first, carrying a TRAY OF CHICKEN - the service 
           entrance has a METAL DETECTOR wrapped around it -- it goes 
           off.

           Michael holds up the METAL TRAY, the GUARD LIFTS THE LID - 
           RAW CHICKEN in SAUCE -- The GUARD WAVES HIM THROUGH -

           Jean-Luc and Finn carry tables, Charlie carries MORE FOOD.  A 
           GUARD STANDS at the door, observes...all WEAR VISIBLE EAR 
           PIECES...

           Charlie MAKES A TURN - 

                                 GUARD
                             (French)
                        That’s the closet.

           Charlie turns toward the GUARD, holding food - unsure.
                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Are you stupid, it’s the other 
                        side.

           Charlie turns back towards the closet, the GUARD STEPS 
           TOWARDS HIM --

           Jean-Luc steps past-

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Excuse me, sorry.

                                 GUARD
                             (French)
                        Your friend doesn’t listen very 
                        well.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        That’s because he’s deaf.

           Jean-Luc motions for Charlie to follow him, he does.  The 
           Guard retakes his post.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Jean-Luc walks through, voice low as he passes Michael --

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Charlie is deaf.

           Michael turns to Charlie - motions with his hands - Charlie 
           sets the food down on a nearby counter -- turns to see if the 
           GUARD is FOLLOWING, quick shake of his head.

           Michael presses his mic --

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        We’re going to set up fast in the 
                        kitchen.  Jean-Luc can use you in 
                        the dining room.

           EXT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE

           Finn, listening, heads off towards the dining area --
           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE

           Michael and Jean-Luc work fast, pulling LEGS off the bottom 
           of the CATERING TABLE, Michael removes the pin - one of the 
           WELDING RODS SLIDES OUT --

           Jean-Luc reattaches the leg as Michael turns to the second 
           one --

           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Finn, moves CHAIRS, sets up the heating dishes - begins 
           placing STERNO CANS - one of them, a SMALL RED DASH on the 
           lid, he places it off to the side...

           INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING

           Renlow sits in front with the pilot, Lenz in back - they 
           speak over their headsets.

                                 RENLOW
                        Did you get the Captain?

                                 LENZ
                        He’s ready when you are.  I didn’t 
                        tell him why, just said we were 
                        going to need everyone he had.

           Renlow scans the MAP --

                                 RENLOW
                        No evidence of their presence until 
                        I give the word.

           INT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Michael COOKS - the kitchen, restaurant big, gives Michael 
           lots of room to spread out - Charlie hands him raw food, 
           prepares CHICKEN CUTLETS --

           -- Sir Winston walks through, Michael turns, gives a quick 
           nod.

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        Everything okay?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French accent)
                        Very good, sir.
                                 SIR WINSTON
                        It’s an important evening.  No 
                        mistakes.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French accent)
                        No, sir.  No mistakes.

           Michael turns back to the various working POTS and PANS.  Sir 
           Winston walks out...

           The MOMENT HE’S GONE - Michael OPENS THE DUMBWAITER - the 
           FOUR RODS and ONE OF THE COOKING POTS, COVERED -- Michael 
           nods at CHARLIE - 

           -- Charlie crawls inside, Michael closes the door - hits the 
           button, the small elevator drops slowly --

           INT. DINING ROOM

           Jean-Luc, table set, heating plates and sternos lit, he 
           places the finishing touches on the table -- Finn unfolds 
           chairs --

           They work quietly.  Two CLICKS on the radio, Finn heads to 
           the kitchen --

           INT. KITCHEN

           Michael waiting by the empty dumb waiter - Finn hands him the 
           RED STERNO, reaches under his shirt and PULLS TWO SETS OF 
           BLACK GOGGLES -- hands them as well.

           Michael crawls in the DUMB WAITER - Finn sends him down.

           Moments later, Sir WINSTON enters the kitchen again - 

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        Where’s the chef?

                                 FINN
                             (French accent)
                        At the truck, getting fresh basil, 
                        something I can do?

           Sir Winston, pats his pockets.

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        I need a drink.

           Finn smiles, holds out his arm -
                                 FINN
                             (French accent)
                        Then you’ve found your man, right 
                        this way, sir.

           Off that --

           INT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

           Michael gets out, hands a SET OF GOGGLES to CHARLIE -- 
           Charlie carries the rods, they turn a corner and there is THE 
           BRADLEY --

           -- The VAULT DOOR is impressive, REFLECTIVE CHROME, TINTED 
           GOLD, LARGE WHEEL at the center - DIGITAL KEYPAD on the FACE.

           When they talk, it’s in low tones.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Keypad and a combination lock?

                                 MICHAEL
                        The wheel is for show, the digital 
                        keypad controls the bolts.

           The “COOKING POT” now open - HOLDS VARIOUS TOOLS FOR THE JOB.

           Michael moves very quickly, addresses the Bradley, using a 
           DIGITAL MEASURING TOOL, he PULLS the distance he needs, makes 
           a MARK - pulls to another spot, makes another MARK and 
           finally a THIRD spot.

           Charlie POPS the STERNO - they LIBERALLY APPLY A BROWN PASTE 
           to the base of each WELDING ROD - 

           Michael PULLS HIS GOGGLES DOWN - holds the ROD - CHARLIE 
           (goggles on) uses a hand-held PROPANE GUN, IGNITES THE FIRST 
           WELDING ROD - MICHAEL LEANS FORWARD, PRESSING THE FIERY ROD 
           into the first SPOT - 

           IT BURNS RED as it ENTERS THE VAULT DOOR - LIQUID METAL 
           RUNNING DOWN the vault door -

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Finn hands Sir Winston his drink from a STANDING BAR - Jean-
           Luc finishes setting the dining room --

           -- GUARDS move about the space.
           INT. BY VAULT DOOR - SAME

           The THIRD WELDING BAR BURNS through the door -- the TWO OTHER 
           HOLES still RED HOT --

           Michael PUSHES THROUGH, when the ROD is BARELY LONG enough to 
           HOLD, he pulls back, sets the SCORCHING ROD on the CONCRETE 
           FLOOR --

           -- Michael NODS to CHARLIE, using INDUSTRIAL OVEN MITTS - 
           CHARLIE SPINS the WHEEL, the DOOR UNSEALS - HE PULLS and it 
           SLOWLY OPENS - SOME BLACK SMOKE WAFTS OUT --

           Michael waves the SMOKE AWAY - pushes the VAULT DOOR WIDE (we 
           SEE THE SCORCHED HOLES on this side as well - clean through --

                                 MICHAEL
                             (into walkie mic)
                        We’re in - two minutes.

           Charlie PULLS A FLASHLIGHT from his KIT - they ENTER the 
           SMALL VAULT ROOM --

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Finn and Jean-Luc heard the call - exchange brief glances, 
           Jean-Luc heads into the kitchen, MOMENTS LATER he CARRIES out 
           a TRAY OF COOKED FOOD, sets it on one of the HOT PLATES, 
           COVERS it --

           An LAND LINE RINGS - one of the GUARDS picks it up, listens 
           for a moment, hands the PHONE to SIR WINSTON - 

           -- Finn watches as he WIPES DOWN THE BAR - Sir Winston turns 
           to LOOK DIRECTLY at FINN and JEAN-LUC.  He sets the phone 
           down, whispers to a GUARD who takes a PLACE at the FRONT 
           DOOR.

           Sir Winston approaches Finn - Jean-Luc PALMS A KNIFE, gets 
           ready to TAKE SIR WINSTON if necessary --

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        Young man...

           Finn looks up --

                                 SIR WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        My wife is here, she takes her 
                        martinis dry with two olives.

           Finn nods curtly.  Begins to make the drink, THE GUARD opens 
           the FRONT DOOR and MRS. WINSTON enters, younger than he 
           deserves, she CARRIES A SMALL DOG --
                                 SIR WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        My dear, welcome...

           INT. VAULT ROOM

           Michael and Charlie clear away the SMOKE - a PAINTING is 
           COMPLETELY CHARRED THROUGH, SEVERAL THOUSAND in CURRENCY now 
           bits of burnt paper --

           -- the BACK WALL contains a SINGLE SMALL SAFE, COMBINATION 
           LOCK --

                                 CHARLIE
                        Should we use the fourth rod?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Safe is too small, don’t know what 
                        the French Blues are kept in, it 
                        might melt it all together...

           Charlie steps to the safe --

                                 CHARLIE
                        Guess we do it the old fashioned 
                        way.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Make it fast...

           Charlie spins, listens, spins - a LIFETIME OF STEALING has 
           made him quite good -- Michael studies him, turns to make 
           sure they aren’t going to have any company.

           Charlie spins again, CLICK - the last tumbler falls --

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s it--

           He THROWS THE HANDLE, PULLS the SAFE DOOR OPEN --

           -- THE SAFE IS EMPTY, Charlie reaches in, feeling around, 
           NOTHING.  He TURNS TO MICHAEL --

           -- MICHAEL POINTS HIS GUN AT CHARLIE --

           -- FOR A MOMENT, the BROTHERS REGARD EACH OTHER - Charlie 
           SEES it’s HIS GUN --

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        How did you get it in?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Under the chicken.
           Another moment.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How’d you know?

           Michael holds the gun, laser sharp focus --

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THREE YEARS AGO - FLASHBACK

           We JOIN THE END OF THE SCENE --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Because of what I do, there is a 
                        chance, however small, that someone 
                        might use you to get me.
                             (beat)
                        Someone might take you, do you 
                        understand?

           Beat.

                                 ELISE
                        Yes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good.  Then we’re going to need a 
                        story.

                                 ELISE
                        A story?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, a story you can tell me...so I 
                        can come find you.

           Off that...

           Elise rolls to face him...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        A code...the story of how we met, 
                        but made up.  No one knows it, but 
                        you and me - so anything you say 
                        will sound right.

                                 ELISE
                        Won’t they be listening.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes, but, I’ll teach you how to 
                        talk without giving anything 
                        away...
                                 ELISE
                        You’re good at that.

           Michael smiles, his love for her showing...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yes...you will be too.  And the 
                        first thing I want you to tell me, 
                        just so I know you’re okay, is that 
                        we met at a concert in the park.

                                 ELISE
                        Concert in the park, got it.

           Michael kisses her. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’re probably never going to need 
                        it...

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - WORK ROOM - FLASHBACK

           His PHONE VIBRATES - Michael GRABS the PHONE --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Elise, baby?--

           Strained breathing, and then his WIFE’S VOICE - she’s clearly 
           had the worst night of her life.

                                 ELISE
                        We met...at Leon’s birthday party.  

           Michael JUMPS UP - a MIXTURE of ANGER and FEAR.

                        I was drinking...apricot brandy... 
                        you made fun--

           The LINE IS TERMINATED.  Michael STARES at the PHONE.  Gently 
           sets it down like it’s a TALISMAN.  

           He SWEEPS EVERYTHING off the table -- 

           -- REVEAL, a FRAMED MEMORIAM CARD - LEON BOUTIN 1979 - 1999, 
           beloved BROTHER of ELISE BOUTIN.

           Charlie stares at Michael --

                                 MICHAEL
                        You let her see you.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I didn’t think she knew what I 
                        looked like.

           EXT. OUTSIDE ELISE’S JOB - EVENING

           Elise comes down the steps listening to Michael’s MESSAGE on 
           her cell phone --

                                 MICHAEL’S VOICE
                        ...Follow the smell of garlic 
                        soaked in browned butter, asparagus 
                        tips and filet.  I’m even baking 
                        bread...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Elise?

           Elise looks up, for a moment she can’t place the face, and 
           then a SMILE GROWS --

           -- and SOMEONE PULLS A BAG over her head as she’s STUFFED 
           into a VAN, Charlie PULLS THE DOOR CLOSED and WALKS OFF --

           -- The Van pulls away --

           INT. VAULT ROOM - BACK TO SCENE

                                 MICHAEL
                        She knew, your picture, the one you 
                        sent...and because I talked about 
                        you all the time.  Her brother died 
                        when she was young, she was always 
                        telling me to make things right 
                        with you.  And, now I will --

           Michael steps back, Charlie FLINCHES -- thinking he’s going 
           to be shot --  realizing he’s not --

           CHARLIE SECRETLY PRESSES THE MIC on his WALKIE --

                                 CHARLIE
                        So, the diamonds, they were never 
                        here?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Then the job, the prep, the entire 
                        thing...

           INT. O’SHEA’S HOME - COMPUTER ROOM - FLASHBACK

           O’Shea watches on a MONITOR as Charlie lights cigarette, 
           flicks the match on the ground - he turns to Michael:

                                 O’SHEA
                        You do realize this isn’t a 
                        Bradley?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Of course.  It’s a store bought 
                        Jenson & Cohen, mostly for show - I 
                        could open it with a credit card.  

                                 O’SHEA
                        And Sir Winston keeps something 
                        valuable in a Jenson & Cohen?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I have no idea.

                                 O’SHEA
                        But you want your brother to think 
                        he does?

                                 MICHAEL
                        He took my wife.  He doesn’t know I 
                        know.  He wants me to steal the 
                        French Blues.  

                                 O’SHEA
                        And can you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need him to believe it until I 
                        can find her.

           O’Shea nods, smile growing.

           INT. VAULT ROOM - BACK TO SCENE

           Charlie, STILL PRESSES THE MIC - stares at his brother.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I stole them yesterday, they’re 
                        sitting in the trunk under my work 
                        bench.  You were five feet from 
                        them and didn’t even know it.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Finn’s EYES ARE WIDE, listening to the conversation, Sir 
           Winston WAITS FOR HIS WIFE’S DRINK - Finn is FROZEN -

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        Young man?  

           Jean-Luc sets down a TRAY OF FOOD, heads to the front door --

                                 GUARD
                             (French)
                        Yes?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Something from the truck...

           The GUARD STEPS ASIDE - Jean-Luc heads out --

           Finn watches him, nothing he can do - he HANDS Sir Winston 
           his drink - 

                                 FINN
                             (French)
                        I’m sorry.

           INT. VAULT ROOM - SAME

           Michael steps out --

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re gonna try and lock me in 
                        here?  It won’t work, we already 
                        broke the lock --

           The DOOR CLOSES - Charlie MOVES TO IT QUICKLY - it’s STILL 
           HOT TO TOUCH --

           INT. VAULT

           On the other side, MICHAEL PULLS HIS GOGGLES DOWN, LIGHTS THE 
           END of the FOURTH WELDING ROD and WELDS THE DOOR SHUT --

           INT. VAULT ROOM

           Charlie realizes what’s HAPPENING - HE SLAMS INTO THE DOOR to 
           get it open - it won’t budge --
           EXT. GUARD STAND - SAME

           Jean-Luc fires up the van and pulls it to the CLOSED GUARD 
           STAND - the GATE GUARD comes around --

                                 GATE GAURD
                             (French)
                        Where you going?

                                 JEAN-LUC
                             (French)
                        Idiot chef forgot his cooking wine, 
                        I have to haul ass to Le Doux and 
                        back before the chicken reduces --

           The Gate Guard considers, waves to the other GUARD to open 
           the gate --

                                 JEAN-LUC (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        You’re a life-saver, thank you.

           Jean-Luc pulls away - in the DISTANCE THE ROTORS of a 
           HELICOPTER can BE HEARD -

           INT. BASEMENT

           Michael WIPES THE GUN DOWN, puts it in the FAKE TOOL BOX - 
           REMOVES HIS WHITE LE DOUX JACKET - PULLS THE SLEEVES out, 
           REVERSING IT --

           -- Puts the JACKET back on - now he’s wearing a SUIT -- He 
           HEARS THE HELICOPTER LANDING --

           INT. HELICOPTER

           Renlow turns to Lenz -

                                 RENLOW
                        Call them in, now - nothing in or 
                        out.
                             (to pilot)
                        Don’t go anywhere.

           Renlow POPS out, GUARDS RUSHING OVER - Renlow’s BADGE ALREADY 
           OUT --

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        I need to see Sir Winston 
                        immediately...
           INT. KITCHEN

           Michael, UPSTAIRS, LYON POLICE ARE BLOCKING THE ROAD - FIVE 
           MORE CARS ROLLING BEHIND THEM - 

           -- All of Sir Winston’s GUARDS are ACTIVE --

           Michael PASSES THROUGH the KITCHEN, CHAOS ERUPTING --

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Finn still at the bar, sees Michael - NODS TO SIR WINSTON 
           whose at the FRONT DOOR heading out --

           Michael WAVES Finn to him --

                                 FINN
                        What’s going on?  Jean-Luc left in 
                        the van, the police -

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll explain in a bit, you have to 
                        trust me.  Come on --

           They enter the KITCHEN --

           EXT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE

           Sir Winston gets to Renlow and Lenz --

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 RENLOW
                        Sir Gregory Winston?

           He nods --

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a vault in your home?

           Off Sir Winston --

           INT. KITCHEN TO SERVICE ENTRANCE - SAME

           Michael and Finn head to the back entrance - the GUARD TURNS 
           TO THEM --

                                 GUARD
                             (French)
                        Where do you think --
           Michael SWIFTLY PUNCHES him in the ADAM’S APPLE - the GUARD 
           CHOKING as MICHAEL STRIKES HIM AGAIN, KNOCKING HIM OUT --

           He reaches down, pulls a SET OF CUFFS off the GUARD and his 
           KEYS -- Michael turns to FINN --

                                 MICHAEL
                        Turn around.

           Finn, not moving.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Finn, do as I say.

           Finn turns, Michael CUFFS HIM -

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Come on --

           He GUIDES Finn around the house - MICHAEL’S DEMEANOR shifting 
           to CONFIDENCE - 

           EXT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE

           Renlow, Lenz and Sir Winston enter the front door --

           -- Michael watches from the side of the house and then 
           MARCHES FINN, CUFFED forward --

           INT. BASEMENT - TO VAULT

           Sir Winston, Renlow and Lenz - with TWO LYON UNIFORMS round 
           the CORNER --

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        I highly doubt anyone could have 
                        broken into --

           And then THEY SEE IT - the BURNT VAULT DOOR - the THREE HOLES 
           still smoking - the TOOLS.

                                 SIR WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        My god...

           Renlow rushes to the VAULT - sees the HARDENED WELDED SEAM --

                                 RENLOW
                        It’s been welded shut?

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Hello?
           Sir Winston JUMPS BACK.  Renlow BENDS OVER, peers through a 
           HOLE - sees CHARLIE PEERING BACK --

                                 RENLOW
                        Hello?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Some guy knocked me out and locked 
                        me in here.

           A long pause.

                                 RENLOW
                        Charlie Kitson?

           Silence...

           EXT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE - BY HELICOPTER

           Michael MARCHES Finn to the HELICOPTER, PULLS the rear door - 
           the PILOT SHIFTS - 

           -- Michael HOLDS UP HIS FAKE INTERPOL ID --

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        We got him.  Say hello to Michael 
                        Kitson.

           The PILOT LOOKS at FINN who does his BEST TO LOOK TOUGH.

                                 FINN
                             (French)
                        Fuck you.

                                 PILOT
                             (French)
                        I was told to wait.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        And I was told to get him back to 
                        Paris before these Lyon assholes 
                        take the credit.  Renlow will drive 
                        back with Sir Winston.

           Michael shoves Finn in, gets in behind him, PULLS THE DOOR 
           SHUT.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                             (French)
                        Let’s go.  Now.
           The PILOT FLIPS some switches, pulls the COLLECTIVE and the 
           HELICOPTER lifts off --

           INT. HELICOPTER - OVER WINSTON ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael SEES the MANY POLICE CARS and ROADBLOCKS as the 
           HELICOPTER SAFELY lifts off --

           EXT. KITSON MOTORS - EVENING

           Jean-Luc walks from the LE DOUX CATERING VAN, he’s stripped 
           off his JACKET and removed his tie...

           Arrives at the FRONT DOOR - using his OWN KEYS, opens the 
           GATE and ENTERS --

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - SHOWROOM

           Jean-Luc moves quietly through the SHOWROOM to the GARAGE 
           DOOR, OPENS IT, entering -

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - GARAGE

           Working in the dark, he LOCATES the TRUNK AND SLIDES IT OUT, 
           OPENS IT, DIGS AROUND until he FINDS THE VELVET CASE --

           -- PULLS IT OUT, OPENS IT --

           -- EMPTY --

           -- THE GARAGE LIGHTS FLIP ON --

           -- Jean-Luc turns to see O’SHEA, in his WHEELCHAIR, LARGE 
           GUARD NEXT TO HIM --

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        What the hell?

           He QUICKLY DARTS TO THE DOOR - BUT GETS WALKED BACK IN by 
           ANOTHER GUARD, HOLDING A GUN --

                                 O’SHEA
                        Jean-Luc, good to see you again.

           Jean-Luc realizes...

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        How did he know?
           INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - 12TH FLOOR - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           Jean-Luc lights a cigarette, shaking out the match.  He keeps 
           his eyes pinned on the Michael’s hand drawn diagrams.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        We’re gonna need a fourth.

           Michael crosses his arms.

                                 MICHAEL
                        If you’re thinking Jude, forget it.

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        I wasn’t thinking Jude.

           Michael takes a long beat...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t want to misunderstand you--

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Charlie.

           A long beat as the men remain locked on each other - 
           something flickers behind Michael’s eyes, he buries it.

           INT. MICHAEL’S SEDAN - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           Michael listens...

                                 ELISE (V.O.)
                        You made fun of my apricot brandy.  
                        You told me a joke...about nuns and 
                        priests--

           The call terminated.  Michael closes the phone, processes the 
           sound of his wife’s voice --  as he WATCHES --

           EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - PARIS - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           Jean-Luc’s BLACK BMW pull up in front of the airport - 
           MICHAEL SEES Jean-Luc, window down, cigarette - 

           -- SEES CHARLIE get out of the passenger side - heads inside 
           the airport --

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - GARAGE - FLASHBACK

           Michael watches Charlie and Jean-Luc --
                                 MICHAEL
                        Everyone caught up?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Son of a bitch hasn’t aged a day

           INT. O’SHEA’S HOME - COMPUTER ROOM - FLASHBACK

           The tail end of the Michael / O’Shea conversation...

                                 O’SHEA
                        And what do I get in exchange for 
                        helping with this charade?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jean-Luc.

           O’Shea laughs.

                                 O’SHEA
                        I could get him anytime I want.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And, why haven’t you?  
                             (beat)
                        Because it’s not enough to get him. 
                        He has to know it was you.

                                 O’SHEA
                        You’d give up your best friend?

                                 MICHAEL
                        He ate at my table.  He knew her.  
                        He made his choice when he threw in 
                        with Charlie.  

           O’Shea studies Michael...

                                 O’SHEA
                        Remind me never to double-cross 
                        you.

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - GARAGE

           Jean-Luc stares at O’Shea...

                                 JEAN-LUC
                        Tell him it was not personal.

           O’Shea nods, one of his men opens the BAY DOOR - a VAN parked 
           outside...
                                 O’SHEA
                        I believe for Michael it was.  And 
                        it certainly will be for me...

           Jean-Luc BOLTS through the open door - the GUARD strikes HIM 
           as he PASSES, knocking him down - KICKS HIM in the GUT - 
           O’Shea rolls to him...

                                 O’SHEA (CONT’D)
                        That will likely be the last time 
                        you use your legs.  I hope you 
                        enjoyed it.

           O’Shea nods at his MEN, who PICK UP JEAN-LUC and DRAG him to 
           the van...

           INT. VAULT

           Renlow watches as TWO WELDERS finish CUTTING THE LAST of the 
           DOOR WELD away - Lenz and Sir Winston (and OTHERS) watch from 
           a safe distance.

           Lenz PULLS HIS WEAPON as the DOOR IS OPENED --

           INT. VAULT ROOM

           Charlie LEANS AGAINST the FAR WALL, Lenz enters first, the 
           RENLOW and finally Sir Winston.

           Sir Winston let’s out a GASP, picks up the BURNT FRAME.

                                 RENLOW
                        Something valuable?

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        Portrait of my wife, I was planning 
                        on giving it to her for our 
                        anniversary...

           Charlie BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s what you were keeping in 
                        here?  A fucking portrait?  

           Renlow turns to address Charlie, Lenz stands him up, CUFFS 
           HIM.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like my lawyer.
                                 RENLOW
                        Certainly, just wondering what 
                        you’re doing in Sir Winston’s 
                        vault?

                                 CHARLIE
                        My brother told me he needed help 
                        on a catering job, so I helped.  I 
                        had no idea he was going to steal 
                        anything.  He locked me in here.

                                 RENLOW
                        What did he steal?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (beat)
                        The French Blues.

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        The what?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Michael got away with them.  He’s 
                        probably not far.

           Renlow nods, seemingly accepting the story - he gets CLOSE TO 
           CHARLIE, runs his hand over the JACKET SEAM - YANKS DOWN, 
           RIPPING IT --

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, what the--

           BLUE DIAMONDS FALL from Charlie’s JACKET on to the floor - NO 
           ONE MOVES -- Charlie sees them, starts laughing...

           TWO COPS walk him out - Lenz pulls Renlow aside --

                                 LENZ
                        How did you know?

                                 RENLOW
                        It was in the leather binder.  
                        Right down to which pocket.

           INT. SEDAN - STREET - PARIS - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           Michael sits, his PLAIN SEDAN (never seen before), sits on a 
           TREE LINED STREET - the VANCE FILE open on the passenger 
           seat.

           -- BLACK MERCEDES PULLS IN --

           -- Michael GRABS THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER --
           EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael skirts AROUND THE CLOSING GATE, comes up QUIETLY 
           BEHIND THE DRIVER AS HE GETS OUT OF THE MERCEDES --

           -- HOLDS THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER TO HIS NECK as GARLON VANCE 
           EXITS HIS HOME - he FREEZES --

           -- AS MICHAEL reaches around the DRIVER, PULLS HIS GUN out, 
           pockets the LIGHTER and POINTS THE GUN at VANCE --

                                 VANCE
                        You won’t get fifty meters--

           Vance STOPS when he SEES MICHAEL...

                                 VANCE (CONT’D)
                        You?

                                 MICHAEL
                        The French Blues.

                                 VANCE
                        What about them?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need them back.

           Vance considers.

                                 VANCE
                        You realize there are three men 
                        inside.  They’ll be out here 
                        momentarily.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There’s no one inside, you just 
                        came from your trainer and you’re 
                        meeting your wife for breakfast in 
                        thirty minutes at Foulin, probably 
                        to discuss Henri’s futball game 
                        which you attended yesterday.  Your 
                        son’s team won, three to one.  

           Vance can’t help but smile.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Your guard is a lefty and I’m 
                        standing on his lame side, I’ll hit 
                        him twice in the back before he 
                        completes his turn.  I need those 
                        diamonds.
                                 VANCE
                        I paid you quite a bit to steal 
                        them for me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ll get them back, I promise.  
                        Consider it a favor.  I think you 
                        know I’m good for it.

           Off Vance, considering...

           INT. KITSON TOWNHOUSE - WORK ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Michael SEWS, by hand, pulling THREAD THROUGH a WHITE JACKET.

           -- MICHAEL POURS the FRENCH BLUES into the OPEN SEAM, SEWS IT 
           UP, SEALING IT -- Marks the JACKET with a SMALL RED DOT on 
           the inside collar --

           INT. WAREHOUSE - FLASHBACK

           Charlie tries his jacket --

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, Mom, Hey, Mom, we got a 
                        problem.

           TIME CUT --

           Michael walks to his jacket - WE NOW SEE THE RED DOT, tosses 
           it to Charlie.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You were wearing my jacket, that 
                        one is yours.

           INT. VAULT ROOM - BACK TO SCENE

           Renlow shakes his head, walks out with Lenz.

                                 LENZ
                        Something funny?

                                 RENLOW
                        He’s really good.

                                 LENZ
                        He couldn’t have gotten far on 
                        foot.  The place is surrounded and 
                        there’s only one road out.
           Sir Winston, still taking in his damaged vault.

                                 SIR WINSTON
                        Who is going to pay for this 
                        portrait?

           Renlow looks around, shakes his head, exits --

           EXT. SIR GREGORY WINSTON’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Renlow, Lenz, Charlie and POLICE stare at the SPOT THE 
           HELICOPTER was sitting.

                                 RENLOW
                        I told you, he’s really good.
                             (to Police)
                        Put Mr. Kitson in a car, I’ll be 
                        right with you.

           They WALK CHARLIE away.  Renlow turns to Lenz.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        You got a cigarette?

           Lenz, surprised, fishes one out, hands to Renlow, lights one 
           himself.

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        He planned the whole thing, right 
                        down to which pocket we’d find the 
                        diamonds in.  It was a set up, from 
                        the beginning.  Probably even used 
                        his real passport at the airport so 
                        we’d have a chance to review his 
                        plans.

           Lenz exhales, thinks...

                                 RENLOW (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 LENZ
                        Nothing.  Just makes me wonder what 
                        he was really stealing.

           Off that --

           EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOF TOP

           Michael and Finn get out -  Michael walks Finn to the roof 
           door, the HELICOPTER flies away.  Michael waits a beat, un-
           cuffs Finn.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Get lost.  Like really lost.  
                        They’re gonna be all over 
                        everything you know in less than a 
                        day.

                                 FINN
                        What happened?  How?

                                 MICHAEL
                        They took my wife.  Jean-Luc and 
                        Charlie.  They took her for the 
                        French Blues.

                                 FINN
                        Jean-Luc?  How do you know?

           Michael regards Finn.

                                 MICHAEL
                        The same way I know you weren’t 
                        involved.  Now get lost.  

           Finn accepts that, turns, Michael puts his HAND on HIM --

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Almost forget...

           Takes Finn’s HAND - PUTS A BRICK OF CASH in it.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Stay out of trouble.  

           Finn closes his hand.

                                 FINN
                        Thanks.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And I wouldn’t use the elevator, if 
                        you know what I mean...

           Finn nods, sees a FIRE ESCAPE at the edge of the building, 
           disappears down them.  Michael waits a beat, OPENS THE DOOR 
           to the POLICE STATION - enters...

           EXT. POLICE STATION  - PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael exits into the parking garage - INTERPOL BADGE 
           hanging out of his BREAST POCKET -

           - spots the MOTOR POOL, gets in the first UNMARKED POLICE CAR 
           HE SEES, starts it and PULLS OUT --
           EXT. STREETS - PARIS

           Michael drives the HIGHWAY, gets on --

           EXT. HIGHWAY - TO ROADS TO LOCATION

           Michael replays the ELISE conversations in his head.

                                 ELISE (V.O.)
                        ...you brought me Apricot Brandy...

           Michael passes a SIGN on the FREEWAY -- BRANDINE UNIVERSITY, 
           EXIT HERE --

           ROAD

           Michael DRIVES - PASSES THROUGH A SMALL TOWN - a MOVIE 
           THEATER MARQUEE - TITLE with a TAG:  #1 FRENCH COMEDY...

                                 ELISE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...You made a joke, your friends 
                        laughed...but I didn’t...

           ROAD

           Michael SEES A ROADSIDE DINER - SMALL shack of a place...

                                 ELISE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...You complained about the food...

           COUNTRYSIDE

           Michael drives, no light around, no houses, no other cars...

                                 ELISE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Your friends disappeared...

           Michael consults a MAP, makes a RIGHT TURN...

           SMALL VILLAGE AREA

           A TINY town, couple of STORE FRONTS, everything dark and 
           QUIET...

                                 ELISE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...You kept saying fromage...you’re 
                        my best frendal..friend...

           Michael EXAMINES his PRINT OUT - he FOUND FRENDEL’S GROCERY 
           and MAPPED IT --

           Michael PASSES FRENDEL’S GROCERY - CHEESE and WINE -- he sees 
           a SIGN up ahead --
           SIGN

           Simply reads - ST. CROIX HISTORIC MONOSTARY -

                                 ELISE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...You told me a joke about nuns 
                        and priests...

           Michael makes the TURN - heads down the drive...

           EXT. ST. CROIX MONOSTARY

           Michael PARKS, FLICKS HIS LIGHTS TWICE -- gets out...

           INT. ST. CROIX MONOSTARY - FRONT DOOR

           The PLACE IS DESERTED, what was once a TOURIST ATTRACTION is 
           now just OLD...

           Michael enters, CAUTIOUS -

                                 VOICE
                        Jean-Luc?

           Michael turns - sees JUDE COMING OUT OF THE DARKNESS.

           Jude FREEZES when he sees MICHAEL, PULLS A GUN --

                                 JUDE
                        Motherfuck.

           Michael, calm as a summer day...

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s over, Jude.

           Jude points the gun.

                                 JUDE
                        Fuck that.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know Jean-Luc talked you into it.  
                        I know you took care of her.  I 
                        understand, it’s okay.

                                 JUDE
                        I want to talk to Jean-Luc.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s already running...and he has 
                        the French Blues.
           Jude processes the information, blinks rapidly.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        In the end, he couldn’t live with 
                        killing her.  He told me where to 
                        find you.  He double crossed you, 
                        too.

           Jude can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I know you took care of her.  I 
                        know that.  Put the gun away.  Let 
                        me get her, make sure she’s safe.  
                        I’m gonna need a new crew, you 
                        understand?

           Jude takes a beat, lowers the gun.

                                 JUDE
                        I never touched her.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know.  

                                 JUDE
                        It was Jean-Luc’s idea.  He said 
                        your brother made the deal.  
                        Offered me...

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s fine. I just want my wife.  
                        This is all fixable.

           Jude puts the gun in his belt...

                                 JUDE
                        Follow me...

           INT. ST. CROIX MONOSTARY - HALLWAY

           Jude leads, Michael follows, his eyes taking in everything - 
           the stop at a THICK DOOR, Jude FUMBLES with the KEYS - finds 
           the CORRECT ONE --

           -- REACHES FOR THE DOOR - MICHAEL REACHES FOR THE GUN --

                                 JUDE
                        No --

           BANG - single SHOT - JUDE’S EYES LOCKED ONTO MICHAEL’S.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Think about it, Jude: If you didn’t 
                        have a gun, you’d still be alive.

           Jude falls BACK, BLOOD POOLING around him.  Michael WIPES THE 
           GUN - tosses it - opens the door --

           INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION / ELISE’S ROOM 

           Elise sees him, but can’t believe it - for a MOMENT the STARE 
           and then RUN INTO EACH OTHER’S ARMS -- MICHAEL HOLDING HER 
           FOR DEAR LIFE...

                                 ELISE
                             (French)
                        You came.  You came.  

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        I love you.   Wife.

           Off that...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN...

           INT. KITSON MOTORS - DAY - FIVE YEARS AGO

           Michael wipes down the GTO (now CANDY APPLE RED) as he HEARS 
           THE DOOR open --

           -- Turns to see ELISE BOUTIN (late 20s) enter, followed by 
           DR. EVIN YOUNG (40s)....her current boyfriend who seems more 
           interested in the cars than her...

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        Good afternoon.

                                 YOUNG
                             (French)
                        Hello.

           Elise looks around, Michael watches her.  Young steps to the 
           1968 SHELBY MUSTANG -- whistles - Elise admires the car,  
           steals a glance a Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (French)
                        You like American cars?
                                 ELISE
                        You’re American?

           Michael nods.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Guilty.  What gave me away?

           Elise smiles, not giving it up.  Young, oblivious...

                                 YOUNG
                        Beautiful.  How much?

           Michael steps to the opposite side, speaks to both of them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not a dishwasher, the value 
                        isn’t based on a number.  You have 
                        to experience it.  

                                 YOUNG
                        Yes, yes...I’m sure.  And, what 
                        will the experience cost me?

           Michael looks at Elise, something electric passes between 
           them...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hard to say.  Everybody’s 
                        experience is different.  Some 
                        people appreciate it more than 
                        others.

           Elise looks away, lets her hand run the HIGHLY POLISHED body 
           of the car...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You might want to give it a run, 
                        put her through the paces.

           Young glances at his WAFER THIN WATCH...

                                 YOUNG
                        We have dinner reservations at 
                        L'Arpege.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I hear it’s wonderful.

           Young gives Michael a condescending smile.  

                                 YOUNG
                             (French)
                        It’s just dinner.
           Michael, eyes never leaving Elise...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Is it?

           Young takes her hand, Michael walks them to the door.  Young 
           exits first...

           Michael extends his hand, Elise takes it...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Michael Kitson.

                                 ELISE
                        Elise.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (beat)
                        Nice to meet you...

           Off that...
