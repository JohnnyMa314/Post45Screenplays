          And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; 
          that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation 
          in judgment.
                                                           -- Numbers 35:12
           EXT. HIGHWAY, WESTERN OKLAHOMA FARMLAND - DUSK

           Harvest season. Ample wheat fields stretch to the horizon. 
           Combines till abundant land at measured intervals. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Bible tells all sorts a stories 
                        ‘bout good and evil, and the 
                        difference between the two... 

           A SETTING SUN casts fire-orange on hard-worked LABORERS.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        In my time here, thing I realized, 
                        those ain’t terms that’s applicable 
                        to man...

           An unswerving two-lane marks the only interruption in a sea 
           of Hard Red Winter. An asphalt vein through the heartland. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Seems the world only got one kinda 
                        man... Difference is whose telling 
                        their story.   

           A BLACK MERCURY COUGAR glides smooth over flatland, past a 
           sign shaped like Oklahoma. A lonely drive into a lonely town. 

           TITLE BURN: KINGFISHER, CENTRAL PLAINS, OKLAHOMA

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - DUSK

           A weathered farmhouse set back on acres of billowing wheat. 
           The maroon and white Sooners flag flaps in the evening wind 
           just below the Star Spangled Banner.

           A separate WORKSHOP behind, big as the house itself. 
           Decommissioned farm machinery awaits repair nearby. 

           INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Lit by the hot blue glow of a PLASMA TORCH as it HUMS through 
           quarter-inch steel. Sparks cascade to floor. 

           It’s operated by a burly man hidden behind a welding mask. 
           Hands like a worn catcher’s mitt. Thick, beaten, and rugged. 

           We note a MARINE CORPS TATTOO on his sinewy forearm - Bald 
           Eagle above the globe, anchor behind, U.S.M.C inked below. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Dad! Dad! Tell Colt to stop.

           The shop door rolls open. JENNY (10) tumbles inside followed 
           by her older brother, COLT (19). Play fighting.
                                 JENNY
                        Colt! Quit it.

           The torch kicks off and the welding mask flips up to reveal a 
           handsome man:

           NATHAN SPILLER: 40s, defined jaw and muscular neck. Bred from 
           good stock. A man who fought his way through life and always 
           won, but soft eyes betray an earthly kindness. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Dammit, Colt! Not in here!

           Colt and Jenny stop dead in their tracks. He’s the law.

                                 NATHAN
                             (re: the torch)
                        Thing burns hotter’n hell... Never 
                        in here.

           The boy sulks while Jenny cracks an impish smile.

                                 JENNY
                        But Daddy... You did say you’d take 
                        us to get ice cream t’night.

           Nathan shakes his head, knows he lost. She’s gonna be a real 
           heartbreaker, pretty as a peach by age ten.  

                                 NATHAN
                        Get in the truck. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET, KINGFISHER - NIGHT

           Sun’s gone and the world’s now tinged with PURPLE RADIANCE of 
           the young night. A God fearing community where ‘neighbor’ 
           means family. Locals enjoy the summer repose. 

           The two-dollar theater plays the current Hollywood fare. 
           Lights flickering brightly on the overhead marquee.

           HIGH-SCHOOL KIDS gather on street-side benches to flirt. None 
           will leave this town. The kind of place you don’t leave.

           EXT. FENTON’S ICE CREAM - CONTINUOUS

           Nathan pays cash, takes his malt. Passes ice cream to Colt 
           and Jenny sitting at the picnic table out front.

           Owner JAMES FENTON (60s, apron, balding), nods kindly.

                                 NATHAN
                        How’s business, Mr. Fenton?

                                 FENTON
                        Be nice if summer went ten months.
                                 NATHAN
                        Hear that... You want me to take a 
                        look at that cooler? See if I can’t 
                        help?

                                 FENTON
                        Nah. It’ll be here tomorrow. You, 
                        enjoy the night, Nathan.

           Nathan nods. Fenton smiles appreciative. 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           A reliable Chevy patrols the strip. Behind the wheel:

           SHERIFF EVERETT WALSH: 56, cowboy hat and boots. Could tell 
           stories for days. Steers as if on a track. Done it for thirty-
           plus years, cherished every one. Born here. He’ll die here. 

           He brakes at a stop sign, waves to a friendly couple, CHUCK 
           HOLLAND and his wife ESTHER (50s), putting up a sign in the 
           front window of their restaurant -- HOLLAND’S EATERY.

           Walsh smiles proud. Feels good to protect and serve. 

                                 NATHAN (O.S.)
                        Sheriff.

           He turns to see Nathan climbing into his F-150 outside the 
           passenger door. Colt and Jenny nearby.

                                 WALSH
                        Evenin’ Nathan.
                             (looking past)
                        Colt. Jenny. 

           Jenny waves, ice cream everywhere. Colt nods hello. Walsh 
           smiles, continues down Main.

           A moment later, he notices the Mercury Cougar cruise past. 
           Instinctively marks the car as belonging to outsiders.

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - LATER

           CRICKETS calm as Nathan’s truck pulls in, kicks up dirt. 
           Jenny jumps out, runs to the house. The boys follow suit.   

                                 NATHAN
                        Jenny. Brush your teeth. Get ready 
                        for bed. 

           She hurries in the unlocked front door.

           Stars like diamonds, glitter above in jet-black infinity. 
           Nathan stops to take in the quiet night, appreciate his land. 
           Colt notices, looks back before entering the house.
           INT. JENNY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenny lies in bed surrounded by a shrine of stuffed animals. 
           Her mind active, staring at fluorescent stars pasted above. A 
           WHITE CAT purrs softly, curled beside for the night.  

           Nathan watches from the doorway. A loving father that never 
           thought he’d have a girl, now can’t imagine life without one.  

                                 NATHAN
                        You brush your teeth, sweetheart?

           She nods. He moves to the bed, takes a seat on the edge.

                                 NATHAN
                        Good girl.

                                 JENNY
                        The Sooners play tomorrow?

           He laughs, strokes her hair and pulls up the blanket.

                                 NATHAN
                        It’s July, honey... Sooners don’t 
                        play ‘till September. 

                                 JENNY
                        Really?

                                 NATHAN
                        Really... 

           He smiles, kisses her forehead.

                                 NATHAN
                        Sweet dreams, angel. I love you.

           He exits, leaving the door cracked.

           IN THE HALLWAY.

           Nathan glances inside Colt’s room, sees his son reading. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Good night, Colt.

           Colt looks to his father and we get the sense these two don’t 
           quite understand each other. Still waters run deep. 

                                 COLT
                        Good night.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Nathan moves to the window, lights a smoke, inhales heavy. 
           NATHAN’S P.O.V.: A hundred FIREFLIES play across Winter Wheat 
           beyond. Tails flash in short bursts like spirited lightbulbs.

           On the night stand, A PICTURE OF NATHAN AND HIS WIFE BRIANNE 
           holding a child bathed in a waning summer sun.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - LATER

           Earth’s quiet. Night balmy. The Black Cougar’s now parked 
           next to Nathan’s truck. Doors open quietly and out step... 

           Armed men wearing rubber THREE STOOGES MASKS. 

           Doors shut gently behind. They move fluidly toward the house. 

           An eerie sight: LARRY, CURLY, and MOE shotguns drawn. 

           INT. SPILLER HOUSE - NIGHT

           FLASHLIGHTS dance along the walls of the upstairs hallway. 
           The masked Stooges glide silently into a selected door.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CA-CHUNK! Nathan opens his eyes, stunned to find himself 
           staring down the barrel of a 12-gauge shotgun held before the 
           distorted rubber face of LARRY FINE, curls and all. 

                                 LARRY
                        We’re here for the safe. All goes 
                        well, we open it’n not your head.

           Quickly, MOE gags Nathan, pulls a pillow case over his head, 
           swallowing his world so quick there’s no time for heroics. 

           INT. STUDY - NIGHT

           Moe ushers Nathan into the first-floor room. Before them, 
           Colt kneels, pillow case over head, hands tied. No Jenny.  

           CURLY stands across the room shaking his head ‘no.’ A 
           painting removed from the far wall reveals...

           A HIDDEN STRONGBOX. It’s heavy door swung open. Flat empty.

                                 LARRY
                             (under his breath)
                        Fuck.

           Moe locks eyes with Larry. Emotionless, cold as ice. 

                                 MOE
                        Just get it over with.
           Larry nods, trains his gun on the back of Nathan’s head. This 
           man’s got a knack for killing. Eyes gleaming. Scary calm.

           We TRACK UP gun metal, noting Larry’s trigger hand has only 
           THREE FINGERS, pinky and ring loped off below the knuckle.

           BLAM! MUZZLE FLASH illuminates the room as he takes a life. 
           His face reflects the fire of hell itself. Room goes dark. 

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           BLAM! A front window FLASHES WHITE with a second gunshot. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK.

           And our title burns in...

                                 CITIES OF REFUGE

           Over BLACK we hear THUMP,THUMP,THUMP! Heavy KNOCKING.

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - MORNING

           Early. Golden light from the east spreads onto a large, 
           plentiful ranch. Wood fencing lines a property that sees no 
           end and horses run wild over expansive grasslands within.

           All sharply contrasted by Kingfisher POLICE CRUISERS parked 
           in the drive, a flurry of oscillating LIGHTS, and at the...

           FRONT DOOR. THUMP,THUMP,THUMP! Sheriff Walsh bangs heavy, 
           eyes red with pain and doubt. The door opens to reveal:

           HECTOR DELGADO: 50s, unassuming, but with the concealed 
           confidence of earned wealth. He speaks with a slight accent, 
           the only hint of an upbringing in harsh rural Mexico. 

                                 DELGADO
                        There something I can help you 
                        with, Sheriff?

                                 WALSH
                        Hate to come here like this 
                        Hector... but...
                             (beat; difficult)
                        Nathan and Colt Spiller were 
                        murdered last night...

           That lands. Delgado’s not sure how to respond. 

                                 WALSH
                        His daughter’s missin’... 
           Walsh pauses, removes his hat as Delgado’s wife, ELENA (40s, 
           aged well) steps into the foyer, mind foggy from sleep. She 
           calls to her husband in Spanish.  

                                 ELENA
                        (Hector. What’s going on?)

                                 DELGADO
                             (turning back)
                        (Everything’s fine, my love. Would 
                        you please put on some coffee?)

           She abides. Walsh waits until she’s out of earshot.

                                 WALSH
                        We found boot prints. Musta been 
                        two or three men with 12-gauge...
                             (beat)
                        The past you two’ve had...

                                 DELGADO
                        I understand, Sheriff... 

           Delgado steps aside, inviting Walsh to enter.

                                 DELGADO
                        Please come inside. Elena will have 
                        coffee ready in a moment...

           Walsh nods tight, much obliged. Officers follow soon after. 

           Delgado signals to RANCH HANDS in a lawn truck nearby. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Charlie.

           Their foreman approaches: CHARLIE LEVITT (30s, tanned, dirty 
           from life outdoors). Flicks a cigarette butt on the way. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Get the horses in their stalls. 
                        Make sure the Sheriff has no 
                        difficulty checking the lot.  

           Charlie nods before leaning in close, whispers subtle. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dominguez boys and Bulger didn’t 
                        show today...

           Delgado appreciates the remark, nods tight and heads inside.

           COUNTRY MUSIC rises, the CHATTER of a crowd takes us to...
           INT. GOOD HURT BAR - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a feminine hand selecting a song from the jukebox. 

           PULL BACK to see CANDY (27): Tank top and skin tight jeans, a 
           goddess of Good Hurt. Female body’s a thing of beauty.

           TITLE BURN: LAREDO, TEXAS - US/MEXICO BORDER - ONE WEEK LATER

           Candy glides to a billiard table through the crowded room. 
           Many eyes cop a look, but we move to a pair in particular... 

           AT THE BAR. A well-built MARCUS LATTIMORE (30s) tracks her 
           every move. Dark and handsome, most female eyes probably 
           watch him. A little edge and the confidence to go with it. 

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        She’s just your type, Marc. 

           His longtime friend, ADRIAN SHAW (30s) speaks up: A lady 
           killer himself. More good looks than he’s ever cared to be 
           conscious of. Blonde, athletic, looks military.   

                                 MARCUS
                        That’s what I’m worried ‘bout.

           Adrian’s eyes join Marcus’ as they watch Candy and her 
           friend, TIFFANY (20s), at the billiard table. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        She with him?

           He tips his beer towards a bull of a man, TOMMY LEE, leaning 
           against the far wall and keeping a close eye on Candy.

                                 MARCUS
                        Be my guess. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Explains why none of these other 
                        fellas has taken a pass at her yet.

           They glance at each other, cracking smiles. Game on. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’ll take the friend... Got bigger 
                        tits anyway. 

           INT. BILLIARD ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Marcus strides over, Bud Heavy in hand, confidence to the 
           brim. Adrian follows, breaking off to intercept Tiffany.

                                 MARCUS
                        Couldn’t help but notice you ladies 
                        playin’ pool alone...
           She lines up a shot, doesn’t even lift her eyes.

                                 CANDY
                        Ever wonder why that might be?

           CRACK! Candy buries the six in the far pocket.

                                 MARCUS
                        I’m guessing it’s the redneck 
                        wallflower over there. Thinks you 
                        belong to ‘im... You his property?

                                 CANDY
                        I’m sorry, but I don’t belong to 
                        anybody...

           She glances up into his smile. Now she’s interested. 

                                 MARCUS
                        What’s your name?

                                 CANDY
                        Candy.

                                 MARCUS
                        Isn’t that sweet... Last name Cane? 
                        I’m Marcus.

           She plays tough, but her eyes are already in bed with him.

                                 MARCUS
                        That there’s Adrian... He likes 
                        your friend. Tried tellin’ him you 
                        were the better looker, but he 
                        don’t listen all that well...

                                 CANDY
                        Can’t blame ‘em... She got bigger 
                        tits.

           He’s in love.

                                 MARCUS
                        I buy ya a drink?

                                 CANDY
                        If you wanna get your ass kicked. 

           He smiles, doesn’t scare easy. Adrian notes the remark, locks 
           eyes with Marcus. An understanding. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER - NIGHT

           Two COUNTRY BOYS hold Marcus against a wall while Tommy Lee 
           rains BODY SHOTS into his gut. 
           Candy and Tiffany stand nearby, trying to help.

                                 CANDY
                        God dammit, Tommy Lee! STOP IT!

           It’s not even a fight. It’s an ass-kicking. 

           EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           A Chevy pick-up idles in the darkened rear corner of the lot, 
           lights off, muffler HISSING hot air. 

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian sits alone, body lost in darkness. Eyes painted with 
           WHITE LIGHT thrown from the rear view as he watches...

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Tommy Lee shake the sting from his fist and Marcus spit warm 
           blood, when suddenly... 

           WHOOP-WHOOP! Police SIRENS come to life. The Country Boys 
           dash like roaches. A SPOTLIGHT scans the lot. Only Marcus 
           remains, writhing in pain. 

           EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian shakes his head, throws the truck in gear and eases 
           into the gas, leaving his friend behind. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER

           Marcus lies facedown in the dirt. Sirens throw red-blue 
           lights across the lot. People gather to watch, curious.

           A LAREDO COP pops the trunk on an ALL-BLACK COUGAR. Marcus 
           watches the inevitable. Hands cuffed. Face vacant.

           EXT. RIVERWIND INDIAN CASINO - DAY

           Gaudy NEONS cycle continuously along the overhang. A navy 
           blue sedan, FBI markings, pulls to the curb. Out steps...

           SPECIAL AGENT DAVID HAYES: 40s, brash but haunted. He was 
           athletic, the body quit early. Still holds a grudge. He was 
           going to be different. 

           TITLE BURN: NORMAN, OKLAHOMA - TWO DAYS LATER

           Hayes flashes FBI credentials to a VALET. Enters at a clip. 
           INT. RIVERWIND INDIAN CASINO - POKER ROOM - DAY

           Hayes moves along the wall, briefcase in hand. His clothes 
           feign class, face unshaven and tired. Running on fumes.  

           He nears a table of COWBOYS playing high stakes Hold ‘Em, 
           keeping his eyes trained on the player with the big stack: 

           BROOKE BENEDICT: 30s, strikingly beautiful but unabashedly 
           rough around the edges. Tousled hair above white tee and 
           jeans. The usual attire. 

           There’s no doubt she doesn’t quite fit the bill for the type 
           surrounding this table. Hayes finds it amusing. 

           AT THE TABLE.

           The men shake their heads as Brooke rakes in the winnings. 
           CHET, the big fella across the table, was last to fold...

                                 CHET
                        Can we at least see ‘em, so I feel 
                        better about folding those tens?

                                 BROOKE
                        Go ‘head. Curious myself.

           Chet looks. Smiles and tosses down her THREE/FIVE OFF SUIT.

                                 CHET
                             (under his breath)
                        Sonofabitch...

                                 BROOKE
                        Gotta keep your hands off those 
                        chips, Chet. You’re shuffling half 
                        the stack when you got high pair. 
                        That’s too easy.  

           He hangs his head like a scolded child. The other players 
           laugh, used to her much appreciated pointers. 

                                 HAYES (O.S.)
                        Doctor Benedict?

           Brooke pauses, not used to being called that in this place. 
           She turns to see Agent Hayes just behind, FBI badge out.

                                 HAYES
                        Can we talk?

                                 CHET
                        Finally. Somebody gonna prove she’s 
                        an evil, cheatin’... 
                                 BROOKE
                             (points directly at him)
                        Chet. Don’t you dare.

           INT. SMOKING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hayes sits in a booth across from Brooke. These two have a 
           history and it shows. She signals a waiter to bring the 
           usual, not interested in whatever Hayes is offering.

                                 BROOKE
                        I need a drink. You want one?

                                 HAYES
                        No thanks. I quit that...

                                 BROOKE
                        The missus?

           Hayes glances to his wedding band, slips the hand into his 
           lap, smiles polite. She senses that struck a nerve.

                                 HAYES
                        She ain’t around anymore... Ring’s 
                        a habit. 

           A beat as she processes. Hoping that’s not why he’s here.

                                 HAYES
                        Don’t worry. Ain’t why I’m here.

           He slides a manila folder across the table.

                                 HAYES
                        I need your help... Sure you heard 
                        ‘bout the Spiller case. Been all 
                        over the news...

           He nods to a TV screen overhead: HOMICIDE IN KINGFISHER 
           scrolls. REPORTERS cover the action from Main Street.

                                 BROOKE
                             (nods)
                        Why you involved?

                                 HAYES
                        Family had a little girl. Couldn’t 
                        find her... 

           Brooke opens the folder, glances at the Spiller case file. 

                                 HAYES
                        Least not a body. 

           She stops, closes the file, places it back on the table. 
                                 BROOKE
                        Hate to rain on your parade, Hayes. 
                        But I read people now. Don’t find 
                        ‘em anymore. 

                                 HAYES
                        That’s all I’m asking you to do.

                                 BROOKE
                             (beat)
                        News didn’t say you had suspects.

                                 HAYES
                        Few locals... Landowner named 
                        Hector Delgado was the primary... 
                        But nobody capable of this... 

           He shakes his head slow and deliberate, flips to a PHOTO OF 
           THE CRIME SCENE: Blood and gore coat the Spiller study. 

           The image has no affect on Brooke. 

                                 HAYES
                        ‘Till we found the killer... Good 
                        ol’ boy. Former Delta Force... Man 
                        that’s probably done worse. He’s 
                        psych trained to resist all kindsa 
                        shit and a polygraph didn’t help. 
                             (smiles weak)
                        I can’t get anything... 

           She sees this is hard for him. She likes it. 

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m not FBI anymore, Hayes...

                                 HAYES
                        That’s right... You got a cushy 
                        desk job, now...

           He pulls out a PICTURE OF JENNY AND NATHAN: he’s dressed in 
           military uniform, could be coming home from a tour overseas. 

                                 HAYES
                        ...But that ain’t the girl I knew. 

           A beat as Brooke’s eyes linger on the image. She knows 
           exactly why he chose to show this photo.

                                 BROOKE
                        How long’s she been gone?

                                 HAYES
                        Nine days.

           She tenses a bit, knows that’s not good. 
                                 BROOKE
                        No note? 

           He shakes his head, knows she’s considering. 

                                 HAYES
                        Now or never. You know that.

           He stands, slaps a $20 on the table.

                                 HAYES
                        And you look good, Brooke. 

           Hayes leaves as the waiter returns with her order. She looks 
           to the drink while Hayes walks away. Makes her decision. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Hayes!

           He keeps walking, knows he’s got her. Smiles to himself. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET, KINGFISHER - DAY  

           FBI sedan drives the strip. Tragedy smothers like a blanket. 
           Ice cream shop and theater now closed. CUSTOMERS dawdle from 
           Holland’s diner, fanning themselves against humid air.

                                 HAYES (V.O.)
                        Town’s a bit shook up right now...

           INT. FBI SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Hayes eyes Brooke’s legs, now tightly bound in a pencil 
           skirt. Very professional. Pressed blazer, little makeup.

                                 HAYES
                        The family was well known. Father 
                        was a marine turned mechanic. Fixed 
                        farm machinery, did custom metal 
                        work to pay the bills...   

           Brooke feels the weight of this crime. Her mind drifts, 
           watching Esther Holland lifelessly water flowers on the walk. 

                                 HAYES
                        You gonna be alright?

                                 BROOKE
                        Yea... Just been awhile.

           He nods, understanding. 

           EXT. KINGFISHER POLICE STATION - DAY

           A flurry of activity. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN mill about, 
           descending upon this small town like locusts.
                                 HAYES
                        Stay with me.

           Hayes guides Brooke through the MASS OF LOCALS gathered at 
           the entrance: Men and women. Blue collar. Seeking answers.

           Their leader, RHETT CHILDRESS (40s, former football star, now 
           just too drunk to scare), fronts strength for the crowd.

                                 RHETT
                        That bastard needs to rot in hell!

           His wife, PEGGY CHILDRESS (39), pulls their son close. 

           DEPUTIES HUNTER FINK (20s, muscular but baby faced) and CESAR 
           MORENO (30s, Hispanic) open the door for Hayes and Brooke.

                                 DEPUTY FINK
                        That’s enough, Rhett! Go on home, 
                        let us do our job. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Hayes leads Brooke inside. Circular fans SQUEAK overhead, 
           strained from overuse. Four desks, aging computers, faded 
           wood paneling on the walls.  

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY  

           Simple room. Square, neat. Brooke enters just ahead of Hayes. 

                                 HAYES
                             (shaking hands)
                        Sheriff Walsh. Dr. Brooke Benedict.

                                 WALSH
                        Have a seat.

           Brooke sits awkwardly, fidgets to cross her legs. Never been 
           comfortable in proper dress. 

           Walsh sits slow. He’s in tatters. Coffee in hand looks to be 
           the only thing keeping him upright. Trying to hide the hurt.

                                 WALSH
                        My deputy set you up with a motel 
                        off the 33... Need anything else, 
                        don’t be afraid t’ask. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Thank you Sheriff. That’ll be fine.

           He nods, moving on. 
                                 WALSH
                        Hayes says you used to be FBI, now 
                        you... detect lies for a livin’?

                                 BROOKE
                        Part right... I’m a psychologist. I 
                        analyze subject emotion and micro-
                        expression... for lies, yes.

           He deliberately wipes sweat from his brow. 

                                 WALSH
                        That help more with poker or 
                        kidnappings?

           She reads his doubt. It’s not hard.

                                 BROOKE
                        ...Most abductions involve family 
                        members... Hard to look a father in 
                        the eye and know he hurt his own 
                        son... I’m better at readin’ it 
                        than a polygraph. 

                                 WALSH
                             (undecided)
                        Hayes thinks it’ll find Jenny... 
                        Suppose we’d give it a shot. 

           She doesn’t appreciate the slight.

                                 BROOKE 
                        Jenny’s been gone ten days with no 
                        ransom note, Sheriff. After 
                        fourteen, chances of findin’ her 
                        are almost zero. 
                             (beat)
                        I recommend we get started. 

           Hayes smiles at the small boldness, remembers her fire.

           INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

           Brooke follows as the men lead her through the old building. 
           Hayes hands over a threatening MUGSHOT OF MARCUS.

                                 HAYES
                        Marcus Lattimore. Picked ‘im up for 
                        a bar fight in Laredo, Texas night 
                        b’fore last.

           Past empty drunk tanks, a visitors room, pay phones. 

                                 HAYES
                        Specially trained in weapons and 
                        tactics...

                        Damn near first on the ground in 
                        Afghanistan after nine-eleven.  

           Walsh opens a door for Brooke and Hayes to enter.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           The open air building is sticky with summer humidity. A 
           circular fan blows, slowly arcing relief.

           Recording equipment and case notes fill the only table. TWO-
           WAY MIRROR on one wall looks into the INTERROGATION ROOM.  

                                 HAYES
                        He’s stickin’ to his story. Claims 
                        he knows nothin’ and refused a 
                        lawyer.

           Brooke nods, takes a mental note. 

                                 HAYES
                        Don’t know it’d do him much good. 
                             (beat; off her look)
                        Laredo cops ran the plates on his 
                        car. Came up stolen... Found a pair 
                        of boots that match prints from the 
                        Spiller’s and a 12-gauge that could 
                        be the murder weapon in the 
                        trunk... He was runnin’ for the 
                        border, we caught a break.

                        Background?

                        What you seen’s what we have. CIA 
                        buried everything once he made 
                        Delta. Sonofabitch’s like a ghost. 

           Brooke considers, doesn’t like it. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Spiller was military too...

                        ‘Bout the only connection we got... 
                        But, Spiller was a marine. Never 
                        served together.

                        known associates... Nothing yet. 

           She nods, looks to the interrogation room. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Let’s see him.
           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           -- Concrete. Single light. Marcus reads peacefully on his 
           cot. Legs crossed, feet up. A man comfortable with solitude.

           -- He stands. Moves to the bars. Deputy Moreno handcuffs his 
           wrists. No resistance. Calculated movement hides danger.  

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - LATER

           Hayes eyes Brooke. Remembers those hips fondly. She does her 
           best to ignore it, flipping through grisly IMAGES FROM THE 
           CRIME SCENE: Marcus in military gear, Spiller family, etc. 

           All look up when the interrogation room door swings open and 
           Deputy Moreno guides Marcus inside, chains him to the floor.

           Brooke studies his every move. Surprised by his appearance. 
           His good looks. Tracks him as a man not afraid. Calm. 
           Confident. Not the look of a cold blooded killer.     

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus is oddly stolid, considering. Eyes in the direction of 
           the mirror but focus locked beyond. Thousand yard stare. 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           Hayes notes Brooke’s attention. Eyes fixed on Marcus. 

                                 HAYES
                        Ain’t playing cards anymore, 
                        Brooke... He’s scary good. 

           She catches herself, turns back. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You bring me here to help or to 
                        watch, Hayes?  

           Walsh exhales a plume of smoke, admires her backbone.

                                 HAYES
                        Alright... Let’s go. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Let me try it alone. 

           Hayes looks to Walsh, thinking it over.

                                 HAYES
                        ...Used to do this together. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Lot we used to do together...
           He gets it. Things have changed. Nods. 

                                 HAYES
                        Be smart. 

           She gently takes the case file, moves to exit. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Marcus’ gaze shifts to the door as it opens to reveal Brooke. 
           Finds her eyes, holds steady. There’s a moment. A spark.   

           She cheats confidence, walks tall, moves to sit at the table. 
           Room’s hotter than hell. Stifling. It takes her breath away. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Hello, Marcus.

           He doesn’t respond. Just follows her legs, every muscle 
           twitch. An undeniable physical attraction. Both know it. 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hayes sees it too, not thrilled. Chemistry clear as crystal.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke sits, forces her legs crossed. Playing refined.

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m here to ask you a few questions

                        ...Agent Hayes is busy trying to

                                 MARCUS
                             (interrupting)
                        You FBI?

           She gives the slightest glance to the mirror. Marcus sees it. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Been that way for ten years. 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Smoke billows out of Walsh’s lungs as he and Agent Hayes keep 
           an eye on Brooke. They can hear every word. 
                                 WALSH
                        He’s gonna chew her up. 

                                 HAYES
                        Don’t sell ‘er short. Girl’s 
                        tougher’n she looks.

           Walsh inhales deep, still not convinced.

                                 HAYES
                        She was nineteen for nineteen in 
                        child abductions. Any kid got taken 
                        in Oklahoma, she got ‘em back. 

                                 WALSH
                        ...She quit?

                                 HAYES
                        Went nineteen for twenty.

           He understands, shakes his head soft. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke plays calm, appears composed. Marcus is stone cold.

                                 MARCUS
                        What’s your name?

                        Not Special Agent Benedict? 

           He smiles, sees right through her.

           ANGLE BELOW THE TABLE: Brooke’s nerves swell, legs tense, and 
           her foot begins to tap air slowly. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Thought maybe we’d talk like we

                        People don’t ask if they can begin. 
                        People just start.

           She gives a sardonic smile, takes a beat before continuing.

                        There’s no way to sugarcoat this,

                        boots that match prints from the 
                        Spillers... It won’t take much

                        she, Marcus?

           He holds her stare, knows she’s not getting anything, and 
           like playing a game, he decides to change the pace.

                                 MARCUS
                        What’s a pretty thing like you

                        No... Too proud for that. Raised

                        You a daddy’s girl, Brooke?

           Her legs shift to the side, angled away from him. A subtle, 
           nervous turn and he notes it. Smiles slight. 

                                 MARCUS
                        What’s wrong? Daddy never teach you

                        Pretty good, Marcus... You get all 
                        that just now? 
                             (beat)
                        Want some kinda prize? A pat on the 
                        back for wasting our time and 
                        Jenny’s?

                                 MARCUS
                        What the hell this girl mean t’you? 
                        You know that family?

                                 BROOKE
                        ...Seems you see things just fine. 
                        You tell me. 

           She reads a sudden intensity in him and it’s frightening.

                                 MARCUS
                        Tell you one thing I see... See you 
                        pretending to be somethin’ you 
                        ain’t. And it’s not very becomin’.

                                 BROOKE
                        Could say the same about you, 
                        Marcus. I’ve seen your record...

                                 MARCUS
                             (interrupting)
                        Lady, don’t even try’n tell me what 
                        I am... I’ve seen things you 
                        thought only existed in nightmares. 
                        Things your daddy didn’t prepare 
                        you for, and I see right through 
                        that bullshit false pride... 

           He delivers these words like a knockout punch. 
                                 MARCUS
                        Sitting here, lookin’ at nothin’ 
                        more’n a spooked little girl, 
                        spends her life tryin’ to prove she 
                        can hang with the boys. 

           She clenches her jaw, the words sting. He’s well aware. 

                                 MARCUS
                        So, Special Agent Benedict... 
                        Before you gonna start askin’ me 
                        questions, make sure you can handle 
                        the fuckin’ answers.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Hayes and Walsh realize it’s over. She’s done. 

                                 WALSH
                        Go get ‘er...

                                 HAYES
                        I’m goin’.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus leans back, satisfied. He took round one. Brooke 
           breaths heavy, unable to find the words when Hayes STORMS IN. 

           He locks eyes with Marcus, and we immediately sense there’s 
           no love lost between these two. 

                                 HAYES
                             (gently, to Brooke)
                        Come on, let’s go. 

           He takes Brooke delicately by the arm. Marcus notices the 
           physicality, the way Hayes touches her. It upsets him. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - REAR EXIT - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke storms out the back door, body shaking. She’s a mess 
           of emotions, angry with herself for cracking.  

           Tears well behind the eyes as she watches heat vapor radiate 
           off the Oklahoma vista beyond and she’s hit by a memory... 

           QUICK FLASHBACK: Her world is replaced by high contrast and 
           harsh colors. YOUNGER BROOKE (6), with tears in her eyes, 
           steps out of a swaying Midwest corn field.

           A MAN (30s) SHOUTS at her from a nearby farm house. It’s 
           threatening. The girl makes a decision, takes off running 
           back into the endless cornfield. He gives chase. She hides, 
           diving for cover in the unruly stalks. 
           PRESENT BROOKE fights away the image. She lights a cigarette. 
           Leans against hot cement, inhales heavy.

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - DAY 

           Delgado walks a prized Arabian in a dusty corral. He runs his 
           hands along the horse’s muzzle as a reward for the trot. 

           He’s interrupted when Charlie Levitt approaches, an obedient 
           PITBULL doddering between him and another taciturn man...

           JAVIER SOTO (40s): an angular Salvadorean with an off-putting 
           appearance. Thick cataracts dirty his eyes to the point of 
           near blindness, his face and neck blanketed with tattoos. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothin’ on them Dominguez boys, 
                        boss. 

                                 DELGADO
                        And Bulger?

           Charlie lights a cigarette, exhales smiling.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That three fingered fuck’s been 
                        gone since day before Spiller’s 
                        happened...

                                 DELGADO
                        I don’t see any reason to be 
                        smiling, Charlie.

           Charlie reads the threat, loses the grin.

                                 DELGADO
                        What are the police doing?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Got a suspect. Been all over the 
                        news... 

           Delgado pauses, slightly perturbed. Charlie takes a measured 
           drag, notes his bosses hesitation.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Rhett Childress’ been down there 
                        givin’ everybody hell... Gettin’ 
                        reporters all worked up.  

           Delgado nods his disapproval, grabs a carrot, feeds a horse. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Talk to him for me... Tell him to 
                        leave it alone. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        No problem, boss...

                                 DELGADO
                        Until the police have their answer, 
                        keep looking for those boys... Make 
                        sure they had nothing to do with 
                        Spiller. 

           Delgado bends to pat the homely dog’s head, looking the 
           scarred animal in its amber eyes. 

                                 DELGADO
                        And get rid of these dogs, Charlie. 
                        You’re smarter than that.  

           Charlie looks away ashamed as Delgado leaves. Javier drags a 
           smoke and starts to laugh at Charlie’s cowardice.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck you. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DUSK

           As the sun sets, the front lawn comes alive with FLICKERING 
           LIGHTS. A candlelight vigil. Thirty or so people gather to 
           show their respect for the family. REPORTERS capture it all.

           Chuck and Esther Holland pass votive candles to neighbors. 
           PASTOR SEAN MACY (40s, amiable) leads a small prayer group. 
           People looking to one another for comfort and security. 

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DUSK

           Sheriff Walsh watches the mourners outside with weary eyes. 
           Lights a cigarette. NEWS TEAMS load their vehicles out front. 
           He hates this. Hates the attention and the cause.

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - NIGHT

           Marcus stands at his small barred window. Surveys mourners 
           and reporters gathering outside. Moves to sit in the dark.   

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - LATER

           Agent Hayes sips a cup of coffee, cell phone to the ear. It 
           BEEPS audibly, followed by a muffled VOICE MAILBOX MESSAGE.

           He hangs up, turning to find Brooke standing in the room. She 
           reads his pain, plays it off.

                                 HAYES
                        Y’alright?

                                 BROOKE
                        Are you?
           He laughs small, nods.

                                 HAYES
                        Shouldn’t have put you in there 
                        alone. It’s been a while...

           She doesn’t want his sympathy.

                                 BROOKE
                        You didn’t put me anywhere. I blew 
                        that one... Won’t happen again. 

           Looking to the ground, Hayes twists his wedding band 
           unconsciously. She sees it, understands.

                                 BROOKE
                        I want to see the house... 

                                 HAYES
                        Maybe you should get outta here for 
                        the night. Go get some rest...  

                                 BROOKE
                             (firm)
                        Hayes. I’m fine. 

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Hayes’ sedan kicks up gravel, comes to a stop out front. 

           INT. SPILLER HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door CREAKS open. FLASHLIGHTS gambol into the foyer 
           and Hayes lifts caution tape, Brooke ducks under, he follows.  

           Hayes steers his light into the adjacent study. 

                                 HAYES
                        It happened in there...

           Brooke’s not listening, attention drawn upstairs. Hayes 
           shakes his head as she starts to climb.  

           INT. JENNY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Light beam leading her eyes, Brooke takes in Jenny’s room: 
           stuffed animals, stars above -- a place brimming with love. 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Brooke scans the room as it was left: sheets ruffled, pillow 
           case missing, but everything else is perfect, no clutter.  

           Hayes steps into the room, his light joins hers.
                                 BROOKE
                        Military man.

           Hayes understands, the man was organized. Nods. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You said he worked metal. Where’s 
                        the shop?

           INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

           Hayes stands at the door while Brooke moves gracefully 
           through narrow rows, flashlight studying the organization: 
           all the tools labeled, hung in rows, spotless.  

           A FAINT RINGING and she turns as Hayes answers his PHONE.

                                 HAYES
                             (into the phone)
                        Agent Hayes.

           Her light finds his face and they lock eyes, big news. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Hayes storms into the station, Brooke just behind. Officers 
           Fink and Moreno follow their movement with anxious eyes.  

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

           They enter at a clip, Hayes and Brooke turning their 
           attention to the glass, looking in on...

           ADRIAN. Basked in STERILE WHITE LIGHT. He sits alone, chained 
           in place, feels eyes watching through the two-way. 

           Brooke studies him through the glass. Hayes scans his FILE. 

                                 HAYES
                        Name’s Adrian Shaw... Also former 
                        Delta. Multiples place him at the 
                        bar in Laredo with Lattimore... 
                        Border Patrol stopped him at the 
                        bridge in Brownsville. 

           He shakes his head, can’t believe the luck.

                                 BROOKE
                        Reynolds on your ass for this?

                                 HAYES
                        It’s all over the news... Already 
                        wants to transfer them to OKC. 
                                 BROOKE
                             (beat; doesn’t like it)
                        Movin’ them’ll only hurt your 
                        chances... 

                                 HAYES
                        Won’t happen... Marcus says if he’s 
                        transferred, he calls a lawyer. 

           Brooke turns to him, eyes question the statement. He shrugs. 

                                 HAYES
                        Figure it’ll buy us a few days...

           Brooke reads the situation, knows his ass is on the line. She 
           considers a moment before turning to the door.

                                 HAYES
                        Where you going?

                                 BROOKE
                        To redeem myself.

           He smiles slight, watching her body as she turns to exit. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Adrian bites his nails nervously, chewing to the skin. Glazed 
           eyes follow as Brooke enters. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Adrian Shaw. I’m Special Agent 
                        Brooke Benedict with Oklahoma City 
                        FBI. I’m here to ask you a few 
                        questions ‘bout the Spiller case?

           She sits, deliberately crossing her legs. Nerves waning. 

                                 BROOKE
                        I specialize in kidnappings. 
                        Finding children like the girl you 
                        took from the Spiller’s...

                                 ADRIAN
                        I didn’t take anybody... 

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m sorry... The one you’re accused 
                        of taking.

           He checks the CLOCK on the wall. She notes it.

                                 BROOKE
                        You been here a while. I apologize 
                        for keepin’ you waiting.
           He doesn’t like being studied, anger waxing. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        No need. Got nothin’ but time...
                             (sneering)
                        Ain’t that way for everybody 
                        though, is it?   

                                 BROOKE
                             (beat; fuck you)
                        Let’s continue. 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh enters and sees Hayes watching the proceedings through 
           the glass. He moves to join, lights a cigarette.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian’s face is that of a guilty child, a devilish smirk. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Already said I know Marc, but I had 
                        nothin’ to do with that family.

           The serious, chilled nature of his voice is unsettling. He 
           leans back, loosens up a bit. Chews nail. SPITS. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        But, I’ll tell you somethin’ I 
                        heard long time ago, might help... 
                             (chuckles)
                        Heard if there weren’t no such 
                        thing as the devil... Hell’d be run 
                        by the dollar bill. 

           Her mind’s working fast. Studying his eyes. He blinks quick. 
           Runs a cuffed hand over his buzzed head. Cracks a grin. She’s 
           formulating a plan, her next move.   

                                 ADRIAN
                        You find the money, you find the 
                        motive...

           Brooke leans in, goes on the offensive.

                                 BROOKE
                        I don’t need your advice, Adrian. 
                        What I need is to find a little 
                        girl. And right now, I don’t really 
                        care if you did kill that man and 
                        his wife. I just need to know where 
                        she is... 

                                 ADRIAN
                        There wasn’t no wife... 
           A long beat. His eyes flutter, knows he fell into her trap, 
           hates himself for it. Back to grinding those nails.

           She considers. Too easy. Trusts her gut.

                                 BROOKE
                        It was all his idea wasn’t it? He’s 
                        the leader?

           Adrian looks away, had enough. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You sick of being the follower, 
                        Adrian? 
                             (beat)
                        That why you left Marcus behind in 
                        Laredo? Let him take the fall?

           He shakes his head, scratches an arm, all nerves that she’s 
           not buying. She stands suddenly, motion like a shock to him.

                                 ADRIAN
                        That’s all you got?

                                 BROOKE
                        Don’t think I’d be too happy to see 
                        you if I were Marcus. 

           His eyes lift to her face, sees were this is going.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke slips out. Fink locks the door behind and she takes a 
           moment to compose herself, closes her eyes, breathes deep.

                                 BROOKE
                        Let’s take him back to his cell.

                                 FINK
                        Together?

                                 BROOKE
                        Together. 

           She’s getting it back. Fink nods, moves to open the door.

           INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON CHAINS RATTLING cement as Deputy Fink leads Adrian 
           down the darkened corridor. Brooke follows, just behind. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - CONTINUOUS

           CLANGCLANG...CLAGNCLANG... Marcus sits up at the approaching 
           sound, watching the edge of his cell as it nears, when...
           ADRIAN shuffles into view. Shock hits like a gut punch, but 
           he keeps it tight until Brooke catches his eye. 

           She clocks his surprise, not even a hint of anger. She keeps 
           moving and Marcus averts his eyes, didn’t like that.  

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke enters, mind working fast. She pulls a PHOTO from the 
           case file. Walsh is confused, trying to figure her play.

                                 HAYES
                        Where’d you go?

                                 WALSH
                        You had ‘em on the ropes... 

           She’s not listening. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Get Marcus back in there. 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Brooke smokes to settle the nerves, when the door opens and 
           Deputy Fink leads Marcus inside, chains him in place. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You ready for them answers now?

                                 BROOKE
                             (beat)
                        Just want one, Marcus.

           He sits tight. Go ahead. 

                                 BROOKE
                        What went wrong? 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve seen your record. Know you can 
                        kill... But, why’d you lose your 
                        edge... do a chicken shit thing 
                        like kidnap a child? 

           She slides the photo of Jenny and Nathan across to him. 
           Tracks his reaction. He doesn’t even blink, but her eyes are 
           looking deep inside, instinct taking over. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You get set up? Somebody convince 
                        you Spiller had money? 
                             (beat)
                        Didn’t like that... So, you kill a 
                        marine and his son, take Jenny to 
                        prove a point? That the type of man 
                        you are?
           Marcus averts his eyes. Looking to the door, the clock above. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Figured you were better’n that, 
                        Marcus... Thought I was dealing 
                        with a hero.
                             (shakes her head)
                        You’re not a hero... Nothing but a 
                        common thug with anger issues, and 
                        a disgrace to that uniform you used 
                        to wear. 

           Marcus turns back slow and she sees a flash of rage behind 
           those eyes. It’s small, but there it is, real anger. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You really think questionin’ my 
                        morals gonna get you anywhere?
                             (beat; leans in)
                        Told Hayes I didn’t touch that 
                        family. Don’t matter what picture 
                        you wanna put in front of me...  

           She smiles. He’s good, but she still sees something.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Adrian isn’t helping your case... 
                        You’re much better... Shoulda 
                        walked him through this.

                                 MARCUS
                        I don’t speak for Adrian. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Wasn’t supposed to be here, was he?

           He holds tight, both know she’s right.  

                                 BROOKE
                        What happened, Marcus? Who got the 
                        best of you?

           There’s a loaded pause, eyes locked. He knows what she’s 
           doing, looking past the surface, trying to read his thoughts. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Seein’ any answers in there?

           She smiles. Stands to leave, turns back from the door. 

                                 BROOKE
                        I’ve seen enough, Marcus. 

           CLANG. Fink opens the door and she exits, leaving Marcus 
           alone with the photograph. He glances into the two-way mirror 
           and can’t help but smile at her resolve. 
           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke enters, replaying the conversation in her mind. Both 
           men watch, curious to see where this goes. 

                                 BROOKE
                        We’re wasting time...
                             (beat)
                        You have the wrong men. 

           Her words hit like a dead blow hammer.

                                 HAYES
                        What’re you talking about, Brooke?

                                 BROOKE
                        Why’d you bring me here, Hayes?

           He understands, says nothing. She points to the interrogation 
           room, where Fink unlocks Marcus. 

                                 BROOKE
                        These two have seen interrogations 
                        like this before. They were ready 
                        for it... 

                                 HAYES
                        Adrian was a mess in there.

                                 BROOKE
                        C’mon Hayes. The nail biting... 
                        Nervous ticks. That don’t seem 
                        rehearsed to you?

           Hayes fears where this is going. Face blank, distant.

                                 BROOKE
                        Only thing real was Marcus’ 
                        surprise when he saw Adrian and 
                        that anger... He’s proud... And 
                        he’s good.  

                                 WALSH
                        You sayin’ they planned this?

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m sayin’ there’s more to this...
                        Both of them say they had nothing 
                        to do with the Spillers but don’t 
                        want a lawyer?   

           She lets that sink in.  

                                 HAYES
                        Why would they do that...
                                 BROOKE
                        I don’t know... Attention? Maybe 
                        they’re buying time... We got fire, 
                        we won’t be looking for smoke.

           Hayes is fuming. She knows it.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Why’re they in custody? Lost a bar 
                        fight?

           A beat as they both consider. 

                                 BROOKE
                        How many people on the planet you

                        a bar fight?

           They both know the answer’s not many. 

                                 HAYES
                        Jesus Christ, Brooke. Another Delta 
                        crossing the border? The boots?... 
                        Murder weapon? 
                             (beat)
                        Evidence ain’t coincidental.

                        It’s circumstantial’s what it is... 
                        What’s the motive? Why the 
                        Spillers? You even question that?

           There’s an almost imperceptible anger rising in Hayes. Brooke 
           knows it well. Even Walsh can read the history between them. 

                                 HAYES
                        Motive was money. They were after 
                        the strong box...

                                 BROOKE
                        For what? Five thousand dollars? 
                        Spiller was a farmer with a 
                        fireproof safe in the wall.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, Hayes. But these two are 
                        smarter than that...

           Walsh considers. His opinion starting to sway.

                                 HAYES
                        Jenny’s been gone over a week... 
                        Could be a week since she had food 
                        or water...

                        What if I’m right?
           He holds her stare for a weighted second. She keeps pushing.

                                 BROOKE
                        Call it intuition if you want, but 
                        I’m telling you... keep looking. 

                                 HAYES
                        These boys know where she is. 
                             (beat)
                        If you wanna sit here’n play games, 
                        I sincerely hope you can handle her 
                        death on your conscience...

           Hayes exits, infuriated. This is his skill in question. It’s 
           a moment before Brooke speaks.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Sheriff. We could be wasting time. 

           She studies his reaction. His mind saying one thing, heart 
           another. He gives a subtle nod. He’ll trust her. 

                                 BROOKE
                        What else do we know? Need to find

                        that could help.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

           FLUORESCENT LIGHTS kick on. Walsh leads Brooke into a small 
           room chock-full of filing cabinets. He finds a select folder.

                                 WALSH
                        Hayes’s already been through this, 
                        but that’s all we have on Nathan...  
                        Ain’t much to have.

           She opens the file, scans it. Immediately taken by a thought.  

                                 BROOKE
                        What happened to his wife?

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - NIGHT  

           Walsh lights a cigarette, sits heavy. 

           Brooke stands across the desk, scanning a mess of NEWS PAPER 
           CLIPPINGS. They announce: AN ACCIDENT, GUN FIRE, HOMICIDE...

           INT. FORD TRUCK - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A reconstruction. Colors idyllic, almost bizarre. Nathan and 
           his wife BRIANNE idle at a red light. The light turns green 
           and Nathan accelerates, when...
           SMASH! Their world SPINS out of control as another vehicle 
           runs a red and SLAMS into the passenger door. The windshield 
           EXPLODES, peppering the interior with glass shards... 

           EXT. KINGFISHER STREET - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

           Nathan’s truck ROTATES WILDLY. The Chevy that T-Boned it 
           RICOCHETS to the side, a mass of devastated metal.

           A Bronco SKIDS to a halt nearby. TWO DRUG RUNNERS hop out of 
           the rear, armed with SUB-MACHINE GUNS.

           BUDDABUDDABUDDA! The men open fire on the totaled Chevy. 
           Shots PLINK off the truck’s metallic frame.

           EXT. KINGFISHER STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Sheriff Walsh hauls ass to the scene. He finds Nathan, 
           collapsed to the earth, Brianne in his lap. Shock hits. 

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Walsh looks sick, replaying the scene in his mind. Impossible 
           to tell if the events were his recollection or Brooke’s 
           assemblage of the details. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Drugs been a problem in Kingfisher?

                                 WALSH
                        We have issues, same as anywhere 
                        else in the country.

                        Never been anything like this... 
                        Before or since. 

           She nods, scanning the file.  

                                 BROOKE
                        Says here Nathan was arrested a 
                        month later?

                                 WALSH
                        Just talked ‘im down.
                             (beat)
                        Had too much t’drink, threatened 
                        Hector Delgado. 

           Brooke remembers the man she saw exit the station earlier.

                                 BROOKE
                        Did he have reason to? Delgado have 
                        something to do with the death?

                                 WALSH
                        Nathan sure thought he did.  
           There’s a heavy pause as Walsh remembers a friend. Brooke 
           studies his response, mind running over the facts. 

                                 WALSH
                        We checked Delgado for this, if 
                        that’s what you’re gonna ask... Man 
                        keeps his hands clean.

           He glances out the front window, swallows pain like a razor 
           blade. Outside, the Holland’s call it a night, packing up.

           She reads the frustration, his body ripe with it. She doesn’t 
           know what else to say, just nods and moves to the door.

           INT. SHOTS TAVERN - NIGHT

           Rhett Childress downs a shot, smiles at the bartender, SUSAN 
           BRADLEY (20s, a natural beauty). She reciprocates coyly and 
           pours him another shot, one for herself.  

                                 SUSAN
                        This one’s on me.

           He’s intrigued, finds her eyes, likes his chances. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Saw you at the station today.

                                 RHETT
                        That right?

                                 SUSAN
                        Lotta people lookin’ up t’you. 

                                 RHETT
                        Town ain’t happy, that’s for sure.

                                 SUSAN
                        You’re doin’ the right thing.

           She smiles and together they throw back the shot. Rhett sits 
           ever so slightly taller in his seat, confidence growing.  

           EXT. SHOTS TAVERN - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Rhett’s F-150 ROCKS HARD from the force within. Susan’s head 
           KNOCKS against the side window. MOANS muffled through glass.

           EXT. SHOTS TAVERN - PARKING LOT - LATER 

           Rhett wavers, pissing under a car as Susan heads inside. It’s 
           a moment before he finishes. ZIPS. Turns to see... 

           Charlie and Javier blocking his exit between cars. He pauses, 
           face goes white. Sanguine to skittish in a tick.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        You come a long way since high 
                        school, Rhett... Still fuckin’ jail 
                        bait in the back of that truck. 

                                 RHETT
                        Fuck you. She’s twenny.

           Charlie spits sludge, tongue shifts dip.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yea? She look it.

                                 RHETT
                             (beat)
                        What d’you want, Charlie? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here t’ask you to stay away from 
                        the police station... Mind yer own 
                        bidness... Kingfisher don’t need 
                        that kind of attention. 

                                 RHETT
                             (cautious)
                        Police ain’t doing shit.

                                 CHARLIE
                        They got them boys. What more you 
                        want?

           SPLAT. Charlie spits and Javier flips open a BUTTERFLY KNIFE. 
           Rhett eyes the knife, holds his tongue. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How ‘bout you stick t’what yer good 
                        at... Fuckin’ Susan Bradley out 
                        here in the parkin’ lot. 
                             (smiles)
                        Won’t have no trouble then. 

           A heavy pause, Rhett has no move. He nods tight, understands. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thatta boy, Rhett.  
                             (beat)
                        Be seein’ ya around. 

           Javier shuts the knife with a practiced hand and they head 
           off into the darkened lot. Rhett left fuming.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Hayes sits at a temp desk plodding through the case file. He 
           pops a piece of Nicorette in his mouth and the PHONE RINGS. 
                                 HAYES
                             (into the phone)
                        Special Agent Hayes.

           INT. OKLAHOMA CITY FBI - CONTINUOUS

           SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE (SAIC) JIM REYNOLDS (50s) (a serious 
           man, every day handsome) sits hunched at his desk, watching a 
           flat screen. This man wears a heavy burden.  

           ON TV: Images from Kingfisher; The candlelight vigil, Jenny, 
           all smiles at the beach, mug shots of Marcus and Adrian. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Hayes. It’s Jim. Give me some good 
                        news about those boys.

           INTERCUTTING --

                                 HAYES
                             (beat)
                        I’m workin’ on it. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        This is getting more coverage than 
                        I expected. People don’t like the 
                        unexplained. You understand?

           A long moment. He does.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        What about the little girl?

                                 HAYES
                        I’ll get her, Jim... You know my 
                        record.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Record’s a thing of the past, 
                        Hayes. 

                                 HAYES
                        ...Yes sir.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        This fuckin’ thing’s gonna drag us

                             (beat)
                        Time to shit or get off the pot.

           He hangs up, considering the TV with desperate eyes.

           Hayes slowly returns the phone to the cradle, ill at ease.  
           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Walsh looks distraught, makes his own decision. Grabs a 
           flashlight, moves to the door pulling his hat on.  

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Sky blanketed with stars. Humidity of the day still sitting 
           low. Sheriff Walsh moves deliberately down the front steps. 

           Chuck Holland sees him pass, jogs to catch up.

                                 CHUCK
                        Sheriff. Where ya headed?

                                 WALSH
                        I’m gonna find her, Chuck.

                                 CHUCK
                        We’ve searched those woods five 
                        times. Thank God she ain’t there.
                             (pleading)
                        Go on home to Grace.

           Walsh stops, looks him dead in the eye.

                                 WALSH
                        You wanna help or not?

           Chuck sighs, looks back to his wife apologetically. 

           EXT. ROSE ROCK MOTEL - NIGHT

           A Kingfisher black & white pulls into the lot, hurling light 
           onto the face of the seedy lodging. Brooke steps out of the 
           passenger door, leans back in to talk to Deputy Moreno.

                                 BROOKE
                        Gimme a minute, huh?

           He smiles sympathetic, understands -- place isn’t nice.

           INT. ROSE ROCK MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The door swings open. Brooke stands in silhouette against the 
           headlights from out front. She shakes her head.

           INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CLICK. Brooke’s hand finds the light switch. Room goes white. 
           She squints. Stained-yellow tile. Moldy shower curtain.

           A beat. She takes a step in and looks to the mirror: a woman 
           dressed professional, doubting her instincts. Who is that?
           EXT. ROSE ROCK MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke exits with her bag, pausing to look across the street. 

           BROOKE’S P.O.V.: Lights pierce the night sky, heavy machines 
           at work before an industrial plant: DELGADO AGRICULTURE.

           An idea forms and she hops back into deputy Moreno’s cruiser. 

                                 MORENO
                        Not up to your standards?

                                 BROOKE
                        Ain’t tired. 

           He smiles, throws it in gear, heads out. 

           EXT. DELGADO AGRICULTURE PACKAGING PLANT - NIGHT

           A collection of warehouse-type buildings. All labeled as 
           DELGADO’S PACKAGING PLANT. 

           Hector Delgado walks a lit path behind the facility, he 
           lights a cigar as a FLATBED TRUCK RUMBLES by, parking beside 
           others under the pale glow of industrial sodium lamps.

           Charlie approaches and together they watch the men at work. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Everything’s good down south, 
                        boss... Gonna be a day early.  

           There’s a beat and we sense the news is a surprise.

                                 DELGADO
                        You talk to Childress?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yea. He ain’t gonna be a problem.
                             (beat)
                        But, the FBI got a new girl in town 
                        t’talk to them boys at the 
                        station... Thought you should know.  

           Delgado turns through a pall of cigar smoke, considers. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Any news on the other three?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not yet. 
                                 DELGADO
                        Get me something, Charlie. I don’t 
                        care who it is, just bring me 
                        somebody that knows where they 
                        are... Bulger most of all. I don’t 
                        trust that son of a bitch. 

           Charlie nods tight, and together they watch RANCH HANDS, 
           cowboy hats and flannel shirts, hop onto the trucks and begin 
           unloading MASSIVE HAY BALES strapped to the back.  

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Hayes is alone in the dark. He’s a mess, collar loosened. 
           Eyes glazed from a lack of sleep as he runs over... 

           INTERROGATION TAPES on the computer. Rewinding and watching 
           again. Checks notes, looking for anything he may have missed.

           Brooke enters quiet, sits beside. Knows his torment.

                                 BROOKE
                        I know you won’t listen, but

                                 HAYES
                        Sleep ain’t an option right now.

                        What’d you tell him? You’ve got 
                        nothing? 

                                 HAYES
                        We got blood. 
                             (beat; off her look)
                        Leadin’ outta the house. Don’t 
                        belong to the father or son.

           She nods, considering.

                        ...That plant off the 33 belong to

                        if that’s what you’re thinkin’.

                                 BROOKE
                        That’s sweet. You worried about me?

           He shakes his head at the sarcasm and she stands, gently 
           rubbing her hand along his thigh. He remembers that touch. 
                                 HAYES
                        You’re not FBI anymore. Don’t want 
                        you runnin’ around like you were. 

           She opens the door, heads out.

                                 BROOKE
                        Somebody’s gotta find Jenny 
                        Spiller.

           Hayes watches her body carefully as it moves out the door. He 
           turns back to the tapes for a moment and a thought hits him. 

           He checks his pocket. Son of a bitch...  

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Brooke moves down the steps pulling Hayes’ keys. BEEP BEEP, 
           she finds the sedan and heads out. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A team of flashlights cuts through darkness. Sheriff Walsh 
           pushes forward maniacally, scanning the ground below. Chuck 
           Holland struggles to keep up.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Chuck steps out of the woods with his head hung, exhausted, 
           calling it a night. Walsh follows, he’d keep going, but 
           they’ve literally searched every square inch.

           Esther Holland waits by their truck, holding Styrofoam cups 
           brimming with hot coffee. The men nod thankfully.

                                 ESTHER
                        You tried, boys. All we can ask.

           Walsh stares back into the thick woods, wondering if they 
           missed something. Not really listening.

                                 ESTHER
                        She’s worried sick ‘bout you, 
                        Everett. 

           He knows, nods slow.  

                                 WALSH
                        I know it. 

           INT. WALSH RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           GRACE WALSH, a strong woman, nearly forty years the Sheriff’s 
           wife, pulls saran wrap over a plate of food on the table.
           INT. KITCHEN - WALSH RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Light slices darkness as Grace puts her husband’s meal in the 
           fridge. There are three others just like it inside. 

           She sips red wine and washes dishes. Glances out the window.

           GRACE’S P.O.V.: James Fenton sits on his porch across the 
           street, smoking a cigarette. He can’t sleep either.

           EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT

           Hayes’ FBI sedan parked on the shoulder in darkness. Lights 
           off. Inside, Brooke watches TWO MEN smoking near the front 
           entrance to Delgado’s property. She exits quietly. 

           Brooke bends to remove her shoes, high heels not helping on 
           the uneven surface. She keeps them in hand. 

           Spots a spread of stables and barn-type buildings bathed in 
           cobalt moonlight. She glances down the road one last time, 
           sees the men and makes a decision. Hops the fence. 

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke’s FOOTFALLS the only sound save a few quick DOG BARKS. 

           She pushes forward through waist high overgrowth. Sees light 
           radiating from an open door, advances on it. Inside a group 
           of RANCH HANDS enjoy the night off. The men are ARMED, 
           sitting around a DOG FIGHTING PIT. PIT BULLS chained beside. 

           They shoot the shit in Spanish, spit tobacco, eyes on the 
           aftermath of a vicious brawl. ONE MAN pulls a beaten dog from 
           the ring. Warm blood runs from its neck and ears. Then...

           CRACK. Brooke’s foot breaks a twig. She holds her breath as 
           the dogs turn, pure muscle itching for release. 

           The men glance outside, moving in her direction. A moment 
           feels like eternity as one of them stands inches from her, 
           looking out towards the road...

           Where A CAR PARKS by hers, high beams punching through the 
           night. The man spits, landing brown sludge beside Brooke, and 
           the new car HONKS TWICE. They all look to the road. 

           EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie steps out of his blue jeep and walks the edge of the 
           road, moving towards the empty FBI sedan. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Got ourselves a visitor, Javier... 
                        Smells like a pig. 
           Javier joins, gazing out over the property. Through the 
           years, they’ve developed a silent vernacular. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yea. That’d be my guess. Snoopin’ 
                        where they shouldn’t be. 

           He unsheathes a BLADE, glistening austere under moonlight... 

           THWACK-PISTT! and drives it to the hilt in car’s rear tire. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s go see.

           Javier hops the fence, up and over graceful as smoke.  

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           FLASHLIGHTS KICK ON and the men jog out of the corrugated 
           steel building and scramble to comb the premise. 

           Brooke stays low, moves towards the road. Dogs SPRINT PAST.

           Light FLICKERS through pitching wheat as Brooke runs. 
           FLASHES. HOLLERING. DOGS BARKING. Brooke has to stop, her 
           world starts to spin. Breaths hard. Choppy. Swallowing air...

           QUICK FLASHBACK: The purple glow of twilight. YOUNGER BROOKE 
           (8) lies flat on her belly in a corn field. The beauty of the 
           swaying crop contrasted sharply by the little girl’s fear.   

           From her POV we see BOOTS stop at a few feet. A liquor bottle 
           fall by their side. Younger Brooke gulps back a cry, a tear 
           rolls down her cheek, drips to dry earth... The boots leave. 

           PRESENT BROOKE on a knee. Hyperventilating as men scour the 
           grounds nearby. She closes her eyes, forces her breathing to 
           calm. Starts moving towards the road and...

           A Pit suddenly appears feet from her, lumbering in pursuit... 
           She freezes, holding her breath... but the dog’s young, a 
           puppy. It meets her gaze and they both pause... it leaves.

           Brooke continues towards the fence. She hears CRUNCHING, 
           grows louder... Turns to see an ADULT DOG not ten feet away. 
           Thick drool pendent under chin. White teeth gleaming. 

           A beat. And the dog BREAKS, dead sprint for Brooke. She hauls 
           to the fence, hops it in terror. Dog BARKS like a banshee. 

           She pulls herself together and moves to the road. Notes the 
           BLUE JEEP parked silently behind her cruiser. She has A FLAT 
           TIRE. Searching lights turn in her direction. She ducks below 
           the fencing and starts a jog down the road...    
           A Ford Bronco HURTLES by, spotlight scanning the shoulder... 
           Brooke ducks into the gully, tries to remain calm. 

           The truck slows right where she left the road. Bright light 
           slowly arcing over the wheat’s edge. Brooke stares back 
           through the shadows of the pitching crop with baited breath.  

           A long still beat... And finally, the Bronco creeps away. 
           Brooke exhales. 

           EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DELGADO’S RANCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Javier walks the road, eyes scanning for tracks when he 
           notices something in overgrowth: A STILETTO-HEELED SHOE. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Swallows play across amber morning sun. Resting by the dozens 
           on telephone wires. The day’s young, the earth still. 

           Brooke sits on the front steps. She’s dog tired, walked all 
           night. Her clothes dirty, shoes missing. She shakes out her 
           last cigarette as Hayes pulls up in his borrowed cruiser.  

           He approaches slowly, noticing her disheveled appearance.

                                 HAYES
                        The hell happened to you?

           She’s not listening, lost in the sound of morning CICADAS 
           BUZZING. Calling out to each other in evanescent song. They 
           share a moment. Her mind running over the night’s events.    

                                 BROOKE
                        Spiller thought Delgado was 
                        involved with his wife’s death.
                             (beat; off his look)
                        Walsh told me ‘bout the arrest.

           Hayes looks to her bare feet, cut and bloodied. He glances 
           around and sees no sign of his car.

                                 HAYES
                        Where’s my car, Brooke?

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - DAY  

           GOLDEN SUNLIGHT, a hot day. INSECTS BUZZ,CHIRP. Hector 
           Delgado stands in tall grass with his sleeves rolled...

           Staring at a FRIESIAN MARE in childbirth. Jet-black coat 
           slicked and shiny with lifeblood. She doesn’t make a sound.

           RANCH HANDS assist, the horse JERKS with contractions and a 
           new life emerges, dusty earth coating its wriggling form.  
           Delgado turns to the road, one hundred yards off, spotting a 
           POLICE CRUISER sidle up beside another car, Brooke and Hayes 
           exit. He wipes sweat from his brow, none too pleased. 

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - LATER

           Concern washes over Hayes’ face as he surveys the deliberate 
           gash in the sedan’s tire.

                                 HAYES
                        What’d I tell you about comin’ out 
                        here? Let me play detective. I’m 
                        better at it.

                                 BROOKE
                        Adrian said find the money, you’ll 
                        find the motive... 

           Hayes shakes his head.

                                 BROOKE
                        Don’t shake your head at me. Told 
                        you what I think. Didn’t say you 
                        had to believe it. 

                                 HAYES
                        ...Maybe I was wrong bringing you 
                        in on this.

           She pauses, studying the doubt in his eyes.

                                 BROOKE
                        Maybe.
                             (beat)
                        Or maybe you brought me in ‘cause 
                        you’re not even convinced anymore.

           He focuses, locks eyes with her.

                                 HAYES
                        Don’t try’n read me, Brooke. It 
                        ain’t gonna get you anywhere...

                                 BROOKE
                        Hasn’t failed me yet.

           Frustration becomes anger. He knows where this is headed.

                                 BROOKE
                        How’d she work out, Hayes? The one 
                        you told me you weren’t seein’? 

           She almost regrets the words before they leave her mouth.

           Hayes gives up, moves to the trunk. He pulls a spare and 
           jack, tosses them on the ground, landing heavy.
                                 HAYES
                        There’s a reason I tell you to stay 
                        outta something... It’s for your 
                        own good. 

           He SLAMS the trunk, moves to the driver’s side.

                                 HAYES
                        Rich men tend to have secrets, 
                        Brooke... Delgado’s not the type 
                        you want to be messin’ with. 

                                 BROOKE
                        I think he’s exactly the type you 
                        should be messin’ with! 

                                 HAYES
                        You think I don’t know that?!

           A long beat as they both calm down. 

                                 HAYES
                        Reynolds’s had an eye on Delgado 
                        fer three years. He hasn’t slipped 
                        up yet... And Christ, Brooke. I’ve 
                        already been out here for the 
                        Spiller case. 
                             (beat; off her look)
                        Found nothin’ but a few ranch hands 
                        breakin’ laws. You want me to lock 
                        them up for fighting dogs? 

                                 BROOKE
                             (beat)
                        I don’t want you to give up yet.

                                 HAYES
                        It ain’t giving up, if I’m right.

           She holds his stare until he gives in and moves to the car. 
           Looking out to the road ahead, the case eating him alive.

                                 HAYES
                        We’re down to three days... Then 
                        odds are zero...

                                 BROOKE
                        I know the odds.

                                 HAYES
                        Then act like it. 

           They share a look, and for a moment, both remember why they 
           didn’t work out. He yanks the car in gear and heads off. 

           She finally lets her guard down. She’s worried. It shows.   
           A praying VOICE RISES OFF SCREEN.

                                 PASTOR MACY (O.S.)
                        ...With all who have faithfully 
                        served You in the past... 

           INT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           Pastor Macy leads his flock. Standing room only. Mourners 
           joined in hardship. They look to him with earned respect. 

           LARGE PHOTOS stand before the congregation: images depicting 
           the smiling faces of Nathan in military uniform, a senior 
           picture of Colt. Lives forever frozen in happier times. 

                                 PASTOR MACY
                        ...they may share in the eternal 
                        victory of Jesus Christ our Lord; 
                        Who lives and reigns with You...

           Sheriff Walsh stands in back, hat in hand, head bowed. Feels 
           scornful eyes pass judgement with every glance. Except...

           Peggy Childress. Sitting in front with her five-year-old, 
           Cutter. A broken woman, eyes wet and burning red.   

                                 PASTOR MACY
                        ...in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
                        one God, for ever and ever... Amen.

           The prayer concludes and Walsh notices Peggy staring back 
           with pained eyes, searching for sympathy. A look we sense 
           means more than any words. He ducks out before the crowd.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Weather’s turning. Brooke pulls onto Main and enters a ghost 
           town. Trash eddies in the wind. The Shots Tavern sign bangs 
           and a sun-tired STRAY DOG laps water from storm drain runoff.  

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY  

           WORKERS lower two unembellished wooden caskets into red-brown 
           earth. MOURNERS drop flowers on the graves. NEWS CREWS roll 
           from the entrance, forced back. 

           Sheriff Walsh keeps a self-imposed distance, standing alone, 
           overlooking the proceedings. Agent Hayes approaches. 

                                 HAYES
                        I’m sorry, Sheriff. Really am.

           Walsh nods thankful. Eyes trained on the reporters. 
                                 WALSH
                        Funny thing how people flock to 
                        sufferin’... As if it makes their 
                        own lives easier. 

           Angry storm clouds threaten the western sky. Walsh watches 
           them with a studied eye, lights a cigarette.

                                 WALSH
                        World’s got enough sufferin’ you 
                        ask me... No need t’go out lookin’ 
                        for it.

           CICADAS BUZZ like hell, ushering in the first LIGHTING STRIKE 
           miles off on the horizon. Hayes sighs, unable to console.

           INT. HOLLAND’S EATERY - DAY

           Brooke sips a black coffee. She studies the nervous fear 
           suffocating other diners. James Fenton dines alone, 
           lifelessly stirring his own drink. 

           Esther Holland comes over dressed in black, offers a refill, 
           surprised by Brooke’s mussed clothing, wind-blown hair. 

                                 ESTHER
                             (dull)
                        Top ya off?

                                 BROOKE
                        No, thank you.

           Brooke lights a cigarette and glances out the window. 

           BROOKE’S P.O.V.: A gunmetal gloom descends over the visible 
           world. Hot wind whips up debris, signalling the coming storm. 
           She spots the familiar BLUE JEEP parked outside.

           DING! Bell above the door sounds as Charlie and Javier enter. 
           Chuck Holland greets them with slight reservation.  

                                 CHUCK
                        Anywhere you like, gentlemen.

           They glide to a booth just past Brooke. Charlie takes care to 
           peek under her table, noticing she’s in flip-flops. Smiles.  

           Brooke gets the message, doesn’t want to show it. She calmly 
           snuffs out her cigarette, leaves a $20 and moves to the door. 
           Both men turn to watch her leave and she’s well aware of it. 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke adjusts her rear view and spots Charlie and Javier 
           moving to their jeep a minute or so after her. 
           INT. POLICE CRUISER - LATER

           Storm clouds blacken the Oklahoma sky, towering into the 
           heavens. Brooke returns to the station, pulling in to see...  

           Gale force winds whip through the CROWD that has returned in 
           full. The funeral’s stirred up painful emotions. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke steps from her vehicle and two raindrops strike the 
           roof of car. PLINK. PLINK. Draw her gaze to the sky. 

           People are angry, SHOUTING obscenities. REPORTERS document 
           the events. Familiar faces using anger to cope with sorrow.

           Rhett Childress steps forward, drunk and looking for a fight. 
           He moves to Brooke, sizes her up. Reads her as FBI. 

                                 RHETT
                        Sick of you Feds playin’ games, 
                        lady! We all ready for results! 

           Brooke stands her ground, fronting boldness. 

                                 ANGRY MAN (O.S.)
                        Tell her, Rhett!

                                 RHETT
                        You ain’t doin’ nothin’ but 
                        boardin’ killers... and we still 
                        don’t see Jenny!

           He circles, crowd CHEERING him on, when...

           BOOM! A shotgun blast silences all. 

           Sheriff Walsh exits the station with Deputies Fink and Moreno 
           at his side. 12-gauge held at port arms, stock against the 
           hip, barrel smoking from the recent fire. 

                                 WALSH
                        Rhett, you even look at her wrong, 
                        I’ll end you. 

           Rhett smiles as Walsh eyes REPORTERS rushing to the action. 

           Peggy Childress steps forward to calm her husband, gently 
           tugging his arm. Walsh knows it’s a dangerous move. 

                                 PEGGY
                        Come on, Rhett. Let’s go home.

           Walsh and Peggy hold eyes for a moment. She gives the 
           slightest of nods, signalling it’s OK. An unnamed tension 
           between them. Brooke notices the silent exchange.  
                                 RHETT
                        You know somethin’, Sheriff?

           Walsh just stares, not in the mood for his shit.

                                 RHETT
                        Law only exists to serve the 
                        people... Well, here they are.

           Brooke and the officers glance around. Angry faces scowling 
           back. NEWS CAMERAS rolling. A gentle rain falls.

                                 RHETT
                        Don’t think they’re too happy with 
                        how you been handlin’ this...

           A few LOW MURMURS from the crowd. 

                                 RHETT
                        Spillers were part of this town... 
                        We take care of our own.  

           The crowd GROWS LOUDER, they want blood. Walsh sees it. 

                                 PEGGY
                             (meekly)
                        Dammit, Rhett. Let it go...

                                 RHETT
                        Eye for an eye, Sheriff. Those boys 
                        need to pay.  

           Walsh glares, Rhett keeps grinning. The crowd at his back, 
           loves the attention, confidence blooming.  

                                 WALSH
                             (calm)
                        Come on, Doctor Benedict.

           Rhett glowers as Brooke heads up the stares and...

           CRRAAAAAACK! The sky opens. It begins to rain heavily. 

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Walsh shows Brooke inside, OVERNIGHT BAG draped over her 
           shoulder. He shuts the door, moves to his desk, listening to 
           rain as it lashes the windows and roof. 

                                 WALSH
                        You seem pretty sure about them 
                        boys.
                             (beat)
                        You’re never wrong?
                                 BROOKE
                        I understand the stakes, if that’s 
                        what you mean. 

           He nods, doubting that she does. 

                                 WALSH
                        Rhett Childress is just about dumb 
                        enough to try somethin’... And tell 
                        the truth, I couldn’t blame him if 
                        he did...

           Brooke glances out the window. Reporters chased off by the 
           weather, but Rhett’s group remains, draped in rain parkas, 
           dripping water. She feels the urgency. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Then we better act first...

           He nods in agreement, cigarette clenched in his teeth.

                                 BROOKE
                        Is there somewhere I could change?

           INT. CELL BLOCK - LATER

           Deputy Moreno nods hello to Brooke and then does a double-
           take before unlocking the gate for her to enter.

                                 DEPUTY MORENO
                        Doctor Benedict.

                                 BROOKE
                        Hello, Deputy.

           She’s changed into blue jeans and a white tee. She looks 
           good, continuing slowly past vacant cells lining either wall. 
           The sound of FORCED EXHALES grows louder. Finally reaching... 

           MARCUS’ CELL. She peeks in to find Marcus suspended from the 
           top bunk, plowing through chin-ups with mechanical precision. 

           With his shirt off, we see his musculature for the first 
           time. Like an anatomical diagram, all fast-twitch. 

           She watches until he finally rests, lowering from the bunk. 
           He looks to his calloused hands and turns slowly to face her. 

           She sees his pause when he notices her appearance.

                                 MARCUS
                             (smiles)
                        Didn’t think I’d be seeing you 
                        again, Special Agent Benedict... 
                                 BROOKE
                        We’re not finished yet, Marcus.

           She sets up a folding chair in the hall with a new resolve. 
           Their eyes stay locked for a moment, a charged undertone. She 
           can handle the fuckin’ answers. He notices, nods gentle.

                                 BROOKE
                        Let’s start over... I’m not FBI... 
                        Not anymore. I’m a psychologist, 
                        trained to detect lies.  
                             (beat)
                        Hayes brought me here to read you. 
                        Find out if you’re lying and what 
                        you know about Jenny Spiller. 

                                 MARCUS
                        How’s that going?

                                 BROOKE
                        I know you didn’t hurt that family.
                             (beat)
                        I’m just curious why you want us to 
                        think you did. 

           He nods ever so slightly. She watches his eyes travel the 
           length of her body. Tight jeans, loose shirt, nubile curves.

                                 MARCUS
                        You see a lot... Where you develop 
                        a skill like that? 

           His insinuation is clear.  

                                 MARCUS
                        Used to eyes feelin’ you up and 
                        down... Had to learn when they 
                        meant trouble? 

           A long beat. She glares. He studies. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Did daddy touch you, Brooke? Touch 
                        you when you didn’t want him to?

                                 BROOKE
                        Fuck. You. 

                                 MARCUS
                        That why you read people so well? 

           She tries her best to stay strong, fights away a memory, but 
           he’s got the upper hand again. Beating her at her own game. 
                                 BROOKE
                        They’re gonna kill you. I hope you 
                        know that... But, I’m gonna figure 
                        out what you’re up to. And I 
                        promise, I’m gonna find that girl.  

           She stands, deliberately folding the chair. He reads her 
           strength, her concern, and a visible emotion crops up in him 
           for the first time. She sees it clear as day.

                                 MARCUS
                        ...Why you doin’ this, Brooke? 
                        Dangerous game you’re playing. 

           She takes a beat, reads his eyes. Tracks a subtle tenderness. 
           Still feels he’s wasting her time, turns down the hall.

                                 MARCUS
                        Wait.

           He moves quickly to the bars, reaching out to grab her arm. 
           It’s gentle more than aggressive. His fingers linger for a 
           moment and then he quickly releases. There’s a loaded pause. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Answer the question. Hayes’s 
                        worried ‘bout savin’ face. That’s 
                        clear as day... But, what’s in it 
                        for you?

                                 BROOKE
                             (beat)
                        I lost one before... Won’t do it 
                        again...

           He understands and it triggers something in him. Respect.

                                 MARCUS
                        ...When I tell you I didn’t take 
                        that girl... I mean it. 
                             (beat)
                        Rest is up to you. 

           She gazes at him imploringly, knows he’s telling the truth. 
           He holds her stare for a moment, then moves back to his bunk 
           and takes a seat on the edge.  

           Brooke starts down the hall. Her mind racing and a memory 
           crashes in. Cell bars flickering alongside blend into...

           QUICK FLASHBACK: Balusters spanning the rail of a farm house 
           porch. YOUNGER BROOKE (7) moves beside, running parallel. 

           She climbs the stairs, peeks in the front door. Her FATHER 
           sits at the dining room table with a bottle of liquor. He’s 
           in a daze, head hung, body slumped heavy with alcohol. 
           She tip toes by. He fumbles for the bottle, hand sliding on 
           the table. She sees it just as his eyes shoot to her. She 
           reads his desire. His terrible thoughts. Freezes in terror.  

           PRESENT BROOKE waits anxiously for Moreno to unlock the cell 
           block gate. Short of breath, she wants out.

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus sits on his bed, barely visible in the dim cell. 
           Brooke’s getting to him, it shows. He’s conflicted.

           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian pushes his face up against a small barred window. 
           Smells the rain, and steals a glance of the green-gray sky.

           He moves to his bunk and considers the hard spined book 
           resting on his mattress when an idea forms. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - UNKNOWN  

           No windows, no furniture, walls made of earth. Wooden pillars 
           give the room form; single overhead bulb provides light. A 
           generator runs nonstop, THRUMMING in the back corner. 

           Stairs lead to the ceiling where a drop-down door swings open 
           and a man steps in wearing a WHITE HOCKEY MASK: THE GOALIE. 
           He carries a tray of food and two water bottles.

           ANGLE WIDENS to reveal A MAN IN A CAGE against the far wall. 
           A stained mattress provides the only comfort for the 
           mysterious man in the homemade iron trap. 

           The Man eyes his captor with palpable contempt. The Goalie 
           sets the tray at the base of the cage.

                                 MAN IN THE CAGE
                        You’re a dead man.

           The Goalie moves to pick up the tray again when The Man in 
           the Cage LUNGES towards the bars. He grabs the food and we 
           get a good glimpse of his right hand:

           IT HAS ONLY THREE FINGERS, pinky and ring long gone.   

           The Goalie watches with an odd detachment, a mix of pleasure 
           and discontent. The Man eats ferociously, hunger beats anger.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           Rain falls in thick sheets. A handful of REPORTERS linger by 
           their vans, waiting for the storm to pass. Rhett’s group 
           stands to the side, under a large oak, a constant threat. 
           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - DAY

           Adrian checks the hallway for guards before beginning to tap 
           the spine of his book against the cell bars. TIC-TIC-TIC... 

           Echoing an elementary message through the empty corridor. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus sits up with a growing realization. He listens 
           carefully to the faint TAPPING and smiles soft. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - DAY

           Hayes sits, doggedly staring at his computer screen when his 
           PHONE RINGS. He picks it up. 

                                 HAYES
                        Agent Hayes.

           INT. OKLAHOMA CITY FBI - CONTINUOUS

           SAIC Jim Reynolds sits at a communications console, 
           surrounded by high-tech equipment. TV and computer monitors 
           display NEWS FEEDS. Some show events in Kingfisher.

           ON TV: Angry citizens gathered outside the police station. We 
           see familiars. Recognize Rhett and his gang from earlier. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                             (into speaker phone)
                        Hayes, tell me what the fuck I’m 
                        looking at?

           INTERCUTTING --

                                 REYNOLDS
                        What’s all the commotion out there?

                                 HAYES
                             (beat)
                        I’m taking care of it... 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Wouldn’t call vigilante justice 
                        taking care of it. This isn’t the 
                        wild west, Hayes.

           Hayes takes the scolding, eyes dark. 

                                 HAYES
                        I’ll keep it quiet... 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Yes you will. Don’t have much 
                        choice. 
                                 REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
                        You figure this thing out, or it’s 
                        your ass. Because mine has enough 
                        heat under it to start a fuckin’ 
                        fireworks show. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           CLICK. The line goes dead before Hayes can even respond. 
           There’s a beat as he weighs his limited options, he wears 
           this stress, it’s chewing him up inside. 

           He stands, moves toward the CELL BLOCK, finds Deputy Fink 
           standing guard, he straightens at Hayes’ approach.    

                                 HAYES
                        Come with me.

           Fink joins, we follow, striding down the corridor to...

           MARCUS’ CELL. Marcus sits against the wall reading. He marks 
           his page and looks up at his captors without a word. 

                                 HAYES
                        Hands out. 

           Marcus complies, reaching through the bars. Hayes forces his 
           wrists together, handcuffing them outside in the middle of 
           the cell door. Marcus is now forced to stand. 

                                 HAYES
                             (to Fink)
                        Do the same to Adrian... They don’t 
                        sit, they don’t sleep. Got it?

           Fink stands concerned for a beat before nodding. 

                                 DEPUTY FINK
                        Yes sir.

                                 HAYES
                        I’m gonna get my answers, Marcus.
                             (beat)
                        One way or another.

           Marcus looks away, smiles to himself as Hayes heads off.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Spectral purple-black sky. Rain falls heavy in rhythmic 
           waves. Rivulets run downhill into storm drains, gurgling 
           through blockage. The crowds are gone, the exterior calm. 
           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - NIGHT

           LIGHTNING FLASH strobes through the dank corridors. Rain 
           percusses the roof and outer walls. 

           Water dribbles to the floor and the light bulb overhead 
           BUZZES loudly. Adrian stands at the bars, wrists handcuffed 
           same as Marcus. He looks like shit, can’t sleep standing.

           EXT. WALSH RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           The quaint home is railed by a loud clap of THUNDER and the 
           FLASH of lightning an instant later. Storm’s close. 

           Brooke climbs from her cruiser and moves quick through the 
           downpour, seeking shelter under the Sheriff’s front awning. 

           INT. WALSH RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Rain batters the walls and windows. Walsh sits alone under 
           the soft glow of the dining room lamp. A plate of prepared 
           food left out on the table.

           He reaches for his fork with trembling hands when there’s a 
           KNOCK on the door. Surprised to have a visitor.

           MOMENTS LATER. 

           Walsh opens the door to find Brooke outside. Her hair slicked 
           flat under water weight. He considers before speaking...   

                                 WALSH
                        Come on in.

           INT. WALSH HOUSEHOLD - MOMENTS LATER

           Walsh pulls out a chair for Brooke and moves to enjoy his 
           first meal in quite some time. 

                                 WALSH
                        Mind if I eat? Been awhile.

                                 BROOKE
                        Of course...  

           With head hung to the table, chewing slow, he looks older 
           than his years. Brooke reads his pain, wishes she could help.

                                 WALSH
                        There a particular reason you’re 
                        here this time a night, Brooke?

           Even though spoken gently, there’s an edge to his question. 
           She takes a moment, choosing her next words wisely. 
                                 BROOKE
                        Could Rhett Childress have 
                        somethin’ to do with this?

           His shoulders sink. She sees it. He shakes his head.

                                 WALSH
                        Alibi’s there. He was at the bar...

                                 BROOKE
                        He’s tryin’ real hard to get you to 
                        end this. Blame Marcus and Adrian, 
                        call it a day...

                                 WALSH
                        Brooke. He’s scared... Everybody 
                        is. Rhett just appreciates the 
                        chance to act tough...  

                                 BROOKE
                        I saw the way Peggy looked at you. 
                             (beat; off his look)
                        Somethin’ there. 

           Walsh steadies his hand, grows grim and sets down his fork.

                                 BROOKE
                        It’s what I do, Sheriff... You’re 
                        keeping something from me, and 
                        Peggy Childress knows what it is.

           There’s pain or anger in him, she can’t tell which. 

                                 WALSH
                        You implying I’m keeping somethin’ 
                        from the case? Somethin’ personal? 
                             (beat)
                        That’d be mighty bold considerin’ 
                        my good friend was just murdered 
                        and his daughter taken.

           A beat. She studies his tired face and they fall utterly 
           silent. Rain patters the senescent house loud as a waterfall. 

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m right about this...

                                 WALSH
                        And if we got the men who took 
                        Jenny... It matter then?

                                 BROOKE
                        You don’t think they took her.
                                 WALSH
                             (beat)
                        All I know’s what I can see.

           A long, pregnant moment as Brooke tries to read him. It pains 
           her to think he’s giving up. She shakes it off and stands. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Good night. Sheriff.

           Brooke exits out the front door. 

           EXT. WALSH RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke jogs back to her car and WE WIDEN to reveal...

           CHARLIE’S BLUE JEEP, parked down the road. Water beads on the 
           windshield, flicked away by swinging wipers. Two ominous 
           figures come into view, keeping watch, cigarette butts aglow. 

           INT. WALSH RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Walsh lets out a deep sigh. His heart heavier than he 
           can bear. He considers eating until his wife, Grace, steps 
           from the darkened staircase and moves to join him. 

           He shakes his head slow. She senses his stress, tries to read 
           his thoughts. Sits at his side, looks to him in earnest. 

                                 GRACE
                        C’mon. Out with it...

                                 WALSH
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know if those boys did it, 
                        Grace... Scared I’m wasting time. 

           He looks to her, his eyes filled with youthful shame.

                                 GRACE
                        Everett. You been Sheriff of this 
                        town for thirty-four years. You 
                        unnerstand how this place 
                        functions. And you let that be...  

           She talks and he listens, staring across the empty house.

                                 GRACE
                        But if this has gone too far... 
                        Then, honey... you already know 
                        what you need to do.

           There’s a moment as she watches her troubled husband, wanting 
           to say more, before standing. She kisses the top of his head.
                                 GRACE
                        I’d ask you to come up to bed, but 
                        I wouldn’t expect you to... Just 
                        know that I love you. And always 
                        will, come hell or high water.

           She leaves. He remains alone in the darkened house. The 
           thunderous downpour continues outside, beating against 
           exterior walls with the force of a locomotive. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. KINGFISHER ELEMENTARY - MORNING

           The storm has passed. The earth is happy and wet, bathed in 
           the golden rays of an early sun. 

           Puddle water glistens like night stars. Splashed by the 
           footfalls of running CHILDREN. Buses HISS before leaving.  

           INT. KINGFISHER ELEMENTARY - ROOM 4 - MORNING

           CLOSE ON a collection of children’s artwork. Colorful crayon 
           and marker drawings. Most depict a similar WHITE CAT. 

           In block letters above is the name, ‘JENNY SPILLER.’  

           WE WIDEN to reveal Brooke studying the young girl’s artwork. 
           She hasn’t slept, running on fumes but out of time.    

                                 PEGGY (O.S.)
                        Doctor Benedict?

           Brooke turns to see Mrs. Peggy Childress: Jenny’s fourth 
           grade teacher. Could have been pretty, probably was.

                                 BROOKE
                        Mrs. Childress?

           She nods a beat, then looks to the drawings. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Thank you for seein’ me.
                             (beat; no response)
                        She’s talented...

           Peggy smiles soft, nods. 

                                 BROOKE
                        She liked her cat...

                                 PEGGY
                        ...Don’t know exactly what you’re 
                        lookin’ to find, Doctor. Already 
                        told the FBI everything I know.   
           Brooke gives a moment, tries gently.

                                 BROOKE
                        I understand, Mrs. Childress. And I 
                        don’t mean to be a bother, but the 
                        situation’s changed since you last 
                        talked to Agent Hayes...

                                 PEGGY
                             (interrupting)
                        I’m sorry, Doctor Benedict. Been 
                        hard for me, just like everybody 
                        else...
                             (beat)
                        Really nothing more I can say.

           Brooke senses Peggy’s holding something back. They share a 
           glance for a moment. Two strong women just trying to survive.

           BR-RINNNNGGG! The school bell sounds and children begin to 
           file in. Brooke forces a smile and moves to the door. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           Summer heat returns, clinging heavy. Vapor radiates off the 
           drying red earth. Hayes stands on the front steps, watching a 
           small crowd gather with a troubled look on his face.  

           Rhett Childress arrives in his truck, stepping out with DEAN 
           CLEMONS and TRENT HANSEN (40s, high-school football buddies). 

           NEWS VANS hold steady, waiting for a break like predators 
           around prey. Hayes has had enough. He makes a decision, pops 
           a piece of Nicorette and heads back inside. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Hayes approaches, finds Marcus standing, hasn’t slept. He 
           looks like hell, clear bags outlined beneath his eyes. 

                                 HAYES
                        Howdy, Marcus.

                                 MARCUS
                        You ain’t sick of me yet?

           Hayes cracks a rancorous grin, before THUNK! He quickly 
           SMASHES the butt of his gun against Marcus’ fingers. He 
           collapses, handcuffs keeping his knees off the ground.  

                                 HAYES
                             (leaning in; quiet)
                        I’d love a chance t’see how tough 
                        you are. Don’t care who the fuck 
                        you were. You ain’t shit now.
                                 MARCUS
                        ...That fear talkin’, Hayes? Pretty 
                        girl got you second guessin’?

                                 HAYES
                        ...Even if we find Jenny, you’re 
                        gettin’ the needle. Shit’ll course 
                        through them veins like the fires 
                        of hell. Won’t be so tough then. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You need me to be tough, Hayes. 
                             (mocking)
                        ...You got your killers. 

                                 HAYES
                             (fuming)
                        ...I’m ready t’listen anytime you 
                        wanna talk.

           He moves back down the hall. 

           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Adrian is in similar condition, eyes heavy and red. Hayes 
           stands outside his cell.

                                 HAYES
                        Gonna offer you a deal, Adrian... 
                        You tell us where Jenny is, I’ll 
                        get your sentence capped at five 
                        years.

           Adrian locks eyes with Hayes.

                                 HAYES
                        It’s first come, first serve. Your 
                        partner’s already considerin’. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Don’t act like a fuckin’ clown, 
                        Hayes. Marc ain’t listenin’ to you.

           Hayes smiles, turns to leave. Adrian’s face is dark as 
           thunder, knuckles white around the bars, weighing options.

           INT. POLICE GARAGE - DAY 

           Sheriff Walsh leans against a work table, staring at the 
           confiscated Mercury Cougar. Cigarette in hand.

           QUICK FLASHBACK: Walsh looks out his cruiser window at 
           Nathan, Jenny, and Colt. He accelerates, continuing down the 
           street as he notices the all black Cougar pass.
                                 BROOKE (O.S.)
                        You alright, Sheriff?

           Brooke enters, trying to read his aloof state. He nods, looks 
           to her with a hint of disappointment. Knows where she was.

                                 WALSH
                        Peggy tell you what you needed to 
                        know?

           She’s impressed, smiles while shaking her head ‘no.’

                                 BROOKE
                        ...Still waitin’ on you.

           He inhales, looks back to the car. Keep waiting. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You have any idea who’d be 
                        following me? Two men in a Jeep?

                                 WALSH
                             (beat)
                        Probably press. Think you’re FBI.

           Brooke nods, not buying it. Reads fear in his hesitation.

                                 BROOKE
                        ...Hope so. 

           She smiles, turns to exit. 

                                 WALSH
                        Where ya headed now?

                                 BROOKE
                        Gonna go feed a cat.

           His look says he has no idea what she’s talking about, just 
           watches her go with a hint of fatherly concern.

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - DAY

           Brooke’s cruiser pulls into the drive. She steps out.

           INT. SPILLER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 

           She bends to examine an empty FOOD BOWL, checks the cupboards 
           nearby. Inside, PIECES OF CAT FOOD sprinkled in a vacant 
           space. She has an idea, when...

           The sound of FLOORBOARDS creaking startles her. She moves 
           slowly towards the front entrance, when suddenly...

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Howdy.
           Brooke JUMPS and Charlie steps out of the darkened study. She 
           considers running for the door, but Javier moves into the 
           front entrance, knife drawn, deliberately slicing an apple. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Who the hell are you?

           Brooke backpedals slowly towards the kitchen when Hector 
           Delgado moves past Javier into the front hall. Sunlight at 
           his back casting him in silhouette, Brooke stops cold.    

                                 DELGADO
                        Gentlemen. If you’d please.

           They follow orders, move outside smiling malevolently. Brooke 
           catches sight of the 9MM stabbed in Charlie’s belt. 

                                 DELGADO
                             (clocks her fear)
                        Please don’t be alarmed, Doctor 
                        Benedict... Do you know who I am?

           She nods tight. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Good... Then perhaps you could tell 
                        me why you were on my property the 
                        other night? 

           They lock eyes. It’s not a bluff, he knows. A beat. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You’re the only person in this town 
                        who had an issue with Nathan. 

           Delgado smiles. 

                                 DELGADO
                        An issue? 
                             (beat; nods)
                        Seems every villainy needs a 
                        scapegoat... I suppose that’s one 
                        of my roles in this town.

           His eyes drift to the house, up the stairs, into the study.

                                 DELGADO
                        It’s unfortunate really... The 
                        disadvantage of being an outsider. 
                        Good deeds are often overlooked.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I saw the dogs, Delgado. Don’t try 
                        to play innocent. 

           That stirs the fire, she sees it. He pulls it together.   
                                 DELGADO
                        I’ve offered to help the police in 
                        any way possible... But please 
                        don’t mistake my generosity for 
                        weakness. 
                             (beat)
                        And please... Stay off my property.

           His eyes run the length of her body before he turns to leave. 
           Charlie and Javier follow through dusty sunlight outside. 

           Brooke breaths a bit easier, but for the first time, she 
           begins to feel in over her head. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           Walsh exits, moving toward his cruiser. Rhett and his group 
           stare at him brazenly, faces reddened from sun and drink.

                                 RHETT
                        Find Jenny yet, Walsh?

           The sheriff darkens, turns back with an anger we haven’t 
           seen. Chews his odds. Not now. Moves to his car.  

           INT. DELGADO’S SUV - LATER

           Charlie drives, talking on a cell phone as the vehicle turns 
           past the police station. Delgado sits in the rear, mind at 
           work, eyes bleary and directed outside...

           Delgado’s P.O.V.: Rhett Childress stands on the front lawn, 
           playing the hero and giving an interview for local news. 

           Charlie hangs up, looks to his boss in the rear view.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dominguez bunk mates ain’t talkin’. 

           Delgado nods, a hidden fury rising behind the calm facade. 

           INT. OUTBUILDING - DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS 

           Delgado enters and darkness replaces sunlight. Eyes adjust to 
           the shaded, open-air edifice. RANCH HANDS; bronze skin, young 
           and old, sinister in their silence, hold PIT BULLS at bay. 

           Angry dogs keep heavy chains taut, surrounding a BLOODIED 
           MAN, tied to a chair in the building’s center.

           TWO BODIES hang above, heads bagged, swaying slightly from 
           ceiling joists. A sight both terrifying and otherworldly. 

           A Rancher shakes his head. 
                                 RANCHER
                        (Swears he hasn’t seen them.)

           Delgado moves to stand face to face with the bloodied man.

                                 DELGADO
                        (Hello, son... Surely you 
                        understand by now that we need help 
                        in locating your friends... You 
                        see, it is entirely possible that 
                        their behavior is reflecting 
                        negatively on myself and our entire 
                        group... and that is something I 
                        simply cannot tolerate...)

           Delgado maintains a placid detachment, anger hidden well.

                                 DELGADO
                        (So, I’m offering you one last 
                        chance for salvation... Please tell 
                        me where your friends have gone...)

           The man shakes his head slight, WHIMPERS, drools blood. 

                                 BLOODIED MAN
                        (Gone... Disappeared.) 

           Delgado wipes sweat from his brow with a shirt sleeve. 

                                 DELGADO
                        (Disappeared?)

           He turns, waves Charlie over from the entrance. 

                                 DELGADO
                             (calm)
                        Bring me their fuckin’ mother if 
                        you have to... I want to know where 
                        they went, and I want to know now. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure thing, boss.

           Delgado looks to the Ranch Hands, the dogs nearby.

                                 DELGADO
                        And what did I say about these 
                        fuckin’ dogs, Charlie? Don’t make 
                        me repeat myself. 

           He turns back to the bloodied man, waves his hand and a large 
           man in the rear lifts a FELLING AXE. And with one violent 
           motion he brings it down into the man’s skull... THUD!

           Delgado doesn’t flinch, but he can no longer hide his worry.
           EXT. DELGADO’S STABLES - LATER

           Charlie scratches his head in an overgrown walk between work 
           houses. Swats a fly away from the DEAD DOG at his feet. Her 
           NECK’S SLIT, legs twitch, red blood still pumping.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She had a year left...

           He looks to Javier who drags a smoke, starts to laugh. 

           EXT. SPILLER HOUSE - DAY  

           The sun sits at its peak. Winter wheat swells with gentle 
           wind, dancing silently around the vacant house. 

           A police cruiser sits out front, engine TICKING in the heat.

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke sits alone, looks at herself in the rear view and 
           hates what she sees...

           For the first time in recent memory, she’s afraid. She forces 
           herself to light a cigarette. Hands trembling.

           TIRES CRUNCH GRAVEL outside and Brooke looks in the side view 
           to see Sheriff Walsh pulling up. He exits and takes his time 
           approaching her driver’s side, lights a cigarette. 

                                 WALSH
                        Figured I’d find you here.

           She looks to the distant horizon, observing a DELGADO 
           AGRICULTURE WAREHOUSE, men perpetually at work.

                                 BROOKE
                        What’s Delgado doing he wants this 
                        over so quick.

           He pauses, fear hits hard. She reads his concern.

                                 BROOKE
                        I’m fine, Sheriff... Just wanna 
                        know what I’m dealing with.  

           Walsh exhales heavy, happy she’s OK.   

                                 WALSH
                        When you live ‘round here... You 
                        learn there’s some things you just 
                        don’t ask... 

           A beat as he chooses his words, takes a drag off his smoke. 
                                 WALSH
                        Delgado’s got his hand in a little 
                        bit of everything... Most of all, 
                        it’s his name on the bottom of just 
                        ‘bout every paycheck in this city.

           She looks to the WAREHOUSE far beyond. Wheat fields swaying 
           in the space between. Knows the odds are against her.

                                 BROOKE
                        We’re out of time, Sheriff.

                                 WALSH
                             (beat)
                        Mean anything if I said I believed 
                        you? 

           She turns to him, understanding the words aren’t easy, 
           realizing he’s willing to help.

           EXT. ABANDON DRIVE-IN THEATER - DAY  

           Long unused. Faded screen, weather-worn and broken. Walsh and 
           Brooke stand beside his cruiser in the weed ridden lot.

           She gives him a moment. He considers, removing his hat, wipes 
           his forehead with a shirtsleeve.  

                                 WALSH
                        Some time after his wife passed, I 
                        found out Peggy and Nathan had 
                        developed a special relationship. 

           It’s hard for him to get this out, doesn’t want to betray 
           friends. His eyes scan the vacant lot and we’re TAKEN BACK... 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Windows down, Walsh smokes, driving a lonely road past the 
           drive-in theater. When, something catches his attention. He 
           turns into the lot, throws on the overhead SPOT LIGHT.

           EXT. ABANDON DRIVE-IN THEATER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Walsh makes his way to Nathan’s truck. Parked alone as if 
           waiting for a movie to begin on the long crippled screen.  

           At the window, Walsh is surprised to see Nathan Spiller and 
           Peggy Childress together inside. 

           They face forward, unable to look at Walsh as he shifts his 
           flashlight from Nathan to Peggy. Everything is clear as day. 

           EXT. ABANDON DRIVE-IN THEATER - DAY  

           Brooke watches Walsh, sympathetic to his burden. 
                                 BROOKE
                        You didn’t tell Hayes?

           He shakes his head, tortured by this secret.

                                 WALSH
                        Didn’t think it would do any 
                        good... We had the killers.
                             (smiles sad)
                        Who am I to jeopardize what Peggy 
                        and Rhett have? 

                                 BROOKE
                             (beat)
                        You’re good with Rhett’s alibi?

           He lights a cigarette and nods slow. 

                                 WALSH
                        I’m fairly certain Rhett didn’t 
                        even know ‘bout this... 

           He turns to Brooke, blows a long plume of smoke. 

                                 WALSH
                        But Peggy might know more than 
                        she’s lettin’ on. 

           Brooke understands.

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - DAY

           Delgado walks beside his house servant, GUSTAVO. At the front 
           of the compound they spot NEWS VANS giving live updates. 
           Delgado’s blood boils, not happy with the attention.  

                                 DELGADO
                        Gustavo.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Sí?

                                 DELGADO
                        (Call Charlie. Tell him we need to 
                        talk.)

           Gustavo nods, heads off to make the call. 

           EXT. DELGADO’S STABLES - LATER

           Delgado scrubs down a horse when Charlie and Javier approach. 
           This is the first time we’ve seen Delgado hurried, motions 
           quick. We get the sense he’s lost control of this situation 
           and he’s not happy about it.  
                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s the word, boss?

           Delgado doesn’t lift his eyes. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Need you to move everything to the 
                        other warehouse.

           Charlie and Javier look to each other, something’s off. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Now?..

                                 DELGADO
                             (not listening)
                        Make sure that order’s in and out.

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...Yes, sir.

           Delgado finally pauses, calmly wipes sweat from his brow. 

                                 DELGADO
                        I wanna have a talk with Rhett. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - DAY  

           Hayes sits at his temporary desk. He COUGHS heavy, deep-
           lunged when the phone RINGS, startles him. He picks it up. 

                                 HAYES
                        Special Agent Hayes. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Agent Hayes. It’s Tim down at the 
                        OKC lab. Ran those blood samples, 
                        got your results... 

           Hayes waits anxiously as Tim looks over the results.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Turns out, neither sample was a 
                        match... That’s negative for Marcus 
                        Lattimore as well as Adrian Shaw.
                             (beat)
                        Don’t mean these ain’t your boys, 
                        just means blood won’t help ya. 

                                 HAYES
                        Confession will.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You get one?
                                 HAYES
                        Not yet.
                             (long beat)
                        Thanks, Tim...

           Hayes sets the receiver back down in the cradle. He runs his 
           hands through his hair, struggling with these results. 

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY  

           Grace Walsh places flowers at Nathan’s grave site, her eyes 
           wet. Wishing this didn’t happen. Wants her husband back.

           James Fenton approaches slowly. Sets down a bouquet of roses 
           and stands beside his neighbor, his old friend. 

           A long, quiet beat. Purple-white flowers of the Royal Empress 
           RUSTLE and undulate in the breeze. Pedals dancing away.  

                                 GRACE
                        Havin’ trouble sleeping, James?

                                 FENTON
                             (beat)
                        I coulda had ‘em stay.

           She turns to him, sees the survivors guilt across his face.

                                 FENTON
                        Night he died. Nathan offered to 
                        help fix my cooler...

                                 GRACE
                             (interrupting)
                        Don’t do that.

           He blinks back a tear.

                                 GRACE
                        Somethin’ we all coulda done 
                        different. No use in beatin’ 
                        ourselves up over it. 

           James nods slow, wanting to believe that. She puts an arm 
           around him and for a moment they just stand together.

           EXT. CIMARRON RIVER BASIN - DAY  

           Sun and shade mingle, flitting on water’s surface. Anonymous 
           MEN & WOMEN dressed in white, gather along river’s edge. 
           Pastor Macy stands waist deep, lowering a procession of 
           disciples into the warm stream. A Believers Baptism.  

           Sheriff Walsh watches from across the water. His face 
           sunburnt and tired. His eyes put on his broken heart: afraid 
           time’s up, thoughts of the friends lost and betrayed. 
           EXT. KINGFISHER STREET - DAY

           A Kingfisher black & white turns onto a residential street 
           lined with slipshod housing and overgrown by weeds. KIDS 
           playing baseball in the road dart out of the way.

           KNOCKING carries us into...

           EXT. CHILDRESS’ TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Five-year-old Cutter opens the door to find Brooke standing 
           outside. Neither one knows how to respond.

                                 BROOKE
                        Is your mommy home?

           He says nothing, just takes off running into the house. 
           Brooke leans in, when Peggy Childress steps into view.

                                 PEGGY
                        ...Come on in. 

           As if she knew Brooke would be back. Brooke senses this is 
           the real Peggy. The mother. Tough because life’s not easy.

           INT. CHILDRESS’ TRAILER - DAY

           Peggy and Brooke sit at the dining table sipping coffee. 
           Brooke notes the odd decor: walls lined with PHOTOS OF RHETT 
           in his glory days; Kingfisher high school football uniform, a 
           younger Peggy by his side. Brighter times. 

           A collection of OKLAHOMA ROSE ROCKS, dozens of red rock 
           formations, blossoming like the flower, line the shelves.

           Cutter watches CARTOONS at a dangerous volume one room over.  

                                 PEGGY
                        You here to ask ‘bout me and 
                        Nathan?

           She gives a tight nod and the TV BLARES LAUGHTER. Peggy 
           forces a sad smile. Finds memories she’s tried to shake.

                                 PEGGY
                        ...He made me happy. 

                                 BROOKE
                             (understanding)
                        Did your husband know?

                                 PEGGY
                        You got any kids, Brooke?

                                 BROOKE
                        No.
                                 PEGGY
                        Life gets a whole lot more 
                        complicated when you bring kids 
                        into the picture...

           Brooke senses that’s the story of this woman’s life.

                                 PEGGY
                        Means you gotta make some tough 
                        choices... Right and wrong ain’t 
                        quite the same.   

           Peggy takes a sip of her coffee. Eyes Brooke with confidence. 
           She shakes her head subtle, can’t believe what she’s doing.

                                 PEGGY
                        Rhett didn’t know...

           Brooke nods understanding, and Peggy looks to Cutter in the 
           other room. Brooke tracks it, knows there’s more, continues.

                                 BROOKE
                        Peggy... He’s important t’you?

           Peggy nods soft. He’s her life. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Then tell me whatever it is you’re 
                        hiding... so you’d never have to 
                        leave him alone.  

           A long beat as she chews on the threat. Selects the words.

                                 PEGGY
                        I’ve seen one of those boys b’fore.

           There’s a pause as Peggy takes a moment, then slides an 
           ENVELOPE from her pocket and hands it to Brooke. They lock 
           eyes, mutual appreciation, and an understanding. That’s all.  

           Peggy stands and moves to join Cutter in the other room. 
           Brooke watches them through the door frame when A WHITE CAT 
           hops onto the counter, rubbing its back along a window sill.

           Brooke has a huge realization, looks to Peggy and then exits.

           EXT. SHOTS TAVERN - DAY  

           Rhett smokes, joking with Dean and Trent on the front walk.

           A WHISTLE draws their attention to the blue jeep parked out 
           front. Tinted window rolls down and Charlie waves Rhett over.
           EXT. OUTBUILDING - DELGADO’S RANCH - LATER  

           Charlie and Javier lead Rhett from the jeep. He looks around, 
           considers his circumstance. Wheat for days. Nowhere to run. 

           Delgado steps out of the building, crushes a cigar stub with 
           his boot heel and rolls up his sleeves. Rhett swallows hard. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Hello, Mr. Childress... Do you know 
                        why you’re here?

           Rhett glances to Charlie and Javier over his shoulder. Nods.

                                 DELGADO
                        I was told my associates paid you a 
                        visit... Asked you to leave police 
                        matters in police hands... Is that 
                        correct?

           Delgado moves closer, calmly wipes sweat from his neck. 

                                 RHETT
                        ...The people ain’t happy. 

                                 DELGADO
                        Is that why you’re still at the 
                        station? Talking to the press?

                                 RHETT
                        This town’s a real tight knit 
                        bunch. Like family... And we look 
                        out for each other.
                             (confidence growing)
                        Not sure you’d be able t’understand 
                        that...

           Delgado smiles. Not happy, but dangerous. Very dangerous. 

                                 RHETT
                        Right now, our family needs a 
                        leader...

                                 DELGADO
                        Perhaps what your family needs, is 
                        for you to walk away? Stop acting 
                        like an adolescent drunk?

                                 RHETT
                        Maybe you’d be best t’just mind yer 
                        own business, go back to wherever 
                        it is you come from...

           SMACK! Before the words even leave his mouth, Delgado back 
           hands Rhett with a primitive brutality. He falls to the dirt.  
                                 DELGADO
                        Way I see it, the people need me, 
                        Rhett... Here or anywhere else, it 
                        is the strong that lead the weak... 
                        You are not the strong...

           Rhett wipes blood from his lip. Spits at Delgado’s feet. 

                                 RHETT
                        We don’t need you... You ain’t 
                        doin’ shit!

           He starts to rise when Delgado SLAMS his boot down on his 
           fingers, grinding the heel, bones POP and CRACK! 

                                 RHETT
                        FUUUUCK!

                                 DELGADO
                        I do a lot, Rhett.

           Delgado clenches his fists, anger swelling. 

                                 DELGADO
                        I provide security for this 
                        community... Jobs and support! I’m 
                        the backbone! The good!

           Rhett settles, talks soft through the pain. 

                                 RHETT
                        Fuck you...

           THUMP! Delgado swings hard, landing a solid hook on Rhett’s 
           nose, BLOOD EMPTIES like a faucet. Rhett covers his face.

           Delgado stares down at the broken man with an uncultivated 
           anger, smoldering. Blood speckles his arms and shirt. 

                                 DELGADO
                        I’m the leader! Not some piece of 
                        shit drunk!

           Rhett writhes in pain and WHIMPERS something unintelligible, 
           when... THUMP! A vicious kick to the ribs. Charlie cringes.  

                                 DELGADO
                        When I ask you to stop playing 
                        hero. I hope you understand now... 
                        that I mean it. 

           Delgado steps back as Rhett squirms, crimson blood 
           solidifying in the dirt. He CRIES SOFT, apologetic.   

                                 DELGADO
                        Don’t make me ask you again.
           He heads away as Charlie and Javier help Rhett to his feet. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE-35 NORTH - DAY  

           Sparse traffic drifts over thirsty terrain. A PAINTER’S VAN 
           idles on the shoulder, engine running in the heat. 

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           AC WHISPERS through the vents, RADIO plays soft, and we only 
           see the back of the DRIVER. He wears a hat, face obscured. 

           Driver’s P.O.V.: Routine traffic is interrupted by the RUMBLE 
           of FLAT BED TRUCKS; half dozen, piled high with hay bales.  

           The Driver flips open a cell phone, thumbs a text: “Trucks 
           are 40 miles out. Let’s go.” SNAP. He pockets the phone and 
           rocks the van in gear before easing into traffic. 

           INT. CELL BLOCK - DAY  

           Brooke moves fast to MARCUS’ CELL. Pausing when she sees his 
           condition. Still standing, body weak, eyes dark and distant.

                                 BROOKE
                        Christ. What happened t’you?

           Marcus lifts his handcuffs, demonstrating the problem.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hayes.

           She’s livid.

           EXT. CELL BLOCK GATE - DAY  

           Deputy Fink flips through a magazine when Brooke marches in 
           like a bat out of hell.  

                                 DEPUTY FINK
                        That was quick...

                                 BROOKE
                             (interrupting)
                        Gimme the goddamned keys to those 
                        cuffs or I promise the only work 
                        you’ll find in law enforcement is 
                        guardin’ the fuckin’ door at a 
                        strip mall! 

           Fink is stunned, hands over the keys without a word.

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke finds the key, slides it home. Marcus smiles at her 
           mettle. She pauses, realizing just how close they are.   
           There’s a heavy moment until finally, she unlocks the cuffs. 
           He folds onto the bunk behind like he was shot in the belly.

           She grabs the folding chair, sits across from him.

                                 BROOKE
                        You had me figured from the 
                        beginning, Marcus... Jenny Spiller 
                        wasn’t only about my FBI record...

           He finds her eyes. Clocks the honesty. Here comes her truth.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I moved to Oklahoma when I was 
                        ten... because my father killed 
                        himself. 

           Brooke continues over a lurid memory... 

           INT. BROOKE’S HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           It all happens fast. Images flicker in forced recollection. 

           YOUNGER BROOKE creeps across molding hard wood floor in a 
           dingy upstairs hallway. Flies swarm heavy. Air humid.  

                                 BROOKE (V.O.)
                        My mother left when I was young. I 
                        never knew her.

           She reaches a door at the end of the hall, shrouded in 
           darkness. Turns the handle. The sight is haunting. Piss-
           colored walls speckled with crimson blood. She continues, 
           pushing the door open to find...

                                 BROOKE (V.O.)
                        I found him... 

           Her father’s headless body, against the bed. Still twitching. 
           Brain material clings from the ceiling in sticky globs.

                                 BROOKE (V.O.)
                        He’d blown his head off with a 12-
                        gauge. Took the easy way out of 
                        this terrible world.
                             (beat)
                        And it didn’t bother me one bit.

           YOUNGER BROOKE simply stares at the sight before her. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus eyes Brooke in a whole new light. His tired eyes show 
           a sympathy we haven’t seen before. She reads it.

           He understands. Nods sympathetic. 
                                 BROOKE
                        I was adopted by a single man named 
                        Carl Benedict... A marine. And a 
                        wonderful man... Not unlike Nathan 
                        Spiller. 

           INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           YOUNG BROOK (16) stands before an open casket. Inside, CARL 
           BENEDICT’S body lies stiff in his service uniform.

                                 BROOKE (V.O.)
                        I took his last name... Considered 
                        him my father... He died of a heart 
                        attack when I was sixteen.

           A MILITARY OFFICER bends to hand Young Brooke a TRIANGULAR 
           FLAG -- the familiar token given to loved ones of a fallen 
           serviceman. She cries, sad and alone. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - DAY

           Brooke remains stone faced. Proud of her strength. 

                                 BROOKE
                        I learned to read people because of 
                        one father... and how to love them 
                        because of the other... 

           Brooke removes Peggy’s envelope and passes it through the 
           bars to Marcus.

                                 BROOKE
                        And I couldn’t help but see a 
                        little bit of myself in 
                        Jenny...your niece.

           Marcus looks at the PHOTO INSIDE: It’s of him and Nathan’s 
           wife. Marcus’ sister, BRIANNE. They are younger. All smiles.

           Marcus SHOWS A HEAVY EMOTION for the first time. He almost 
           speaks, words resting on the tip of his tongue. Lips quiver.

                                 BROOKE
                        You wouldn’t hurt her...

           He looks her dead in the eye. There’s something so appealing 
           about those eyes, she can’t fight it, has to hold his gaze.

           A long beat as he reads her conviction. He’s pleased. There’s 
           an audible sigh as the fight exits his body.

                                 BROOKE
                        ...But if Delgado’s responsible for 
                        your sister’s death... Why’d Nathan 
                        Spiller have to die?
           He shakes his head, can’t believe it’s come to this. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Nathan was a marine...
                             (beat; off her look)
                        Those boys are a tight knit 
                        group... Semper Fi, ya know?

           She struggles to understand his play. Words are difficult.  

                                 MARCUS
                        ...They wear that shit proud.

           Brooke’s angered by the riddle, but then realizes something. 
           Something big. He see it, nods.

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - DAY

           Parked off a county road, the driver reaches to the passenger 
           seat and reveals a GOALIE MASK, he slips it on and exits.

           INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - UNKNOWN 

           Generator’s gone, room dark. The Man in The Cage watches as 
           The Goalie works by the light of an electric lantern, wearing 
           latex gloves, sweeping and dusting prints. Removing evidence. 

                                 THE GOALIE 
                        Time to shine, friend. 

                                 MAN IN THE CAGE
                        Ain’t your friend. I’m your worst 
                        fuckin’ nightmare.

           The Goalie just shakes his head. Soft hazel eyes visible 
           through the mask as he packs up all remaining gear.  

                                 THE GOALIE
                        Don’t think you understand 
                        nightmares.

           He reaches up and SHUTS OFF the overhead bulb, then climbs 
           the wood stairs leading to daylight as The Man calls out. 

                                 MAN IN THE CAGE
                        Wait!

           The heavenly door SLAMS shut and the room goes casket black.

                                 MAN IN THE CAGE
                        No. No. No. No. NOOOO... 

           INT. CITY MORGUE - DAY  

           OTTO BAINES, city coroner (40s, overweight, sweating) shows 
           Brooke to a select body locker, looks her up and down.  
                                 OTTO
                        This is it.

           A name tag reads: SPILLER, NATHAN.

                                 OTTO
                        Found no teeth, and most of the 
                        head’s missin’... What exactly you 
                        lookin’ for?

           He chuckles at his own dark humor. She doesn’t.

                                 BROOKE
                        Can we just open it?

                                 OTTO
                        ...Sure thing, lady.

           He runs the zipper the length of the body. The stench is 
           revolting, Brooke fights a gag reflex. Shotgun blast left 
           behind a HEADLESS WHITE BODY, sickly pale and long dead. 
           Brooke grabs the left forearm, sees nothing. 

           Grabs the right, and there it is: A BALD EAGLE TATTOO -- the 
           bird perched upon an American Flag.  

           She compares it to a PHOTO OF NATHAN. It’s clearly, DIFFERENT 
           FROM HIS USMC DESIGN. Brooke can’t believe her eyes.

           Shaking her head, understanding the entire set up.  

                                 OTTO
                        That what you wanted t’see?

           Brooke takes off before he’s even done asking.  

           INT. CHILDRESS’ TRAILER - DAY

           Drawn shutters throw patterned sunlight across a cluttered 
           room. Peggy sits alone in a recliner, smoking when the PHONE 
           RINGS beside her. She moves slow, answers.

                                 PEGGY
                        Hello?

           The unheard voice takes her breath away. 

                                 PEGGY
                             (soft)
                        ...Of course.

           She shakes uncontrollably, closing her eyes, trying to fight 
           away some haunting thought, tears building.  
                                 PEGGY
                        FBI agent came by earlier. She 
                        knows a lot... I’m sorry. I had no 
                        idea...

           The voice cuts her off. She nods quick before hanging up and 
           stands alone for a beat, oddly angelic in the dusty sunlight. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - DAY

           Marcus sits in the dark, when a FLECK OF LIGHT dances across 
           the ceiling, catches his attention. He moves to the window...

           Marcus’ P.O.V.: The painter’s van is parked discreetly across 
           the street. Light glints and moves in a purposeful reflection 
           off a small mirror held just outside the driver’s window.  

           Marcus moves quickly to his cell bars. 

                                 MARCUS
                        HAYES!

           EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY

           An ALL WHITE BOX TRUCK speeds down the deserted two-lane.

           INT. BOX TRUCK - CONTINUOUS  

           Two RANCH HANDS react, when up ahead Peggy Childress waves 
           them down, standing square in the middle of the road.  

           They come to a stop and notice her truck parked on the 
           shoulder, HOOD POPPED. She approaches the driver’s side.  

                                 PEGGY
                        You boys lend a hand?

           The men eye her suspiciously. The passenger keeps a 
           SUBMACHINE GUN in his lap, ready if needed. 

                                 RANCH HAND
                        (Sorry lady. No time.)

           He accelerates quick and Peggy’s left behind, watching 
           through the dust with a pained expression, alone.

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY  

           Walsh stands alone. Staring at a peg board, filled with 
           images from the crime scene. A KNOCK brings his mind back.

                                 WALSH
                        It’s open.

           Brooke enters.
                                 BROOKE
                        Sheriff. They’re gonna try to get 
                        out. We need to transfer them now.

                                 WALSH
                             (interrupting)
                        Tell the truth, I was hoping you 
                        were right, Brooke.

           She stops in her tracks, wondering what that could mean. He 
           turns to face her, looks like death. 

                                 BROOKE
                        What do you mean? What’s goin’ on?

                                 WALSH
                        Marcus’s talkin’ right now.

           A sudden understanding stuns Brooke. That can’t be right. She 
           exits without another word. 

           INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke storms past deputy Moreno, almost sprinting down the 
           hallway. She sees Agent Hayes and Deputy Fink by...

           MARCUS’ CELL.

                                 BROOKE
                        David. What’s goin’ on?

           Hayes finishes a note, turns on a dime towards the entrance.

                                 HAYES
                        Little late, Brooke. Marcus’s 
                        decided to cooperate. 

           His words are meant as a jab. He was right. She wasn’t.

                                 BROOKE
                        Whatever he’s telling you, he’s 
                        lying!

           Hayes shakes his head in disbelief. Looks her in the eye.

                                 BROOKE
                        Don’t care what he’s saying. I 
                        promise your DNA comes back 
                        negative. They set this up...

                                 HAYES
                        Enough, Brooke!
                                 BROOKE
                        No! Listen to me! The body’s not 
                        Nathan Spiller... I checked the 
                        tattoos! They’re not the same! 

           Hayes pauses for the briefest moment, then concedes. 

                                 HAYES
                        You’re seein’ what you wanna see... 
                        They gave us Jenny. 

           That hurts. She can’t believe it. 

                                 HAYES
                        It’s over... Now step aside before 
                        you cost us any more time. 

           Hayes continues and she falls behind, stands despondent. As 
           they disappear down the hallway, Brooke turns to Marcus. He 
           looks beyond exhausted, gives the faintest of smiles.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           The entire Kingfisher police force bursts outside, Hayes 
           leads the charge. Walsh exits last, looks defeated. 

           Rhett watches the commotion with two black eyes and a 
           bandaged nose. He hops out of his truck and moves to confront 
           Walsh on the front lawn, Dean and Trent just behind. 

                                 RHETT
                        Time’s up, Sheriff...

                             (interrupting)
                        They told us where Jenny is. 

                                 RHETT
                        ...What?

                        Fifteen miles west.

           Rhett was ready to dance, now doesn’t know how to respond.

                                 WALSH
                             (surrendering)
                        You were right...

           Rhett understands, station’s fair game. Walsh heads to his 
           cruiser. Other cars tear out, swirling dust in their wake.  

           They watch the police convoy speed off. Rhett’s eyes burning 
           with anger. He’s made up his mind. He’ll be the strong.  
           Suddenly, Brooke jumps directly in front of the Sheriff’s 
           cruiser. He SLAMS on the brakes.

                                 WALSH
                        Get out of the way, Brooke.

           She slides around to the driver’s window.

                                 BROOKE
                        Marcus told me the truth. They’re 
                        leading us on... Now I’m telling 
                        you... You leave, they won’t be 
                        here when you get back. 

           He can’t look her in the eye.

                                 BROOKE
                        You said you believed me. Why’d 
                        that change?

                                 WALSH
                        He confessed.

                                 BROOKE
                        They’re still playing us. They 
                        never stopped...

                                 WALSH
                             (snapping back)
                        This isn’t a game, Brooke! Jenny 
                        could be dead!

           His heart aches. Wants this over. She sees it, sympathizes.

                                 WALSH
                        Ever think he could be playin’ you?

           That hurts. His doubt is devastating. She steps back, 
           understanding and Walsh pulls out. 

           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian gazes outside and notices the police convoy tearing 
           out of the lot. He cracks a small smile.

           EXT. DELGADO AGRICULTURE - WAREHOUSE - DAY  

           The ALL WHITE BOX TRUCK rumbles to a halt, axles heavy. RANCH 
           HANDS hurry out, rolling open the rear door to find WOODEN 
           CRATES lining the interior. They waste no time unloading. 

           INT. VAULT - UNKNOWN 

           Lights BUZZ to life in succession, illuminating a long 
           concrete corridor. Rows of similar WOODEN CRATES line each 
           wall, stretching to the far end, where there is... 
           A WALL-SIZED VAULT DOOR.

           Suddenly, RANCH HANDS burst into the narrow passage, VROOOM! 
           Dollying crate after crate down a ribbed steel ramp.

           The last crate is piled near the front. The men exit as 
           quickly as they entered, the entrance hatch is SLAMMED shut 
           and the room falls into SILENCE...  

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - DAY  

           Marcus dresses slow and deliberate. Tucks in his shirt, yanks 
           a wrinkle from his pants, slides into jail issued slippers. 

                                 BROOKE (O.S.)
                        Who were they? The men you killed?

           He looks to her, finishes buttoning his shirt. Smiles, 
           adjusts his cuffs.

                                 MARCUS
                        Come this far... Can’t figure that 
                        much out?

                                 BROOKE
                        Figure they worked for Delgado... 
                        The men who killed Brianne? 

           He nods slight. She shakes her head in disbelief. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Why, Marcus? The whole thing... 
                        What’s it for?

           He only gives the smallest trace of a smile. No more. 

                                 BROOKE
                        ...Just tell me she’s OK?

           There’s a quiet longing in both their eyes. In any other 
           situation this could be something more. He smiles, and...  

           Suddenly... BOOM! A gunshot rattles the small station. Marcus 
           and Brooke turn as a COMMOTION rises out front.  

           He reaches through the bars, grabs her by the waist. She 
           doesn’t fight it. His strong hands pull her close.

           Faces just inches apart...

                                 MARCUS
                        You gotta get out of here.

                                 BROOKE
                        What’s Hayes gonna find?
                                 MARCUS
                        I’m giving them what they need. 
                        It’s all lined up, made easy. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Town needs Jenny.

                                 MARCUS
                             (beat)
                        Can’t do it... I’m gonna hit 
                        Delgado were it hurts... This was 
                        the only way t’make sure the 
                        Spillers were clear. No worries.   

           Brooke wants to say something, but fears he’s right... 

           BOOM! Another gunshot sounds in the lobby. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Get out of here, Brooke. Time’s up. 

           There’s a passionate longing in both their eyes as he slowly 
           releases her hips. She takes off. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke enters to find Rhett and his gang making their move. 
           Drywall debris wafts from the ceiling, Deputy Fink’s warning 
           shot having punched a small hole above.  

                                 FINK
                        I’m warning you, Rhett!

                                 RHETT
                        Best to just set down that pistol, 
                        cowboy. Be on yer way. 

           Fink holds his ground behind the greeting desk, gun leveled 
           at Rhett as his men circle like hyenas around prey. 

                                 RHETT
                        Time those boys got what’s theirs. 
                        You know it as well as I do.  

                                 FINK
                        That ain’t the law! Stand down!

           He swings his aim wildly, when Rhett spots Brooke in back. 
           Dean follows his look, STARTS after her. She quickly ducks 
           into Sheriff Walsh’s office.  

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke locks the door, moves quickly to the CV RADIO on 
           Walsh’s desk.  
                                 BROOKE
                             (into radio)
                        Sheriff Walsh. Childress is in the 
                        jail...

           THUMP! She jumps when a foot SLAMS into the office door. 

                                 BROOKE
                             (into radio)
                        If you can hear this... I’m asking 
                        you to trust me... 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh drives alone, tailing the commotion up ahead. Hayes’ 
           sedan leads two other cruisers over rural highway at 
           breakneck speed. His CV CRACKLES to life.

                                 BROOKE (O.S.)
                        You’re not going to find Jenny. 
                        It’s all planned. They want 
                        Delgado... 

           CLICK. The decision pains him, but he shuts it off, ending 
           the transmission. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - REAR EXIT - CONTINUOUS

           The painter’s van SKIDS to a halt outside the back entrance. 
           THE GOALIE hops out and slides out a SWAT BATTERING RAM. 
           Line’s up the door and... THUNK... 

           Steel buckles under the force of the blow. Doesn’t give.

           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Adrian eyes the cell block entrance as the battering ram 
           pummels the steel door off screen. DUNK... 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus strips his cot bare, piling flammables beside the 
           toilet in the rear. The battering continues. DUNK...

           INT. POLICE STATION - REAR EXIT - CONTINUOUS

           Light pokes through gaps on the edge of the crippled door. 
           The pounding stops for a moment, a brief SILENCE, until...

           THUMP! The door gives, CLATTERING to the floor to reveal The 
           Goalie and the back of his van. He hops in the vehicle, 
           lowers a ramp, tosses a duffel bag over his shoulder and 
           wheels a PLASMA TORCH into the cell block. 
           INT. CELL BLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           The Goalie pulls the tool behind, striding to...

           MARCUS’ CELL. Marcus smiles at the man as he drops the 
           duffle, unzips, and passes him a pair of WELDING GOGGLES.

                                 MARCUS
                        You’re a day early.

           The Goalie shakes his head at the sarcasm and continues...

           He preps the tool, uncoiling a hose and SPARKING a torch, 
           hits a button and the machine kicks on...

           THE PLASMA CUTTER flickers blue in the darkened cell block. 
           Marcus dons the goggles, and The Goalie goes to work. SPARKS 
           flying as he starts sawing through the steel bars.

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Dean tries to pry his way in. His foot SLAMS against the door 
           again. Brooke realizes she’s only got one way out...

           She moves to the window, lifts Walsh’s chair, and SMASH! 
           Sends it flying onto the station’s lawn. Shards of glass 
           protrude at harsh angles from every side of the opening. 

           Another KICK. The door JERKS on its hinges. Brooke starts out 
           the window, delicately avoiding the wicked glass.

           THUMP! Half way out and the leg of her jeans gets stuck. 

           THUMP! Brooke pulls frantically, until, finally the jeans 
           tear free, scraping her skin along the shard, DRAWS BLOOD. 
           SMASH! Just as the door gives. Dean sprints to the window, 
           but he’s a moment late. Brooke’s up and running... 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke feels WARM BLOOD running down her leg, keeps moving. 
           She gets to her cruiser just as Rhett steps out the front 
           door. He levels a SHOTGUN in her direction. 

           BLAM! Buckshot rips open the rear window. He loads another. 

           BLAM! Pellets HACK into the trunk of the car, demolish the 
           overhead sirens. Rhett marches towards the car, pumps another 
           round home, fires again. BLAM!

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Glass fragments spread like pouring rain as the shotgun 
           BLASTS continue. Brooke keeps her head low, finally slides 
           the key home, CRANKS it into gear. ALL GAS.
           INT. VAULT - UNKNOWN 

           BRIGHT WHITE and utterly SILENT. Crates undisturbed, until... 

           THUMP...THUMP...THUMPTHUMP! Heavy pounding gives way to 
           CRACKING, wood SPLINTERS, POPS! and out of one crate...

           NATHAN EMERGES. Sweaty, sucking air, knuckles bleeding. He 
           catches his breath, lungs burning, and lowers himself to the 
           floor. Removing a PLASMA TORCH from the crate shortly after.   

           Still sucking wind, he moves to study the massive vault door. 
           Traces the hinges with rugged hands, TATTOO again visible.  

           He pulls on a welder’s mask and SPARKS the torch, a plasma 
           arc flickers to life, glowing radiant blue. He brings it to 
           the first hinge, metal POPS and SIZZLES with the heat. 

           INT. MARCUS’ CELL - CONTINUOUS

           The Goalie HUMS through the last few bars. Marcus keeps 
           constant force on the metal until the steel GIVES. Marcus 
           climbs out and they quickly move on heading to the exit.

           Reaching the REAR DOOR, Marcus grabs The Goalie by the arm 
           and looks down another cell corridor.

                                 MARCUS
                        Gotta get Adrian.

                                 THE GOALIE
                        They’re in the building...

           Marcus holds his gaze, doesn’t flinch, doesn’t care.

                                 MARCUS
                        Then you better cut fast. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           Rhett motors back inside, furious over Brooke’s escape. 

                                 RHETT
                        They won’t be gone long. Time t’be 
                        heroes, boys... 

           He moves to Fink, now tied to his desk chair, Rhett RACKS 
           another bullet home, puts the barrel to the man’s forehead.

                                 RHETT
                        Got some keys for us, partner?

           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Marcus and The Goalie come to Adrian’s cell. Adrian stands 
           smiling as they approach. Marcus shakes his head.
                                 MARCUS
                        You’re supposed t’be sipping a 
                        Margarita ‘bout now.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Only way I could tell you it was 
                        early, brother.

           They lock wrists through the bars. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Thank you for this...

           Adrian nods, understanding Marcus’ appreciation, dons 
           goggles. The Goalie SPARKS UP the torch, goes to work. 

           INT. CELL BLOCK GATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Rhett and team come to the gate, noticing the BLUE GLOW at 
           the end of the hallway, SPARKS CASCADING to the floor. 

                                 DEAN
                        What the fuck?

                                 TRENT
                        They’re cutting ‘em out.

                                 RHETT
                        Son of a bitch!

           Rhett hurries, guesses the wrong key, tries another.

           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus spots Rhett’s crew at the end of the corridor, still 
           trying their luck with the gate.

                                 MARCUS
                        Make it quick. We got company.

           The Goalie turns his head, spots the trouble, returns to work 
           without hesitation, until...

           BLAM! Buckshot pelts the wall behind. Marcus and The Goalie 
           duck, then get back to work. Only a few bars remain. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Come on. Come on.

           INT. CELL BLOCK GATE - CONTINUOUS

           Rhett tries a key. Dean slides home another shell, takes aim.

           BOOM! The room flashes hot white, smoke sits heavy. Rhett 
           places another key. It works, the door swings open.
           INT. ADRIAN’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus and Adrian push/pull with all their might as The 
           Goalie continues. Marcus sees Rhett swing the gate open.

                                 MARCUS
                        Now or never, kid.

                                 ADRIAN
                        AhhHHHHH!

           CLANK! Bars finally give. Goalie kills the tool, they move 
           without delay, leaving the torch, jogging to the rear exit.

           BLAM-THUMP! Shots pepper the rock walls and hit target with a 
           dull wallop. Adrian looks to his shoulder, SEES BLOOD, feels 
           no pain, keeps moving.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - REAR EXIT - MOMENTS LATER

           They rush to the van, Adrian hops in, SLAMS the doors. Marcus 
           moves to the driver’s seat and The Goalie rides shotgun.

           BLAM! Lead batters the van’s tail and Marcus floors it just 
           as Rhett, Dean, and Trent burst out the back door.

                                 RHETT
                        FUCK!

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           RPMs lurching, Marcus watches their pursuers recede in the 
           side view. The Goalie yanks off his mask, and we see it’s... 

           COLT. His face sweaty from the heat of the torch, eyes 
           glowing proud. Marcus pats him on the shoulder. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You are your father’s son, that’s 
                        for damn sure.   

           Colt smiles shy and Marcus looks to Adrian in the rear view.

                                 MARCUS
                        You hit?

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’m fine. 

           Marcus sees blood spreading quick, tests the van’s limits. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY  

           The police motorcade RIPS across Oklahoma flatland. SIRENS 
           BLARING as the cars push one hundred. A NEWS VAN brings up 
           the rear, racing to keep pace. 
           INT. VAULT - UNKNOWN 

           Sweat runs heavy as Nathan continues with the hinges. The top 
           two are finished. He works on the final, lower one.  

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY  

           Brooke corners like a seasoned driver, turns onto a deserted 
           county road headed out of town.  

           EXT. LOT 459 - DIRT ROAD - DAY  

           Police cars chew gravel, accelerating through the turn onto 
           the desolate road, a county sign indicating this as LOT 459: 
           PROPERTY OF DELGADO AGRICULTURE rattles into view.

           Hayes glances out his window towards the expansive head-high 
           wheat field laid out before. A break in the crop reveals...

           A SHACK. The only visible building for miles. Wheat sways 
           soft against rotting wood siding. He HAMMERS the brakes.

           EXT. LOT 459 - CONTINUOUS

           Hayes jumps out, loads his pistol. Cops hustle to join.

                                 HAYES
                        This is it! Everybody with me! He 
                        said she’d be alone, so let’s move!

           They begin the short jog to the shack. Sheriff Walsh moves to 
           the news van just pulling in. A CAMERAMAN already unloading 
           his gear in back. 

                                 WALSH
                        You want this story. You’re gonna 
                        give us a minute. Understand?

           The REPORTER nods. Walsh turns. Moves briskly, adrenaline 
           pumping, fatigue gone. 

           DOWN THE ROAD. An ARMED MEXICAN RANCH HAND peeks out from 
           behind the cover of thick wheat. He spots the police officers 
           moving onto the lot. He pulls a RADIO off his belt. 

                                 RANCH HAND
                             (into radio)
                        (We got trouble...)

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - LOT 459 - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON another armed MEXICAN GUARD. He answers the radio.

                                 RANCH HAND (O.S.)
                        (Police are on the lot.)
           ANGLE WIDENS to show a massive clearing in the center of the 
           wheat field. FLAT BED SEMI-TRUCKS await loading nearby. 

           Beside them, DOZENS OF HAY BALES lie spread out on the 
           ground, each rolled out to reveal... BUNDLES OF COCAINE.    

           The Guard turns and signals to a handful of anonymous, 
           heavily armed HISPANIC WORKERS patrolling the clearing.

                                 MEXICAN GUARD
                        Policía!

           They BURST into action, scurrying to hide product. Rolling 
           hay bales over the top of cocaine bricks. 

                                 MEXICAN GUARD
                        (LET’S GO! LET’S GO!)

           The others mount up, following as he begins a trot towards 
           the shack on the edge of the 459. 

           EXT. HELIPAD - OKLAHOMA CITY FBI - CONTINUOUS

           SAIC JIM REYNOLDS ducks under rotor wash, Kevlar vest on, he 
           boards a SWAT CHOPPER that wastes no time getting airborne. 

           INT. SHACK - LOT 459 - MOMENTS LATER

           The door swings open in a BLAZE of sunlight. Hayes leads, 
           local cops following with guns drawn. Looks of surprise all 
           around as they find NOTHING... The room is EMPTY.

                                 MORENO
                        There!

           He points to a lock on the ground, a floor hatch. Hayes 
           signals two men to get it open, readies to descend. 

           Walsh enters last, his old heart racing. Watching with a mix 
           of horror and relief as the men raise the ground level door.

           INT. VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           Nathan works on finishing the last hinge. POPPING. HISSING.

           Behind him, a ceiling hatch begins to open slowly. Nathan’s 
           unable to hear the activity over the WHIR of his torch...

           ZIP-POP! The final strand of metal on the last hinge gives. 
           He kicks off the torch and TURNS SUDDENLY as the overhead 
           entrance hatch is finally opened...

           INT. UNDERGROUND ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Light shafts into the empty room. Officers climb down with 
           Hayes at their side, they all look to see...
           THE CAGE. A SHADOWED FIGURE INSIDE. Hayes lowers his weapon 
           and charges forward, others follow. It’s chaotic. Hayes 
           reaches the bars, FREEZING in shock. Not Jenny, but... 

           The Man in The Cage: malnourished and dirty. There’s an 
           inherent evil about him. Something that can’t be chased out. 

                                 HAYES
                        What the fuck...

           Walsh takes the stairs slow, breath labored. His light finds 
           the men across the room. Their faces say it all, pure shock. 

           INT. VAULT - CONTINUOUS

           Nathan watches Colt, Marcus, and Adrian descend the fluted 
           steel ramp leading from the ceiling entrance. He smiles. 

           His face blackened from fire and glistening with sweat. He 
           looks to his son, who displays the same visage. We sense a 
           deep fatherly pride, Marcus sees it.

                                 MARCUS
                        He did a hell of a job. 

           Nathan smiles, appreciative. 

                                 MARCUS
                             (sarcastic)
                        Though it was a day early... Thanks 
                        for the heads up.

           They all crack, allowing themselves to smile for a moment 
           until Nathan sees scarlet streaks running down Adrian’s chest 
           and arm. Back to business.

                                 NATHAN
                        You’re hit.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I’ll be fine...

           Adrian coughs blood. Spits to the side. Nathan looks to 
           Marcus with a glance that says ‘he needs help.’

                                 MARCUS
                        We don’t have much time... This 
                        works out, thing’ll be all over the 
                        news. Delgado will want out fast...

           Nathan understands. They need to hurry. The four men stand 
           together before the massive vault door. Nathan takes one 
           final look at his son. And they all begin to PUSH, until... 

           WHOOSH...BOOM! It topples to the earth below, revealing...
           A bank like storage unit. Walls lined with metal shelves, 
           each stacked with BUNDLED MONEY. Individual BRICKS stocked 
           full of TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS. 

           There must be TEN MILLION DOLLARS in fifteen separate bricks. 
           Colt can’t believe his eyes, stands in shock.

                                 MARCUS
                        Gotta move!

           Nathan reads Colt’s fear, pats him on the back reassuringly.  

           EXT. SHACK - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheriff Walsh marches to his cruiser. He doesn’t know who to 
           believe anymore, but he feels doubt creep in like a chill up 
           the spine. JAMS the car in gear. Takes off in a hurry. 

           INT. DELGADO’S STABLES - CONTINUOUS

           Gustavo approaches in a hurry, holding out a cell phone.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        (Senor Delgado. You have a phone 
                        call.) 

           He finds Delgado walking the Arabian. He pauses to answer.

                                 DELGADO
                             (into phone)
                        Hola.

           A small beat as his face goes flush, his heart skips a beat.

           INT. OUTBUILDING - DELGADO’S RANCH - MOMENTS LATER

           A GUATEMALAN MAN busts through the doors, sweaty and 
           screaming in Spanish. 

                                 GUATEMALAN
                        (Charlie! Boss needs you! Now!)

           Charlie looks to Javier with drunken eyes. He nods, let’s go.

           EXT. LOT 459 - DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           THE REPORTER preps her makeup in a side view mirror. Her 
           Cameraman lights a cigarette, leaning against the van and 
           then he drops his smoke, his face goes limp.

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Oh shit...

           RANCH HANDS materialize out of the head-high wheat around the 
           shack. Each armed with AR-15s or AKs, scary weapons. 
                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Get in the van.

                                 REPORTER
                        No. Get this! Get this!

           The Cameraman scrambles to roll. Films from a distance as...

           Ranch Hands move forward, when Deputy Moreno exits... 

           BUDDABUDDABUDDA! Men unload. THUMP. THUMP. Blood mists. 
           Moreno takes two bullets in the chest, sits down, stunned. 

           INT. SHACK - CONTINUOUS

           Moreno THRASHES in pain. Agent Hayes pulls him to the side. 

                                 HAYES
                        JESUS CHRIST! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

           THUMPTHUMPTHUMP! Gun fire rakes the shack’s exterior, 
           jackhammering across the siding in DEAFENING BLASTS. 

                                 MORENO
                        FUCK! I’M HIT!

           THUMPTHUMPTHUMP! Officers duck and Hayes pulls his phone.

                                 HAYES
                             (into phone)

           Peggy’s a mess. Sitting behind Cutter as he stares at the 
           television. His cartoons are interrupted by a NEWS UPDATE.

           The TV cuts to LIVE FOOTAGE of the gunfight on lot 459. 
           TAKTAKTAKTAKTAK! Gunfire rattles through the speakers. 

                                 CUTTER
                        Mommy. They’re shootin’ each other.

           The crawl reads: SHOOTOUT NEAR KINGFISHER, OKLAHOMA - LIVE. 
           The REPORTER speaks quick, nervous and caught off guard.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)

           Delgado hurriedly prepares an overnight bag. Gustavo helps

           Hector stops dead, looking across the room to the mammoth TV 
           against the far wall -- a live feed of the shoot out. Across 
           the bottom: SHOOT OUT AT COUNTY LOT 459.

           For a moment he seems almost reserved. Ready to throw in the 
           towel. But he pulls himself together, starts packing again. 

           EXT. WESTERN OKLAHOMA SKY - DUSK

           Just a sliver of sun remains, burning blood red on the 
           western horizon. The Oklahoma City SWAT CHOPPER moves low 
           above the harvest. A NEWS CHOPPER trails close behind. 

           INT. SWAT CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

           Reynolds sits with SWAT CAPTAIN RUSS SUTTER (40s, stalwart 
           leader). Turbulent wind WHIPS through the open bodied craft. 

           Sutter SIGNALS TWO MINUTES and points to a clearing in 
           endless wheat below; the small shack and the SHOOTOUT raging. 
           The helicopter begins its descent. SWAT preps for battle.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DUSK

           Sheriff Walsh steps out of his black and white, spots the 
           destruction caused by Rhett’s crew. Heads in.

           INT. CELL BLOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh finds MARCUS’ CELL. Empty. A hole sawed clean through. 
           He hangs his head in disbelief. He lost, feels sick.

           Esther Holland stops in utter shock upon seeing the TV above

           ON THE TV: LIVE HELICOPTER FOOTAGE of the tail end of the gun 
           fight on Lot 459. Oklahoma City SWAT surrounds the shack. 

           THE IMAGE SWITCHES to show: the clearing the 459’s wheat 
           field. A massive rectangle carved out of the crop. SWAT 
           MEMBERS moving between the bundles of uncovered COCAINE.

           Agent Hayes is distraught as PARAMEDICS usher The Man in the

           The engine ROARS as Brooke keeps the pedal to the floor. Wind 
           whipping violently through the open rear window. 

           BROOKE’S P.O.V.: Delgado’s Ranch comes into view, shaking 
           through the windshield a few hundred yards down the road.

           Nathan and Colt finish loading a U-HAUL parked just outside 
           an UNDERGROUND ACCESS HATCH. The rear of the U-HAUL piled 
           high with black duffle bags holding Delgado’s money. 

           Adrian’s sitting in the van, struggling, losing color fast. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Nate, we gotta get him outta here. 
                        He’s losing too much blood.

                                 NATHAN
                        We’re done. Got it all. 

           Marcus nods and stands for a moment staring at his brother-in-
           law and nephew. A sense of accomplishment tinged with pain.

                                 NATHAN
                        Thank you for this. You took all 
                        the risk. Don’t think I don’t know 
                        that.

                        And now you’re my brother.

           He reaches out a hand, they lock wrists, hold eyes in a solid 
           handshake between men. Colt extends his hand, but Marcus 
           smiles, pulls him close into a hug. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You did great, kid. Your mom woulda 
                        been proud.

           Through it all, Colt’s become a man. Marcus holds his eyes, 
           then hops in the van without hesitation.

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus looks back to Adrian; going white, sweating heavy.

                        man...

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke has the cruiser parked down the road, leaning out the 
           open door, keeping watch on Delgado’s front entrance.

           BROOKE’S P.O.V.: An SUV pulls into the front gate. She knows 
           something’s going on, doesn’t like it one bit. 

                                 BROOKE
                             (into radio)
                        But, Delgado’s the big fish. And I 
                        guarantee that’s where they’re 
                        headed... Marcus won’t let this go. 
                        I’m gonna need back up...
                             (beat; watching the SUV)
                        Fuck it. 

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           CLICK! The radio cuts off. Marcus’ face goes dark as night.  
           Eyes wide, blood surging through temple veins. 

           He watches dirt kick up behind the U-HAUL as Nathan and Colt 
           pull away. Glances in the rear view, sees Adrian dying.

           Marcus lays on the HORN, watches the U-Haul stop. 

           EXT. DELGADO AGRICULTURE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marcus acts as Adrian’s crutch, keeps him propped under the 
           shoulder. Staring up at Nathan and Colt in the U-Haul. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Plan’s changed. Need you to take 
                        him.

                                 NATHAN
                        Where you going?

                                 MARCUS
                        ...Something I gotta do. 

           Nathan nods and moves to help get Adrian in the back. They 
           lie him down, pain coursing his nerves, jaw clenched.  
                                 MARCUS
                        Can’t thank you enough, Adrian.

                                 ADRIAN
                        We ain’t out yet.

           They shake hands one last time as brothers. Adrian forces a 
           smile. Marcus knows he’s right and turns away, mind made up.

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Marcus stares at the road ahead. Finalizes his decision. 
           CRANKS the van in gear. BURNS OUT.

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Walsh stares at the radio in his office in disbelief. 
           Brooke was right, and now she’s in trouble. He sits in shock.

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke tosses the CV into the car and pulls the SHOTGUN 
           strapped to the cruiser’s roof. She marches towards the front 
           gate, takes aim at the fleeing men.

                                 BROOKE
                        OKLAHOMA CITY FBI! HANDS ON YOUR 
                        HEAD’N GET ON THE GROUND! NOW!

           CA-CHUNK! She racks home a bullet, keeps moving. 

                                 BROOKE
                        WHO’S IN THE TRUCK?!

           The three men pause, surveying the situation. Brooke’s still 
           coming, eye on the SUV, expecting to see Marcus any second.  

                                 BROOKE
                        I SAID GET DOWN!

           Delgado and Charlie lock eyes. Look says it all. Brooke reads 
           it just as Charlie PULLS THE .45 from his belt... 

           BOOM! She fires one round and DIVES into dusty overgrowth. 

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Charlie’s shots HISS through dirt as Brooke 
           scrambles for cover in nearby wheat. 

           Delgado ducks behind his SUV, Charlie RACKS in another 
           magazine. Looks to Javier... ARTERIAL BLOOD fans from a gash 
           in his neck. Brooke’s buckshot took the skin clean off. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck, Javi! She got you good. 
           Javier smiles through bloodied teeth and his knees buckle. He 
           sits against the dusty steps, still grinning.

           BLAM-THUNK! Brooke’s second shot pelts the SUV and cement 
           wall behind. Charlie ducks, then follows her into the wheat. 

           INT. DELGADO’S SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Delgado scrambles in the rear door, shouting to his driver.

                                 DELGADO
                        Go! Go! Go!

           Driver SLAMS THE GAS, truck’s moving before the door’s shut. 

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - DUSK

           Marcus keeps it in the red, sees Delgado’s ranch about a mile 
           up the road. SLAMS the gas to the floor. ENGINE GROANING.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke hides, gulping air. When suddenly, Charlie appears. 

           BROOKE’S P.O.V.: Her face at ground level. His boots within 
           feet. Gun hangs at his side. He spins, looking. It’s eerily 
           reminiscent of the memory that haunts her from youth. 

           ON CHARLIE. He scans frantically. Nothing but waist high 
           wheat until he spots the van barrelling onto the property.

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus clenches his teeth. Spots Javier and makes up his 
           mind. GUNS it towards the ranch. GRRRR! Engine going.

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Javier sees the van gaining, has him dead to rights. He 
           smiles and calmly pulls a PISTOL from the hip. 

           BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He unloads. Smiles wicked.

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           TAK-TAK! The windshield sheers. Glass folds, Marcus ducks.

           TAK-TAK! A bullet hits something important. The ENGINE REVS 
           HARD then quits. SMOKE turns to FLAME. Just as... 

           SMASH! The world goes black, van accordions into the ranch.
           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke hears the CRASH, tries to move, when...CLICK. She 
           feels cold steel against her head.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Game over, lady. Shoulda left town 
                        when ya had the chance. Now get up. 

           He forces her to stand. Puts his hand on her hip, runs it up 
           to her breast. She closes her eyes in disgust. Hates this. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        God damn, ain’t I lucky... 

           She tries to scream, but he shoves his hand over her mouth. 
           She BITES down, draws blood...

                                 CHARLIE
                        FUUUUCK!!!

           Brooke takes off, staying low. She’s terrified, wants to 
           vomit, fighting memories she’s tried desperately to forget. 

           ON CHARLIE. He shakes blood from his bite wound and moves to 
           find her. Fast walk turns into a sprint and he’s moving. 

           INT. PAINTER’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus opens his eyes, stunned. ENGINE SMOKE distorts vision, 
           BLOOD MIST coats. He runs his fingers across his chest... 

           Finds them sticky with warm blood. He’s hit. Right side, just 
           below the collar bone. Blood coursing heavy from the wound.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke exits the wheat, sees the van and Javier when... 
           Charlie springs from nowhere like a coiled demon. Tackling 
           her to the earth with heavy force, he looks insane.   

                                 CHARLIE
                        You fuckin’ bitch!

           THWUMP! He PISTOL WHIPS her across the face. She’s stunned, 
           staring to the sky as it recedes into a pin-pick of white.  

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus stumbles onto chalky earth, red blood puddles below. 
           He’s dazed, fading fast. Doesn’t care, gets to his feet.  

           ON CHARLIE. He pulls Brooke to her feet and uses her as a 
           shield, moving closer to the van. Gun leveled and cocked. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        You come lookin’ for the girl? Or 
                        you just got a death wish, friend?

           ON MARCUS. Eyes focus. He remembers Brooke. Checks his 
           handgun, hands shaking, blood pulsing with every heartbeat. 

           He looks around the rear of the van, gun leading his sight. 
           Locks on Charlie and Brooke. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Be careful where I’s aiming that if 
                        I was you. 

           Marcus doesn’t say a word. Keeps shaky aim on the target. 
           Brooke’s eyes flit open weakly and they share a look.

                                 BROOKE
                        Take the shot, Marcus.

           Charlie ducks, now just an eyeball showing beside her neck. 
           The shot’s damn near impossible. All three know it, but... 

           Marcus and Brooke LOCK EYES. She nods, trusting him 
           completely. She closes her eyes and holds her breath when... 

           BLAM! Charlie’s head kicks back in a flurry of crimson. Bone 
           and blood spread over her neck and she breaths again. 

           Smoke wafts from Marcus’ barrel and his arm goes limp, face 
           hits the dirt. Brooke sprints to him, kneels by his side.

                                 BROOKE
                        Marcus! Can you hear me?

           He finds consciousness, nods. They hold each other’s eyes for 
           a charged moment. Her hand on his chest, trying to stop the 
           bleeding, desperately wanting to say more... 

           She turns to see SIRENS fast approaching. Makes a decision.  

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER

           FIREFLIES SMASH against Walsh’s windshield as the Sheriff 
           tears ass into Delgado’s ranch. 

           High beams cut into the blue darkness and he sees the 
           carnage. Brooke standing alone, bloody and beaten. Relief 
           doesn’t even begin to describe what he’s feeling.   

           EXT. DELGADO’S RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Walsh moves like hell, jogging to Brooke. He pulls her in for 
           a fatherly hug, thankful she’s okay and for so much more. 
                                 WALSH
                        Are you okay?

           She falls into the hug. She needed it.

                                 BROOKE
                        ...Delgado got away.

                                 WALSH
                        Not for long. No hiding what he’s 
                        been up to...

                                 BROOKE
                        Marcus and Adrian are gone?

           Walsh holds her at an arms length, trying to read her for the 
           first time. She knows it, doesn’t show much. He smiles as if 
           to prevent himself from crying.

                                 WALSH
                        I’m sorry I doubted you...

           She shakes her head soft and moves back in for another hug.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. CHILDRESS’ RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Rhett sips a beer and watches out the window awaiting the 
           inevitable. Knows he fucked up, he’s in trouble. 

           He glances one last time to a HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PHOTO on 
           the wall: smiling proud, young and arrogant. 

           SWAT and police cruisers TEAR into his drive, red-blue lights 
           flashing through the darkened living room. 

           EXT. DELGADO AGRICULTURE - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Delgado’s SUV skids to a halt. Delgado exits at a clip, he’s 
           completely shaken, face no longer hiding his concern. 

           INT. VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

           Delgado and his driver come down the ramp and reality hits 
           hard. The vault lies BROKEN and EMPTY, the money long gone. 

           He moves close, running his fingers along the CLEAN CUT 
           HINGES. Perfect edges, only left by one tool. He knows it.   

           EXT. DELGADO AGRICULTURE - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           The two men step back outside just as SWAT and FBI teams 
           swarm the premise. Members of both units throwing Delgado to 
           the ground. Defeated, he doesn’t even put up a fight.
           EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Vaulted sky now aglow with FLUORESCENT LIGHTING and the 
           THROTTLE of helicopter rotors. NEWS TEAMS have returned in 
           full force, REPORTERS take notes, give live updates. 

           Familiar faces gather, some sad, most outraged. James Fenton 
           is utterly defeated, Pastor Macy stands beside his wife. 

           Grace Walsh pushes through the crowd and barrels through the 
           SWAT barricade, moving into the arms of her husband. The 
           Sheriff sways with exhaustion, folding into her arms. 

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Commotion. Officers Fink and Moreno fight off reporters 
           trying to get to SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE JIM REYNOLDS. 

           He stands beside Agent Hayes, staring blankly through the two-
           way at THE MAN IN THE CAGE. The evil three-fingered trigger 
           man now chained where they once watched Marcus and Adrian. 

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Lab guys told me they talked t’you.
                             (beat)
                        DNA didn’t match your boys.

           Hayes turns in his direction. Eyes show fear.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        You got lucky... That sample 
                        belonged t’him. 

           There’s more to those words and Hayes knows it. Ignoring the 
           lab results put his career in jeopardy. A heavy beat as 
           Reynolds lets that sink in.

           SWAT LEADER Russ Sutter approaches with a report. Hayes and 
           Reynolds linger a moment before turning to listen. 

                                 SUTTER
                        ...Name’s Cody Bulger. Worked for 
                        Delgado. Wanted for just ‘bout 
                        everything in the book. 
                             (beat)
                        Says he was set up... Admits he 
                        killed the Spillers but the plan 
                        was all your boys’. 

           There’s a moment as all three men try and piece together what 
           Brooke has known all along.

                                 SUTTER
                        Also said there was no little 
                        girl... Least not that he saw. 
           Brooke stands in the doorway watching Hayes. He turns to her, 
           choked up with regret and pride. Also a hint of the love that 
           never left. She was right all along. 

           He desperately wants to say something, but she won’t have it. 
           Shakes her head soft and turns away. He lets her go.  

           EXT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Brooke strides out of the station, moving through the tumult 
           as if immune to it. She cracks the slightest of smiles and 
           Sheriff Walsh just watches her leave. 

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        Sometimes right and wrong ain’t so 
                        easy to define. Older I get, more I 
                        realize that as truth. 

           EXT. OKLAHOMA FARMLAND - NIGHT

           Marcus stands before a BURNING POLICE CRUISER. He’s utterly 
           alone in the blackness of the night. Orange flames flicker 
           off his pale face, he’s still losing blood, but he won’t quit 
           yet. Not after coming this far. 

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        If something needs to change... Who 
                        am I to question he who’s willing 
                        to take that final step. 

           He moves to find a BLACK SEDAN hidden in the rural land. 
           Pulls a key from the visor, slots it in the ignition and 
           throws the car in gear. Heading out, down the road under a 
           blanket of summer stars.

           EXT. KINGFISHER ELEMENTARY - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Peggy Childress sits in her truck with a child beside. It 
           looks like Cutter, a hoody pulled over the head, gently 
           stroking the cuddly WHITE CAT perched on his lap.  

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        Ask me, it’s all a matter of 
                        opinion.

           The U-HAUL pulls up outside, parking beside. She locks eyes 
           with Nathan through the driver’s window.

           He hops out and the child exits her truck, sprints and leaps 
           into his arms. Nathan bends to a knee pulling the child’s 
           hood back, and we see it’s JENNY. 

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        Label it what you want... but the 
                        choice has been made. 
           Colt jumps down and moves to join the hug. Nathan pulls him 
           in, closes his eyes, enjoying the moment. A family again.  

           Peggy exits her car and Nathan finally stands to greet her.    

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                        And it sure as hell ain’t always 
                        the easiest one. 

           They come face to face for the first time in a long while, a 
           heavy moment, intense longing in both their eyes.

                                 PEGGY
                        You’re supposed to be dead. 

           He smiles soft, wanting to hold her. 

                                 NATHAN
                        ...Want you to come with me. 

           Tears show her heartbreak, building delicate behind saddened 
           eyes. A single drop runs down her cheek as she looks away.

           She shakes her head slight and he smiles. Knows her answer. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. KINGFISHER HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Humidity gone, the night’s crisp. A capacity crowd enjoys the 
           high school game and the company of others. 

           TITLE BURN: TWO MONTHS LATER.

           We recognize all the FAMILIARS, buying drinks and hot dogs, 
           wearing Kingfisher team gear. The town is moving on. Drawn to 
           youth as a reminder of life. Its abundance.  

           Peggy sits with Cutter in the front row, wearing the pain of 
           a love that will never come to fruition. Puts on strength. 

           The American Flag sways gently at HALF MAST. Above the 
           scoreboard, a football jersey is hung for all to see, the 
           back reads: C. SPILLER #1. They have their closure.

           EXT. GRASSY HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Brooke stands on the edge of the stadium’s light range, cast 
           in shadows. The CRACK of football pads barely audible.

           From out of the darkness steps a form. A man. Marcus. He 
           moves to stand beside her. His wounds healed. His plan 
           executed to perfection. Except this part. Her. 
                                 BROOKE
                        You know I let you leave, assumin’ 
                        I’d never have to see you again.

                                 MARCUS
                        That the way you want it?

           There’s a moment and she doesn’t know what to say. They just 
           stand watching the game. CRACK, WHISTLE. Play continues. 

                                 BROOKE
                        You broke their hearts, ya know.

                                 MARCUS
                        Got everything they needed... 
                        Everybody wins. 

           She turns to look at him for the first time, mad at herself 
           for wanting to continue this conversation. 

                                 BROOKE
                        Everybody?

           He nods. Loves how she wants to continue.

                                 MARCUS
                        ...Jenny’s fine, Brooke. Life’s 
                        gonna be easier for them. 

           She looks at him hard, finds his soft eyes. 

                                 BROOKE
                        What about me?

           He smiles. 

           EXT. BLEACHERS - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Walsh shares a blanket with Grace. She’s enthralled 
           by the game, loving every second of the action.

           His eyes wander, glancing towards the hill where he can make 
           out TWO FIGURES on the edge of darkness. 

           He squints to confirm that he sees Brooke. She turns to the 
           man beside her and they embrace in a hug, possibly a kiss. 
           Hard to tell from this distance.

           He turns back to the crowd, the smiling faces, CHEERLEADERS, 
           the PLAYERS on the field. And finally, he smiles, putting his 
           hand on Grace’s leg in a silent display of content.

                                 THE END
