           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY 

           LUCY GULLIVER, 28, sits in her bedroom. Charmingly 
           vulnerable, she curses like a sailor and falls in love 
           easily. Lucy is a Junior Curator at the Metropolitan 
           Museum of Art. You will come to understand why. 

           Around the room, shelves line the walls from floor to 
           ceiling. They are crammed, filled to the gills with 
           things. But as we move closer we see order, multiples - 
           COLLECTIONS - stamps, shot glasses, spoons, Dr. Seuss 
           Books, lipsticks, condoms, teapots of all shapes and 
           sizes...a cornucopia of oddities and fantasies. 

                                 DEEP MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Lucy Gulliver collected things. At 
                        four it was fireflies in a jar. At 
                        seven it was stamps. At twelve, 
                        Revlon Lipsticks. It wasn’t the 
                        shades that fascinated her, but 
                        rather the names. If one wore 
                        Roman Holiday Pink, would she 
                        immediately adopt the grace and 
                        poise of Audrey Hepburn? At 
                        seventeen  Lucy collected condoms. 
                        On a trip to Amsterdam she 
                        procured a bacon flavored condom. 
                        It really made her want to have 
                        sex with a butcher. Eat. Meat. 
                        Fuck. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        But that’s all pork fat under the 
                        bridge now. 
                                 (Beat)
                        As the years went on, Lucy’s 
                        collections only grew more 
                        bountiful. Perhaps it was this 
                        panache for collecting that led 
                        Lucy to her most recent 
                        collection. One that was 
                        more...accidental. A collection 
                        borne from habit, rather than 
                        purpose. You see, in her adult 
                        life, Lucy began collecting bad 
                        boyfriends. 

           Lucy opens a large album. We see photograph after 
           photograph of Lucy kissing various men. A tall handsome 
           model. A short, wiry professor. A hipster. Another 
           hipster. A sheik sitting on top of a camel. A tough L.A 
           Cholo with a Dodgers neck tat. One hipster, two hipster, 
           red hipster, blue hipster.

                                 DEEP MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        For each boyfriend that meandered 
                        in and out of her life like a 
                        scruffy, mal-intentioned Peter 
                        Pan, Lucy kept items with which to 
                        commemorate them. A break up 
                        collection of sorts. And perhaps 
                        it was for this reason, that Lucy 
                        never quite moved on from 
                        heartbreak. 

           Lucy cultivates her “boyfriend” collection - items 
           devoted and representative of each man-friend. Some might 
           say she’s crazy. Others, might choose “sentimental.” 

           She picks up an old violin and begins to play a sad sack 
           melody. Poor me, poor me, pour me another drink. 

           Her playing is interrupted by her cell phone ringing. Her 
           ring tone is APPLE BOTTOM JEANS (boots with the fur). And 
           we are jolted back into reality... 

           EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY 

           Establishing shot of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The 
           stairs, the arches, the grandeur, the opulence. Lucy 
           rushes inside checking her watch. She is late for work, 
           which really isn’t out of the ordinary. 

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - EXHIBITION SPACE - DAY 

           Lucy pushes a giant statue of Aphrodite across the floor. 
           Her work ally, JULIAN, 30 watches her. He is not always 
           helpful but he’s always funny. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Use your core, whore. 

                                 LUCY
                        You should have an ignore button. 
                        Like my blackberry. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Are you saying that because I’m 
                        black? 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m not playing this game with 
                        you. 

                                 JULIAN
                        What game?  Racism? 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Lucy, finished pushing, stands back to admire her work. 

                                 LUCY
                        Aphrodite is the original gangsta 
                        of love. And thusly deserves a 
                        place of  original gangsta-ness. 
                        And that’s final. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Look at you - so dominating! I 
                        should be wearing a dog collar 
                        under this one of a kind Thom 
                        Browne. 

           At this moment their boss MAX FRANK, 37 strides into the 
           room. He is well pressed, well-dressed, Prada Loafers, no 
           socks - you know the type. He uses words like diaphanous 
           and obfuscate. Oh, and he and Lucy are fucking. There is 
           time spent together and flirting but no real commitment. 

           Lucy looks at Max adoringly, as he surveys their work. 
           She tries, and fails to keep cool. 

           It is clear that Julian hates Max.

                                 LUCY
                        I was thinking - perhaps its 
                        stupid - and if it is, you can say 
                        hey - that’s stupid. But I was 
                        thinking, what if we exhibited all 
                        these ancient sculptures and 
                        paintings salon style - along one 
                        wall - nothing else adorning any 
                        of the other surfaces. Tres Paris 
                        late 1900s? 

                                 MAX
                        Perhaps. 

                                 JULIAN
                        She’s brilliant. You know that, 
                        right? 

           Lucy elbows him. 

                                 MAX
                        I’m aware Julian. But as we move 
                        on I do want to emphasize the 
                        tensions between divine and mortal 
                        lovers. I want that to be the 
                        cynosure of the exhibit - that 
                        inherent tension. Understood?

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 LUCY
                        Word. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        I mean, absolutely. 

           Max squeezes Lucy’s shoulder. 

                                 MAX
                        See you tonight. 

           Lucy nods. 

                                 LUCY
                        I can’t wait. Or I mean, I look 
                        forward to it - with the 
                        appropriate amount of enthusiasm 
                        that one reserves for such events.   

           Lucy smiles awkwardly. Max nods and exits. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Doesn’t it bother you that he 
                        gives you absolutely no credit and 
                        then takes all the credit? 

                                 LUCY
                        Isn’t that what a boss is supposed 
                        to do? 

                                 JULIAN
                        What did you have for breakfast 
                        this morning? 

                                 LUCY
                        Oatmeal. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Quaker? Arrowhead? Max’s Cock? 

                                 LUCY
                        Inappropriate. This is your place 
                        of employ. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Yours too. But the only thing 
                        you’ve been employing lately are 
                        your jaw muscles. So I suggest you 
                        pipe down Judge Judy. 

                                 LUCY
                        I like him. And I think he likes 
                        me. And by “think” I really mean 
                        “hope.”

                                 JULIAN
                        If he likes it then he’ll put a 
                        cock ring on it. 

                                 LUCY
                        Riddle me this -  is it a 
                        relationship if you don’t fight? 
                        Or throw things? Or are together 
                        but it’s a secret? Don’t answer 
                        that. Also what is the definition 
                        of casual as it pertains to two 
                        humans having the sex? Don’t 
                        answer that either. 

           Lucy checks her watch. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        We are going to be late for- 

                                 JULIAN
                        The Max Frank self promotion tour 
                        of 2010. 

                                 LUCY
                        He is about to be the youngest 
                        director in the history of the 
                        Met. It’s kind of a big deal. 

                                 JULIAN
                        How big exactly. 

           Lucy extends her arm and motions to the length of her 
           forearm. 

                                 LUCY
                        Umm. Like, this big. 

           Lucy grins and begins heading towards the door. Julian 
           calls after her. 

                                 JULIAN
                        I’m surprised all your organs are 
                        still intact. 

           Lucy turns to look at him. 

                                 LUCY
                        You and me both, sister. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Touche. 
           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - LADIES LOUNGE - NIGHT 

           Inside the cramped bathroom, Lucy wiggles out of her 
           jeans and into a very sexy evening gown. She momentarily 
           checks her make up. Reapplies lip gloss. Makes a face at 
           herself in the mirror. She looks fly. There is a knock at 
           the door. Lucy opens it, peaks her head out. It’s Max. 

                                 LUCY
                        Can I help you? 

                                 MAX
                        All signs point to yes. 

           He smiles. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Bug, I need to speak to you about 
                        something. 

                                 LUCY
                        Professionally or otherwise?

           Max clears his throat, unaccustomed to being 
           uncomfortable. 

                                 MAX
                        Otherwise. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        The thing is, that, I feel as if. 
                        Well. Hmm. How to put this, 
                        exactly...

           Lucy grows impatient, pulls him into the bathroom, and 
           kisses him. It’s hot and grabby. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wait, I- 

                                 LUCY
                        Cinder-Fella, we’ve got to be at 
                        the ball in 15 minutes. The 
                        talking ship has sailed. 

           She kisses him more. Max succumbs, pulls up her dress and 
           in the words of LL Cool J, makes her earrings jingle.  

           INT. CIPRIANI MIDTOWN - FANCY GALA - NIGHT 

           Everything has a pinkish glow to it. The way fancy things 
           do. Lucy and Julian weave their way through the 
           glittering crowd searching for their table. They grab 
           glasses of wine from a waiter with a passing tray. Julian

                        Hopefully I’ll be taking a long 
                        hard piss during our boss’ 
                        acceptance speech. I prefer the 
                        sound of my own urine to his 
                        voice. What does that say about 
                        me?   

           Lucy is focused on Max who works the room. 

                                 LUCY
                        How cute does he look in that 
                        tweed blazer by the way? Like T.S. 
                        Eliot with a better face. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Yeah and he has the fake Madonna 
                        accent to match. The man is from 
                        Pittsburgh and he talks like he 
                        just got off the Mayflower. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        Off the Mayflower and into your 
                        bush. 

           Julian giggles, delighted. 

                                 LUCY
                        Julian, this is a grown up party! 

                                 JULIAN
                        Who are you trying to impress? 

           Lucy looks across the room - her eyes land on AMELIA 
           CARTWRIGHT, 35, shiny blond hair, flawless skin, straight 
           teeth, red lips. She’s so glossy. Lucy points. 

                                 LUCY
                        Her. 

           Julian clutches Lucy’s arm. 

                                 JULIAN
                        A non-ironic OMG!  Amelia 
                        Cartwright. AT OUR TABLE! She’s 
                        perfect. A YSL-wearing, shiny-
                        haired dermatologist. She’s my zit 
                        popping muse. 

                                 LUCY
                        She’s the kind of girl that makes 
                        me want to shower.

                                 LUCY
                        Yikes. 

           Julian grabs Lucy’s hand and drags her towards the table. 

           INT. CIPRIANI MIDTOWN - SAME 

           Max is sandwiched between Lucy and Amelia. Max looks 
           uncomfortable. Lucy leans over to him. 

                                 LUCY
                        Do you like my hair? I used this 
                        new technique, where you rub the 
                        back of your head against the 
                        bathroom wall while being violated 
                        by your boss. It’s all the rage in 
                        Europe. 

           Max smiles wanly. 

                                 MAX
                        Sure. 

           Lucy furrows her brow. 

                                 LUCY
                        You alright?  

           Max nods. 

                                 MAX
                        Nerves. 

                                 LUCY
                        You should shotgun a beer. I find 
                        it really takes the edge off. 

                                 MAX
                        No. 

                                 LUCY
                        Suit yourself. 

           Max clears his throat uncomfortably then leans in the 
           opposite direction and whispers something in Amelia’s 
           ear. She giggles. Max smiles tightly. Homeboy looks WOR-
           ried. 

           At a podium at the front of the grand room is EVA WOOLF, 
           age unknown. She is Fabulous (with a capital F).

                        Hello. Pay attention to moi.

                        Good evening. I’m Eva Woolf, and 
                        as President of the Metropolitan 
                        Museum of Art’s Board, I’d like to 
                        welcome you all to this very fancy 
                        party celebrating the promotion of 
                        our very young director. 

           Applause, applause, applause. 

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        While Max Frank is practically a 
                        fetus, I happen to be very old and 
                        thus I make no bones about what I 
                        do and don’t know. I know about 
                        Art. And I know about Men. It so 
                        happens that I have been lucky 
                        enough to have profited greatly 
                        from both of these endeavors. 

           The crowd laughs. Lucy clasps her hands, delighted. 

                                 LUCY
                                 (Sotto.)
                        I love her.

           They focus their attention back to the podium.

                        As a result I have a great deal in 
                        common with Max Frank, a handsome 
                        man with an eye for fine art. It 
                        is with great pride that the board 
                        of the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
                        welcomes him as the youngest 
                        director in our illustrious 
                        history. Ladies and Gentlemen, Max 
                        Frank! 

           Max stands. He weaves his way through the tables shaking 
           hands, kissing babies, etc.

           Eva gives him an appraising look and smiles at the crowd. 
           The crowd applauds as Eva returns to her seat. 

                                 MAX
                        I’m uncertain if I will be able to 
                        live up to such a winning 
                        introduction, but I will try. 
                        Before I begin, I’d like to take a 
                        moment to make an introduction of 
                        my own. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        Artists draw inspiration from many 
                        sources. Some are captivated by 
                        their surroundings. Others 
                        propelled by their pain - a great 
                        many, actually by their pain. 
                        Others by religion. Some are 
                        spurred along by other artists. My 
                        favorite photographer William 
                        Eggleston was of this ilk. As a 
                        young man, he was moved by the 
                        work of Henri Bresson and knew 
                        immediately his metier would be 
                        behind a lens. 

           Julian rolls his eyes at the word “metier.” 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Though I am no Eggleston, or 
                        Bresson, for that matter, this is 
                        the woman who inspires me. 

           Lucy nods along, flattered, overwhelmed. Julian raises 
           his brow at her, impressed. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Please welcome her both as the 
                        newest member of our tireless 
                        Board and of course, as the woman 
                        who captured my heart, Ms. Amelia 
                        Cartwright. 

           Amelia stands, looks around at the crowd and nods her 
           head, elegantly. Lucy by instinct, stands as well. The 
           crowd stares at her. Julian tries to pull her down. Lucy 
           looks apoplectic. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Sit. 

                                 LUCY
                        Shit. 

           Max, sensing a problem, continues his speech as Julian 
           tries to pull Lucy down.

           Lucy doesn’t know whether to stay or go. She looks like a 
           deer in headlights. Julian pulls her arm to sit, Lucy 
           pulls away - it’s s a tug of whore. 

                                 MAX
                        My appointment is proof that the 
                        Met, though a classic and 
                        indelible New York institution, is 
                        a forward thinking one. It will be 
                        my goal, as curator to make sure 
                        that the Met stays relevant - 
                        stays fresh - its mission will be 
                        to expose the 18th century English 
                        milliner, the Lapita-era Potter, 
                        Piccasso and Dorothea Lange to 
                        even newer and more contemporary 
                        voices - blending ancient and 
                        modern to accommodate and attract 
                        visitors- 

           Lucy, has had enough, she takes off, sprinting out of the 
           ballroom. 

           EXT. 42ND STREET - LATER

           Lucy stands breathless outside of Cipriani Midtown. The 
           tears she’s been holding in finally stream down her face, 
           creating a mascara road-map of sadness. 

           Suddenly a large gust of wind. Lucy’s dress flies over 
           her head. She bats it down. She is tangled in her gown. 
           It is woman versus dress. 

           At that moment Max exits on to the street. 

                                 MAX
                        Lucy! 

           Lucy turns around - facing him, bitch look crazy. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry. I tried to tell you 
                        earlier - in the bathroom - I just- 

                                 LUCY
                        How?  How did you try to tell me?  
                        With your penis?  

                                 MAX
                        We never quite defined things-  

                                 LUCY
                        Right. The impressionism of 
                        relationships. No commitment.

                        Amelia and I just got serious. I 
                        swear it. She just seems 
                        more...appropriate. 

                                 LUCY
                        Appropriate? Like, like I can’t be 
                        the Hilary to your Bill? The 
                        Connie Chung to your Maury Povich?  

                                 MAX

                        Oh that’s right. I forgot. You’re 
                        one of those people who doesn’t 
                        own a television. Which when I 
                        found out, I said was bourgeois 
                        and cool but what I meant was that 
                        it makes you a cockmonger. 

           Max smiles at the word cockmonger. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Not funny. 

                                 MAX
                        Lucy, you and I - we have fun. But 
                        with Amelia, it’s more serious. We 
                        have something...

                                 LUCY
                        Something what? 

           Max looks away, not wanting to answer. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Something what?

                        Something...extraordinary. 

           Lucy swallows hard, that hurt. 

                                 LUCY
                        Extraordinary? 

                                 MAX
                        Bug, please. Let’s not muddle 
                        things more than necessary. Come 
                        on, we’re both adults here.

                                 LUCY
                        First of all I’m not an adult. I’m 
                        28. Secondly fuck you. Thirdly I 
                        quit. 

                                 MAX
                        Lucy, please. You’re being 
                        tempestuous.

                                 LUCY
                        That is not a word you use in an 
                        argument! 

           Lucy begins stomping down the street - though it is very 
           hard to stomp in heels. 

                                 MAX
                        What about the Art and Love 
                        exhibit? This is your first lead 
                        exhibit. I need your innovation, 
                        your talent.

           He touches her arm. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Your understanding. Come on Luce, 
                        you will regret this decision. 

           Lucy pulls away. 

                                 LUCY
                        No Max - you will regret this 
                        decision. 

           Max, defeated, turns and walk back inside. Lucy gathers 
           herself, feeling decidedly un-Cinderella-like. She steps 
           out onto the street and lifts her arm to hail a cab. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        TAXI! 

           As she does, across the street NICK FRIEND, 32, 
           attractive, sarcastic, and best of all, unavailable, 
           stumbles out of a bar with his arm around a FLOOZY. 

                                 NICK
                        TAXI! 

           A taxi halts directly between the two of them. Nick 
           ushers the Floozy into the TAXI. Lucy, enraged swings 
           open the opposite passenger door. 

                                 LUCY
                        Oh no! You do not steal a taxi 
                        from a lady.

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 NICK
                        Come on, there will be another. 
                        There’s always another. 

                                 LUCY
                        No. There isn’t always another. 
                        Don’t you get it? This is the one 
                        I want. I had my heart set on this 
                        one. I did a lot for this one.  

                                 NICK
                        I’m pretty sure you just lifted 
                        your arm to hail it. Again, it’s 
                        just a cab.  

                                 LUCY
                        No! No it’s not just a cab. It’s 
                        THE cab. It’s supposed to be MY 
                        cab. We can’t SHARE the cab. TWO 
                        people can’t have the same cab. 
                        It’s the cab I wanted. I love this 
                        cab. So I advise you to Get. The. 
                        Fuck. Out. Of. My. Cab. 

           Lucy is practically foaming at the mouth. 

                                 FLOOZY
                        Is this a zombie movie? 

           Nick, wide-eyed ushers the girl out of the cab, slamming 
           the door behind him. Lucy smooths her dress and addresses 
           the cabby, calmly.  

                                 LUCY
                        Brooklyn please sir. Thank you. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           AMANDA BAXTER, 28, an accomplished Attorney at Law, 
           practical, efficient, loves credentials and NADINE 
           HOLLOWAY, 28, still finding herself, most often in 
           bedrooms all over town, sit on the couch sipping Pinot 
           Noir. These are Lucy’s roommates. 

                                 NADINE
                        So I very patiently say, Sam, we 
                        have worked together for four 
                        years cultivating our cases of 
                        assistant ass, and not once have 
                        you ever gotten up to make copies 
                        or run an errand for our boss.

                        Today, I said, I’m wearing very 
                        high heels so maybe, just this 
                        once, you can tear yourself off 
                        your Aero chair, do me a solid and 
                        give the Xerox a whirl. 

                                 AMANDA
                        A fair and just request. 

                                 NADINE
                        You would think. Until he pulled 
                        up his pant leg, tapped his 
                        prosthetic and said, “I’m an 
                        amputee.” 

                                 AMANDA
                        No! 

                                 NADINE
                        Yes. I didn’t even know. I thought 
                        he had a gangsta lean or 
                        something.

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re telling me you’ve worked 
                        next to this man for four years 
                        and you didn’t know he was an 
                        amputee? 

                                 NADINE
                        It’s a job, not my career. At work 
                        I function at minimal alertness. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Didn’t you have sex with him?  

                                 NADINE
                        Just the one time.

           Suddenly, the door to the apartment swings open, Lucy, 
           bursts in, her face streaked with tears, clutching the 
           evening’s program. Amanda and Nadine turn to look at her. 

                                 LUCY
                                 (Between sobs.)
                        Hi. 

           Nadine and Amanda exchange a look and spring into action. 
           They are BREAK UP OPERATIVES, scrambling around the 
           apartment at lightening speed. 

           Nadine rushes to the fridge and grabs two tubes of COOKIE 
           DOUGH. Amanda dives for KLEENEX and BLANKETS with one 
           hand while she pulls out the COUCH with her foot.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Lucy collapses onto the couch. 

           Nadine pops WHEN HARRY MET SALLY into the DVD player and 
           then collects THREE BOTTLES OF WINE from the pantry. 

           The girls plop down on the couch on either side of Lucy, 
           who lets out a long, painful wail. 

                                                               TIME LAPSE 

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re better off without him. I 
                        know it doesn’t seem that way now, 
                        but, he’s just so...

                                 LUCY
                        So what? 

                                 AMANDA
                        So Prada loafers no socks. 

                                 NADINE
                        Besides, Max Frank - two first 
                        names. I don’t trust people with 
                        two first names - think about it - 
                        Woody Allen - child molester. Mike 
                        Tyson - wife beater. Jenny Craig - 
                        fat... 

           Nadine pauses. 

                                 LUCY
                        Fat what?

                                 NADINE
                        That’s it. 

                                 LUCY
                        Well, barring your erudite 
                        theories on nomenclature, it still 
                        sucks. 

           The girls nod. Lucy holds up the program. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Yet another thing to add to the 
                        collection. 

           She sighs, and gets up from the couch and disappears into 
           her bedroom. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh god. Not again.

                        This is the program that breaks 
                        the camel’s back. We’re the camel. 

                                 AMANDA
                        We can’t have another boyfriend

                        It’s seeping into my bedroom. 

                                 AMANDA
                        There are reality shows about 
                        this. 

                                 NADINE
                        You gotta tell her. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You tell her. 

                                 NADINE
                        You. 

           Nadine grabs Amanda’s arm and starts pinching her. 

                                 AMANDA
                        OW! 

           Lucy walks back into the room. 

                                 LUCY
                        What’s going on? 

           Nadine stuffs a huge chunk of cookie dough in her mouth 
           and points to Amanda. 

                                 AMANDA
                        We have to talk to you. 

           Nadine nods in agreement. Mouth still full.

                        We understand that break ups are

                        But you have to get rid of the 
                        break up collection. Purge 
                        yourself. It’s bad news. It’s 
                        holding you back.

                        It’s clogging your emotional 
                        pores. You need a life facial. 

           Lucy touches her face.

                                 AMANDA
                        You can’t have a good relationship 
                        because you’re constantly mourning 
                        the old relationship. And by the 
                        time the mourning period is up - 
                        the new relationship has already 
                        fallen apart.

                        You’re living in the past like

                        You’re like a modern day Mrs.

                        You want me to throw it away? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Or burn it. 

                                 NADINE
                        Or dump it in the east river. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Any of these options seem 
                        sensible. 

           Lucy looks from one roommate to another. 

                                 LUCY
                        But I can’t! This is my stuff! I 
                        mean - it’s a part of me. It means 
                        something. It’s what’s left when 
                        two people stop loving each other. 

                                 NADINE
                                 (Pointedly.)
                        Or when just one person stops 
                        loving the other person. 

           Amanda shoots Nadine a look.

                        Lucy, those things aren’t who you 
                        are - they’re the remnants of 
                        heartbreak, and the truth is that-

                                 NADINE
                        The truth is that they’re keeping 
                        you from moving on. 

           Nadine and Amanda nod simultaneously. 

                                 LUCY
                        But we collect Mayan pots, and 
                        Egyptian funerary gods! What’s so 
                        different about my collection? 
                        They’re the historical relics of 
                        my life! I can’t throw it away. I 
                        can’t. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Can’t? Or won’t? 

           Lucy, exasperated she marches into her room and slams the 
           door. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

           Lucy lies in her bed, staring at a photo of Max in the 
           program from the Gala. A knock, Lucy quickly shoves the 
           program under her covers. Nadine and Amanda enter. 

                                 AMANDA
                        We’re going running in Central 
                        Park. 

                                 NADINE
                        Correction. She’s running I’m 
                        going to walk behind her smoking 
                        and thinking of palindromes.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you want to come? 

                                 LUCY
                        No. I want to lie here and eat 
                        until my body starts to look like 
                        an uncooked souffle. 

                                 AMANDA
                        We are not sitting shiva for this 
                        relationship. No ripping of 
                        clothes. No covering of mirrors. 
                        And no break up collections.

                        I just got broken up with in a 
                        very public forum. I have a right 
                        to feel sorry for myself. 

           Amanda pulls back the covers on Lucy’s bed to reveal all 
           of the REMNANTS OF MAX, in bed with Lucy. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        This is very humiliating. 

                                 AMANDA
                        All the break up stuff needs to 
                        go. Everything associated with 
                        people who have been inside of you 
                        - gone.

           The girls give her a funny look. She shrugs.

                        Palindrome. 

           EXT. EAST RIVER DOCKS - DAY 

           Lucy drags two huge garbage bags filled with her break up 
           collection. She stands on the dock, peers into river - 
           she sees her reflection in the brown water. 

                                 LUCY
                        Narcissus like, totally died 
                        staring at his own reflection. 

           She takes a deep breath. Suddenly, she sees something. 
           Looks closer - it’s a DEAD BODY bopping in the river. 
           Lucy grabs her trash bags and gets out of there. 

           INT. FREDDY’S BAR - BROOKLYN - DAY

           Lucy stands in front of the bar, as the CUTE BARTENDER, 
           BRIAN, 29 wipes down the bar. A few ITEMS sit in front of 
           her; an old t-shirt, a small bear holding a heart that 
           says; “Shit bitch, you is fine.” 

                                 LUCY
                        So I mean, I’m just trying to 
                        expunge. Rid myself of the painful 
                        past. Hello wind. Here’s my 
                        caution. That sort of thing. 

           She pushes the items towards the Cute Bartender.

                        So here you go, Brian. I’m 
                        returning these ghosts of 
                        relationships past. What we had 
                        was great, don’t get it twisted. 
                        But that was in 2001. The year of 
                        the snake. Which, ironically you 
                        managed to exemplify throughout 
                        the relationship. Now I’m moving 
                        on. 

           Lucy smiles awkwardly. 

                                 BRIAN
                        I’m sorry, do we know each other?  
                        I’m kinda drawing a blank here. 

           Lucy looks mortified.

                                 LUCY
                        I’ll just have a tequila shot. I 
                        think they keep the self hatred in 
                        the limes. 

           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT  

           Lucy sits nervously, on the train, her large garbage bags 
           of things at her feet. Passengers lurch back and forth on 
           the ride. An old woman sitting across from Lucy gives her 
           a funny look. Lucy smiles. 

           The subway car stops. The doors open. Lucy stands, pushes 
           past a few people and gets off the train, LEAVING HER 
           GARBAGE BAGS BEHIND. 

                                 OLD WOMAN 
                        Terrorist! 

           Lucy whips around. The old woman points directly at Lucy. 

                                 OLD WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Terrorist That girl is a 
                        terrorist! 

           The entire subway car begins panicking. People begins 
           screaming. 

                                 LUCY 
                        No! No! I’m not a terrorist. 

           A MAN on the platform yells at the conductor.

                        Jihad! Jihad! Jihad! 

           It’s total chaos. All the doors open. People stream out. 

                                 LUCY
                        No! You don’t understand! I don’t 
                        have a bomb. I don’t want to hurt 
                        anyone. 

           A pregnant woman lunges at Lucy who hits the ground. A 
           siren starts going off. 

           Lucy looks stricken, other passengers hold her down. A 
           group of NYPD officers in riot gear storm the station.

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Nadine and Amanda sit on the couch in their workout  
           clothes drinking Pinot Noir. 

                                 NADINE
                        And so in conclusion, I realized, 
                        though anal sex is for some 
                        people, it’s just not for me. 

           Amanda nods, understanding. 

           A worn out, disheveled Lucy bangs open the door to the 
           apartment. Behind her she drags the two large garbage 
           bags. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Really Lucy? 

                                 NADINE
                        Really?

           Lucy looks from one roommate to another. They have NO 
           IDEA the sort of day she’s had.

                        yet massively co-dependent. And

                        you’ve been to law school. You 
                        went to law school because you 
                        didn’t know what else to do with 
                        your life.

                        You tear up - to this day - every 
                        single time you hear a song from 
                        “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” 
                        because that was “your album” with

                        you had to make it hard.” 

           Amanda covers her ears.

           She marches over to the coffee table, grabs the bottle of 
           wine and then storms into her room. She slams the door.

           NIGHT 

           Lucy drinks wine straight outta the bottle.

                        Everyone has this stuff. Everyone. 

           Lucy looks around the room. Her eyes taking stock of her 
           boyfriend collection. She gets a little misty. 

                                 DEEP MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        As Lucy got drunker, and still 
                        drunkerer, she wondered about 
                        love. After all, volumes of 
                        encyclopedic proportion have been 
                        written about love, that 
                        indescribable pull that unites 
                        people’s hearts and loins. But 
                        when its all over - when love 
                        crumbles like the Roman Empire, we 
                        are left holding the ruins - in 
                        the form of songs, letters, 
                        gifts...Where to put these things 
                        when the clock strikes break up? 
                        Lucy knew that if anyone could be 
                        the emperor of these maladies, it 
                        was her. What if people brought 
                        their break up mementos to her?

           Lucy drunkenly stumbles over to her laptop and logs onto

           Lucy looks at her computer screen, satisfied with 
           herself. She sits back and continues drinking. And 
           drinking. Soon enough, Lucy is passed out, clutching the 
           bottle of wine, snoring. As she does, we go BACK to her 
           COMPUTER SCREEN and see people on FACEBOOK - LIKING and 
           COMMENTING on her POST...

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - LUCY’S ROOM - 
           MORNING  

           An alarm buzzes, louder and louder. Lucy wakes up with a 
           jolt. Her lips and teeth are wine-stained. She stumbles 
           around the room grabbing clothes off the floor, quickly 
           getting dressed. She glances in the mirror.

           EXT. MET STEPS - DAY 

           Lucy and Julian sit on the steps of the Museum. Lucy’s 
           head is in her hands. A box of her things at her feet. 

                                 LUCY
                        I thought I was late for work, but 
                        then I realized I didn’t have a 
                        job. 

                                 JULIAN
                        The irony is that this is the 
                        first time in the history of the 
                        world that you were on time. So 
                        you have that. 

                                 LUCY
                        What do I do? I have no marketable 
                        skills. I have $77 in my bank 
                        account. Oh God. Mistake. Big 
                        mistake. Huge.

           Lucy frowns at him. Julian shrugs sheepishly. 

                                 JULIAN (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were quoting Pretty 
                        Woman. 

                                 LUCY
                        Why would I do that right now? Why 
                        would I quote Pretty Woman? 

                                 JULIAN
                        Uh, I think the question is why 
                        wouldn’t you quote Pretty Woman? 

           Lucy isn’t listening to him.

                        Lucy, you need to get a grip. You 
                        will find another job. 

           Lucy continues to sob and maybe rock back and forth just 
           a little bit. Julian grabs her and turns her towards him. 

                                 JULIAN (CONT’D)
                        Lucy! You will be fine. You will 
                        find a new job. You will find a 
                        new boyfriend type person. Who 
                        will admit that they are your 
                        boyfriend type person. You are 
                        woman. Now roar. 

                                 LUCY
                        Roar. 

           A flock of pigeons fly overhead, settling on the steps of 
           the Met. A bird shits on Lucy’s head. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Did a bird just shit on my head? 

           Julian nods his head. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Absolutely not. 
           EXT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY 

           Lucy arrives home carrying the contents of her office her 
           hair is tangled, she is a hot tranny mess. She walks up 
           the steps of her apartment, right by WILLHEMINA REED, 30, 
           a timid, leather clad, daredevil lesbian who sits on the 
           stoop of her building. Lucy attempts to unlock the door. 

                                 WILLHEMINA 
                        Lucy? Lucy Gulliver? 

           Lucy turns, dropping her things. She bends down to pick 
           them up, Willhemina tries to help her. 

                                 LUCY
                        Are you from Visa? Please come 
                        back when I’m successful and have 
                        money to pay you. That will be in 
                        approximately ten years. 

           Willhemina giggles quietly. 

                                 WILLHEMINA
                        No, Lucy, it’s me, Willhemina Reed 
                        from Mr. Share’s class? Third 
                        grade? We reconnected on Facebook 
                        through Adam Winograd? The 
                        unlawful titty grabber? 

                                 LUCY
                        Oh yes! Of course! Willhemina! 
                        Wow. You’ve changed. I could 
                        barely recognize you under all 
                        that - leather. 

                                 WILLHEMINA
                        I wore a lot more denim when I was 
                        eight. Anyway, I brought 
                        something, for your museum?

           She reaches into a shopping bag and produces a CAST that 
           looks as if it once belonged on a LEG. 

           Lucy looks at her quizzically.

                        It’s a cast. My ex, Gina, was my 
                        nurse. I was in the hospital after 
                        a nasty motocross accident. 

                                 LUCY
                        You do motocross? I distinctly 
                        remember you being afraid of the 
                        jungle gym. 

                                 WILLHEMINA
                        Yes. Hard to believe. I used to be 
                        very timid. But as it turns out, 
                        I’m a bit of an adrenaline junky. 
                        I have big...

           She motions with her hands. 

                                 LUCY
                        Balls? 

                                 WILLHEMINA 
                        Mmhmm. Gina was my nurse. And then 
                        she became my girlfriend. And you 
                        know the rest. 

                                 LUCY
                        What’s the rest? 

                                 WILLHEMINA 
                        She left me for a doctor. 

           Lucy bursts into tears. 

                                 WILLHEMINA (CONT’D)
                        Please stop crying. I’m one of the 
                        few lesbians that shies away from 
                        tears. And golfing.   

           Lucy snivels.

                        Listen, I have been having the 
                        worst time getting over Gina. 
                        Every time I close my eyes I see 
                        her face. It’s like her head is 
                        tattooed onto the inside of my 
                        eyelids.

                                 LUCY
                        That’s called heartbreak. It’s 
                        horrible. I get it repeatedly like 
                        herpes. Which I don’t have.

                        You are an insane person.

                        Maybe. But, I’m also a chick who 
                        isn’t afraid of anything. 
                        Heartbreak though, scared the 
                        living daylights out of me. I’ve 
                        climbed Everest, swam with great 
                        white sharks, I don’t even flinch 
                        at popping a wheelie, but my break 
                        up? Paralyzed me. Getting rid of 
                        that cast is terrifying. But here 
                        you are willing to take care of 
                        it...I’m just saying. I think I 
                        can start moving on. 

           Willhemina fidgets for a moment.

                        That’s all. It was really nice 
                        catching up with you, Lucy. Poke 
                        me sometime. 

           Lucy watches her walk down the street for a moment. 

                                 LUCY
                        Willhemina! Wait! 

           Lucy fishes through her box and pulls out a pen and a 
           paper. Willhemina turns. Lucy runs down the street and 
           catches up to her.

                        write it down, right here. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY 

           Lucy walks around the cast, examining it from all angles. 

           Finally she begins carefully constructing a little box 
           that looks like the CORNELL BOXES (made famous by artist 
           Joseph Cornell in the 1930s - google ‘em). Inside, 
           charmingly presented, Willhemina’s story, and her cast - 
           colorful, sweet - an ode to a relationship past. A piece 
           of art. As we hear;

                        Thanks to Willhemina, Lucy had the 
                        first item for her Museum of 
                        Broken Relationships. Though she 
                        had no boyfriend, and no job, and 
                        very hazy prospects for the 
                        future, Lucy was beginning a new 
                        collection. And that made her feel 
                        a little bit better. 

           Lucy places the box on the mantle, and takes a photo of 
           it. She immediately CREATES A MUSEUM BLOG - “THE MUSEUM 
           OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIP’S INAUGURAL ITEM!”

           With that, she steps back and admires her work. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - LATER

           Amanda comes home from a long day of work. She is always 
           carrying one million bags. Gym bag. Laptop bag. Case file 
           bag. Purse bag. She unloads. 

           She notices the cast in its LUCY BOX on the mantle. She 
           steps forward and takes a closer look, furrows her brow. 
           Then, at the top of her lungs a la Desi Arnaz; 

                                 AMANDA
                        Lucy! You got some splainin’ to

           INT. SPIN, PING PONG BAR - NIGHT 

           Lucy plays against both Amanda and Nadine in ping pong at 
           the same time. Two on one. She also holds a beer in one 
           hand. She is a very good ping pong player. 

                                 AMANDA
                        So let me get this straight. You 
                        started a Museum.

                        just go out and fuck a stranger 
                        like a normal person.

           The girls are now having drinks at the bar. There are 
           ping pong tables everywhere. Amanda looks around.

           Nadine looks around, taps the guy next to her on the 
           shoulder.

           The CAB GUY, NICK FRIEND, turns around, he is with his

                        Seems as if you two already know 
                        each other. That’s a plus. Nick, 
                        do you want to have sex with my

           Nadine grabs Amanda’s hand and walks away with Brady 
           trailing behind. Lucy is stuck with Nick.

                        No. Relationships require a long

           Lucy sits at a table as Nadine and Amanda play one 
           another in ping pong (poorly). Nick approaches with a 
           beer. He taps Lucy on the shoulder.

                        I mean, it’s a beer. If this were 
                        ancient times, it would be an 
                        olive branch. And I would be a

                        I’m between jobs. Well, actually, 
                        I just quit my job but I don’t 
                        have another job. So really 
                        there’s a job behind me but no job 
                        ahead of me so the term “between 
                        jobs” doesn’t really apply. 
                        Anyway, for the moment I am 
                        working on a little project. A

                        I think we ran into each other 
                        again for a reason. Plus a cynic 
                        is merely an idealist 
                        disappointed. I’m sure you’ll come 
                        across something to bring me.

           Nick looks at the napkin, on it, Lucy’s name, address, e-
           mail and phone number. 

                                 NICK
                        Is this a clever way of giving me 
                        your digits? 

                                 LUCY
                        I hate you. 

           Nick stuffs the napkin in his pocket and walks off.

           EXT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Nadine, Lucy and Amanda arrive home from their night out. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nick is an asshole. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, an asshole you gave our 
                        address to. What if he comes over 
                        in the night and cuts you up into 
                        little pieces and then cuts us up 
                        into little pieces? And then puts 
                        those little pieces in cement and 
                        then puts the cement in garbage 
                        bags and then puts those garbage 
                        bags in a body of water?  

                                 NADINE
                        You worry too much. 

           Outside their door is a package. It is addressed to Lucy, 
           she picks it up. 

                                 LUCY
                        Look. It’s from hermit Peter next 
                        door! 

                                 NADINE
                                 (Suggestive.)
                        He’s not that much of a hermit. 

           Lucy pulls a SEXY BLACK LACE BRA out of the package. 
           Suddenly a NOTE is pushed out from UNDER THE DOOR next 
           door. Lucy picks it up. 

                                 LUCY
                        He says it belonged to a girl who 
                        he always thought was out of his 
                        league. He was constantly trying 
                        to convince himself that she was 
                        brilliant.

                        That they had a lot in common. But 
                        - they really only had her hotness 
                        in common. 

           Lucy holds up the bra. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Ironically, she left behind 
                        evidence to that fact. 

           Nadine snatches the bra. 

                                 NADINE
                        This is nice. Can I have it?

                        First of all it’s for the Museum. 
                        And second of all ewww it belonged 
                        to someone else. 

                                 NADINE
                        Yeah. It’s vintage. 

           Lucy snatches it back.

                        I’m sure it’s just a fluke. I’m 
                        sure this is the last item I’ll

           INT. NICK AND BRADY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           The apartment is sparse. A stark contrast to Lucy’s. 
           There are electronics. And a couch. And some books.

           Brady plays Madden or Halo or Call of Duty or one of 
           those lame games that boys play. Nick messes around on 
           his computer. 

                                 BRADY
                                 (To the screen.)
                        I am going to crush you like Rex 
                        Ryan crushes a foot long Subway 
                        Club. 

                                 NICK
                        I would estimate that 30 percent 
                        of all my meals originate at 
                        Subway. 

                                 BRADY
                        Double meat, bro. 

           A mussed, pixie-ish, cute girl exits Nick’s bedroom. This 
           is ELLA, 24. She is Nick’s last night. She is very short 
           and tiny. Ella stretches. 

                                 ELLA
                        Mornin’. 

           Nick barely looks up from his computer.

           Nick keeps playing on Facebook or whatever. Brady looks

                        What are you doing? 

           Nick doesn’t look up.

                                 NICK
                        I guess. 

           Ella registers his disinterest. 

                                 ELLA
                        I better go. Marlene and Rick are 
                        probably worried about me. 

           Nick barely glances up.

                                 NICK
                        Who are Marlene and Rick? 

                                 ELLA
                        My parents. 

           Nick looks up suddenly. 

                                 NICK
                        Your parents? 

                                 ELLA
                        I mean, I’m sixteen. I told them I 
                        was sleeping at my friend Dylan’s 
                        house. Dylan’s a girl.  

           Ella get up off the couch and stretches. Gathers her 
           belongings. 

                                 NICK
                        WHAT?

           Ella nods, serious. 

                                 ELLA
                        I can’t wait to tell everyone 
                        about my first time. It was so 
                        much better than Bieber fever. 

           Nick is apoplectic. 

           Ella begins walking away. She reaches the doorknob, grabs 
           the handle and smiles over her shoulder. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Just kidding. But next time you 
                        see someone’s vagina, you should 
                        work on your morning after 
                        etiquette. Have a nice day. 

           With that, she walks out of the apartment. The guys are 
           silent for a moment. 

                                 BRADY
                        Woah. Lesson learned.

                        That was different. They usually 
                        like you back. 

                                 NICK
                        So?

                        back since Chloe-

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - 
           NIGHT 

           Lucy sits cross legged in the middle of her living room, 
           surrounded by items. She busies herself making boxes ad 
           sorting through them. The boxes are stacked on top of 
           each other, lining the walls. 

           Amanda enters the apartment, sits on the couch, 
           exhausted.

                        Some of these stories are cray 
                        cray. Listen to this. 

           Lucy picks up a bottle of champagne and reads from her 
           laptop - citing the blog entry that goes with it. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        My ex-boyfriend and I met on New 
                        Year’s Eve. Fitting for the 
                        beginning of a relationship - 
                        hopeful, exciting. But, Mark and I 
                        started off all wrong. We stole 
                        this bottle of champagne. We 
                        weren’t interested in resolutions. 
                        In fact, we stole three bottles of 
                        champagne. When we were too drunk 
                        and barefoot, this one remained. 
                        We resolved to drink it together, 
                        the next year. But Mark wasn’t 
                        very good at staying put. And 
                        though I’ve often found myself 
                        drinking alone lately, this 
                        bottle, is the one I can’t bring 
                        myself to open. 

           Lucy looks distraught.

                        I really proved you wrong. People -

                        strangers lining up to bring me 
                        stuff. That’s gotta mean 
                        something, right? Bring me your 
                        poor, your tired, your huddled 
                        break up masses! There’s something 
                        communal about this. Something 
                        big.  

           Amanda smiles, fiddles with her engagement ring.

                                 AMANDA
                        Still in Japan. Still being mogul-
                        like. Still talking on a very tiny 
                        cell phone. 

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know how you do it. He’s 
                        so far away. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t mind. This way he can’t 
                        hold my hand on the street. Which 
                        gives me hives.  

                                 LUCY
                        Right. 

           Lucy goes back to working.

                        Hey Luce - if Max Frank begged for 
                        your forgiveness tomorrow would 
                        you take him back? 

                                 LUCY
                        Maybe. If he made a really good 
                        case. Is that pathetic? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Absolutely. 

                                 LUCY
                        Yeah. I thought so.

           Nick sits at his desk sketching a BUILDING - beautiful, 
           elegant, cool, interesting. It’s very good. Next to him 
           his cell phone begins ringing. The screen reads:

           Crumples up the drawing. Throws it away.

           Nadine walks up and down the line checking everyone out. 
           She stops in front of a TIMID GUY holding a CHEAP

           EXT. FLATIRON BUILDING - DAY 

           Nick leads a tour of people on a beautiful, sunny day. 
           They are old people and young people. Not tourists. New 
           Yorkers who want to know more about their city. He 
           gesticulates towards the Flatiron building. 

                                 NICK
                        Great buildings contradict 
                        everything else. They make us 
                        think. They start conversations. 

           He looks over to an OLD LADY with glasses. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Rose, seriously. Stop interrupting 
                        me. One more time and I will put 
                        you in a headlock.   

           The tour laughs - oh he’s charming. Oh they love him. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        The Flatiron building, initially 
                        named the Fuller building, is 
                        exactly that. Completed in 1902, 
                        it was designed by the Chicago 
                        school’s Daniel Burnham as a 
                        vertical Renaissance palazzo with 
                        Beaux-Arts styling. When Alfred 
                        Stieglitz, the photographer mused 
                        on it he said it appeared to be 
                        moving toward like the bow of a 
                        monster ocean steamer – a picture 
                        of a new America still in the 
                        making. But I like the building 
                        because when a wind comes from the 
                        north it whips around the building 
                        creating currents on either side, 
                        and very unpredictable ones at 
                        that. Back in the day, men would 
                        try and get peaks of women’s 
                        skirts that would be blown up by 
                        the breeze and the policemen 
                        trying to dissuade them would 
                        shout - 23 skidoo!

                        I knew my relationship was serious 
                        when my girlfriend wore her 
                        retainer to bed with me. She 
                        wasn’t embarrassed that she looked 
                        like a fourteen year old. Cause 
                        she knew I liked her anyway. Even 
                        though sometimes I felt like a 
                        pedophile.

                        My ex left this deodorant in my 
                        apartment when we broke up. I wore 
                        it for a month so I would smell 
                        like him. I can’t take a whiff of

                        loved her. Killing it would just 
                        be too cruel. Plus, I’m afraid it 
                        will bite me.

           The apartment is covered with people’s artifacts. You 
           have to climb over a mountain of heartbreak just to get 
           to the bathroom. 

           Nadine trips on a pile of stuff on her way to the kitchen 
           and falls flat on her face with a loud crash. Lucy and 
           Amanda emerge from their respective rooms. Lucy holds 
           some DRIED FLOWERS and A GOKU ACTION FIGURE- more items.

                        with all this stuff? 

           Lucy considers this question, sits down on the couch. The 
           girls look at her expectantly. 

                                 LUCY
                        I mean, people can read the

                        blog but - I don’t know - it feels 
                        like all these things deserve 
                        more. People should be able to see 
                        all of this - touch the items. 
                        Read the stories. Every item just 
                        feels like it’s so emblematic of 
                        the relationship from which it 
                        came. I love that part. If people 
                        are lining up outside our door, 
                        don’t you think they’ll line up 
                        outside of an actual Museum?

                        should be displayed in a gallery 
                        space. It will be part therapy,

                        They will come. 

                                 AMANDA
                        They already have. 

           As if on cue, there is a knock at the door.

           Amanda yanks open the door - Nick stands on their welcome 
           mat.

                        Is this a bad time?

                        Perfect time.

                        Make yourself at home. 

           Nick enters gingery and the girls disappear into their 
           rooms.

                        When I was growing up we moved a 
                        lot. My father - he was a 
                        professor, in search of tenure. 
                        But not many people are interested 
                        in History of Swiss Military 
                        Uniforms. So he and I moved from 
                        small mediocre town to small 
                        mediocre town. Fayetville,

                        There’s no such thing as an

                        how was your day? That is the only 
                        conversation people end up having. 
                        But most days are just like the 
                        day before so what’s the point. 
                        Two, someone gets comfortable

           CLOSE ON A KEY; Lucy and Nick enter a horribly crappy 
           looking commercial space with a Real Estate Agent. Lucy 
           looks around disgusted, shakes her head and immediately 
           turns around and walks out. 

           ANOTHER HOVEL; Nick and Lucy stand outside a horrible 
           space - looking at the building. Lucy shakes her head. 
           Next to them, a lobster roll food truck pulls up. They 
           exchange a look-

           CLOSE ON A SCRABBLE PIECE; Nick and Lucy sit at a table

           piece to spell the word “THRUST” on a Scrabble Board.

           enter another COMMERCIAL SPACE for the MUSEUM. Lucy looks

           CRAPPY ROACH INFESTED BUILDING; Nick and Lucy exit a real 
           dump. Next door is a roller rink. They exchange a look.

                        And then maybe you can feel me up 
                        by the bathroom while the rest of 
                        the kids eat birthday cake.

                        But then you’d want to date me. 

                                 LUCY
                        I take offense to that. 

                                 NICK
                        Why? You are a commitment girl. 
                        Say it strong say it loud. I want 
                        a relationship and I’m proud. 

                                 LUCY
                        I can’t just have commitment-less 
                        sex. Fuck buddies?  The name alone 
                        makes me nervous.

                        It sounds like - hey let’s chest 
                        bump and then have sex. Great

                        I’m right.

                        So you’re saying you’ve never just 
                        fucked someone for a while. Cause 
                        it was convenient and available. 

           Lucy smiles. 

                                 LUCY
                        Not by choice. 

                                 NICK
                        Why? 

                                 LUCY
                        Because I’m just not that girl. 
                        Nadine, she’s that girl. Not me. 
                        I’ve seen that movie; at 
                        approximately 2 a.m. you get a 
                        text message and it reads “u out?” 
                        The person doesn’t even try and 
                        spell the whole word. Just the 
                        letter “u.” And then the next 
                        thing you know, you open your eyes 
                        and a drunk guy is squatting over 
                        you grunting and there’s a minimal 
                        chance you’re even cruising 
                        through the orgasm neighborhood. 
                        You’re not even orgasm adjacent. 
                        And once the Clit-Ship has sailed 
                        all you can think about is a 
                        grilled cheese sandwich and how 
                        that last tequila shot made you 
                        really hungry. So now you’re 
                        concentrating on not vomiting and 
                        trying to remember where the take-
                        out menus are. But despite all 
                        that, there’s a little part of you 
                        that maybe wants him to take you 
                        out to dinner and ask what your 
                        hobbies are. 

           At that moment “I’m Too Sexy for my Shirt” comes on. Lucy 
           smiles and spins in her skates.

           Lucy gyrates, slowly taking off her shirt - Nick is 
           enraptured - only to reveal - a tank top. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I am so too sexy for my shirt. 

           With that, she skates off. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lucy is in bed, sleeping. Nick is standing over her 
           holding a flashlight and a blindfold. Her eyes fly open.

                        I’m not one of those weird girls 
                        with a rape fantasy. 

                                 NICK
                        Good. Because this is a 
                        kidnapping. 

                                 LUCY
                        Why? 

                                 NICK
                        You’ll see. 

           Nick turns on some mysterious sounding music. 

                                 LUCY
                        What’s that for?

                        Kidnapping music. It’s necessary 
                        if this plan is to be airtight and 
                        unfold with Germanic precision. 

           Nick puts a blindfold on her. 
           INT. SPARSE LOWER EAST SIDE BUILDING - NIGHT

           The small gallery space is in a slightly rundown but 
           charming building, surrounded by new restaurants and 
           sweet boutiques. Lucy stands in the middle of an empty 
           space, shabby space blindfolded, Nick is next to her. 

                                 NICK
                        You can take off your blind fold.

                        It’s sparse. Too well lit for you 
                        to commit a violent crime.

           On the window is etched “THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN 
           RELATIONSHIPS.” She rushes over to the window. Looks at 
           Nick, looks at the window, can hardly believe her eyes. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nick! I can’t afford this! If I

                        other spots I definitely can’t 
                        afford this beautiful, bright 
                        thing. It’s exactly what I

                        told him about your predicament - 
                        and he said - it’s yours, for as 
                        long as you need it. 

                                 LUCY
                        That sounds suspiciously sugar-

           Lucy looks at him and suddenly, leaps into his arms. Nick

                        I told you. I don’t like stuff. 
                        Weighs you down. 

           She wanders into his bedroom. A bed. Made. Pristine. A 
           desk. A pile of papers on his desk. 

           Lucy gives Nick a devilish grin. She picks up the 
           envelope from the desk and begins removing pages, one at 
           a time, scattering them about the room, tossing them in 
           the air. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        This doesn’t bother me at all. 

           Lucy jumps into his bed. Messes up his sheets. Nick grabs 
           a pillow and wacks her with it. She squeals with delight. 
           She grabs the other and wacks him hard. Nick lands on the 
           bed. He grabs Lucy’s ankles and pulls her down next to 
           him. Pinning her down. 

                                 LUCY
                        Okay! I surrender.

           They are out of breath, lying next to one another - the 
           moment is charged. Could they, maybe? Make out? Instead; 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        But seriously, what’s with all the 
                        cold hard surfaces? 

                                 NICK
                        My Mom is essentially a pack rat.

                                 LUCY
                        Like me? 

                                 NICK
                        Way worse than you. I grew up in a 
                        house full of things. Every square 
                        inch. Covered. But among all that 
                        stuff she never really found what 
                        she was looking for. 

           Silence for a moment. Nick clears his throat. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I gotta drain my lizard. 

           Nick exits. Lucy, inevitably, begins to snoop. She opens 
           his nightstand drawers. Condoms. Lots and lots and lots 
           of condoms. Walks over to his desk. Opens a drawer. A 
           couple of pens, inside a desk organizer. Opens another 
           drawer. She finds a folder. Looks over her shoulder 
           quickly and opens it. Inside is DRAWING UPON DRAWING UPON 
           DRAWING of beautiful buildings - unique and stunning and 
           meticulous. At the back is a blank APPLICATION TO THE 
           YALE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE. Lucy looks at it 
           thoughtfully for a moment. 

           EXT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lucy, slightly drunk, but happy, hums a little tune as 
           she walks down the street, approaching her building. 

           She stops short. Max is sitting on her stoop. He sees her 
           and stands. 

                                 LUCY
                        Oh god. Is this part where you 
                        tell me you have one of the big 
                        STDs? 

                                 MAX
                        No. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 LUCY
                        Well, if you don’t have AIDS what 
                        are you doing here?

                                 MAX
                        I want you back. 

                                 LUCY
                        No. 

           She turns around, and walks up the steps. We know this is 
           very difficult for her, but she wills herself to go 
           inside. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - SAME

           Lucy unlocks the door. Nadine and Amanda are frantically 
           putting dozens and dozens of roses into vases, sinks, 
           anywhere they will fit. This combined with all the break 
           up artifacts has turned the apartment into complete and 
           utter chaos. 

           Nadine has a rose in her mouth, Amanda wears a bunch of 
           roses on her head like a crown. 

                                 LUCY
                        Rosencrantz! Guildenstern! What 
                        are you doing? 

                                 AMANDA
                        They’re for you. From Max Frank.

           Nadine spits like an old Italian Lady. 

                                 NADINE
                        Fongool! 

                                 AMANDA
                        They keep coming. Every fifteen 
                        minutes. They won’t stop. Make it 
                        stop. 

           Lucy furrows her brow. Turns around and walks out of the 
           apartment. 

           EXT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - SAME 

           Lucy comes downstairs holding a rose. Max is still 
           sitting on the stoop. 

                                 LUCY
                        I hate roses.

                        I think they’re for dead people 
                        and prom dates. 

                                 MAX
                        Okay. 

                                 LUCY
                        So, why are you sending me this 
                        vile blossom? 

                                 MAX
                        Lucy, I...I very much regret the 
                        way things uh, transpired between 
                        us. I treated you horribly-

                                 LUCY
                        Yes. Yes you did. 

                                 MAX
                        I’d like to make it up to you. 

                                 LUCY
                        Do I get to break up with you in a 
                        crowded room full of fancy 
                        strangers? 

           Max looks at her. He’s handsome. And she liked him for a 
           reason.  

                                 MAX
                        I was thinking a bout of intense 
                        and sincere groveling. Followed by 
                        dinner. An appetizer. An entree. 
                        If things go well, an optional 
                        dessert. 

                                 LUCY
                        What about Amelia? 

           Max looks away. 

                                 MAX
                        It didn’t work out. She wasn’t - 
                        she’s not. 

           He pauses, and then very sincerely. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        She’s not you.

                        I think the word you used was 
                        extraordinary. 

                                 MAX
                        I was wrong. I had extraordinary 
                        and I gave it up. I had you. 

           Lucy takes this in. 

                                 LUCY
                        Okay. Fine. Dinner. No dessert.

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON A TUBE OF LIP GLOSS; Lucy glosses her lips in a 
           hand mirror standing on her bed. Julian sits on the bed, 
           playing chess against himself. 

                                 LUCY
                        I am going to be cool and aloof. I 
                        will not succumb to slick lines or 
                        flirtatious arm touching. I will 
                        have only two glasses of wine. I 
                        will remain in platonia.

           Julian moves his chess pieces. 

                                 JULIAN
                        You’re going to get drunk and have 
                        sex with him. 

                                 LUCY
                        No way. Look. 

           She lifts her skirt revealing granny panties that are 
           yellowed with age, and hole-y. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Are those radioactive?  Did you 
                        pick them up last time you were 
                        doing laundry at a nursing home?  
                        Are you wearing dentures right 
                        now?  

           Lucy looks at him firmly. 

                                 LUCY
                        No sex with Max.

           Lucy and Max sit across from one another finishing an 
           amazing, expensive, fantastic dinner. 

                                 MAX
                        So can I interest you in dessert? 

                                 LUCY
                        You said dessert was optional. 

                                 MAX
                        And I’m giving you the option. To 
                        eat dessert and not desert me. 

                                 LUCY
                        Very clever. 

                                 MAX
                        I think they also happen to have 
                        your favorite dessert on the menu. 

                                 LUCY
                        This is a Michellin joint. I 
                        highly doubt that they serve 
                        Banana Cream Pie. 

                                 MAX
                        Care to place a wager on that? 

                                 LUCY
                        What did you do? 

           At that moment SUPERSTAR CHEF GUY (ERIC RIPERT) 
           approaches carrying two beautiful, towering banana cream 
           pies. Lucy looks at him mouth agape. He places one in 
           front of Max and one in front of Lucy. 

                                 ERIC RIPERT
                        I don’t often make made to order 
                        dishes. But my friend Max said 
                        this was a - how did you put it? 

                                 MAX
                        Life or death situation. Highly 
                        dramatic. If this goes poorly it 
                        could end like a Shakesperean 
                        tragedy.

                        Bon Appetit. 

           Lucy watches him go. She looks down at her pie, 
           delighted.

                        Well, one for you to eat, and the 
                        other for you to smash in my face. 
                        Because that is after all, what I 
                        deserve. 

           EXT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lucy stands on her stoop, pie leftovers in hand. Max 
           faces her for the goodbye moment. 

                                 LUCY
                        That was satisfactory. I had next 
                        to no fun at all. 

           Max takes the pie from her hands, places it on the steps 
           next to them. Then he takes her in his arms and gives her 
           the longest, loveliest most weak in the knees making 
           kiss. When they finish, she steadies herself. 

                                 MAX
                        Good night. 

           And with that he takes off walking down the street.

                                 (To herself. Sotto.)
                        I did not have sex with him! Woop 
                        woop! I did not have sex with him! 
                        I’ve got the power! 

           She does a little victory dance, raising her arms in the 
           air. Oblivious to everything. 

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Lucy? 

           Lucy turns around, caught. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I can hear you. 

           She blushes a deep red. Unlocks the door and rushes 
           inside, yelling over her shoulder;

                                 LUCY
                        Goodnight! 
           INT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - DAY 

           Lucy, Nick, Julian, Nadine and Amanda stand in the empty 
           space surrounding by ... Lucy’s boxes. All the break up 
           stuff that needs to be shelved and categorized and 
           displayed. 

           Lucy addresses them. 

                                 LUCY
                        We need categories. Like the Dewey

                        Okay. Stubs. That’s a category. 
                        Tickets are a big thing. Travel. 
                        Mix tapes. Ooh! First Meetings.

                        take that the other person doesn’t 
                        know about. 

           Nadine removes her watch and adds it to the pile.

           Lucy’s eyes are shining. 

                                 LUCY
                        Yes! All that stuff. 

           Nick clears his throat, speaks up. 

                                 NICK
                        What about, like, um, Moment of

                        Meaning? 

                                 NICK
                        Meaning, the first time you knew 
                        you were in love with someone. You 
                        know, if you kept anything, from 
                        like, that particular moment. 

                                 LUCY
                        Ladies and  gentlemen, I think 
                        Nicholas Friend might have a soul. 

           And with that, they begin working diligently, 
           categorizing items, placing them on shelves. 

           INT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Take out containers litter the floor. Lucy, Nick, Amanda, 
           Nadine, and Julian all look exhausted. But their work 
           seems done, the Museum’s shelves are lined with items and 
           their accompanying stories. 

           Suddenly Max appears at the door, he’s carrying a bag of 
           groceries.

                                 MAX
                        I came to help, but it seems your 
                        work here is done. 

           Everyone turns to see him. 

                                 NICK
                        Convenient. 

                                 MAX
                        But I come bearing celebratory 
                        libations. 

           He pulls out a bottle of champagne and glasses from the 
           grocery bag. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Shall we make a toast? 

           Nick, feeling confrontational steps up. 

                                 NICK
                        Hey man, I’m Nick. 

                                 MAX
                        Well, Nick, I am Max Frank, I’m 
                        Lucy’s boyfriend.

                                 NICK
                        Didn’t know Lucy had one of them. 

                                 LUCY
                        Neither did I. Don’t I get a say 
                        in the matter? 

           Max pauses, turns to Lucy, dramatically. 

                                 MAX
                        Lucy Vaughn Gulliver resident of 
                        New York City, of no providence, 
                        of much wit, of great beauty, will 
                        you be my girlfriend? 

           Lucy thinks for a moment. 

                                 LUCY
                        Maybe. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        On a trial basis. 

                                 MAX
                        That’s good enough for me. 

           Nadine and Amanda give Lucy a look. “Boyfriend?” Amanda 
           mouths. Nick looks uncomfortable. Lucy shrugs and begins 
           distributing glasses and pouring champagne. Max raises 
           his glass. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Lucy, I would like to make a toast 
                        to your first lead exhibit at the 
                        Metropolitan Museum of Art.  

                                 LUCY
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 MAX
                        If you’ll have us, the Met would 
                        like to sponsor the Museum of 
                        Broken Relationships as its first 
                        ever satellite exhibit. 

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t know what to say. 

                                 NICK
                        Say no. 

                                 NADINE
                        Woah. Burn. 

           Max ignores Nick. He turns back to Lucy.

                                 MAX
                        Lucy, when you were at the Met, I 
                        never gave you the opportunity to 
                        be you - in the deepest of senses. 
                        Your ideas never got the credit 
                        you deserve. And then you left. 

                                 LUCY
                        I left because you were having sex 
                        with me and also-

                                 MAX
                        I know. 

                                 JULIAN
                        We all know. 

                                 MAX
                        Look, Lucy - all of New York 
                        deserves to see this place. The 
                        whole world even - the Met can 
                        help you do that. You have the 
                        support of the board, the 
                        trustees...me. The Met needs 
                        voices like yours. We need you. 

           Max looks at Lucy. A moment, as she considers this. 

                                 LUCY
                        Can I think about it? 

                                 MAX
                        Don’t think too long. The 
                        opportunity might pass you by. 

           Everyone is now standing around with their champagne 
           glasses. Unsure of what to do next. Nick is texting on 
           his phone. Homeboy is checked out. 

           Max raises his glass, and turns to the group. Nick 
           continues on his phone. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        To the Museum of Broken 
                        Relationships. 

           Lucy raises hers along with the others, save for Nick. 

                                 LUCY
                        May you be more successful than 
                        the sum of your relationship 
                        parts. 

           Nick isn’t paying any attention.

           Lucy leans in to him. 

                                 LUCY
                        You okay?

           They clink glasses.

                        You go on with your bad hoarder

                        I think we’re open for business. 

           She turns to look at the door, willing someone to enter.

                        Holy fuck. 

           INT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - DAY 

           Lucy sits behind a desk constructing a BREAK UP BOX. The 
           door to the Museum opens and a little bell rings. Lucy 
           doesn’t look up from her work. 

                                 LUCY
                        Be with you in a moment!

                        Well I should certainly hope so. 

           Lucy looks up, startled.

                        about you, is about to hear about 
                        you. 

           Lucy blushes.

                        I’ve gathered a few break up items 
                        over the years you know. And I 
                        carefully considered which to 
                        bring. I’ve got eggs of the 
                        Faberge persuasion and diamonds as 
                        big as baby fists- 

                                 LUCY
                        But you probably need to hang on 
                        to those. 

                                 EVA
                        Precisely. Anyhow, I thought this 
                        was more fitting. 

           Eva opens her hand and reveals an unopened fortune

                        There used to be this restaurant 
                        on 61st street named Gino’s. It 
                        isn’t there anymore, but it was a 
                        gem of spot. All the greats would 
                        eat there, Tony Bennett, Frank 
                        Sinatra, yours truly...The 
                        wallpaper was hideous - bright red 
                        with zebras on it.

                        But the food was divine and there 
                        was vodka in the martinis. Gino’s 
                        was classically New York. Anyhow, 
                        they would always give out fortune 
                        cookies for desert. Don’t ask me 
                        why - it was an Italian 
                        restaurant. Anyhow, I dated a 
                        lovely boy - at that time I was 
                        still just a girl so he was a boy - 
                        and we would eat there every 
                        Sunday night. I would have the 
                        linguini with clams and he would 
                        feast on the meatballs. I was 
                        working in the hosiery department 
                        at Wolworth’s at the time, and one

                        particularly horrific week of sock 
                        sorting, our fortunes came. I was 
                        just miserable and that night he 
                        told me that if I ever needed a 
                        little hope I should open up the 
                        fortune cookie - but I shouldn’t 
                        waste it if I didn’t need it. His 
                        mother hated me, and eventually, 
                        mothers always win - so there you 
                        have it. I was history, but I kept 
                        the cookie. 

                                 LUCY
                        I will display it proudly. 

           Lucy sets it down on the desk, carefully. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

                        You know, I’ve fallen in love many 
                        times, and each time it seems, 
                        heartbreak is just as devastating 
                        as the last time. But love, my 
                        dear, love is worth it. If you 
                        know he’s incapable of breaking 
                        your heart he isn’t worth his 
                        weight in salt. The one who can 
                        break your heart but doesn’t - 
                        that’s the one. 

                                 LUCY
                        How do you know when you’ve found 
                        him?

                                 LUCY
                        Time is annoying. 

                                 EVA
                        I know. And the more it passes the 
                        more well acquainted my breasts 
                        become with my bellybutton. 

           Lucy giggles. The bell of the Museum rings again and Max 
           enters with a CHRIS RESOR, 35. 

                                 MAX
                        Eva! What are you doing here? 

                                 EVA
                        I was just admiring this little 
                        place. 

           She winks at Lucy. Max stands next to Lucy and puts his 
           arm around her. 

                                 LUCY
                        Thank you again. 

                                 EVA
                        Anytime. And don’t you forget what 
                        I said. 

           And with that she walks out of the Museum in a swirl of 
           perfume and diamonds. Max turns to Lucy. 

                                 MAX
                        Fancy company you keep.

                        I roll deep. 

                                 MAX
                        Right. 

           Max turns to Chris.

                        Lucy, I want you to meet my friend 
                        Chris. Chris writes for New York 
                        Magazine. 

                                 LUCY
                        Oooh! I love that magazine. My 
                        lifelong dream is to fall into the 
                        Lowbrow but Brilliant box of the 
                        Approval Matrix.

                        How about the Highbrow but 
                        Brilliant box? We’d like to do a 
                        story about the Museum of Broken 
                        Relationships. Max has told me all 
                        about it. 

           Lucy looks at Max incredulous. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’d like to think I have a 
                        highbrow but brilliant box. 

           Chris laughs. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Do you also have a card? I’d like 
                        to be in touch this week. 

                                 LUCY
                        No, but I can write my phone 
                        number on your hand with a pen. 

                                 CHRIS
                        That’s so sixth grade. 

           Lucy grabs a pen off her desk and writes on Chris hand. 

                                 CHRIS (CONT’D)
                        We’ve made it official. 

                                 LUCY
                        Very. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Alright. I’m off. I have to go 
                        follow the Gossip Girl kids 
                        around. But I will be in touch. 

           With that Chris exits. Lucy beams at Max. 

                                 MAX
                        Drink? 

                                 LUCY
                        ABSOLUTELY. 

           EXT. STANDARD GRILL - EVENING

           Lucy and Max drink cocktails - it’s a gorgeous New York 
           evening in that gorgeous New York way. Lucy is wearing a 
           fashionable hat.

                        So talk to me about your chapeau. 

           Max takes a drink, his eyes teasing her. 

                                 LUCY
                        It’s very chic. All the chic girls 
                        are wearing them. 

                                 MAX
                        And you are one of said chic 
                        girls? 

                                 LUCY
                        The chic-iest. Look at me. I’m on 
                        a rooftop. My drink has an egg 
                        white in it and muddled fruits. I 
                        should have a yacht. Except I have 
                        no money. I am pauvre-chic. 

           Max looks at Lucy a moment. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 MAX
                        I’m just looking at you. 

                                 LUCY
                        Why? 

                                 MAX
                        The chic girls don’t ask why. 

                                 LUCY
                        Sorry. 

           Max laughs, then grows serious. 

                                 MAX
                        Lucy, when I took on the 
                        directorship of the Met, I 
                        promised to shake up the Museum. 
                        You need money. I need you. Let me 
                        help you. Let’s make the Museum of 
                        Broken Relationships a special 
                        exhibit for the Met - I can 
                        attract donors. I can attract the 
                        money. I can attract press. You 
                        just concentrate on doing what you 
                        do best.

                                 LUCY
                        Which is?

                        Being a visionary. Well, that, and 
                        charming the pants off people. 

           Max pretends to go for his belt buckle and undo his 
           pants. Lucy smiles, but then gets serious. 

                                 LUCY
                        I don’t need you to save me. I 
                        wanted to do this on my own. This 
                        place is my life. I built it out 
                        of my own craziness and addiction. 

           She shrugs. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        It’s me.   

                                 MAX
                        I’m not saving you. I want to be 
                        your partner. Haven’t I proven 
                        myself worthy of that? 

           Lucy looks away, thinking. Max takes her face in his 
           hands. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Bug, let me do this. It’s still 
                        yours. It will always be yours. 

                                 LUCY
                        Okay. Partners. 

           Max extends a hand, Lucy puts hers in his to shake it and 
           he pulls her in for a kiss.

                                 MAX
                        Now you know the first order of 
                        Museum business must be an 
                        opening. We need a real launch. 

                                 LUCY
                        Claro. 

           She thinks for a moment. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        We should throw a Broken Hearts 
                        Ball. It’ll be like - the inverse

                        Plain, brick, charming to be sure,

                        During prohibition there was a 
                        speakeasy- right here - whose back 
                        door was 86 Bedford Street. And 
                        every time a patron got a little 
                        too tipsy - the bartender would 
                        throw him out the back door. He 
                        would 86 him. Hence the term-

                        Sure.

                        How come you never became an 
                        architect? 

           Nick starts walking down the street. Lucy keeps pace.

                                 NICK
                        I’m not good enough. 

                                 LUCY
                        How do you know?

                        I do.

                        But how? 

           Nick stops. Faces Lucy.

                        Chloe and I applied to graduate 
                        programs at the same time. We 
                        thought we’d open up a firm 
                        together. That was the dream. I 
                        desperately wanted to go to Yale - 
                        Elliot Stern, my idol taught 
                        there. Chloe got in everywhere. 
                        And I got in nowhere.

                        mentoring her. Specifically, in

           Lucy and Nick walk a couple paces in silence.

           Brady sits on the couch, uncomfortably - across from a 
           girl. This is CHLOE, 30, aka. THE MURDEROUS WHORE. 

                                 BRADY
                        So Libya, huh? Shit is crazy over

                        You’re really missing out. 

           The front door opens and Nick enters. As soon as his eyes 
           land on Chloe he stiffens, turns to Brady.

                        She’s very stealth. Like a jaguar 
                        or a hippo. Which is a 
                        surprisingly fast animal.

                        Nick, I’ve tried calling you.

                        And I haven’t answered, which, in

                        When I told you three years ago I 
                        never wanted to see you again, I 
                        meant it. 

           A long pause.

                        Nick, Elliot and I are engaged. We

                        to tell you myself. 

           Nicks face reveals no emotion. Chloe clears her throat.

                        true moral character. 

           Nick walks into his bedroom and slams the door. A beat.

                        So? Logjammers? 

           EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

           Lucy waits outside of the giant front doors. Nick arrives 
           breathless, lookin’ disheveled. Late. 

                                 LUCY
                        Everything okay?

                        Yeah fine. Great. 

           Lucy gives him a suspicious look. 

                                 LUCY
                        If you say so.

           Lucy and Nick wander through the huge arches - it is 
           completely empty save for them.

           They get to an intersection at the Museum in the hallway.

           Lucy takes off running. Nick sprints after her. 

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

           Lucy stands with Nick in the roped off section of the 
           Museum where the Art and Love exhibit is to open in a 
           couple of weeks. 

           EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY HER VISION - against the wall, 
           displayed like a SALON. 

                                 LUCY
                        Seems like now that I’m gone 
                        they’re finally taking my advice 
                        around here. 

           Lucy shakes her head.

                        Weird. 

           She walks slowly through the exhibit, Nick follows, 
           watching her. Lucy ends up in front of Aphrodite.

                        Now this is my favorite piece. 
                        Aphrodite. The Aphrodite statue by 
                        Praxiteles was the first 
                        monumental nude in classic 
                        sculpture. And since then there 
                        have been many more in Aphrodite’s 
                        image. But that she was the first, 
                        it makes me imagine that she was 
                        somehow irresistible to men. They 
                        would take great risk for her, or 
                        something. Because every woman 
                        wants to be the exception to the 
                        rule. You know? 
                                 (Beat.)
                        See how her hand is placed that 
                        way covering her...vag. 

           Lucy grins. But is quickly serious again. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        She’s reserved but it also draws 
                        your attention towards her. She’s 
                        the first and ultimate seductress. 
                        Its this incredible intersection 
                        of power and modesty. I guess 
                        that’s love’s power. The ability 
                        to make you feel completely 
                        insecure but also totally 
                        invincible.

           Nick watches Lucy as she speaks. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I sound ridiculous. 

                                 NICK
                        No. You sound brilliant.

           Nick takes a step towards her. Lucy takes a deep breath. 

                                 LUCY
                        This is art because it’s beautiful 
                        and it’s historic and it makes us 
                        feel things. It provides context. 
                        It makes us understand what the 
                        world once was. Who people were. 
                        That is the downfall of the human 
                        condition. We are obsessed with 
                        ourselves. 

           Nick takes another step towards her. Lucy is visibly 
           nervous. They are close.

                        The things that line the shelves 
                        of my museum, they are everyday 
                        items. But to someone that ticket 
                        stub, that old book, that 
                        retainer, along the way it became 
                        beautiful, it took on meaning and 
                        thus it somehow became art. You 
                        know what I mean? 

           Nick nods. Lucy looks up at him. The moment is charged. 

           And then Nick kisses her. Uncertain at first but then 
           they are stumbling around, knocking into thousand year 
           old statues and artifacts and then they’re on the floor 
           and then they’re like, totally doing it.  

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATER 

           Nick and Lucy lie on their backs, post coital, in that 
           room with the glass ceiling where you can see out to 
           Central Park and it’s so cool. They are covered in a 
           large tarp-cloth type thing that they have in museums to 
           drape over stuff.

                                 LUCY
                        We did. 

                                 NICK
                        And we totally did it at the Met.

                                 LUCY
                        We did. 

           Lucy nestles into him and lets her eyes close for just a 
           moment, feeling very happy. 

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - AN HOUR LATER 

           Lucy sleeps on the floor of the Met. 

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Lucy?

           CONTINUED:

           She stirs. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Lucy!  Wake up! 

           Lucy’s eyes flutter open. She’s confused for a moment. 
           Looks around. No Nick. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Lucy, what are you doing sleeping 
                        on the floor covered in a tarp? 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m not entirely sure. 

                                 MAX
                        Well you shouldn’t be napping at 
                        the Met when the Broken Hearts 
                        Ball is in less than forty eight 
                        hours. 

                                 LUCY
                        Right. Yeah. 

           Max checks his watch. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You took my advice on the display. 

                                 MAX
                        What? 

                                 LUCY
                        The salon display - for Art and 
                        Love? 

                                 MAX
                        I guess I did. Alright, I have 
                        some things to take care of here. 
                        Dinner later, you muskrat? 

           Lucy nods, clears her throat. 

                                 LUCY
                        Sure. 

           Max walks off, leaving a bewildered Lucy in his wake. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY 

           Nadine and Amanda are at their usual place on the couch, 
           drinkin.’ Lucy enters, exhausted from her day. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LUCY
                        Do you two ever plan on leaving 
                        the couch? Are you sutured to it? 

                                 NADINE
                        Not if we can help it. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Where did you learn that word? 
                        Grey’s Anatomy? 

                                 LUCY
                        Shut up. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What’s your problem? You’re acting 
                        like you just came from getting 
                        your sass waxed. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nick and I slept together and Max 
                        is my boyfriend and I’m all kinds 
                        of confused.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Ooh! 

                                 NADINE
                        Finally! I thought you were 
                        getting thee to a nunnery.  

                                 LUCY
                        No. Bad. Now I’m riding the whore 
                        carousel. I’m just another one of 
                        the girls in the slut parade. We 
                        slept together and then he 
                        disappeared. He Houdinied me.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Wanna talk about it? 

                                 LUCY
                        Not really. 

           Amanda pours a glass of wine and extends it to Lucy. Lucy 
           joins the girls on the couch, very relieved to have her 
           friends in this moment. 

           INT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Lucy and Max are bent over a list of VIP donor types 
           coming to Broken Hearts Ball.

                        So we’ve got the Astors, the 
                        Tisches, and the Trainas.  

           Lucy nods, not really paying attention. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Do you think you could muster some 
                        sort of enthusiasm? 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sorry. I am. Just distracted. 
                        Stress.  

                                 MAX
                        Lucy, the enormity of this - I 
                        understand, it’s staggering. The 
                        Met’s first satellite exhibit - in 
                        it’s history. This is monumental - 
                        for you, for me, for both of us. 
                        Embrace it. 

           Lucy feigns enthusiasm. Throws her hands in the air. 

                                 LUCY
                        Woo. Excitement. Woo. 

           Max laughs. Takes her in his arms. 

                                 MAX
                        That’s the kind of spirit I’m 
                        talking about. Perhaps we can 
                        rustle up some sort of cheer squad 
                        uniform. Pom poms, perhaps?  Tube 
                        socks? 

                                 LUCY
                        Gross. 

           Max kisses her. She lets him. She kisses him back. We 
           pull back to reveal;  

           EXT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Outside, we see Nick, standing in front of the Museum, 
           the TEAPOT shaped as THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING in his 
           hands. He looks stricken. 

           INT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Lucy looks up to see Nick.

           She heads for the door. 

           EXT. THE MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Lucy comes outside. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nick- 

           Nick hands her the teapot. 

                                 NICK
                        Just wanted to give you this. 
                        Found it in an antique shop. I’ll 
                        catch you later. 

           With that he turns around and leaves. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nick! 

           He doesn’t turn. Just keeps walking. 

           EXT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Max joins Lucy. They look at each other for a moment. 

                                 MAX
                        You don’t need him. You have me. 

           Lucy nods, but she seems unsure. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS

           Lucy wanders around New York at dusk, losing herself in 
           the city. New York I Love You, But You’re Bringing me 
           Down by LCD Soundsystem plays.

           INT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - THE NEXT NIGHT

           A huge banner hangs over the Museum that says “BROKEN 
           HEARTS BALL” - a giant broken heart sits in the middle of 
           the Museum. It is red and glowing and beautiful. It looks 
           as if it’s almost beating. 

           The Museum is crowded with people. It is a very 
           glittering crowd. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           EVERYONE who has EVER DONATED to the Museum is also there 
           - BEANIE BABY LOTHARIO GUY, RETAINER GUY, WILLHEMINA, 
           HERMIT PETE FROM NEXT DOOR - Etc. Etc. Etc. 

           Max shmooozes with folk. In the corner is an EASEL 
           covered with a CLOTH. 

           Lucy is wearing a gorgeous red dress with a full skirt. 
           She is beautiful and in every way, the belle of the ball. 

           She stands with Nadine and Amanda in a corner, sipping 
           drinks and surveying the scene. 

                                 NADINE
                        I can’t believe you turned your 
                        crazy into this. 

                                 LUCY
                        I know. My crazy is beautiful. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It really is. 

           At that moment Nick approaches. There is a tall, leggy, 
           sulky girl on his arm. This is GISELE, 21. 

                                 LUCY
                        Nick! Hi! You came! 

           Then she notices Gisele. 

                                 NICK
                        This is Gisele. 

           Gisele extends a limp hand, presumably, to shake. Nick is 
           showing her off. Lookin’ all smug and shit. 

                                 GISELE
                        Ciao. 

                                 LUCY
                        Pleasure is all mine. 

                                 NADINE
                        And mine. 

                                 AMANDA
                        And mine. 

           They all stand around for a moment. 

                                 GISELE
                        I’m bored.

                        Let’s get you a drink. 

           Gisele nods. They walk off. Lucy watches them go. 

                                 NADINE
                        Well you can lead a whore to 
                        culture but you can’t make her 
                        think. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Her handshake felt like a bag of 
                        limp dicks. 

                                 LUCY
                        Do you think I would be hotter if 
                        I just stopped smiling? Why are 
                        the hot girls so pouty?  

                                 AMANDA
                        Because they’re trying to turn 
                        their brains on and they can’t 
                        figure out how. 

                                 NADINE
                        She wasn’t hot. She had legs up to 
                        my armpits but a horse face. She 
                        looks like Seabiscuit’s cousin. 

                                 LUCY
                        Thank you. For that. I’m going to 
                        go find Max. 

           Lucy weaves her way through the crowd. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM: 

           Nick watches Lucy for a moment. But then quickly turns 
           his attention back to Gisele. 

                                 GISELE
                        Any time you want a blow job, just 
                        tell me. 

                                 NICK
                        Pardon? 

                                 GISELE
                        Should we make up a signal? Like 
                        in baseball? 

           Gisele tugs her ear twice. And then taps herself on the 
           head once. 

           NEAR THE BROKEN HEART:

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Lucy watches Nick and Gisele. The moment Max stops 
           schmoozing she wraps her arms around him. He kisses her 
           for a moment. She hopes Nick is watching. 

                                 MAX
                        This is a huge success! Donations 
                        are pouring it! I’m going to have 
                        a banner year! 

                                 LUCY
                        Congratulations to us. 

                                 MAX
                        Alright - more noses to brown and 
                        elbows to rub. I need to make the 
                        rounds. 

           Lucy nods. Shoots another look in Nick’s direction. 

                                 LUCY
                        Of course. May I have another kiss 
                        first? 

                                 MAX
                        Anything for you, partner. 

           Lucy plants one on Max like it’s the last kiss of her 
           life.

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR: 

           Nick sees the kiss as he and Gisele dance. Gisele is one 
           of those models that dances like she’s having an 
           epileptic seizure. She looks like she’s in a trance. 

                                 NICK
                        Gisele. 

           Gisele keeps dancing. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        GISELE! 

           She opens her eyes and grins. 

                                 GISELE
                        Are you mad that I took ecstacy 
                        before I came here? 

                                 NICK
                        Um. I guess it’s a little 
                        unconventional.
                                 (Beat.)
                        Do you wanna get outta here? 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

           Gisele tugs her ear twice and pats herself on the head. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. I guess I could go for one 
                        of those. 

           Gisele grabs his hand and leads him towards the door. 

           AT A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP DISPLAY:

           Lucy stands at the shelves looking at some of the boxes 
           she’s made. Its her party and she’ll cry if she wants to. 
           She looks across the room to see Nick leaving with 
           Gisele. 

                                 JULIAN (O.S.)
                        Go talk to him. 

           Lucy turns. 

                                 LUCY
                        He’s leaving. With the Gazelle 
                        with the rack.  

                                 JULIAN
                        Lucy, I told you to roar, you 
                        roared. All these people, are here 
                        because of a little idea that you 
                        had that got bigger and bigger. If 
                        that doesn’t make you grow some 
                        balls and chase him, I don’t know 
                        what will. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        P.S., you’ve never looked better. 

                                 LUCY
                        You really know how to talk to a 
                        lady. 

                                 JULIAN
                        I know. 

           She heads towards the door. 

           EXT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT 

           Lucy exits the Museum. Nick and Gisele are halfway down 
           the block. 

                                 LUCY
                        NICK!!

           He turns. Gives Gisele the wait a minute sign and walks 
           towards Lucy. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NICK
                        Sorry we gotta go. Congratulations 
                        again. Enjoy your party. 

                                 LUCY
                        Really? That’s it? You got 
                        nothing? 

           It’s starts to rain a little. I know, I know. But this is 
           the part where it has to rain. 

                                 NICK
                        I know what I saw last night. I 
                        don’t think there’s anything else 
                        to say. 

                                 LUCY
                        That’s insane. Because I’ve gotta 
                        lot of shit to say. You walked out 
                        on me. We slept together and then 
                        you disappeared. Which also 
                        happens to be your move. So I 
                        guess I’m the idiot because I 
                        convinced myself that I was 
                        somehow different. 

                                 NICK
                        Can’t a dude just be confused for 
                        a second. We’ve become such a good 
                        friends and sex just changes 
                        things. And Chloe told me she got 
                        engaged and the next thing I knew 
                        we were - and things got out of 
                        hand. And I bolted. 

           Lucy lets this information sink in. 

                                 LUCY
                        Ohmygod. Chloe got engaged, you 
                        freaked out and needed to stick 
                        your dick in something and I was 
                        at the wrong place at the right 
                        time.  

                                 NICK
                        That’s not true. 

                                 LUCY
                        It’s completely true. You are a 
                        tiny little man. 

           Lucy turns to walk away. 

                                 NICK
                        I regret ever having helped you.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Lucy turns back, opens her purse and pulls out an 
           ACCEPTANCE LETTER from the YALE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE 
           and throws it at Nick. 

                                 LUCY
                        Well, that makes two of us. 

           With that Lucy turns around and storms back into the 
           Museum. 

           INT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - NIGHT

           Lucy re-enters the Museum, she’s wet from the rain. 
           Nadine, Amanda and Julian spot her and begin making their 
           way towards her, flutes of champagne in their hands, 
           Nadine carries two. At the same time, Max makes his way 
           towards her. Max reaches her first. 

           Max approaches and through clenched teeth; 

                                 MAX
                        Where the hell were you? 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m so sorry. 

                                 MAX
                        Get it together. 

           Lucy nods. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m back. I’m in there like 
                        swimwear. 

                                 MAX
                        Excellent. It’s speech time. Wish 
                        me luck. 

                                 LUCY
                        You don’t need it. 

           Max kisses her cheek and grabs a glass of champagne from 
           the bar, and walks off. Lucy smooths her hair. 

           Nadine, Amanda and Julian arrive. Nadine hands her a 
           glass of champagne. Lucy gulps it down. 

                                 JULIAN
                        So it went well with Nick huh? 

           Lucy wipes her mouth and shakes her head.

           CONTINUED:

                                 AMANDA
                        Don’t let him and that lollipop 
                        head ruin your night. 

                                 JULIAN
                        No way no ho. 

                                 NADINE
                        What’s wrong with M. Frank? 

                                 LUCY
                        I think he’s just stressed about 
                        his speech. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Chin up sister. This night is 
                        about you. 

                                 LUCY
                        Yes. Glass half full, glass half 
                        full. 

           Nadine switches glasses with her. 

                                 NADINE
                        Yours was empty. 

           The girls share a smile. 

           NEAR THE BROKEN HEART:

           Max stands in front of the crowd, next to the easel and 
           clinks his flute of champagne. The crowd hushes. 

                                 MAX
                        Hello everyone! Hello! Welcome! 

           The crowd is quiet, and gathers around Max. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I will keep this brief - as 
                        brevity is the soul of a good 
                        speech. 

           The crowd chuckles. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to welcome you all to 
                        what is a truly exceptional 
                        exhibit. 
                                 (MORE)

                        I encourage you to take your time 
                        as you explore it -  - the Met has 
                        never done an exhibit of this sort 
                        in its history - and this ground 
                        breaking idea could not have been 
                        possible without all of you. 

           The crowd applauds. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Ordinary items, housed here, have 
                        become extraordinary. Simplicity 
                        becomes beauty, heartache becomes 
                        art. We have brought the Met 
                        downtown!  Who would have thunk 
                        it? 

           The crowd laughs again.

                        Before you get in your town cars 
                        and head back uptown, I’d like to 
                        unveil something very special. New 
                        York Magazine has recognized this 
                        exhibit - this moment where art 
                        and real life collide. So without 
                        further adieu, I present to you 
                        the cover of New York Magazine - 
                        featuring the Met’s Museum of 
                        Broken Relationships! 

           Max unveils the easel - on it a LARGE cover of NEW YORK 
           MAGAZINE - a photo of the MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS 
           on the front and MAX, alone, standing, arms folded, in 
           front of it. 

           The crowd applauds. 

           Max raises his glass. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        To the Museum of Broken 
                        Relationships! 

           The crowd echoes back; 

                                 CROWD
                        Salut! Cheers! 

           BACK NEAR THE BAR:

           Lucy, dumbfounded, stares at Max. Not a mention of her. 
           Nothing. He took all the credit. Once again. Fool me 
           once... she runs towards the bathroom, Nadine, Amanda and 
           Julian hot on her heels. 
           INT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - BATHROOM

           Nadine, Amanda Julian and Lucy are crowded in the 
           bathroom, like sardines. 

           Lucy stands over the sink, breathing heavy. 

                                 NADINE
                        I will cut a bitch. I will go over 
                        there and cut his face off like a 
                        middle eastern dictator would. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I will put his balls in a vice and 
                        I will squeeze until they are 
                        small, thin johnny cakes. 

                                 JULIAN
                        I will stick a giant dildo in his 
                        asshole, against his will. 

           Lucy, suddenly, very calm, turns to them. 

                                 LUCY
                        Though appreciated, none of that 
                        will be necessary. Especially you 
                        Julian.

           The three of them look at her. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        I got this.

           INT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - MINUTES LATER

           The bathroom door opens and Lucy emerges, cool as a 
           cucumber. The party is still in full swing. Max 
           approaches, magazine in hand. 

                                 MAX
                        Bug, how wonderful is this? Look! 

           He opens the magazine inside, a small picture of Lucy. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        This is great! For you. For me. 
                        For the Met. For the Museum of 
                        Broken Relationships. It’s all 
                        coming together. 

                                 LUCY
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

           Max looks genuinely taken aback. People begin looking in 
           their direction. 

                                 MAX
                        What? 

                                 LUCY
                        That’s you on that cover. It’s not 
                        me. It’s not even us. It’s just 
                        you. 

           Now everyone stares at them. Lucy walks over to the shelf 
           where the MAX FRANK BOX - HER BOX is located and pulls it 
           down off the shelf. She faces Max. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                                 (Realizing.)
                        Max, you can’t see beyond your own 
                        ambition to realize that you did 
                        me wrong. You don’t know the first 
                        thing about what this place stands 
                        for. 

                                 MAX

                        The thing about heartbreak is that 
                        when you go through it, you 
                        believe you’re the only person in 
                        the world who has ever experienced 
                        such pain. Who has known such 
                        agony. Your suffering feels so 
                        utterly singular. But this Museum 
                        made people feel like they weren’t 
                        alone - that heartbreak hurts like 
                        hell for everyone. It’s universal. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        My entire life I’ve waited for big 
                        love. I’ve wanted it, and chased 
                        it, and sought it out in the most 
                        unlikely places. And it’s losers 
                        like you who have blinded me with 
                        your Prada loafers and your no 
                        socks and your thesaurus words. 
                        You pretended to want me but all 
                        you really want is success. Max, 
                        you will never, ever find 
                        extraordinary. But me? I will.  

           She turns to everyone in the Museum, holds the box over 
           her head a la Cusack in can’t buy me love. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I’m moving on. I’m taking this 
                        break up box and I’m burning it. 
                        The final act for this Museum is a 
                        ring of fire. If you’re with me, 
                        if you want to find big love, if 
                        you want to move forward let’s go. 
                        I don’t want to look at this damn 
                        break up box for one more second. 

           She turns back to Max. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Because hear this Max Frank - I am 
                        so fucking over you. 

           The crowd stares at her. A moment of silence. Finally, 
           Willhemina steps out of the crowd. Everyone watches her. 
           Her leather and chains make sounds as she walks across 
           the room. She takes her box of the shelf. 

                                 WILLHEMINA
                        I’m with you Lucy.

           She stands next to Lucy, defiant.  

           And then ONE BY ONE everyone who donated to the Museum 
           begins stepping forward and taking down their break up 
           boxes too. SNAKE GUY, BEANIE BABY LOTHARIO, RETAINER 
           DUDE, EVERYONE. 

           And with that, Lucy turns around and walks out of the 
           Museum followed by all of her donors who carry every last 
           one of their things out of the Museum and away from the 
           Coward Max Frank.  

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT 

           Lucy links arms with Nadine, Amanda and Julian. They lead 
           the crowd THROUGH NEW YORK CITY STREETS and TOWARDS THE 
           BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

                                 JULIAN
                        Max Frank almost shat himself. 

                                 NADINE
                        There was fecal matter in his 
                        Dolce and Gabbana. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I want to sue him.

                                 LUCY
                        We’re about to burn him in effigy. 
                        Because homies, out of the ashes, 
                        a new love awaits. 

                                 JULIAN
                        Sing it sister. 

           They keep walking, together and as they do, Chris Resor, 
           Max’s NY MAGAZINE friend slips out of the Museum and 
           joins the procession.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 

           The procession continues to UNDER BROOKLYN BRIDGE with 
           Lucy, Amanda, Nadine and Julian at the forefront. 

                                 DEEP MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        And so Lucy led the giant break up 
                        parade through the streets of New 
                        York City and ended up under the 
                        Brooklyn Bridge. There, the 
                        denizens of heartbreak committed 
                        the ultimate act of catharsis. 

           Everyone piles their CORNELL-LUCY-BOXES in a giant pile 
           and Lucy is last - she adds her MAX FRANK BOX, and with 
           great pomp and circumstance throws a MATCH IN - the pile 
           ignites - and burns and burns and burns - the fire gets 
           huge. “Ring of Fire” by Johnny Cash plays... 

                                 DEEP MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And as the last remnants of 
                        breakups were engulfed in flames, 
                        Lucy felt a great wave of relief. 
                        Her art installation was complete. 
                        This chapter of her collections 
                        was over. As the fire burned, Lucy 
                        watched as the strangers around 
                        her became friends with one 
                        another. When she looked closer, 
                        she even saw the beginnings of 
                        romance ignite right there along 
                        with the bonfire. And that gave 
                        Lucy, yet another idea.  

           We see the museum donors, chat, and laugh and meet one 
           another. We also see the glow of the fire on Lucy’s 
           content face, and Chris Resor, of New York Magazine SNAP 
           A PHOTO of her in this perfect moment. 
           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           Morning rises over Manhattan. 

           INT. LUCY’S ADORABLE BROOKLYN APARTMENT - LUCY’S ROOM - 
           MORNING 

           Lucy begins clearing her own collections from her 
           shelves. Time to move on. Nadine sticks her head in. 

                                 NADINE
                        We’re about to open a bottle of 
                        wine. You want in? 

                                 LUCY
                        It’s 10am. 

                                 NADINE
                        Yeah. It’s rose. 

           Lucy shakes her head. 

                                 LUCY
                        I forgot Eva’s fortune cookie box 
                        at the Museum. I gotta go back for 
                        it. 

                                 NADINE
                        Don’t worry about that right now. 

                                 LUCY
                        I have to - I owe it to her. 

                                 NADINE
                        Suit yourself. And don’t worry, 
                        there’s always more wine. 

                                 LUCY
                        I know. 

           INT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS - MORNING

           Lucy unlocks the door of the museum and goes over to the 
           shelf and gets Eva’s box. It’s the last one. She sits on 
           the floor and looks at it as the sun streams in through 
           the windows. A lovely last scene. 

           A MAN WITH A CLIP BOARD approaches the door. Knocks. 

                                 MAN WITH A CLIP BOARD
                        Excuse me? 

           Lucy looks up, stands.

                        Oh. God. I’m sorry. I was in my 
                        own world. How can I help you? 

                                 MAN WITH A CLIPBOARD
                        Hello miss. I’m an Inspector with 
                        the New York City Department of 
                        Building. I’m here to see if this 
                        building is up to code. Are you 
                        the owner? 

                                 LUCY
                        No Sir. I’m just the tenant.

                        Okay, well I’m looking for-

           He consults his clipboard.

                        The owner, a Mr. Nick Friend, is 
                        he around? 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sorry, what did you say? 

                                 MAN WITH A CLIPBOARD
                        Nick Friend. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m sorry. I gotta go! Right now. 

           Lucy takes off running out the door and down the block. 

                                 MAN WITH A CLIPBOARD
                        Miss! Miss! Excuse me! 

           But Lucy just keeps running. 

           EXT. NICK’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - SAME

           Lucy knocks on the door. A disheveled Brady answers it. 

                                 LUCY
                        Is Nick here? 

           Brady looks at her disapprovingly, shaking his head.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        BRADY!

                        He’s not here. What the hell 
                        happened with the two of you? He’s 
                        a shell of a man. 

                                 LUCY
                        Can I just leave him a note? 

                                 BRADY
                        Yeah. 

           He opens the door wide. The apartment is a mess. Lucy’s 
           eyes widen but she doesn’t say anything. 

                                 BRADY (CONT’D)
                        I was just about to pop in some 
                        Reality Bites. Care to join?

                                 LUCY
                        I’m good. Thanks. 

                                 BRADY
                        “I’m not going to work at the Gap 
                        for chrissakes!” 

           Lucy nods and heads towards Nick’s room. 

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - NICK’S ROOM - SAME

           Lucy walks into Nick’s room. On his desk, a row of items. 
           They are all mementos from his relationship with Lucy. 

           There is A TICKET STUB from the BROKEN HEARTS BALL, the 
           CARD of a CHEESY REAL ESTATE AGENT that they met with, a 
           FULL COPY of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, the CRUMPLED NAPKIN 
           with her ADDRESS ON IT. A SCRABBLE PIECE. An I’M TOO SEXY 
           RECORD. 

           Lucy stares at the items for a long moment she sits down 
           at Nick’s desk and begins to write. 

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Lucy sprints past Brady, an envelope in hand. 

                                 BRADY
                        How sexy is Troy Dyer? 

           Lucy slams the door to the apartment. 
           EXT. SOUTHAMPTON ESTATE - DAY 

           Establishing shot of a breathtaking beach-front mansion 
           in Southampton. Blue and white and expensive all over. 

           INT. SOUTHAMPTON ESTATE - DAY 

           Inside said estate every possible square inch of space is 
           adorned with things. Paintings. Knick knacks. Sculptures. 
           Tchochkes. There is not an inch of space uncovered. Not 
           an inch unadorned. A veritable assault on the eyes. 

           Amidst all of this, on a hugely expensive, antique couch, 
           lies miserable, miserable Nick. He points the remote at 
           the television half-heartedly changing the channels. 

           Eva Woolf enters the room, dressed in a caftan or 
           whatever type of outfit fabulous, rich, old people wear 
           at home. She pauses, looking at him for a moment. 

                                 EVA
                        Please don’t tell me I raised a 
                        total fool. 

           Nick looks up at her. 

                                 NICK
                        You didn’t raise a total fool. 

                                 EVA
                        Well that all depends. 

                                 NICK
                        On what, Mom? 

                                 EVA
                        If you let your pride get in the 
                        way of your happiness you are much 
                        more similar to any of your 
                        fathers than I ever could have 
                        imagined. 

           Nick shrugs, indifferent. Eva hands him an envelope.

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        This came for you. 

           She turns on her heel to go, but before she does;  

                                 EVA (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, don’t fuck this one up. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Eva exits. Nick stares at the envelope for a moment. And 
           then he opens it. It’s a letter from Lucy. We hear Lucy’s 
           voice reading the letter as we see; 

           LUCY, NADINE AND AMANDA OPENING the MUSEUM OF BROKEN 
           RELATIONSHIPS COFFEE SHOP - it’s a cafe where people can 
           bring their heartbreak things, but meet new people as 
           they do. The tables are filled with people getting to 
           know one another, new couples sprouting.  

           NICK ARRIVES AT THE YALE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE; he 
           shakes the Dean’s hand, who ushers him into his office. 

           NICK DRIVES ALONG THE L.I.E - he’s speeding, heading back 
           into the city as quickly as possible. 

                                 LUCY (V.O.)
                        They say love is blind. But 
                        sometimes I think, heartbreak is 
                        blind. It makes us focus too 
                        heavily on the past - on what 
                        might have been, instead of what 
                        could be. Nick, we are both guilty 
                        of this. I was consumed by 
                        heartbreak. So consumed, that I 
                        was trying to make a relationship 
                        work, that never should have 
                        worked in the first place. And you 
                        tried to push heartbreak away. You 
                        couldn’t face it, so instead you 
                        faced every girl in the Tri-State 
                        area, horizontally.  And 
                        vertically.  And diagonally. But 
                        my point in writing you isn’t to 
                        tell you what we both did wrong.  
                        It’s to tell you what we both did 
                        right.  When I wasn’t looking, I 
                        fell in love with you. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        Nick Friend, I love you.  And I 
                        hope that doesn’t scare you.  I 
                        hope instead, it makes you realize 
                        that you love me too.  Because you 
                        do.  Love me. I don’t just think 
                        it. I know it.

           INT. MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS CAFE - DAY 

           A bright and sunny morning. Lucy, Nadine and Amanda hang 
           out behind the counter of the coffee shop, its bustling 
           and filled with people enjoying themselves. Meeting, 
           talking, looking at the items. 

           Lucy surveys the scene, satisfied. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NADINE
                        I made out with Sam last night. 

                                 AMANDA
                        From the office? 

                                 NADINE
                        Yes. 

                                 LUCY
                        Made out? 

                                 NADINE
                        Yeah. Saliva was the only bodily 
                        fluid exchanged. Can you believe 
                        it? 

                                 LUCY
                        Hardly. 

                                 NADINE
                        He only has one leg, but I think I 
                        like him. 

                                 AMANDA
                        That is very good news. 
                                 (Beat.)
                        I let Jeff hold my hand in the 
                        street. For like ten minutes. 

           Suddenly the coffee door swings open and a MAN holding a 
           LARGE, VERY HEAVY BOX comes inside. The box obscures his 
           face. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Code red break up. 

           Lucy gives her a look. 

                                 LUCY
                        Sir? Can I help you with that box? 

           The man doesn’t answer. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        Sir? 

           The man puts the huge box down on the ground. REVEALING 
           Nick. The box is filled with remnants from Lucy and 
           Nick’s relationship. 

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t put that stuff here. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 NICK
                        Why not? 

                                 LUCY
                        Because I don’t want to have a 
                        broken relationship with you. 

                                 NICK
                        I don’t want to have a broken 
                        relationship with you. 

           They stare at each other for a moment. 

                                 LUCY
                        You know, you are the first person 
                        I never collected anything from. I 
                        didn’t have to hold on to you, 
                        because you were never going 
                        anywhere. Nick Friend, you are my 
                        forever person. 

           Nick takes a step towards Lucy. He takes her in his arms 
           and kisses her. It is very hot. If I do say so myself. 

                                 NADINE
                        Ohmygod get married! 

           Amanda elbows Nadine. 

                                 NADINE (CONT’D)
                        Just kidding. The institution of 
                        marriage. Blech. So antiquated. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Shut. Up. 

                                 NADINE
                        I can’t help it if deep inside my 
                        vagina I’m a romantic. 

           Lucy and Nick look at the two of them and laugh. 

                                 NICK
                        Lucy, you are the girl who can 
                        break my heart but won’t. 

                                 LUCY
                        Who told you that? 

                                 NICKs
                        A wise old broad. 

           Lucy’s eyes land on the sign in the window; “The Museum 
           of Broken Relationships.” 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 LUCY
                        There’s just one thing missing. 

           Lucy walks over to the counter and jots something down on 
           a little piece of paper. She attaches a piece of tape and 
           goes outside, and tapes it underneath “THE MUSEUM OF 
           BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS.” We pull back to reveal that it 
           says “(AND MENDED HEARTS).” 

                                 DEEP MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        And from that day forward, Lucy 
                        told the story of how The Museum 
                        of Broken Relationships helped her 
                        find great, lasting and very 
                        unbroken Love. 

           INT. CIPRIANI MIDTOWN - NIGHT 

           A large, glittering crowd is gathered - much like at the 
           beginning of our fairy tale. Lucy sits at a table with 
           Julian, Nadine, Amanda, Eva Woolf, and next to Lucy, 
           holding her hand, Nick. 

           ANDRE LEON TALLEY (of Vogue fame) is at the podium. We 
           realize, HE IS OUR DEEP MALE VOICE. 

                                 ANDRE LEON TALLEY 
                        So that Ladies and Gentlemen, is 
                        our very well-earned happy ending. 
                        Please join me in welcoming the 
                        recipient of this year’s 
                        Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Young 
                        Artist Award, the undeniably 
                        unique, collector’s collector, 
                        Miss Lucy Gulliver.  

           The crowd applauds. Nick and Lucy share a lovely kiss. 
           And Lucy steps up on stage to accept her award. Next to 
           her, is the NEW COVER of New York Magazine - Lucy’s face 
           lit up by the burning bonfire. 

           THE END
