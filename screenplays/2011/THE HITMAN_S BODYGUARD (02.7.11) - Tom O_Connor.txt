                                THE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD

                                                                     2/7/11
           INT. MASTER SUITE - MORNING

           Fresh steam from a shower fills the air. Dvorak’s “Tempo di 
           Valse” plays on the sound system with digital clarity. 

           MICHAEL BRYCE is getting ready for his day. Mid-thirties, 
           handsome, very much in shape. This is a man at the height of 
           his powers.

           He uses a shaving brush and real cream, not foam. He hums 
           along with Dvorak as he whisks the blade over his skin.

           He quickly makes the bed -- the sheets are barely mussed. 
           He’s a good-looking guy to be sleeping alone.

           Now onto the clothes. If you know suits, you can tell Bryce’s 
           is handmade. So are his shoes. He completes the outfit -- 
           cufflinks, wristwatch, double-windsor on the necktie.

           Bryce’s cell phone BUZZES. Text message. It’s urgent. His 
           movements become sharper, faster. He straps on two matching 
           GLOCK 18 MACHINEPISTOLS -- one holstered above each hip. 

           Bryce slips on an overcoat of fine vicuna wool. He takes a 
           final look in the mirror -- the concealed guns don’t break 
           the line of the coat. Perfect.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - MORNING

           Darkness.

           The LIGHTS snap on. The fluorescent hum is loud in the 
           confined space. Time to wake up.

           SEAN KIERNAN, mid-thirties, is already awake. And already 
           dressed. He sits on his bare cot, staring straight ahead. He 
           hardly even winces at the sudden bright light. 

           Under the jailhouse scruff, Kiernan’s a handsome guy. But his 
           clothes are drab, carefully chosen not to stand out. And his 
           expression is dark -- a black cloud hangs over him.

           The cell door buzzes open. Four armed GUARDS enter. Kiernan 
           rises from his cot. With just a hint of an Irish brogue:

                                 KIERNAN
                        Morning, lads.

           Kiernan politely complies as the Guards put him in leg irons, 
           a waist chain, and handcuffs. 

           They lead him into the hall. Even in the restraints, Kiernan 
           moves with a fluid grace.
           INT. BRYCE’S JAGUAR (MOVING) - DAY

           TITLE:

                                   Geneva, Switzerland

           Bryce is behind the wheel of his Jaguar XFR, gliding through 
           the business district. Fast but controlled.

           He’s downloaded a set of architectural BUILDING PLANS to his 
           phone. He scans through them as he drives, while also doing a 
           call through his Bluetooth:

                                 BRYCE
                        Tell him I’ll be there shortly. And 
                        that he should relax. There’s 
                        nothing to worry about.

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        Um...?

                                 BRYCE
                        I know. Tell him anyway.

           Bryce hangs up. Turns on the stereo. Classical MUSIC plays.

           INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Recessed lighting. A long, polished table. Frosted windows of 
           bulletproof glass.

           TITLE:

                       INTERPOL Global Headquarters -- Lyon, France

           Kiernan, still shackled, sits at the table with his lawyer, 
           HARR. They’re facing a line of three ATTORNEYS. Several other 
           PEOPLE sit in shadow against the wall. 

           Everyone tries not to stare at Kiernan, but they can’t help 
           it -- they’re fascinated by his presence. The lead attorney 
           on the other side, MORENO, begins.

                                 MORENO
                        Mr. Kiernan. Following negotiations 
                        between the International Criminal 
                        Court and all of the relevant 
                        nation-states, we now have a formal 
                        and binding offer.

           Paperwork is slid across the table.
                                 MORENO
                        If you testify against President 
                        Demidov -- and if your testimony 
                        results in a conviction -- your 
                        wife will receive a full pardon 
                        from all jurisdictions.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Ex.

                                 MORENO
                        Pardon?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Janet’s my ex-wife.

                                 MORENO
                        Of course. Apologies.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Also, she’s completely innocent and 
                        you people have no business 
                        charging her with anything. You 
                        want to apologize for that?

           Harr motions Kiernan to settle down. He skims the document. 

                                 HARR
                        That will suffice for Janet, very 
                        good. And now -- what will my 
                        client receive?

           Another document is slid across the table. A single sheet.

                                 MORENO
                        This letter, signed by myself and 
                        the leadership of the ICC, praising 
                        Mr. Kiernan’s cooperation and 
                        strongly recommending leniency. 

           Harr is appalled. This one, he doesn’t even bother reading.

                                 HARR
                        My client is about to give you the 
                        most reviled war criminal on the 
                        planet. And in return, you want to 
                        give him a thank-you note?

                                 MORENO
                        It will be a mitigating factor--
                                 HARR
                        There is no mitigating. My client 
                        is a contract killer, facing two 
                        dozen counts of murder in ten 
                        countries. Absent a deal, he will 
                        never breathe free air again. We 
                        all know that. Now--

           A SOUND stops them. Pen scratching paper. Kiernan is signing 
           the document. 

           Harr starts to protest -- but a look from Kiernan tells him 
           it’s pointless. Kiernan slides the papers back.

           One of the people along the wall stands. He’s INTERPOL DEPUTY 
           DIRECTOR RAFAEL CASORIA. Fifties, with an old-world elegance.

                                 CASORIA
                        Let’s get this man to the Hague.

           INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

           Kiernan, now in a protective vest along with his restraints, 
           is brought in by the Guards. 

                                 CASORIA
                        This is Agent Ryder.

           INTERPOL AGENT AMELIA RYDER, thirty, attractive, falls into 
           step with them. This is a big assignment for her.

                                 AMELIA
                        Sean, I’ll be accompanying you, 
                        along with your security detail --

           -- a dozen OFFICERS, clad in all black, wearing full body 
           armor and carrying ASSAULT RIFLES. They’re standing in front 
           of three ARMORED SUVS.

           To us, it’s an imposing sight, but Kiernan stops. Skeptical.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Hang on now. Demidov has taken out 
                        every single witness against him, 
                        and this is my detail?

                                 CASORIA
                        These men are GIPN. That’s France’s 
                        most elite police--

                                 KIERNAN
                        --police, exactly. You need 
                        military boys on this.
           Casoria’s second-in-command is ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GERARD 
           FOWLER. Forties, British.

                                 FOWLER
                        No one knows you’re testifying. Or 
                        that you’re even here.

           Kiernan just laughs at that. The GIPN COMMANDER approaches --

                                 GIPN COMMANDER
                             (French accent)
                        Monsieur Kiernan, I must insist on 
                        your cooperation. And I assure you, 
                        we are fully prepared--

                                 KIERNAN
                        Oh are you, now?
                             (French, subtitled)
                        (Do you have air support? Advance 
                        teams sweeping primary and 
                        secondary routes? Spotters placed 
                        at elevation points?)

           The Commander is thrown. No.

                                 KIERNAN
                        No offense to you fine people. But 
                        I’m the expert at this sort of 
                        business. Interpol, you’re a bunch 
                        of bureaucrats, and you --
                             (to the GIPN Commander)
                        -- you’re just a cop. Also, let’s 
                        face it: you’re French.

                                 FOWLER
                        The court’s deadline is three days 
                        away. There is no time to arrange a 
                        multinational military escort.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Even better, then: uncuff me, give 
                        me the car keys and a gun, and send 
                        these French lads home. I can 
                        handle myself.

                                 GIPN COMMANDER
                        We can handle him. It is a short 
                        ride through town to the airfield. 
                        I have the utmost confidence.

                                 AMELIA
                             (to Casoria)
                        But sir, maybe we should consider--
           Casoria silences her with a look. This is his call.

                                 CASORIA
                        Take him.

           The GIPN team starts to lead Kiernan towards the center SUV. 
           Fowler catches up to Amelia.

                                 FOWLER
                        If you feel unsafe, we won’t force 
                        you to go.

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you, sir. I’m going.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Suit yourself. But if I was being 
                        hired to kill me, against this... I 
                        wouldn’t even charge full price. 

           Amelia hesitates -- but she gets in the SUV with Kiernan.

           INT. BRYCE’S JAGUAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Bryce pulls into a garage beneath a towering office building.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Bryce cruises down the rows of spaces. He passes two 
           MAINTENANCE GUYS at work. Finds a spot near the elevators.

           Bryce walks to the elevators, looking straight ahead -- but 
           using reflective surfaces of other cars to scan the garage. 
           Casually watching his back without turning around.

           He waits patiently at the bank of elevators. Gets on.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Once the doors close, Bryce opens the elevator’s control 
           panel. He takes a thick ring of keys from his briefcase. 
           Finds one that fits. 

           He places a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE inside the control panel, 
           clipping it to the wires. He hits the button for fourteen. 

           INT. FOURTEENTH FLOOR - DAY

           An opulent reception area. A RECEPTIONIST at a massive desk.  
                                 BRYCE
                        Terrence Donner. Mr. Seifert is 
                        expecting me.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Yes, welcome. I’ll buzz him.

                                 BRYCE
                        No need. Down the hall, fifth 
                        office on the right, yes?

           Bryce never stops moving. A busy executive. He reaches 

           SEIFERT’S OFFICE

           where SEIFERT, forties, sits on the edge of his desk. His 
           coat already on. A man on the verge of panic. 

           Bryce, on the other hand, looks perfectly relaxed.

                                 BRYCE
                        Hi, how are you? Love this office. 
                        Lighting is everything, isn’t it?

                                 SEIFERT
                             (low)
                        My wife’s not answering her phone.

                                 BRYCE
                        Your wife is safe. My associates 
                        brought her to a hotel. 

           Bryce checks the windows, continuing his recon under the 
           pretense of admiring the space.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mr. Seifert, I’m very pleased that 
                        I can be of assistance. As with all 
                        new clients, I’d like to briefly 
                        explain our working relationship: 
                        if you want to live, you will do 
                        exactly what I tell you to do. 
                             (beat)
                        I hope that’s acceptable.

           Seifert quickly nods. It’s acceptable.

                                 BRYCE
                        Excellent. Let’s be on our way.

           Bryce leads Seifert back into the

           HALLWAY
                                 BRYCE
                        I’ll walk just behind you, but I go 
                        through doors first. Relax. Smile.

           They move at a brisk pace. Brisk, not rushed. Bryce keeps a 
           pleasant smile on his face as he tells Seifert:

                                 BRYCE
                        It’s important that this not look 
                        like an extraction. Whoever’s been 
                        sent is likely already here. If 
                        they think you’re running, they’ll 
                        move on you immediately. 

           As in the garage, Bryce stays aware of his surroundings 
           without seeming to. As they approach the elevators --

           -- Bryce draws a key fob from his pocket. A REMOTE. He hits 
           the button --

           -- the ELEVATOR he came up in opens. They get on.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Bryce presses buttons for the lobby and the garage. As soon 
           as the doors close, Seifert goes into full panic --

                                 SEIFERT
                        Oh my God... I never should have 
                        gotten into business with those 
                        people. I didn’t know--!

                                 BRYCE
                        Mr. Seifert. You’re frightened and 
                        I sympathize. But my job becomes 
                        infinitely more difficult if I have 
                        to sedate you.

           Seifert settles down.

           As the elevator descends, Bryce takes a small black CYLINDER 
           out of his briefcase and affixes it to the ceiling.

                                 BRYCE
                        Move away from the doors, please.

           Seifert does. They wait. The doors open at the lobby.
           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Bryce gets off first. All clear. He motions Seifert to 
           follow. The doors close behind them. Bryce takes out his cell 
           phone. It’s receiving a CAMERA FEED. A view of --

           THE ELEVATOR

           The cylinder Bryce placed on the ceiling is a CAMERA. The 
           elevator doors open --

           -- and now the camera has a view of the garage. Rows of cars, 
           nothing unusual. The Maintenance Guys are gone.

           Bryce studies the feed, then leads Seifert towards the 
           stairs. Bryce knows right where they are -- he’s got the 
           building layout memorized.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY

           Bryce and Seifert exit the stairwell. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Where are you parked?

           Seifert points out his car. Bryce aims his phone at it -- 
           camera mode, then he switches to an INFRARED VIEW. 

           There’s a HEAT SIGNATURE on the underside of Seifert’s car.

                                 BRYCE
                        Let’s take my car.

                                 SEIFERT
                        Why?

                                 BRYCE
                        Because they put a bomb on yours. 
                        Keep walking. Everything’s fine.

           They go to the Jaguar. Bryce puts Seifert in the backseat. As 
           he’s about to start the engine --

                                 BRYCE
                        Put your head down.

                                 SEIFERT
                        Why?

                                 BRYCE
                        They put a bomb on my car, too.

           Before Seifert can protest, Bryce calmly turns the ignition --
           -- PHWOOOOM -- the CAR BOMB detonates --

           -- the Jag is hurled straight into the air --

           -- then slams back down to the ground. 

           The Jag is scratched up, smoking, but otherwise -- intact.

           Seifert, who didn’t put his head down like he was told, is 
           dazed from bumping against the roof. And shocked to be alive.

                                 BRYCE
                        Custom vehicle.

           Bryce throws the Jag into gear, guns it towards the exit --

           EXT. SEIFERT’S BUILDING - DAY

           The two “Maintenance Guys” appear on either side of the ramp, 
           both with SUBMACHINE GUNS -- FIRING at the Jag.

           This time, Bryce doesn’t have to tell Seifert to get down. 

           The fusillade of BULLETS chips away at the Jag’s armored 
           paneling and ballistic glass. Bryce tears past the attackers, 
           they’re almost to the street --

           -- a GARBAGE TRUCK slams to a stop, cutting off their escape. 
           Bryce brakes, cuts the wheel hard, comes to a stop broadside 
           of the truck.

           Terrified PEDESTRIANS up and down the sidewalk. No clear 
           escape path. The attackers are still FIRING, the ballistic 
           glass is starting to give...

           There’s just enough space between the Jag and the truck for 
           Bryce to open his door, drawing one of his MACHINEPISTOLS --

           -- a half-second faster than the truck’s PASSENGER, leaning 
           out the window with a SUBMACHINE GUN. Bryce FIRES -- the 
           Passenger ducks back in. 

           Bryce pulls a small BLACK OBJECT from his coat, throws it in 
           the truck’s cab --

           -- it’s a STUN GRENADE. It explodes with a burst of blinding 
           LIGHT and a concussive BOOM.

           Bryce draws his other MACHINEPISTOL -- turns and FIRES over 
           the hood of the Jag at the Maintenance Guys. He has excellent 
           cover, they’re on exposed ground -- he kills them both.
           Back to the truck. The Passenger and DRIVER are still 
           disoriented, trying to recover --

           -- too late. Bryce SHOOTS them, too. Silence. Bryce scans the 
           environment. No further threats.

           He gets back in the Jag. GUNS it. Checks the mirrors. No 
           pursuit, no second wave. Bryce whips --

           AROUND THE CORNER

           then pulls over. Seifert is huddled low in his seat. Bryce 
           runs his hands over Seifert’s body, checking for injuries. 
           None.

                                 BRYCE
                        Congratulations, Mr. Seifert. You 
                        have been a model client. And 
                        you’re alive and unhurt.

           Bryce gets back on the road. Seifert slowly emerges from his 
           crouch. He starts breathing again. Suddenly, Seifert starts 
           to LAUGH. A crazed, weepy joy. 

                                 SEIFERT
                        Oh... oh my God...

           Bryce grins. He’s seen this before. He pops the glovebox. 
           Bottles of water, a container of pills.

                                 BRYCE
                        Take one pill, please. One.

           As Seifert swallows, Bryce places a call.

                                 EMERGENCY OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
                        Polizei.

                                 BRYCE
                        My name is Michael Bryce. I am an 
                        executive protection agent, 
                        licensed within the EU. I have just 
                        engaged assailants on the Route de 
                        Mayrin and am now extracting my 
                        client from the scene. When I am 
                        able, I will gladly return and make 
                        myself available for questioning. 
                        Thank you.

           Bryce hangs up. Glances at Seifert. He’s starting to come 
           down from the adrenaline rush. Bryce pulls out a cell phone.
                                 BRYCE
                        Your wife will want to hear your 
                        voice. Hit send.

           The call connects --

                                 SEIFERT
                             (into phone)
                        Honey? I’m okay. Yes. Yes. I love 
                        you, darling. I love you so much...

           As Seifert gushes into the phone, Bryce listens with a smile. 
           But it’s a sad smile. Must be nice, what Seifert has.

           EXT. LYON - HIGHWAY - DAY

           Kiernan’s convoy races along the gleaming banks of the Rhone. 
           Three armored SUVs, lights and sirens. Kiernan is in the 
           center vehicle. 

           INT. KIERNAN’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY

           The GIPN Commander and THREE OFFICERS. Kiernan rides in back 
           with Amelia, the Interpol agent. 

           Amelia watches Kiernan. His eyes are closed. His head leaning 
           forward. He’s... dozing.  

                                 AMELIA
                        Thought you were so concerned.

           Kiernan doesn’t even open his eyes.

                                 KIERNAN
                        We’re on a highway.

           Back to his nap.

           EXT. LYON - PRESQU’ILE - DAY

           The convoy pulls off the highway and into the heart of Lyon, 
           moving across the Place Bellecour. Ancient buildings and 
           grand fountains line their route.

           INT. KIERNAN’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY

           As the vehicle slows... Kiernan comes awake. He leans 
           forward, surveying the road. His focus is absolute. 

           He calls out to the GIPN Commander, riding shotgun:
                                 KIERNAN
                        Know where I would do it? On this 
                        stretch of road coming right up. 
                        The curves will cut our speed, and 
                        those buildings are close in -- 
                        great firing positions.

           The GIPN team is uneasy. Kiernan’s the expert. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        If I could sit closer to the front, 
                        I could help.

           But the Commander ignores him. The convoy continues on.

           The Fourviere hill looms ahead -- below it, Lyon’s medieval 
           quarter. Pitched, narrow streets. Picturesque... but deadly.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Oh yeah. Perfect. Choke points all 
                        along our route and we have zero 
                        visibility.

           Still nothing from the Commander. Kiernan turns to Amelia.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Almost there...

           Amelia nods to the Commander: let him up.

           The Commander, quietly furious, mutters in French to one of 
           his Officers, who unbuckles Kiernan’s seat belt.

           Kiernan gets on the floor. He slides forward as best as he 
           can in his restraints. To the DRIVER:

                                 KIERNAN
                             (French, subtitled)
                        (You won’t have time to decide if 
                        you believe me. So decide now.)

           INT./EXT. KIERNAN’S SUV/LYON - DAY

           The vehicles wind through the quiet streets. PEDESTRIANS stop 
           to watch. The old buildings are two and three stories, 
           clustered on either side. Kiernan is on the lookout. 

           Then, movement outside -- PROJECTILES flying at the SUV --

           -- the GIPN Officers turn, rifles up --

           -- ROCKS bounce harmlessly off the car. Outside, a group of 
           KIDS ducks back into an alley, laughing.
           The GIPN team is rattled. Kiernan barely even turned his 
           head. He’s focused on the real danger:

           They’re coming to a curve in the road. 

           As the convoy slows, Kiernan leans forward, scanning --

           -- CARS parked along the road. Kiernan’s eyes lock on a small 
           PEUGEOT. Innocuous, except the rear end is low to the ground, 
           like there’s extra weight on the suspension --

                                 KIERNAN
                        (Brake! Pull right, right--)

           The Driver believes Kiernan. He brakes and pulls right as -- 

           -- THE PEUGEOT DETONATES -- a huge FIREBALL -- just as they 
           would have passed it --

           -- no direct hit, but the blast knocks the SUV on its side -- 
           it SLAMS into a line of parked cars. 

           The other SUVs screech to a halt -- more EXPLOSIONS all 
           around -- ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES --

           -- coming from upper windows on both sides of the street. But 
           the SUVs are heavily armored -- holding for now.

           The GIPN Officers pour out of the SUVs, FIRING up at the 
           windows, taking out ATTACKERS.

           The street is filled with smoke and fire.

           KIERNAN’S SUV

           The GIPN men throw open the side door -- now facing skyward -- 
           and SHOOT out of the opening like tank gunners.

           Amelia, still unsteady, calls to Kiernan --

                                 AMELIA
                        I’ll unlock you--

           She puts her hand to her belt -- no keys. Kiernan already has 
           them. He’s unlocking his cuffs. 

           An Officer sees Kiernan about to free himself -- he draws a 
           TASER, leaps at Kiernan -- the ELECTRIC WHINE building -- 

           -- Kiernan doesn’t pull away, like anyone else would -- he 
           lunges right into the Officer, HEADBUTTING him -- and taking 
           the full force of the TASER right in the chest. 

           Fifty thousand watts. 
           Both men go down -- but the Officer stays down. Kiernan 
           recovers. He calmly finishes unlocking his cuffs. Amelia 
           watches, stunned.

           EXT. LYON STREET - DAY

           Bodies everywhere. Heavy casualties on both sides.

           The surviving GIPN men have formed a cordon around Kiernan’s 
           SUV. The RPG bombardment has given way to a ground assault -- 
           ATTACKERS advancing from all directions. A tightening noose.

           INT. KIERNAN’S SUV - DAY

           BULLETS pound against the frame of the SUV. 

           Amelia digs out the damaged radio as two GIPN men go out the 
           top of the vehicle. The Commander stands FIRING in the open 
           doorway -- then falls back into the SUV. BLOOD pours. Dead.

           Kiernan takes the RIFLE and SIDEARM off the Commander’s body. 
           He moves to the rear door -- 

                                 AMELIA
                        Don’t!

           Too late -- Kiernan throws the rear door open -- using it as 
           a shield as he emerges into the open air --

           EXT. LYON STREET - DAY

           Kiernan takes in the scene. The ATTACKERS all around the SUV. 
           Drawing in. 

           Using the heavy SMOKE as cover, Kiernan runs directly away 
           from the SUV -- holding his fire, staying low, concealed --

           -- he runs right through the circle of Attackers -- now he’s 
           behind them, he turns --

           -- he’s not escaping. He’s making a counter-strike. 

           Kiernan circles around the Attackers, FIRING at a dead run, 
           with incredible accuracy. He’s mowing them down.

           Kiernan stops to reload --

           -- the Attackers have taken out the last of the GIPN cordon. 
           They’re advancing on the SUV.
           INT. KIERNAN’S SUV - DAY

           Just Amelia and the final Officer in here. She’s trying the 
           radio --

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re under attack--!

           No reply, no static, nothing. Radio’s dead. The Officer draws 
           his weapon and races into the 

           STREET

           and right into a barrage of GUNFIRE. He doesn’t have 
           Kiernan’s speed -- he’s immediately cut down. 

           The final two Attackers move in on the SUV --

           -- Kiernan emerges from the smoke, SHOOTS them both --

           -- just as a THIRD ATTACKER rises from behind a car --

           -- Kiernan spots him -- almost in time. They both FIRE -- 
           Kiernan makes a perfect killshot, but also gets HIT.

           The shooting stops. Silence. Charming, historic Lyon is now a 
           graveyard.

           Kiernan checks his body. Grazed in a few places -- and a 
           direct hit, just below his knee. BLOOD flows from it. Kiernan 
           stands -- he can put weight on the leg, at least. 

           Amelia calls from inside the wrecked SUV:

                                 AMELIA
                        Sean?

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’m fine. Check the others.

           Kiernan’s not fine. His leg is bleeding heavily. But he’s got 
           work to do:

           He rifles through the corpses of the Attackers. He digs 
           through pockets, rips off masks, checks tattoos. He does this 
           roughly, quickly. No respect for the dead.

           Amelia finds the SUV’s med kit and starts checking the GIPN 
           team for survivors. None to be found. She’s shaken -- this 
           kind of carnage is beyond her experience.

           Kiernan rips the sleeve of one of the Attackers -- there’s an 
           intricate TATTOO of a CHURCH on his forearm. 
           Kiernan pulls a CELL PHONE from the Attacker’s pocket. He 
           hits SEND. The call connects. Kiernan acts scared, desperate:

                                 KIERNAN
                             (Russian, subtitled)
                        (We took fire. I’ve been hit... I 
                        can’t find anyone. I need the key.)

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                             (Russian, subtitled)
                        (Did you kill Kiernan?)

                                 KIERNAN
                        (I’m... not sure. I’ve been shot. I 
                        need the key. Please.)

                                 MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
                             (beat)
                        (Eight seven two. Good luck.)

           The call disconnects. Kiernan uses the phone’s camera to take 
           a few pictures of the church tattoo, then -- 

                                 AMELIA
                        Drop the weapon.

           He turns. Amelia’s holding the med kit -- and her SIDEARM, 
           aimed right at him. He shrugs, kicks his gun to her.

           The blood from Kiernan’s leg is pooling on the ground around 
           him. She tosses him a set of handcuffs.

                                 AMELIA
                        Put these on. I’ll dress your leg.

           Kiernan hurls the cuffs away. Forget it. A brief stare-down. 
           He wins.

                                 KIERNAN
                        We’re exposed out here.

           Kiernan limps away. Amelia follows him into an 

           ALLEY

           He digs through the med kit. He pockets a needle and surgical 
           thread, then starts field work on his leg. Alcohol, pressure 
           bandage, the basics. 

           Keeping her gun on Kiernan, Amelia takes out her phone --

                                 KIERNAN
                        No calls.
                                 AMELIA
                        I have to tell Interpol--

                                 KIERNAN
                        You can’t trust Interpol. After 
                        this?

                                 AMELIA
                        I’ll take precautions. But we’re 
                        the only agency with transnational 
                        jurisdiction. It’s still my only 
                        way of getting you to the Hague.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I can get there on my own.

           Amelia ignores that, dials --

           INT. INTERPOL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           lunges for the phone. Puts her on speaker.

           She’s got the gun -- Kiernan will have to convince her.

                        I’m not going to run, alright? 
                        Testifying is how I get Janet free.

                        I don’t know where he is. He

           Stunned silence in the conference room. Amelia hangs up.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Nicely done. You’re a smooth one, 
                        you are. Now close your eyes and 
                        count to twenty.

           Distant SIRENS. Kiernan starts limping away --

                                 AMELIA
                        You really think you’ll make it? On

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’ll see you at the Hague.

           She watches Kiernan go. Thinking it over. Calls after him:

                                 AMELIA
                        My apartment’s not far. No one will 
                        look for you there. You need to 
                        rest. Clean up. And you need blood. 
                        I can get you blood. 

           She writes down the address for him. Kiernan checks his 
           bandage -- already soaked through. He’s considering it.

                                 KIERNAN
                        How do I know you won’t change your 
                        mind and send Interpol to fetch me?

           As a sign of good faith, she gives Kiernan something else: 
           the gun she took from him.

           Okay. He disappears down the alley.

           EXT. OUTSIDE GENEVA - AIRFIELD - DAY

           Bryce escorts Seifert to a waiting single-engine CESSNA.

           The ENGINE is roaring -- too loud to talk. Seifert hugs Bryce 
           tightly. Bryce takes the hug good-naturedly; he’s used to 
           that reaction. Seifert disappears into the Cessna. 
           Bryce goes to his Jag, parked by a hangar. He throws a cover 
           over it, concealing its bullet-riddled frame. Parked right 
           next to it -- 

           -- a second, identical Jaguar. Clean and ready to go.

           As the Cessna climbs into the air, Bryce’s cell RINGS. He 
           checks the Caller ID -- this is important. 

           Bryce quickly ducks into the Jag for a quiet place to talk. 
           His voice drops a register:

                                 BRYCE
                        You couldn’t stay away.

           steps into the open, hands raised, badge showing.

           Bryce stares at his phone for a moment. Starts the engine.
           EXT. LYON BACKSTREETS - DAY

           Kiernan slips through the streets, making his getaway,

           Nothing but a table, chair, and phone. A Guard leads JANET

           Kiernan, looking ashen, goes in through a side entrance.

           Bloody towels all over the floor. Kiernan is suturing the 
           wound on his leg. His stitching job is adequate but a little 
           jagged -- first aid isn’t his strong suit. 

           He’s using vodka as a disinfectant. He wants a drink, but the 
           bottle’s almost empty. Hmm. He pours a little more on his 
           leg, then gulps the rest. It goes down like water.

           LATER

           Kiernan tests his leg -- putting weight on it, springing off. 
           Like a mechanic running diagnostics.

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Kiernan is laid out on the bed. Trying to conserve energy.

           He scrolls through the cell-phone PHOTOS he took of the 
           Attacker’s tattoo. Zooms in. In the detailed inkwork, now we 
           see something more -- tiny NUMBERS hidden in the church.

           On a notepad, Kiernan has written “8 2 7.” He copies down 
           numbers from the tattoo, then begins transposing the digits. 

           Some kind of code.

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

           Kiernan burns the notepad in the kitchen sink, then runs the 
           garbage disposal. Destroying it completely.

           INT. DEMIDOV’S CELL - DAY

           Except for the heavy metal door, this feels more like a hotel 
           suite than a prison cell. The inmate is the man himself: 
           ALEXANDER DEMIDOV, fifties.
           TITLE:

                             ICC Detention Centre -- The Hague

           Demidov has lost none of the imperiousness of power. He wears 
           a suit and tie, and looks ready to retake command at any 
           moment. The news plays on a small TV:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        The trial of Alexander Demidov 
                        continues. Demidov, the former 
                        president of Kajekistan, is accused 
                        of selling black-market arms on a 
                        massive scale to terrorist groups 
                        and fellow dictators across the 
                        globe. Fueling genocides in Africa 
                        and Asia, as well as terror attacks 
                        against western democracies...

           Demidov is unfazed by the accusations. A KNOCK on the door. 
           He mutes the news.

           Two GUARDS bring in LIVITIN, forties, Demidov’s attorney. He 
           looks embarrassed to be here. Russian accent:

                        There was quite the dust-up in Lyon

                        anything about that, would you?

                                 LIVITIN
                        Agent Fowler, you have made a long 
                        and pointless journey. My client 
                        has nothing to say. Goodbye.

                                 DEMIDOV
                             (Russian accent)
                        I have no secrets. A diversion 
                        would be welcome. You are my guest.

           Livitin sighs. Motions the Guards to leave. As soon as the 
           three of them are alone --

                                 FOWLER
                        I gave you exactly what you needed.

                                 LIVITIN
                        You have come all this way to lodge

                        I have come for my money. I 
                        delivered as promised.

           Fowler hands Livitin a pen and an official document.

                                 FOWLER
                        The code for the wire transfer to 
                        my Cayman account, if you please.

                                 LIVITIN
                        The job is not yet done. We need 
                        you back at Interpol, monitoring 
                        for any sign of Kiernan.

                                 FOWLER
                        No. They already suspect a leak. 
                        Casoria is no idiot. If I tip you 
                        off again, I risk exposure.

                                 DEMIDOV
                        You are already at risk. As am I.
                             (beat)
                        It is crucial that evidence of my 
                        misdeeds not become public.

           Suddenly -- Demidov lunges forward -- you wouldn’t expect him 
           to be so fast --

           -- he grabs Fowler’s hand -- and stabs him through the palm 
           with his own pen. Demidov claps a hand over Fowler’s mouth to 
           muffle the SCREAM.

                                 DEMIDOV
                        So be sure to hide your wound from 
                        the guards.

           Demidov pulls the pen back out, slowly, letting it get soaked 
           in Fowler’s blood. 

           He releases Fowler, who stumbles back against the wall. 
           Livitin tosses him a towel. 

                                 DEMIDOV
                        When Kiernan is dead, you will be 
                        paid in full.

           Using the pen, Demidov scrawls on the transfer document. The 
           letters “IOU” -- written in Fowler’s blood.
           Fowler is shaking, terrified. He’s never seen this side of 
           Demidov up close. Now he just wants to help.

                                 FOWLER
                        Kiernan... it looks like he might 
                        have been injured in the attack. 
                        You should send another team to 
                        Lyon in case he’s gone to ground.

           Demidov nods: thank you. Livitin knocks on the door for the 
           Guards to open it. Fowler leaves, wobbly, the towel wrapped 
           around his hand to cover the wound.

           Livitin unmutes the news, catching the end of the story:

                                 NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ...despite the long catalog of 
                        Demidov’s alleged atrocities, the 
                        prosecution has been hard-pressed 
                        to make a solid case. The judges 
                        have set a deadline for the end of 
                        this week for prosecutors to 
                        present compelling evidence or 
                        allow Demidov to go free.

           Livitin turns it off. They switch to Russian, subtitled:

                                 LIVITIN
                        (Nothing about Kiernan, of course. 
                        They don’t want to give us clues. 
                        But we will find him.)

                                 DEMIDOV
                        (I find this process unsavory. 
                        Silencing witnesses, hiding my 
                        work? I am the rightful president. 
                        I should hide from no one.)

                                 LIVITIN
                        (As soon as you are back in power.)

                                 DEMIDOV
                        (You are a good lawyer. But you do 
                        not understand power. A true leader 
                        does not slither.)

           EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Bryce parks on the street. Pops the trunk. Neatly arranged 
           inside: a variety of WEAPONS and MEDICAL SUPPLIES. 

           Bryce takes out a small COOLER. Heads for the entrance.
           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Amelia lets Bryce in. She has a few bruises and scratches 
           from the day’s attack. He pulls her close, concerned.

                                 BRYCE
                        What happened?

                                 AMELIA
                        Work. Just banged up. I’m fine.

                                 BRYCE
                        Are you sure? You need to put 
                        ointment on this. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Michael, I’ve had full medical 
                        attention. I promise you, I am in 
                        perfect health.

                                 BRYCE
                        Not for long.

           Satisfied that she’s alright, Bryce sweeps her up and puts 
           her on the table. She laughs, playfully fighting him off. As 
           they make out --

                                 AMELIA
                        No, Michael, focus. I brought you 
                        here for work.

                                 BRYCE
                        You’re going to start paying me? 
                        That’s really not necessary.

           She’s trying to break it off before they’re too far gone --

                                 AMELIA
                        Seriously, we can’t. This is 
                        important. Get up. Up.

           One last deep kiss before they break. 

                                 AMELIA
                        You brought the blood, good --

           She opens the cooler. Inside: a half-dozen RED ROSES.

                                 AMELIA
                        I told you this was business.

                                 BRYCE
                        They’re short-stem. They’re 
                        business roses.
                                 AMELIA
                        And they’re lovely.

           She digs deeper in the cooler -- several packets of BLOOD.

                                 AMELIA
                        O-neg, even more lovely. Come on. I 
                        want you to meet someone.

           Amelia leads Bryce down the hall to the guest bedroom. She 
           knocks lightly on the door, opens it --

           -- but the bed is empty. Kiernan’s gone. Amelia turns --

           -- Bryce is gone, too. 

           From the kitchen: CLICK. CLICK. Two GUNS being cocked almost 
           simultaneously.

           Amelia runs into the

           KITCHEN

           Bryce and Kiernan have their guns leveled at each other. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Guys. Easy.

                                 BRYCE
                        What is he doing here?

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’ve got the same question.

                                 AMELIA
                        You two know each other?

                                 BRYCE
                        We’ve never been formally 
                        introduced.

                                 KIERNAN
                        But I’ve shot him a few times.

                                 BRYCE
                        Shot at, I think you mean.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I winged you in Tangiers. I know I 
                        did.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mmm, sorry. But at this range, you 
                        might have a chance.
                                 AMELIA
                        Guys. I’m sorry for the surprise. I 
                        will explain. Guns down. 

           Neither man complies. No one wants to back down first.

           Amelia steps right between them. She stares hard at Bryce. He 
           lowers his gun. Kiernan follows.

                                 AMELIA
                        Now you’re being formally 
                        introduced. Michael Bryce, meet 
                        Sean Kiernan. Your new client.

           They stare at each other. What the hell...?

                                 AMELIA
                        We are going to go in the other 
                        room and speak politely. Make 
                        yourselves comfortable.

           Bryce and Kiernan are not at all comfortable.

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The roses have been put into a vase.

           Bryce comes out of the kitchen with a cappuccino. Kiernan is 
           propped up on the couch, getting a transfusion of the blood 
           from Bryce’s cooler. 

           Amelia adjusts the pillows for Kiernan. Bryce’s eyes narrow.

                                 BRYCE
                        Amelia, I can’t say I approve of 
                        your new friends.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Not that I care about your 
                        approval, but I’ve never killed 
                        anyone who didn’t have blood all 
                        over their own hands. If a job’s 
                        not right, I turn it down. You 
                        should try that sometime.

                                 BRYCE
                        Forgive me. Did I just receive 
                        moral guidance from Sean Kiernan? 

           Amelia shoots Bryce a look: quiet. She’s ready to explain.
                                 AMELIA
                        We apprehended him three weeks ago, 
                        wrapping up a decade-long manhunt. 

                                 BRYCE
                        How did you finally catch him?

           Amelia looks to Kiernan: alright to say? He shrugs.

                                 AMELIA
                        He surfaced to visit his ex-wife. 
                        We took her in as well.

                                 KIERNAN
                        On completely made-up charges--

                                 AMELIA
                        That wasn’t my call. But it did get 
                        Kiernan to give up the only person 
                        bigger than himself: an old 
                        employer, Alexander Demidov.
                             (she lets that land)
                        Kiernan’s not my friend. But I do 
                        take an interest in his well-being.

           Bryce understands the gravity now. He’s thinking it over. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Hang on. It’s a sweet gesture and 
                        all, but I do not need a bodyguard.

                                 BRYCE
                        That’s fine, because I’m not a 
                        “bodyguard.” I’m not a fat man in a 
                        cheap suit who keeps you from 
                        touching the dancers. I am an 
                        executive protection specialist. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        You are an utter gobshite. If I did 
                        need protection -- which I don’t -- 
                        I could do a lot better than him.

                                 BRYCE
                        Is that right? You’ve tried to take 
                        out several of my clients over the 
                        years. I don’t think you’ve fared 
                        all that well.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I killed Jeremy Gibson.
                                 BRYCE
                        Gibson didn’t follow protocol. You 
                        didn’t get Quattrano, you didn’t 
                        get Roth, you didn’t get Atienza...

                                 KIERNAN
                        I got Atienza.

                                 BRYCE
                        You thought you got him. I switched 
                        vehicles on you. Tony Atienza is 
                        alive and well.

           Bryce’s face falls.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Not anymore.

                        You are the last person I want to 
                        involve in this. But you’re the 
                        only one who can get it done.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Thank you for the blood and the 
                        hospitality. I can take care of 
                        myself.

           Bryce hates this. But it’s got to be done. He faces Kiernan.
                                 BRYCE
                        Demidov is pursuing you. The 
                        authorities are as well. Any safe 
                        houses you had are blown. You’re 
                        alone. And you’re injured. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t try to be a hero. You have no 
                        experience of it.

           Kiernan glares. Amelia holds up her cell. A threat.

                                 AMELIA
                        You let Michael protect you, or you 
                        take your chances with Interpol. 
                        And if you die, Janet gets life. 
                        Are we good?

           Pause. Kiernan nods. Fine. Whatever.

           EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Two POLICEMEN are talking with an elderly NEIGHBOR. No 
           subtitles necessary. The Neighbor is describing someone -- 
           demonstrating Kiernan’s limp.

           One of the Cops pulls up a PHOTO of Kiernan on his phone. The 
           Neighbor nods. That’s him.

           INT. INTERPOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           AGENTS grabbing their coats and tearing outside. Casoria is 
           on his cell. An ASSISTANT runs up to him.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Sir? We ran the occupants of that 
                        building. 

           The Assistant shows Casoria a sheet of paper. He grimaces.

                                 CASORIA
                             (into cell)
                        I have to go.

           INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Fowler is on his cell.

                                 CASORIA (ON PHONE)
                        I’ll keep you updated.
                                 FOWLER
                        Good luck.

           Fowler hangs up. Rubs his injured hand. He’s struggling with 
           this. Then -- he pulls out another phone and sends a text. 

           INT. A VAN (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Six Kajeki MERCENARIES, heavily armed. Driving quickly 
           through the Lyon streets. Demidov’s second team.

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Kiernan is taking in the last unit of blood. His color is 
           back now. Bryce and Amelia say goodbyes at the door.

                                 AMELIA
                        Hate to have you working for free.

           She pulls out a single bill -- a five-euro note. Bryce grins, 
           pockets it.

                                 BRYCE
                        Once we’re on the road, I’ll have 
                        to change out my phone. Can’t call 
                        to check in.

                                 AMELIA
                        I’ve learned not to worry about 
                        you. Sort of.

                                 BRYCE
                        This is nothing. One night of 
                        driving. When it’s done, let’s go 
                        away. A long weekend in Amalfi. 
                        Villa on the water.

                                 AMELIA
                        Sounds wonderful. But after the 
                        long weekend, after the good wine 
                        and great sex, what then? 

           Bryce doesn’t have the answer she wants.

                                 AMELIA
                        Not sure I can keep doing this.

           He moves in to kiss her -- she wants to make it a kiss on the 
           cheek, but gives in at the last second.

                                 AMELIA
                        Be careful.
           And then she’s out the door. Kiernan observed all that, but 
           he’s not going to comment. 

           Each of these guys has always been the alpha male in every 
           room they’ve walked into. And now, they’re in the same room.

           Bryce sits across from Kiernan. He switches into client mode, 
           polite and professional:

                                 BRYCE
                        Mr. Kiernan. The past is past. You 
                        are now my client, and I am very 
                        pleased to be of assistance. The 
                        working relationship is simple: if 
                        you want to live, you will do 
                        exactly what I tell you to do.
                             (beat)
                        I hope that’s acceptable.

           Kiernan gives Bryce a look of pure fuck-you. They hold each 
           other’s gaze. A measuring of wills. 

           The moment is broken when Bryce’s cell RINGS. He answers.

                                 BRYCE
                        It’s going great so far. I’ve 
                        explained the working relationship, 
                        and he fully understands.

           Kiernan rolls his eyes.

           EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Amelia on her cell, walking to her car. Down the street, 
           POLICE CARS are setting up roadblocks.

                                 AMELIA
                        Police. Setting a perimeter.

           INT. AMELIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 BRYCE
                        We’re moving.

           Bryce hangs up. Kiernan has already read his body language -- 
           he tears the IV from his arm. Slaps a bandage on it.

                                 BRYCE
                        Police. If they’re here, so is --

                                 KIERNAN
                        -- Demidov.
           In just a few seconds, they’re ready to go. Both always 
           prepared. As they move to the door --

                                 BRYCE
                        This building has two--

                                 KIERNAN
                        --two stairwells, no fire escapes, 
                        no adjoining roofs. Yeah.

           Kiernan draws his gun, he’s about to open the door -- then 
           Bryce yanks him back. Hard.

           Kiernan’s fist comes up -- he so wants to hit Bryce. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Mr. Kiernan. I go through doors 
                        first. You don’t follow until I 
                        give the all clear.

                                 KIERNAN
                        You are a mental case. I’ve opened 
                        doors before.

                                 BRYCE
                        Let me explain: my job is to keep 
                        you out of harm’s way.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I am harm’s way.

           Bryce points to where he wants Kiernan to stand. Seething, 
           Kiernan goes to his spot. 

           Bryce draws a machinepistol, opens the door, staying low --

           INT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bryce quickly crosses to the doorway opposite. The hallway is 
           clear. He motions Kiernan to come out. Kiernan moves into the 
           hall, with an expression of mock-terror.

           EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Amelia drives up to a roadblock. Shows her ID to a POLICEMAN. 
           He reads it. Double-checks. Then --

                                 OFFICER
                             (French, subtitled)
                        (Turn off the engine. Step out.)
           As Amelia complies, the Officer waves someone over: Casoria. 
           He’s not happy with her. 

           INT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bryce and Kiernan move towards the near stairwell. Kiernan 
           with just a slight limp now.

           As they reach the stairwell door, Bryce draws a COMPACT 
           MIRROR from his coat. Uses it to look through the narrow 
           window --

           -- one of Demidov’s MERCS is on the landing, one floor down. 
           Signaling to a SECOND MERC below him.

           Bryce pulls back from the door. Whispers:

                                 BRYCE
                        Two hostiles, possibly more. We’ll 
                        take the other stairwell.

           Bryce starts that way, but Kiernan doesn’t follow.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Let’s go through these guys.

                                 BRYCE
                        We engage only as a last resort.

                                 KIERNAN
                        What kind of gun are you carrying?

           Bryce holds it up so he can see --

                                 BRYCE
                        Glock 18 --

           -- Kiernan snatches the machinepistol out of Bryce’s hand, 
           throws open the stairwell door --

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           -- Kiernan comes in low, a gun in each hand -- FIRING, 
           instantly killing both Mercs -- 

           -- still in motion, no hesitation -- Kiernan leaps off the 
           stairs, goes airborne over the railing -- 

           -- FIRING again in midair -- killing TWO MORE MERCS on the 
           landing below -- 

           -- Kiernan’s vision and reflexes are unreal -- 
           -- he lands on the flight of stairs below. Slams into the 
           wall, spreading the impact across his body and good leg. 

           Kiernan immediately rises back up in a perfect firing stance. 
           Flawless.

           Bryce rushes into the stairwell, his other gun drawn --

           -- but Kiernan’s already killed everyone.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Thank God you’re here.

                                 BRYCE
                        Bravo. But guess what happens now? 

           With a look of disgust, Bryce points outside --

                                 BRYCE
                             (French, subtitled)
                        (Shots fired.)

           EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           A POLICE OFFICER near the building gets on his radio, and 
           exactly as Bryce predicted:

                                 OFFICER
                        (Shots fired.)

           The police aren’t creeping in anymore -- now they’re charging 
           in. The SQUAD CARS fire up their lights, the perimeter is 
           pulled in tighter, and...

           ...HELICOPTERS appear on the horizon. Their SEARCHLIGHTS 
           bathing the ground.

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Kiernan and Bryce race down the stairs. They can already hear 
           the HELICOPTERS.

                                 BRYCE
                        See, now we have a new problem.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Nothing I can’t handle.

                                 BRYCE
                        What I like to do is think ahead. 
                        Plan. Account for contingencies. 
                                 KIERNAN
                        Brilliant. What I like to do is 
                        have talent.

           As they reach the second-floor landing --

           -- the stairwell door on the first floor opens -- the last 
           TWO MERCS -- Bryce, watchful, spots them an instant before 
           Kiernan does --

           -- Bryce shoves Kiernan aside to shield him -- and SHREDS 
           both Mercs with his machinepistols. 

                                 BRYCE
                        I would be a lot more impressed by 
                        you if I wasn’t me.

           Kiernan’s ear is ringing -- Bryce fired right by his head. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Right in my ear, thanks.

                                 BRYCE
                             (into his other ear)
                        Apologies. But it’s not like you’re 
                        listening to me anyway.

           Kiernan brushes him off, starts down the stairwell -- Bryce 
           pulls him back. Points through the window --

           -- the helicopters’ SEARCHLIGHTS are now covering the ground 
           outside the exit door. 

                                 BRYCE
                        This way.

           He motions Kiernan towards the hall. Kiernan wants to ignore 
           Bryce, but knows he’s right. As they head down the

           SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY

           Bryce keeps an eye on Kiernan’s limp.

                                 KIERNAN
                        The leg’s fine.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’ll determine that, Mr. Kiernan.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Stop calling me that.
           Bryce watches Kiernan walk -- then nods, satisfied. He picks 
           an apartment halfway down the hall -- KICKS the door open -- 
           they run inside.

           INT. SECOND-FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bryce and Kiernan run straight through the apartment -- a 
           young COUPLE cowers behind the couch, terrified -- Bryce 
           CRASHES through a window, Kiernan follows him --

           EXT. AMELIA’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           -- no lights or police here; they didn’t expect Bryce and 
           Kiernan to come out this way. 

           Both men hit the ground, landing and rolling. Kiernan 
           protects his injured leg. They’re back on their feet --

           -- and running through the dark, reaching a covering of trees 
           just before the SEARCHLIGHTS sweep over them. 

           Safe -- at least for the moment. 

           Just as he did with Seifert, Bryce starts to run his hands 
           over Kiernan’s torso, checking for injuries. But Kiernan 
           freaks when Bryce touches him.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Hey! Hands off, you feck.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m checking if you’re hurt.

                                 KIERNAN
                        If I was hurt, don’t you think I 
                        could tell?

           Bryce shrugs, relents. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        You got a car?

                                 BRYCE
                        Yes, but we can’t get to it now, 
                        thanks to you.

                                 KIERNAN
                        You know what? I didn’t ask you to 
                        be here. You are more than welcome 
                        to walk away.
           Bryce surveys the scene. All the roads are blocked. POLICE 
           are closing in from everywhere. It looks bad.

                                 BRYCE
                        Alright. Yes. I think I will.

           Bryce holsters his machinepistols. Straightens his clothes, 
           fixes his tie. He hands Kiernan the five-euro note that 
           Amelia gave him. A refund.

                                 BRYCE
                        I wish you the best in all your 
                        future endeavors.

           And with that, Bryce simply walks out from under the trees. 
           Hands in the air, heading right for the nearest roadblock.

           Kiernan watches him go. Good riddance. He starts moving in 
           the other direction, staying low --

           -- one of the SEARCHLIGHTS picks up Bryce. A police car and 
           TWO OFFICERS wait at the roadblock. They yell commands in 
           French. Bryce obeys, dropping to his knees.

                                 BRYCE
                        (I’m not a part of this.)

           Now the Officers can see Bryce’s face under the searchlights. 
           One gets on the radio:

                                 OFFICER
                        (It’s not him.)

           The helicopter flies away, the SEARCHLIGHT moves off Bryce -- 

           -- as soon as he’s in darkness, Bryce MOVES -- a couple of 
           quick strikes -- in an instant, he takes down both Officers.

           Bryce sees Kiernan heading the other way --

                                 BRYCE
                        Excuse me, Mr. Kiernan?

           Kiernan turns back. Sees that Bryce has given them a clear 
           path through the perimeter.

                                 BRYCE
                        I was thinking -- if you’re 
                        interested -- you could come over 
                        here and, you know, get away.

           Kiernan swallows his pride. Runs back to Bryce.
           Bryce hurls a STUN GRENADE away from their position -- the 
           BLAST and LIGHT draw the helicopters, giving them a few more 
           seconds of darkness.

           They drag the two unconscious Officers out of sight, then get 
           into the police car. Bryce at the wheel.

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

           Bryce doesn’t start the engine right away. He holds out a 
           hand. Kiernan knows what he wants. He grudgingly gives the 
           five-euro note back to Bryce. Hired.

           Bryce kills the siren lights and headlights. They drive away, 
           a shadow in the dark, unseen by the helicopters. 

           The POLICE swarm Amelia’s building, not realizing they’ve 
           already lost their quarry.

           INT. INTERPOL - DEBRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

           A room meant to be claustrophobic. Amelia sits at the table 
           across from Casoria. Fowler is here, too. Standing against 
           the wall. Baleful.

           Casoria pages slowly through a folder. Letting Amelia sweat -- 
           but she’s not sweating. 

                                 CASORIA
                        I always expected that you would 
                        climb the ladder. But it seems you 
                        have taken command a bit earlier 
                        than I would have liked.

                                 AMELIA
                        Official channels were clearly 
                        compromised. I had to use 
                        unofficial channels. Sir, if I can 
                        continue to overstep my bounds -- 
                        you need to take Kiernan’s face off 
                        the wire. Call off the manhunt. If 
                        we find him, so will Demidov.

           Casoria mulls that over. He flips to a page on Janet.

                                 CASORIA
                        You’re certain Kiernan will go to 
                        the Hague and testify? Given his 
                        skillset, won’t he simply try to 
                        break his ex-wife out of prison?
                                 AMELIA
                        And turn her into a fugitive? Janet 
                        is innocent. She married Kiernan 
                        not knowing what he really was. He 
                        wants her pardoned.

                                 CASORIA
                        Tell me more about these unofficial 
                        channels.

                                 AMELIA
                        He’s an ex-CIA field operative who 
                        now provides personal security to 
                        high-value targets.

                             (beat)
                        Do he and Kiernan know each other?

                                 AMELIA
                        They’ve interacted professionally.

           Casoria digests that. Closes his folder.

                                 CASORIA
                        You’re on indefinite leave pending 
                        a full investigation. You’ll 
                        surrender your credentials outside.

                                 AMELIA
                        Sir.

                                 CASORIA
                             (to Fowler)
                        You too. It’s simply procedure.

           Fowler is visibly stricken. But he’s not about to argue. 
           Casoria motions for Fowler to leave. He does. 

           Casoria leans back in his chair. A little more casual now.

                                 CASORIA
                        Very well. I have decided to do 
                        things your way. Since you’ve given 
                        me no other option.

                                 AMELIA
                        With your permission, I’d still 
                        like to attend the trial. As a 
                        civilian, of course.

           Casoria smiles: she’s got moxie. He nods.
                                 CASORIA
                        Amelia, you realize you are going 
                        to be telling this story for years. 
                        From inside a very large office or 
                        a very small cell.

                                 AMELIA
                        Sir, not to make light, but I 
                        believe the only way Kiernan and 
                        Bryce don’t make it to the Hague is 
                        if they kill each other.

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Dark, set back from the road. Bryce stands watch while 
           Kiernan hotwires a nondescript car.

                                 BRYCE
                        I would have preferred to transport 
                        you in my custom-modified Jaguar 
                        XFR, complete with all my weapons 
                        and gear. But I’m sure we’ll do 
                        fine in this 2002 Shitheap.

                                 KIERNAN
                        This car’s in good working order, 
                        and it blends in. Deal.

                                 BRYCE
                        Back roads for a few hours, then 
                        the expressway... we’ll make the 
                        Hague by dawn. For one night, yes, 
                        I can deal.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Ah, about that. We can’t go to the 
                        Hague just yet. First we have to 
                        make a quick stop in Amsterdam.

                                 BRYCE
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry?

           Kiernan tosses Bryce the cell phone he took off the Attacker. 
           Talks casually as he continues hotwiring the car.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Check out the pictures.

           Bryce scrolls through the photos of the church tattoo; the 
           embedded numbers are visible.
                                 KIERNAN
                        I know how Demidov’s teams operate. 
                        Those numbers are part of a double-
                        blind encryption system, coded with 
                        a substitution cipher. You know 
                        what all those words mean?

                                 BRYCE
                        Funny. The encryption is for...?

                                 KIERNAN
                        It lets them change locations of 
                        their safehouses without being 
                        tracked. The numbers are longitude 
                        and latitude down to the tenth. I 
                        got the key, broke the cipher -- 
                        it’s an address in Amsterdam.

                                 BRYCE
                        Your sleuthing is delightful. But 
                        why would we go there?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Amsterdam’s a port city, a hub for 
                        Demidov’s arms sales. We go to this 
                        address, get some evidence against 
                        Demidov, and bring it to the Hague.

                                 BRYCE
                        Evidence? We don’t need evidence. 
                        We have your testimony.
                             (silence from Kiernan)
                        Your testimony. Against Demidov. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        See, okay. I did jobs for Demidov, 
                        but there were always layers 
                        between me and him. I don’t know 
                        enough to put him away. But it was 
                        my only shot at getting Janet out, 
                        so I had to at least try. But with 
                        actual evidence, I won’t need to 
                        fake it. 
                             (beat)
                        Amsterdam. Good town. It’ll be fun.

           The ENGINE catches. Kiernan’s hotwired it. 

           It takes a lot to make Bryce lose his temper. But this is a 
           lot. He’s now on a slow burn.

                                 BRYCE
                        Ah. Well. This is a fascinating 
                        development. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRYCE (CONT'D)
                        Let me be sure I understand. In 
                        addition to the festivities we’ve 
                        already experienced, now you want 
                        me to come help you infiltrate the 
                        global arms-trafficking operations 
                        of Alexander Demidov and the 
                        Kajekistani Ministry of War. Yes?

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’m not asking you to come. Sure as 
                        hell, I don’t want you to come. But 
                        if I ditched you, you’d hop on the 
                        phone to your girlfriend --

                                 BRYCE
                        -- she’s not my girlfriend --

                                 KIERNAN
                        -- and she’d set Interpol right 
                        back on my trail. So I’m stuck with 
                        you. Now get in the car.

           Bryce stands there. Thinking it over.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mr. Kiernan, I am at your service. 
                        But let’s you and I get very, very 
                        clear about one thing: you are not 
                        stuck with me. You need me. And you 
                        know you need me.

           Now Kiernan’s pissed. He gets out of the car.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Oh? Oh, really? Do you not know who 
                        I am? Hi. Sean Kiernan. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Who cares? I’m Michael Bryce.

           They’re right in each other’s face now --

                          KIERNAN
           I’ve evaded the authorities 
           for years. All of the 
           authorities. There is not a 
           security force on the planet 
           I haven’t beaten. I’ve killed 
           from miles away, from inches 
           away. Anyone and anywhere.
                                                          BRYCE
                                              I have protected monarchs. I 
                                              have protected presidents. 
                                              The U.S. Secret Service has 
                                              hired me to teach them to be 
                                              like me. You could populate a 
                                              small town with the people 
                                              whose lives I’ve saved.  

                                 BRYCE
                        I’ll tell you why you need me --
                                 KIERNAN
                        Yeah, please enlighten me --

           -- Bryce punches Kiernan right in the face.

                                 BRYCE
                        That’s why.

           Kiernan is laid out on the ground, stunned. He truly did not 
           see that coming.

                                 BRYCE
                        Hey, are you hurt? Can you tell?

           As Kiernan recovers, so does Bryce -- he realizes that he 
           completely lost it for a moment.

                                 BRYCE
                        I was making a point. Granted, that 
                        might have been inappropriate.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Oh? Might it have been?

                                 BRYCE
                        I sincerely apologize.

           Kiernan gets to his feet. Bryce takes up a defensive stance, 
           expecting an attack.

                                 KIERNAN
                        No no. I’m not going to retaliate. 
                        I’m going to be the bigger man. 
                        We’ve got work to do.

                                 BRYCE
                        You’re right. Yes. Let’s just get 
                        on the road.

           As they start for the car -- Kiernan throws a sudden flurry 
           of punches at Bryce. And somehow, Bryce blocks them all. 
           Kiernan is shocked -- his punches don’t get blocked often. 

                                 BRYCE
                        I have this job for a reason.

           Kiernan grins. For the first time, Bryce has impressed him. 

           They head for the car -- both going for the driver’s side.

                                 BRYCE
                        Sorry. The client never drives.

           Kiernan’s annoyed. But he goes to the passenger side.
                                 BRYCE
                        Sit in back, please. It’s the 
                        safest place in the vehicle.

           Kiernan reluctantly opens the back door. Gets in.

           INT. STOLEN CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Bryce pulls out. Kiernan sits silently in back, feeling 
           weird. After a moment:

                                 KIERNAN
                        Now this is just stupid.

                                 BRYCE
                        This is standard protocol.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Do I at least get a coloring book?

                                 BRYCE
                        In the event of an attack, you’ll 
                        get down low between the front and 
                        rear seats.

                                 KIERNAN
                        In the event of an attack, I’ll 
                        counter-attack and kill everyone.

                                 BRYCE
                        No, that’s not--

           Tired of the argument, Kiernan settles it by climbing into 
           the front seat. 

           There’s an icy silence. Bryce turns on the RADIO. Static.

                                 BRYCE
                        Can you find a classical station?

                                 KIERNAN
                        And why would I do that?

                                 BRYCE
                        Will you please just look for a 
                        classical station? Can you do even 
                        one thing that I ask you to do?

           Fine. Kiernan turns the dial. Flips through a few stations. 

           Then he grabs ahold of the radio and RIPS the entire unit out 
           of the dashboard.
           Kiernan starts tearing the radio apart with his bare hands. 
           Methodically, piece by piece. Bryce just watches him do it. 
           Finally, Kiernan tosses the demolished radio out the window.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I looked. Didn’t find one.

           They drive on in silence.

                                 BRYCE
                        My telling you what to do... it’s 
                        not meant as an insult. I’m simply 
                        trying to keep you alive. 

                                 KIERNAN
                             (beat)
                        I know. And this isn’t what you 
                        signed up for. But you need to get 
                        that I’m not your usual client. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Fair point. We both need to adapt 
                        to the situation.

                                 KIERNAN
                        For starters, stop with the “Mr. 
                        Kiernan” shite. Call me Sean, I’ll 
                        call you Mike. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Sean it is. Actually, I prefer 
                        Michael. It sounds better.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Does it? 

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m not religious, but Michael is 
                        the archangel of protection. I like 
                        the sound of that. It’s cool.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Is it?
                             (Bryce looks wounded)
                        You’re right. Michael the 
                        archangel. It’s very cool. 

           They drive on in silence.

           INT. FOWLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fowler is on his cell. He’s coming unglued.
                                 FOWLER
                        I have gone beyond the limit for 
                        you. It’s over.

           INT. DEMIDOV’S CELL - NIGHT

           Livitin is on his cell. Demidov sits in a chair, reading a 
           newspaper, as though this whole matter is beneath him.

           INTERCUT

                                 LIVITIN
                        I will double your fee. But nothing 
                        gets paid until we have results. 

                                 FOWLER
                        I’ve been frozen out. They’re about 
                        to investigate. I need to run. So I 
                        need money. Now.

           Livitin throws Demidov a look. Demidov takes the phone.

                                 DEMIDOV
                             (into cell)
                        Agent Fowler. If you are no longer 
                        an asset, you are a liability.

           Fowler freezes. Hangs up. Starts throwing clothes in a bag. 
           Grabs his passport.

           Demidov coolly regards the dead phone. Sets it down.

           Done packing, Fowler goes to the door --

           -- then gets thrown to the ground. TWO MEN. They pin Fowler, 
           one puts a plastic bag over his head --

           -- no wasted motion, these guys are pros --

           -- a third man, IVANOV, carefully steps over them. He stays 
           out of the way. Letting his men do their job.

           Ivanov goes through Fowler’s things, finds his cell. Fowler 
           stops struggling. Dead. 

           Ivanov dials. Livitin answers.

                                 IVANOV
                             (Russian)
                        (It’s been resolved.)
           They hang up. Ivanov’s men -- OLEG and PETR -- put Fowler’s 
           corpse in a bag. They leave with the body and the suitcase -- 
           making it look like Fowler ran.

           END INTERCUT

           Demidov has returned to his newspaper.

                                 DEMIDOV
                        (Look what I have been reduced to. 
                        Executing functionaries.)

           Livitin sits. He’s not eager to say this to Demidov:

                                 LIVITIN
                        (We need to seriously discuss our 
                        contingency plans.)

                                 DEMIDOV
                        (Part of me wants to simply tell 
                        the truth. To say yes, I did it. 
                        Then I could leave that court with 
                        my dignity intact.)

           Livitin smiles. Shakes his head.

                                 LIVITIN
                        (As your lawyer, I would prefer you 
                        didn’t.)

           INT. BRYCE & KIERNAN’S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Road trip. This is when most people would make small talk. 
           But the car is silent. The French countryside rolls away in 
           the darkness.

           Kiernan is antsy. He wants something to do.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Do you need to talk? To stay awake, 
                        I mean.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m fine, thank you. I can stay 
                        awake under my own power.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Alright. But it’s a long drive. And 
                        this car’s got no radio.
                                 BRYCE
                        How did you get into this work? I 
                        mean, how does someone decide, I’m 
                        going to kill people for a living?

                                 KIERNAN
                        That is an excellent question. As a 
                        wee lad, many’s the hour I wiled 
                        away ripping the wings off 
                        butterflies and drowning kittens. 
                        Then one day it hit me: “By Jaysus, 
                        I could make money at this.”

                                 BRYCE
                        I didn’t mean to imply that you’re 
                        a psychopath. Necessarily. But it 
                        is an unusual career choice.

                                 KIERNAN
                             (beat)
                        I fell into it. My father was an 
                        arms dealer. I grew up at his side, 
                        traveling around the world, hanging 
                        out with warlords and guerrilla 
                        fighters. Being around all that so 
                        young, I picked up things. I 
                        started training, got good, got 
                        very good. Dad began hiring me out 
                        to his clients. It went from there.

                                 BRYCE
                        Your own father got you into being 
                        a hitman? My God, what kind of--?

           A dark look from Kiernan: drop it. Bryce does.

                                 BRYCE
                        How I got into protection work is--

                                 KIERNAN
                        --oh, I’m bored already. Because 
                        the CIA pays for shit and it’s a 
                        shit life and you don’t know if 
                        you’re on the right side or not. 
                        I’ve got a better question: how 
                        come Amelia’s not your girlfriend?

                                 BRYCE
                        I’d rather not discuss my personal 
                        life.

                                 KIERNAN
                        What? I told you about my father, 
                        and that was all sad and weepy.
                                 BRYCE
                        There’s nothing weepy about me and 
                        Amelia. 

           Bryce is done talking. Kiernan leans his seat back.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Wake me when you want to switch.

                                 BRYCE
                        We’re not switching.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Don’t be daft. You can’t drive the 
                        whole night through.

           Kiernan closes his eyes. Silence. Then:

                                 BRYCE
                        What I have with Amelia is great. 
                        We have fun when we’re together, 
                        but there are no strings and we can 
                        see other people. Simple as that.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Ah. Ah. But she doesn’t see other 
                        people, now does she?

                                 BRYCE
                        I have no idea. 
                             (beat)
                        She should. I do.

                                 KIERNAN
                        No you don’t.

           Bryce is surprised. And busted.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I can read people. Helps with the 
                        job. So what’s your problem?

                                 BRYCE
                             (beat)
                        I work in an extremely high-risk 
                        profession. Any day, I might not 
                        come home. How can I ask someone to 
                        make a lifelong commitment to me 
                        when I don’t know how much longer 
                        my life will last? 

                                 KIERNAN
                        What does she say about that?
                                 BRYCE
                        That she knows I will come home. 
                        That soldiers get married. Firemen 
                        get married. She doesn’t say 
                        “married,” but you know.

                                 KIERNAN
                        She’s not wrong.

                                 BRYCE
                        This job is the thing I’m good at. 
                        The one thing. I’m not sure I could 
                        keep doing it if I had someone 
                        waiting at home for me.

                                 KIERNAN
                        If it makes you feel better... I 
                        think you’re just okay at your job.

           Bryce laughs. Kiernan closes his eyes. Drifts off.

           LATER

           Kiernan’s driving now; they’ve switched. Bryce is in the 
           passenger seat, asleep -- with a machinepistol in each hand.

           INT. ICC - TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - MORNING

           Demidov’s trial is coming back into session.

           Three JUDGES in a row on a high bench. Moreno and the other 
           PROSECUTORS settling in. Demidov and Livitin at their own 
           table. SPECTATORS filing into the small public gallery. 
           Headphones for translation placed all around.

           Amelia takes her seat in the gallery. She watches as Moreno 
           confers with Casoria. Tension is high. No sign of Kiernan.

           Casoria looks over at Amelia. A dark expression on his face. 

           EXT. AMSTERDAM - SPUISTRAAT - MORNING

           The city’s up and awake. Pedestrians, bicycles, even the 
           occasional car.

           TITLE:

                                  Amsterdam, Netherlands

           Bryce and Kiernan sit at an outdoor cafe at the edge of Dam 
           Square. Bryce with a cappuccino, Kiernan with a black coffee. 
           Bryce has shaved, and he’s still immaculate in his overcoat 
           and suit. Kiernan has not shaved. He’s changed into new 
           clothes to blend in with the locals, but still looks scruffy.

           Bryce has PAPERS laid out in front of him -- architectural 
           blueprints, real estate records, government documents, etc. 
           He’s doing advance work on --

           SPUISTRAAT 294

           A two-story home down the block. Unremarkable in this or any 
           other neighborhood. Kiernan keeps an eye on the front door. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        How’s that cappuccino?

                                 BRYCE
                        Mediocre. Outside of northern 
                        Italy, no one gets the foam right. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        I hate that.

                                 BRYCE
                        That’s just coffee in there, right?

                                 KIERNAN
                        What’s that supposed to mean? 
                        Because I’m Irish, you think I’m a 
                        boozer?

                                 BRYCE
                        I think you’re a “boozer” because 
                        I’ve heard from many sources that 
                        you are. Which I’m sure has no 
                        connection to your being Irish.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I never get pissed on a job. Okay?

                                 BRYCE
                             (re: paperwork)
                        Nothing out of the ordinary. No 
                        modifications on record. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Still no movement out front.

                                 BRYCE
                        Stay here while I do a pass.

           Bryce gets up -- so does Kiernan. He’s coming with.
           EXT. BEHIND SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY

           Bryce and Kiernan stand in the alleyway, with a view of the 
           back door. Bryce points his phone at the house.

                                 BRYCE
                        No heat signatures. I’ll go in 
                        first and clear the structure. Once 
                        I know it’s safe, you can come in.

           As Bryce starts for the back door --

                                 KIERNAN
                        You have a lot of experience 
                        breaking into places, do you?

           Bryce considers that. He stands to the side, keeping watch. 
           Kiernan examines the back door. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        No cameras, no tripwires, no 
                        pressure plates. These boys really 
                        want this place to blend in.

           Kiernan balls up his coat and smashes the back windowpane. 
           Reaches in and unlocks the door. Easy enough.

           Bryce steps forward -- I go in first. Kiernan relents.

           INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY

           The house is sparsely furnished. Everything is orderly and 
           untouched. This looks more like a model home than a place 
           where someone actually lives.

           Bryce does a sweep through the rooms. Kiernan tries to hang 
           back, but it’s not in his nature -- he keeps moving ahead, 
           getting in Bryce’s way. They’re still working out the kinks.

           Fortunately, there’s no threat in the house. The only 
           remarkable thing is a heavy deadbolt on the basement door. 

           As a loud BUS rolls past outside, Kiernan FIRES a single 
           shot, blowing out the deadbolt.

           They descend the stairwell into --

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           Virtually the entire basement is glistening WHITE. All the 
           surfaces are surgically clean. 
           The main area is dominated by a full OPERATING ROOM --
           surgical table, biomonitor, implements -- they’re equipped to 
           perform major surgery down here. 

           A row of empty beds, a generator, stores of food and water. 
           This is a miniature hospital, entirely self-contained.

                                 KIERNAN
                        If I’d left any survivors in Lyon, 
                        they’d be here getting patched up.

           Kiernan starts combing through the basement. Bryce joins him. 
           The men quickly tear the place apart. And...

           ...they find nothing. There’s nothing here that isn’t for 
           medical or survival purposes.

           Kiernan is getting more and more frustrated. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Dammit, dammit...

           Kiernan keeps searching -- going back over places he’s 
           already checked. Bryce knows it’s hopeless.

                                 BRYCE
                        This place has been scrubbed. We 
                        should go.

           Bryce moves for the stairs. Kiernan is fuming.

                                 KIERNAN
                        And do what, then? This is our only 
                        lead.

                                 BRYCE
                        I guarantee you we activated some 
                        sort of alarm when we came in. 
                        Think we’ll be alone much longer?

                                 KIERNAN
                        You’re right. Good. Good thinking.

                                 BRYCE
                        What?

           Kiernan checks his gun.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Whoever comes, we kill all but one. 
                        We get what we need out of him.
                                 BRYCE
                        My job is to keep you alive, I’m 
                        not going to let you--

                                 KIERNAN
                        --let me? Alive’s not good enough. 
                        Without evidence, I can do nothing 
                        for her.

                                 BRYCE
                        We have no idea what’s coming. This 
                        position is impossible to defend. 

           Bryce starts up the stairs, like he’s leaving --

                                 BRYCE
                        Let’s hide upstairs.

           On Kiernan. Good.

           INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - FIRST FLOOR - DAY

           Kiernan and Bryce leave the back and basement doors ajar, 
           then scatter SYRINGES on the ground. Now it looks like 
           junkies broke in and left in a hurry.

           They take up hiding places, Bryce with a view of the street. 
           They settle in to wait.

           Nothing yet. Calm before the storm.

                                 BRYCE
                        Understatement, but you’ve gone 
                        above and beyond. For the court, 
                        for your ex. Maybe they’ll cut your 
                        sentence after all.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Wouldn’t count on that. Got a bit 
                        of a record, you know.

                                 BRYCE
                        If I can ask... what did you tell 
                        your wife you did for a living?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Said I was an intelligence 
                        operative. Top-secret and all. She 
                        believed me until the day Interpol 
                        knocked on our door. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Do you regret it?
                                 KIERNAN
                        Lying to her? Worst thing I’ve ever 
                        done. Really. Being married to her? 
                        Don’t regret a moment of that.
                             (beat)
                        Same as you -- in my line of work, 
                        I knew I could die any day. So I 
                        thought, I’ll grab hold of this 
                        beautiful thing while I can. Life 
                        is short, isn’t it? You and I know 
                        that better than most.

           Bryce stays with that a moment. Then something out the window 
           catches his eye -- 

           EXT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY

           A beat-up van has pulled up out front. Four KAJEKI MEN get 
           out. They’re dressed casually, but SUBMACHINE GUNS are 
           visible under their coats. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Four. Coming in.

           Kiernan takes up a firing position. Bryce considers.

                                 BRYCE
                        We’re in a neighborhood. Gunshots 
                        will bring the police.

                                 KIERNAN
                        What? Now you want to run?

                                 BRYCE
                        No. I want to take them without 
                        firing shots. 

           Kiernan nods. Nice. Let’s do it.

           As the Kajekis come around to the back door, Bryce and 
           Kiernan move into separate rooms.

           The Kajekis come in through the back, GUNS out. They spot the 
           scattered syringes. 

           Two of the Kajekis start clearing the rooms, like Bryce and 
           Kiernan did. The other two head down to the basement.

           The first Kajeki checks one room --

                                 KAJEKI
                             (Russian, subtitled)
                        (Clear.)
           The second Kajeki goes through another --

                                 KAJEKI 2
                        (Clear.)

           It’s routine, smooth. Bryce and Kiernan signal each other, 
           they’ll each take one Kajeki --

           -- now --

           -- Kiernan claps a hand over the first Kajeki’s mouth, stabs 
           him with a SCALPEL, heart and throat -- precision strikes -- 
           he’s done for --

           -- while Bryce presses the muzzle of his Glock against the 
           second Kajeki’s head. Whispers:

                                 BRYCE
                        (Clear.)

           Kajeki 2 can tell Bryce is a pro. He calls out:

                                 KAJEKI 2
                        (Clear. All clear.)

           Kiernan gently lowers the corpse to the ground. Takes the 
           second Kajeki’s gun. Bryce keeps his Glock on him.

                                 BRYCE
                        (You’re lucky you got me.)

           Bryce and Kiernan consider taking their captive and running 
           for it. But they can hear FOOTSTEPS -- the other Kajekis are 
           already on their way back up.

                                 KAJEKI 3 (O.S.)
                        (Nothing down here.)

           Bryce and Kiernan take positions near the stairwell...

                                 KAJEKI 3 (O.S.)
                        (Taras? Yuri? Are you there?)

           Bryce nudges the second Kajeki -- TARAS.

                                 TARAS
                        (Yeah. They must have left.)

           Kajekis 3 and 4 are almost to the first floor, Kiernan and 
           Bryce move to get clear angles...

                                 TARAS
                        (Both of them.)
           Good signal. So much for surprise. Bryce pistol-whips Taras, 
           dropping him --

           -- as 3 and 4 emerge from the basement, SUBMACHINE GUNS 
           coming up --

           -- Kiernan and Bryce are on them, slashing, punching -- 
           wrestling for the guns --

           -- both Kajekis are good fighters, they don’t go down fast -- 
           but they do go down. 3 is dead, and as Kiernan slashes 4’s 
           throat --

                                 BRYCE
                        Get down!

           -- Kiernan dives --

           -- Taras has gotten to a loose submachine gun -- FIRING --

           -- WHAMWHAMWHAMWHAM -- Bryce and Kiernan take cover --

           EXT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY

           The front windows of the house SHATTER, blown out by Taras’s 
           shots -- PEDESTRIANS duck, bewildered --

           INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY

           Bryce dives out from cover and SHOOTS Taras -- once in each 
           shoulder, wounding him.

           He kicks Taras’s gun away, checks him -- he’s bleeding 
           heavily. Starting to fade.

                                 BRYCE
                        I need to stop this bleeding. Help 
                        me get him downstairs.

           But there’s already commotion on the street outside --

                                 KIERNAN
                        No time. Got to do it on the move.

           Kiernan hauls Taras to the door as Bryce races down to the 

           BASEMENT

           and grabs medical supplies, raking bandages and vials into 
           his pockets.
           INT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - FIRST FLOOR - DAY

           Kiernan struggles to keep Taras on his feet. Bryce joins them 
           at the door. SIRENS already closing in. Bryce runs out to --

           EXT. SPUISTRAAT 294 - DAY

           CARS waiting at a light. Most of the vehicles are small and 
           underpowered, but there’s a BMW M3 --

           -- Bryce aims his machinepistol at the M3’s DRIVER.

                                 BRYCE
                        Out.

           The Driver bails. Bryce takes the wheel.

           INT/EXT. BMW M3 (MOVING) / AMSTERDAM STREETS - DAY

           Bryce pulls the car around. Kiernan gets in the back, pulling 
           Taras in with him.

           As Bryce drives away, Kiernan digs into the medical supplies. 
           Rips Taras’s shirt open to treat him. 

           Taras tries to push Kiernan away -- Kiernan calmly holds up 
           his gun in one hand, the bandages in the other.

                                 KIERNAN
                        (Pick one.)

           Taras relents. Kiernan starts dressing his wounds.

           They didn’t get out of there fast enough -- the POLICE have 
           already locked onto them. TWO CARS in pursuit and closing.

           Bryce tears through the cobbled streets and over the bridges 
           of the Canal Loop -- fast, but not flooring it. Staying in 
           control, trying not to kill any PEDESTRIANS and CYCLISTS. 

           In the backseat, Kiernan tries to dress Taras’s wounds -- but 
           he’s having a hard time with it. Blood everywhere. Bryce 
           sneaks a look in the rearview.

                                 BRYCE
                        I realize this goes against your 
                        nature, but the idea is to keep the 
                        blood inside the body.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’m working on it --
           Kiernan glances up -- sees the POLICE CARS closing in -- 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Oh Jaysus, maybe try the gas pedal, 
                        why don’t you?

                                 BRYCE
                        It’s not a getaway if we crash.

           Kiernan rips open a packet of CELOX (clotting powder) and 
           dumps it over one of Taras’s wounds -- Bryce watches --

                                 BRYCE
                        Don’t just sprinkle it, you’ve got 
                        to pack it in --

                                 KIERNAN
                        Will you shut up! And stop driving 
                        in circles. You stay in one area, 
                        the cops will converge --

                                 BRYCE
                        I know what I’m doing --

           Bryce rounds a corner, a POLICE CAR has pulled into the 
           middle of the street ahead of them, blocking the way --

           -- Bryce brakes hard.

                                 KIERNAN
                        No, ram him!

           Bryce ignores Kiernan. Stays on the brake. Once he’s almost 
           to a full stop -- he hits the gas again -- 

           -- and drives right into the cop car. At this low speed, it’s 
           not a crash; he’s just pushing the other car out of the way.

                                 BRYCE
                        Why ram when you can nudge?

           Bryce pushes through -- they’re in the clear again, racing 
           down

           KERKSTRAAT

           It’s a long straightaway, coming up the Magere Brug bridge. 
           But there are more POLICE CARS bearing down on them.

                                 BRYCE
                        Think you can drive better? Because 
                        I know I can do what you’re doing 
                        better.
                                 KIERNAN
                        Give me the wheel.

           Bryce opens the sunroof -- throws the car in neutral -- leaps 
           up to give Kiernan space to crawl in below him --

           -- now Kiernan has the wheel. And he absolutely floors it. 

           Bryce is almost thrown from the car -- he barely manages to 
           climb into the backseat.

           Kiernan drives exactly how you’d expect him to. He’s fierce. 
           He drives straight at the oncoming cop cars -- then cuts at 
           the last second, weaving around them, blasting down the road.

           Almost to the Magere Brug -- it’s a pedestrian-only bridge, 
           but not today -- Kiernan tears down it -- miraculously not 
           killing anyone --

           -- in back, Bryce works on Taras. His hands are sure -- 
           expertly packing in the Celox clotter, applying pressure, and 
           putting on bandages even as the car weaves back and forth.

           Bryce keeps his head down the whole time -- he’s intent on 
           his work, and trying not to watch Kiernan’s driving.

           Kiernan’s cleared the bridge -- now he’s whipping through the

           CITY CENTER 

           He keeps the M3 at full speed, barely slowing even at blind 
           curves, with utter faith in his instincts and reflexes. The 
           POLICE CARS are starting to fall behind.

           Bryce finally looks up -- then looks right back down, shaken.

                                 BRYCE
                             (to Taras)
                        I can stop your blood loss and sew 
                        you up. But it won’t matter because 
                        we’re all going to die.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Not just yet.

           Kiernan cuts down a street -- then has to turn sharply to 
           avoid a LIGHT-RAIL TRAIN as it hums down its track. 

           Kiernan accelerates, driving parallel to the train, the 
           pursuing CARS right behind them. And up ahead --

           -- stalled TRAFFIC. No way to get around it. Kiernan GUNS the 
           engine, straight towards the stopped cars --
           -- he’s racing to get past the train -- the gap is narrowing, 
           there’s just a sliver of daylight --

           -- Kiernan torques the wheel, cuts right across the front of 
           the train -- to the other side, clear --

           -- leaving the police cars behind. Cut off by the train. 

           Kiernan watches the rearview. No pursuit. Bryce checks Taras. 
           Wounds dressed, pulse steady. They did it.

           Kiernan reaches back his hand. Bryce resists for a moment, 
           then slaps it. High five.

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

           Busted windows. Dust on the floor. Taras tied to a chair.

           Kiernan’s handling the interrogation. Bryce sits by the wall, 
           trying his best to get Taras’s blood out of his clothes. He 
           wants no part of this.

           Kiernan paces in front of Taras. Just warming up.

                                 KIERNAN
                        (How’s your English? I have a lot 
                        of bad memories in Russian.)

                                 TARAS
                        English fine.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Nothing to this. I want to know 
                        where Demidov’s operating from, and 
                        what I’ll find when I get inside. 
                        That’s it.

           He gestures to the table. The rest of the medical supplies 
           that Bryce gathered are laid out.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Tell me what I want, and my friend 
                        here will shoot you up with a very 
                        nice psychotropic cocktail. You’ll 
                        see pretty pictures for a few days, 
                        then wake up in a hospital bed, 
                        good as ever. 

           Kiernan pulls out a pen and paper. Ready to take it all down.
                                 KIERNAN
                        But if anything you tell me is 
                        wrong, I’ll know where to find you. 
                        English fine. Let’s have it.

           Taras is silent. Not going to be that easy. Kiernan stands. 
           Starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I travel a lot for work. Been all 
                        over the world. I’ve got souvenirs.

           Kiernan pulls off his shirt.

           As we already know, Kiernan is in phenomenal physical shape. 
           But now we’re seeing something else -- the gallery of SCARS 
           that blanket his torso. 

           These are not battlefield scars.

           Burns, electrical scars, gashes, gouges... every single one 
           looks like it was slow and excruciatingly painful. 

                                 KIERNAN
                             (points to a scar)
                        This one I got from the FARC rebels 
                        in Colombia. I was their guest for 
                        a couple very long weeks.
                             (another scar)
                        This one is from some Congolese 
                        gentlemen.
                             (another scar)
                        North Korean special intelligence. 
                        A lot of pent-up anger in that 
                        country.
                             (another scar)
                        Irish Republican Army, if you can 
                        believe it. Total misunderstanding. 
                        They took me out for pints after. 
                        Good lads.

           Kiernan’s not explaining what exactly was done to him -- he 
           doesn’t need to. 

                                 KIERNAN
                             (another scar)
                        This one... I don’t even remember. 
                        How about that?

           Kiernan moves close to Taras. Stare-down.
                                 KIERNAN
                        You want some souvenirs, too? You 
                        can take a world tour, right here 
                        in this chair. Or talk to me.

           Bryce goes to the door. He cannot watch this. 

           But Taras decided to cooperate a few scars ago.

                                 TARAS
                        Demidov still controls the Ministry 
                        of War. He is making a big weapons 
                        sale. Soon. I don’t know who the 
                        buyer is. They keep it very quiet. 
                        There is a warehouse in Houthaven 
                        port. I tell you exactly the place. 

           Bryce eases back into the room. Kiernan takes a seat, pencil 
           and paper at the ready.

           INT. ICC - HALLWAY - DAY

           The trial is in recess. Demidov waits on a bench. Livitin 
           comes up to him, holding a PHOTO.

           It’s a still from a security camera. A shot of Kiernan and 
           Bryce tearing apart the basement on Spuistraat -- Kiernan’s 
           face is clearly visible.

                                 LIVITIN
                        (I think he wants payback before he 
                        testifies. Your men went after him, 
                        now he’s coming after your men.)

           Demidov studies the photo. 

                                 DEMIDOV
                        (Fortunately, I have many men.)

           EXT. HOUTHAVEN PORT - DAY

           Kiernan observes a warehouse through binoculars. 

           THE WAREHOUSE

           is eight stories tall. One side opens directly onto the 
           expanse of the North Channel, with a wet dock.

           Kiernan can see numerous GUARDS carrying assault weapons. 
           They’re all wary, on alert. Kiernan lowers the binoculars. 
           He’s seen all he needs to.
                                 KIERNAN
                        Our boy steered us right. Give him 
                        his reward. 

           They’ve switched cars again -- something nondescript. Bryce 
           pops the trunk. Taras is inside, bound and gagged. Bryce 
           preps an injection for him.

                                 BRYCE
                        We just hit their safehouse. 
                        They’ll have their guard up.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Know who else had their guard up? 
                        Everyone I’ve ever killed.

           Kiernan gets in the car. As Bryce slides the needle into 
           Taras’s arm --

                                 BRYCE
                        My friend, you are going to enjoy 
                        the next few days considerably more 
                        than I will.

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Bryce and Kiernan lay Taras on the ground. He’s unconscious, 
           twitching like he’s dreaming. They get back in the car.

           INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Kiernan’s driving. Bryce is still unsettled. Kiernan sees it. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        I wasn’t going to do anything to 
                        that guy. Wasn’t necessary.

                                 BRYCE
                             (beat)
                        During my CIA training, they put us 
                        through simulated interrogations. 
                        It wasn’t my favorite.

                                 KIERNAN
                        What happened? Did you break?

                                 BRYCE
                             (yes)
                        I’ve endured plenty of pain in 
                        combat. Being tortured is... 
                        different.
                                 KIERNAN
                             (changing the subject)
                        To get into that warehouse, we’ll 
                        need to gear up in a serious way. 
                        My Amsterdam storehouse is blown.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mine’s not.

           On Kiernan, surprised.

           INT. BRYCE’S STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

           Bryce unlocks the unit, codes-out the alarm. Kiernan follows 
           him in. Bryce hits the lights, revealing --

           -- his own personal armory. An array of GUNS, WEAPONS, and 
           other EQUIPMENT, all carefully laid out.

           Kiernan walks through. Impressed -- and annoyed.

                                 KIERNAN
                        You didn’t think to mention this 
                        earlier? Say, before we walked into 
                        that safehouse?

                                 BRYCE
                        If we had needed to retreat and 
                        resupply, I would have said so.
                             (beat)
                        I felt strange about letting a 
                        hitman browse through all my gear. 
                        But go on, have a look. 

           Bryce hits a button -- classical MUSIC fills the storehouse. 
           Kiernan throws him a look, annoyed.

           Kiernan goes through the inventory. Weapons, medical 
           equipment, surveillance gear, GPS tracking systems... Kiernan 
           evaluates it all with an expert’s eye.

           Bryce unlocks a case holding a SECURE PHONE. He dials.

           INT. ICC - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amelia, despondent, walks into the courtroom with the other 
           SPECTATORS. Her phone BUZZES -- unknown number.

                                 AMELIA
                        Ryder.
                                 BRYCE (ON PHONE)
                        Hey, Ryder. Get to a hardline. 
                        Leave the number on my voicemail.

           Bryce’s voice -- thank God. But Amelia forces herself to look 
           casual. She hangs up and starts down the hall.

           INT. BRYCE’S STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

           Bryce hangs up, then opens a cabinet -- several SUITS and 
           OVERCOATS hang there, all cleaned and pressed. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Seriously?

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m in an image business.

           As Bryce starts changing into fresh clothes, he eyes Kiernan, 
           who looks as scruffy as ever.

                                 BRYCE
                        If you want to spruce up for court, 
                        I might have something in your 
                        size. Could help make a good 
                        impression on the judges.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Ah, not much for the fancy stuff.

           Bryce pulls off his shirt -- Kiernan spots a small SCAR on 
           his torso.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Tangiers! I did hit you. I knew it.

                                 BRYCE
                             (busted)
                        You grazed me. Very slightly.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Didn’t want to admit it in front of 
                        Amelia, did you? 

           Bryce shrugs. Kiernan goes back to browsing. He picks up a 
           HANDGUN with an oversized barrel. Next to it are magazines 
           loaded with RUBBER BULLETS.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Rubber bullets? Are you also 
                        running a day care?
                                 BRYCE
                        Nonlethal rounds. For situations 
                        where there’s a risk of killing 
                        civilians.

                                 KIERNAN
                        You are an archangel.

           Kiernan flips open a RIFLE CASE... and stops cold. He stares 
           into the open case with genuine awe. Inside is a gleaming 
           black SNIPER RIFLE.

                                 BRYCE
                        Yeah.

                                 KIERNAN
                        This is a... 

                                 BRYCE
                        Yeah.

                                 KIERNAN
                        ...a McMillan L15X Super Magnum.

                                 BRYCE
                        Chambered with three thirty eight 
                        Lapua Magnum. Go ahead.

           Kiernan carefully takes the rifle from its case. Fits the 
           scope to the stock. Feels its weight in his hands.

                                 KIERNAN
                        They only made...

                                 BRYCE
                        ...ten of them, before the patent 
                        suit from H&K. Tragedy. Finest 
                        rifle anyone ever shot.

           The MESSAGE LIGHT on Bryce’s secure phone is blinking. He 
           checks his voicemail.

                                 KIERNAN
                        You take care of this, right? You 
                        break it down and re-oil it--?

                                 BRYCE
                        --every two months.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Do it every month.

           Kiernan drops a .338 round into the chamber. While he geeks 
           out with the rifle, Bryce dials a number.
           INT. ICC - SIDE OFFICE - DAY

           Amelia’s alone. Door closed. She picks up in half a ring.

           INTERCUT AMELIA & BRYCE

                                 AMELIA
                        Are you alright and where the hell 
                        are you?

                                 BRYCE
                        We’re both fine. Slight change of 
                        plans, but all is well. 

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank God. You’re not talking to 
                        Amelia now. This is Agent Ryder. 
                        Where are you?

                                 BRYCE
                             (beat)
                        Amsterdam.

                                 AMELIA
                        Really? That is so wonderful. And 
                        how are the hookers, Michael?

                                 BRYCE
                        Long story. We’ll be there soon.

           Kiernan grins -- it’s fun watching Bryce take a scolding.

                                 AMELIA
                        There is too much riding on this. I 
                        need to know what is going on and I 
                        need to be there with you. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Absolutely not. It’s too dangerous.

                                 AMELIA
                        The other option is, I tell Casoria 
                        to put a red notice out on both of 
                        you. That’s you on every wire all 
                        over Europe. What’s it going to be?

                                 BRYCE
                        Can you put Amelia back on?

                                 AMELIA
                        Michael.

           Bryce gives Kiernan a sour look. He’s stuck.
           INT. ICC - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amelia emerges from the side office and heads for the exit, 
           slipping through the milling CROWD. 

           No one takes any notice of her, except --  

           Ivanov.

           He signals to Oleg and Petr. They start tailing her.

           INT. ICC - TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - DAY

           Casoria is taking his seat. His cell phone BUZZES. An email 
           from Amelia: 

           “Trust me for one day more.”

           Casoria sees she’s not in the gallery. Considers his options. 
           Starts to say something to the AGENT next to him -- then 
           holds off. He settles in to wait. Not thrilled about it.

           INT. AMSTERDAM STATION CENTRAAL - DAY

           Amelia gets off the NS train. Heads right for the lockers. 

           Oleg and Petr get off the train a few moments after her. They 
           shadow Amelia, switching off to avoid being spotted. They’re 
           both wearing earpieces.

           AT THE LOCKERS

           Amelia sits on a bench, feels under her seat -- a LOCKER KEY 
           is taped there. She goes to the locker, opens it. Inside: a 
           CELL PHONE. She hits redial.

                                 KIERNAN (ON PHONE)
                        Buy a Metro ticket for the fifty-
                        three line towards Gaasperplas. You 
                        need to be on the next train.

           She’s already moving --

           -- Oleg, seeing Amelia on a cell, pulls a small DEVICE from 
           his bag. Jacks it into his earpiece.  

           As Oleg scrolls through his display, We HEAR snippets of 
           PEOPLE TALKING -- he’s tapping into all the cell-phone 
           conversations around him. His device is an IMSI CATCHER. 

           Oleg keeps scrolling, finds the call he wants: 
                                 AMELIA (ON PHONE)
                        I see it. I’m going there now...

           Oleg follows after her.

           INT. AT THE TICKET KIOSK - DAY

           Ticket in hand, Amelia rushes towards the network of tunnels 
           leading to the Metro trains.

           Oleg trails her, farther back in the crowd of TRAVELERS.

                                 KIERNAN (ON PHONE)
                        Take a seat in the center car. 
                        You’ll lose service. But keep this 
                        phone on you.

           As Amelia goes 

           AROUND A CORNER

           someone falls in next to her -- BRYCE. He puts a finger to 
           his lips. Squeezes her hand, a silent hello.

           As he leads her towards the wall, he plucks the phone from 
           her hand. Kiernan is still giving instructions:

                                 KIERNAN (ON PHONE)
                        Redial this number at every stop 
                        and every time the train goes above 
                        ground...

           Bryce drops the phone into a PASSERBY’s shoulder bag -- then 
           guides Amelia through a SIDE DOOR --

           -- just before Oleg comes around the corner. Oleg scans the 
           crowd -- he’s lost sight of Amelia for the moment, but 
           Kiernan’s VOICE is still in his ear --

           -- Oleg continues walking calmly along.

           INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY

           Bryce shuts the door. Kiernan is here, on a cell. He 
           continues giving decoy instructions into the phone:

                                 KIERNAN
                        ...if we haven’t made contact 
                        again, get off at Gaasperplas. Wait 
                        at the south end of the terminal.
           Bryce wands Amelia with an electronic SENSOR -- sweeping for 
           tracking beacons. She’s clean.

           Kiernan dumps the cell. The three of them run down the 
           corridor, vanishing into the bowels of the station.

           INT. AMSTERDAM STATION CENTRAAL - DAY

           Oleg and Petr are standing outside the 53 train. Frantically 
           scanning the PASSENGERS -- no Amelia. 

           As the train doors close, Ivanov comes down the escalator. 
           Sees the look of defeat on Oleg and Petr. His eyes narrow.

           INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

           The Amsterdam outskirts. Skyscrapers going up everywhere. 
           We’re in the shell of a new building -- high up, with a 
           stunning view of the old city.

           The floor is covered with Bryce’s usual exhaustive advance 
           work -- architectural blueprints, recon photos, maps, etc. 

           Amelia is more than a little unnerved.

                                 AMELIA
                        Guys... isn’t this something you 
                        can hand off to the police?

                                 BRYCE
                        The prosecution has to rest in two 
                        days. To get a warrant, based 
                        solely on the word of a runaway 
                        hitman, would take months.

                                 KIERNAN
                        And if Demidov has eyes inside 
                        Interpol, you know he’s tight with 
                        the local cops.

                                 AMELIA
                        Then your plan is to go in, 
                        commandeer a couple tanks, and 
                        drive them to the Hague?

                                 KIERNAN
                        We don’t need the weapons. The 
                        weapons do nothing for us. We need 
                        the paperwork.
                             (off her look, confused)
                        How much do you know about selling 
                        arms on the black market?
                                 AMELIA
                        It’s not a hobby.

           Kiernan hands her a printout. It’s of an official-looking 
           DOCUMENT, adorned with seals and stamps.

                        This is an “end-user certificate.” 
                        These are how weapons move about 
                        the world. If Kajekistan wants to 
                        sell fifty Stinger missiles to, 
                        say, China, that’s legal. China 
                        just supplies a document certifying 
                        they’re the end user of the 
                        missiles, and the shipment sails 
                        right through. But if you want to 
                        sell those same fifty Stingers to a 
                        bunch of terrorists, that’s a bit 
                        tougher. You can’t hide large-scale 
                        arms inside a banana crate, you 
                        have to ship them in the open. So 
                        you get an end-user certificate 
                        from a legit customer -- either 
                        forge it or bribe somebody -- and 
                        then divert the shipment.

                                 AMELIA
                        So whatever weapons are in that 
                        warehouse --

                                 KIERNAN
                        -- arrived here with fake end-user 
                        certificates. That evidence puts 
                        Demidov away.

                                 BRYCE
                        It’s not glamorous, but it works. 
                        Like getting Capone on tax evasion.

                                 AMELIA
                        But they know you’re coming.

                                 KIERNAN
                        They think I’m coming to kill them. 
                        They don’t know I need evidence.

                                 BRYCE
                        They’re preparing for a full-on 
                        assault. We’re just going to slip 
                        in and take a few papers.

           Amelia is thinking it over. She pulls Bryce aside.
                                 AMELIA
                        I asked you to help. But now this 
                        has gone way beyond. If you’re 
                        doing it for me... don’t.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m doing this because it has to 
                        get done.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I won’t let him get hurt.

           That gets a little smile from Amelia. She nods. Okay.

           INT. BRYCE’S STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

           Kiernan and Bryce preparing for the assault. GUNS and GEAR 
           are spread out everywhere.

                                 KIERNAN
                        When we get in there, don’t expect 
                        me to play the client. This is too 
                        heavy for me to take a backseat.

                                 BRYCE
                        Agreed. You and I work pretty well 
                        together. That means together. 
                        Don’t try to do it all yourself. 

           They keep working. Checking and rechecking.

           INT. AMELIA’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Nothing fancy. Low-end corporate. A KNOCK on the door. 
           Staccato, like a code. Amelia answers. It’s Bryce.

                                 AMELIA
                        I thought you didn’t believe in 
                        pregame activity.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m just here to talk.

           She lets him in. He’s carrying two cans of soda.

                                 BRYCE
                        I know this place isn’t up to our 
                        usual travel standards. But I got 
                        you a gift: a blackcurrant soda. A 
                        local delicacy, available only in 
                        the vending machine down the hall.
                                 AMELIA
                        Ooh.

           They drink. It’s awful. They set the cans down.

                                 BRYCE
                        And that is why. 

                                 AMELIA
                        I shouldn’t have forced you to 
                        bring me up here. I didn’t need to 
                        come. But... I did need to.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m glad you’re here. I told you I 
                        wasn’t doing this for you... 
                             (beat)
                        I’m very good at certain things. 
                        And very bad at everything else.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve never told you how much--

           Amelia senses an “I love you” coming. She stops him.

                                 AMELIA
                        You’re going off to war. You may 
                        not know what you’re feeling. When 
                        this is all over with, if there’s 
                        something you want to say to me...

           Bryce hauls her in for a kiss. With a sudden, fierce 
           intensity. She responds. They need each other now. He moves 
           her to the bed.

           She holds him tightly. She doesn’t want to say it, but she’s 
           afraid for him.

           EXT. HOUTHAVEN PORT - NIGHT

           Dead of night. Everything is still. 

           The only activity in the port is at the warehouse -- it’s 
           being heavily patrolled by Kajekistani COMMANDOS. 

           Several man the roof, some stand guard outside, we see others 
           in the windows. A formidable defense force.

           ON THE WATER

           Several small BOATS are scattered throughout the inlet. 
           Watchposts on the dark water.
           One boat floats close to the warehouse. Two Kajeki COMMANDOS 
           onboard. One checks the time, gets on the radio:

                                 COMMANDO
                             (Russian, subtitled)
                        (Position one. All clear.)

           As soon as he clicks off -- THWIP -- THWIP -- two silenced 
           BULLETS, both Commandos fall --

           -- Kiernan’s head sinks back beneath the surface.

           THE WAREHOUSE

           Kiernan and Bryce swim to it, cutting silently through the 
           water. The outer stone of the building is worn and gouged by 
           erosion -- plenty of handholds.

           Kiernan and Bryce free-climb the structure. Two shadows in 
           black wetsuits. Bryce has a large DUFFEL on his back.

           They reach a lower window. Kiernan peers in. Dark. He pops 
           the hinge with a small pry bar. Lets the glass panel slide 
           into the water.

           They’re in.

           INT. THE WAREHOUSE - SIDE ROOM - NIGHT

           They’re in a small storage space. Empty.

           Bryce unzips the waterproof duffel -- it’s full of WEAPONS 
           and GEAR. They change into dry clothes and start arming 
           themselves. Heavily. 

           Bryce pulls out a small laptop. He types a few commands -- 
           his screen fills with images from numerous SECURITY CAMERAS. 
           He’s hacked into the warehouse’s security system.

           Kajeki COMMANDOS are patrolling everywhere. Looks like there 
           are SEVERAL DOZEN spread throughout the building.

                                 BRYCE
                        Did they bring the whole country?

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’d be insulted if they didn’t.

           Kiernan opens the hallway door, just a crack. Bryce checks 
           the camera feed, making sure the doorway is in a blind spot. 
           It is.
           Bryce and Kiernan watch the movement of the patrols, the 
           patterns. Then they see what they’re looking for -- TWO 
           COMMANDOS heading down the hallway towards them. 

           Kiernan moves to the door -- waits --

           INT. WAREHOUSE - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           A Kajeki OPERATOR sits at a huge bank of MONITORS. He’s 
           watching the same footage as Bryce and Kiernan. We see the 
           two Commandos walk out of frame -- 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           -- Kiernan steps into the doorway -- THWIP -- THWIP -- he 
           SHOOTS both Commandos -- they drag the bodies into the

           SIDE ROOM

           Bryce and Kiernan put on the Commandos’ coats and hats, and 
           take their radios.

           A few more clicks on the laptop -- now the SECURITY FEED is 
           transferred to Bryce’s PHONE. They’ll have eyes on the whole 
           building as they move. They head into the empty hallway.

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           To the Operator, it all appears normal. Bryce and Kiernan, 
           now wearing the Commandos’ clothes, look like just another 
           patrol team moving down the hall.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Bryce has memorized the building’s layout, and he can watch 
           the other patrols on his phone. He and Kiernan slip through 
           the warehouse, changing directions and ducking into side 
           rooms to avoid running into anyone. 

           It’s not easy -- the warehouse is crawling with COMMANDOS -- 
           but so far, so good. 

           Bryce opens an old FUSE BOX and clips a small ELECTRONIC 
           DEVICE to the switches. Then they head into --

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Cameras on every landing. Fewer outs now. 
           They quickly climb a few floors. Bryce keeps an eye on the 
           security feed -- problem --

           -- two COMMANDOS are about to enter the stairwell a few 
           floors above them --

           -- Bryce yanks Kiernan through a doorway --

           INT. FOURTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           An exposed walkway; they stand back out of sight. They can 
           see more patrolling COMMANDOS, mostly on the lower floors. 

           Now they also have a view of the cavernous interior of the 
           warehouse --

           -- and the huge cache of WEAPONS arrayed on the bottom level. 

           Mostly large sealed CRATES, but we can see a few surface-to-
           air MISSILE LAUNCHERS and several FAST-ATTACK VEHICLES -- 
           open jeeps with machine guns mounted on them. There are also 
           rows of EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE, heavy SHOULDER-MOUNTED WEAPONS...

           ...Bryce keeps watching his phone -- bigger problem --

           -- more COMMANDOS are about to come around the corner -- the 
           two Commandos on the stairs are heading down to their floor -- 
           they’re going to be boxed in.

           They slip back into the stairwell, the least bad option --

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           The two Commandos come down the stairs. Bryce and Kiernan 
           lower their heads and walk by, mumbling a greeting --

           -- the Commandos nod hello and walk past, it worked --

           -- no, it didn’t. The second Commando turns back, wanting a 
           better look, going for his radio -- 

           -- a KNIFE appears in Kiernan’s hand, Bryce hits a button on 
           his phone --

           INT. FIRST-FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The fuse box that Bryce rigged -- a tiny POP from within -- 
           the LIGHTBULBS along the hall flash and EXPLODE --
           INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           The FLASH of the exploding bulbs draws the Operator’s eye to 
           that screen, so he’s not watching --

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           -- Kiernan quickly kills both Commandos. Bryce and Kiernan 
           each grab a corpse and haul them up a few more steps to --

           INT. FIFTH FLOOR - NIGHT

           They dump the Commandos’ bodies in a blind spot.

           Glassed-in offices ring the perimeter of the warehouse, 
           connected by walkways. Bryce and Kiernan head for a small 
           office. They’re almost running now.

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           The Operator scans the hall where the light bulbs popped. He 
           completely missed Bryce and Kiernan killing the Commandos.

           INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT

           Bryce and Kiernan slip inside. A couple of desks and a heavy 
           SAFE in one corner. Jackpot. Kiernan quickly examines it. 
           Bryce stands guard, checking his phone --

           -- two more COMMANDOS have entered the stairwell where they 
           just killed the other two. Bryce can only watch as they take 
           a look around --

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Bryce and Kiernan cleared the bodies, so the Commandos don’t 
           see anything unusual. But as they start down the stairs --

           -- one notices a dark stain on the floor. He touches it --

           -- fresh blood. He fumbles for his radio.

           INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT

           The radios Bryce and Kiernan took off the Commandos start 
           CRACKLING. Yelling in RUSSIAN, overlapping voices.

           They just got made. Bryce hits a button on his phone --
           INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           On the MONITORS, we see COMMANDOS racing around -- the whole 
           warehouse is going into battle mode. Then -- all the screens 
           go BLACK. Bryce just killed their feed.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

           Ivanov is here among the crates, flanked by Oleg and Petr. As 
           the ALARM sounds, he gets very still. Thinking, calculating.

           INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT

           Kiernan has checked out the safe --

                                 KIERNAN
                        This would take hours to crack. 
                        Going to have to blow it.

           Bryce doesn’t like that, but there’s no choice. Kiernan packs 
           C-4 EXPLOSIVE around the safe’s hinges -- they stand back --

           -- BOOM.

           ON THE LOWER FLOORS

           There was no missing the EXPLOSION. The Commandos zero in on 
           Kiernan and Bryce.

           INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT

           Bryce extinguishes the last of the FLAMES -- Kiernan kicks 
           away the charred, mangled door -- digs through the safe --

                                 KIERNAN
                        Got em. Got em.

           Kiernan pulls out a sheaf of documents -- END-USER 
           CERTIFICATES, like what he showed Amelia. He flips through -- 

                                 BRYCE
                        We’re good?

                                 KIERNAN
                        We’re perfect. 

           Kiernan opens a thin METAL CASE -- slips the certificates 
           inside, then straps it to his chest. 

           They move back into the
           HALLWAY

           and dump their silenced weapons. Bryce draws his 
           machinepistols, and Kiernan hoists a SUBMACHINE GUN. 

           The stealth portion of the evening is now over.

           They encounter resistance right away. Several COMMANDOS pour 
           out of the stairwell --

           -- but Bryce is still wired into the security cameras through 
           his phone, he can see the attacks coming --

           -- he and Kiernan tear the Commandos apart. Once everyone is 
           dead, they step over the bodies and run into the

           STAIRWELL

           both FIRING, dropping more Commandos.

           Then it gets quiet for a moment. The rest of the Commandos 
           haven’t gotten to them yet. And Bryce and Kiernan --

           -- do nothing. 

           They’re on the fifth floor of an eight-story building, with 
           several dozen armed men racing up towards them, and -- 

           -- they just wait.

           They calmly reload, listening to the FOOTSTEPS pounding up 
           towards them, getting closer... and... now.

           Bryce and Kiernan run up the stairs --

           INT. EXIT STAIRS - NIGHT

           They’re one flight below the roof. 

           Kiernan lays more C-4 EXPLOSIVE at the base of the final 
           staircase. He and Bryce run up to the 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           and get the drop on the two COMMANDOS still at their posts, 
           killing them both. 

           They’re alone on the roof. But not for long, because the 
           Commandos are almost to the final stairwell --

           -- Kiernan pulls out a DETONATOR, punches the button --
           -- BLOWING THE STAIRCASE beneath them. There’s no way to get 
           onto the roof now. Or to get off it.

           The BOATS have drawn in closer -- their SEARCHLIGHTS 
           illuminate the inlet. A water escape’s no good. 

           But Bryce and Kiernan are already running to the other side 
           of the building -- solid ground below. They put on CLIMBING 
           HARNESSES, uncoil ROPES, and fix an ANCHOR into the roof. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Ivanov was in the crowd of Commandos going for the roof -- as 
           the SMOKE clears from the explosion, his Commandos are 
           confused, YELLING --

                                 IVANOV
                        (Quiet! Everyone quiet.)

           He listens. Nothing.

                                 IVANOV
                        (No helicopter... everyone get to 
                        the windows.)

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           Bryce and Kiernan RAPPEL down the face of the building. 

           Bryce is harnessed with his back to the ground, Kiernan is 
           facing the ground -- between them, they have a 360-degree 
           range of fire.

           COMMANDOS begin appearing at the windows, trying to get a 
           lock on their position -- Bryce and Kiernan open FIRE at 
           every face that emerges -- it’s vertical Wack-A-Mole.

           They’ve dropped their ropes directly between windows, so the 
           Commandos can’t reach them. 

           Then the recoil from a burst pushes Kiernan too close to a 
           window -- just as a COMMANDO leans out -- Kiernan knocks the 
           Commando’s gun aside -- 

           -- but the Commando grabs onto Kiernan -- he’s trying to tear 
           Kiernan’s hands off the rope, sending him into free-fall --

           -- Bryce laying down COVER FIRE --

           -- Kiernan has to let go of his GUN -- it clatters all the 
           way to the ground as he wrestles with the Commando -- he’s 
           barely hanging on --
           -- Kiernan clamps down on his descender, locking himself in 
           place on the rope -- has both hands free now -- 

           -- he grabs the slack rope beneath him, wraps it around the 
           Commando’s neck -- hauls him out of the window --

           -- Kiernan THROTTLES the Commando with his climbing rope. The 
           Commando goes limp, his neck broken --

           -- Kiernan lets the body fall to the ground. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Coming to you!

           Bryce throws Kiernan a fresh SUBMACHINE GUN. Kiernan plucks 
           the weapon out of the air, is FIRING a quarter-second later.

           As Bryce continues his descent -- a sudden JERK on his rope. 
           He looks up --

           AT A WINDOW

           high above him, another COMMANDO has climbed out on the 
           ledge, he’s cutting through Bryce’s rope --

           -- Bryce FIRES -- killing the Commando -- the body falls 
           straight towards him, Bryce swings to dodge -- his rope is 
           now FRAYING where the Commando cut it. Almost gone --

           -- Bryce swings to a ledge, scrambling for a firm grip -- 
           just as his rope BREAKS --

           -- Bryce FALLS -- catches himself on the ledge -- slowly 
           pulling himself up --

           -- another COMMANDO bursts into the room Bryce is hanging 
           outside of -- Bryce drops back down, dangling from the 
           window, making himself a small target --

           -- the Commando runs to the window and leans down, FIRING -- 
           but Bryce isn’t there. 

           Bryce is now standing on the ledge, off to the side -- he 
           SHOOTS the Commando point-blank. Bryce climbs back

           INSIDE

           He uncoils a fresh rope, secures it to a pipe, hooks in -- 
           ready. He swings back

           OUTSIDE

           He and Kiernan continue their descent, side-by-side -- then a 
           sudden TUG on Kiernan’s rope -- they look up --
           -- now Kiernan’s rope is being cut, by another COMMANDO. 

                                 BRYCE
                        To me!

           Bryce swings towards Kiernan, Kiernan towards him --

           -- as Kiernan’s rope is sliced clean through -- Kiernan is 
           free in space, he jumps for it, pushing off the building -- 

           -- and catches ahold of Bryce’s rope.

           Kiernan’s hanging just above Bryce, but he’s not hooked in. 
           It’s only a few more stories to the ground --

                                 BRYCE
                        Go?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Go!

           -- Bryce unhooks himself, too --

           -- they FAST-ROPE straight down -- a pure free-fall, with 
           just the friction of their bodies on the rope to slow them. 

           Bryce lands first, clears the ground for Kiernan. He hurls a 
           STUN GRENADE into the air -- it detonates, blinding the 
           Commandos at the windows --

           -- as Kiernan lands, a little too hard, on his bad leg --

           -- Kiernan gets up limping, but he can still move. They run 
           along the side of the warehouse, into the darkness -- 

           INT. FIFTH-FLOOR OFFICE - NIGHT

           Far from the combat, Ivanov runs into the office. He sees the 
           exploded safe, the scattered papers -- realization hits.

           He knows what they came here for.

           EXT. HOUTHAVEN PORT - NIGHT

           Bryce and Kiernan run away from the warehouse, towards a high 
           fence. Beyond it, the outer ring of the AMSTERDAM CANALS --

           -- and Amelia, waiting in a SPEEDBOAT.

           Bryce has a few steps on Kiernan -- he scales the fence, 
           perches on top, turns around --
           -- and FIRES on the Commandos pouring out of the warehouse.

           Kiernan gets to the fence. Tries to climb -- can’t. His leg 
           won’t take the weight.

           Bryce reaches his hand down -- Kiernan’s about to grab it, 
           but then he sees -- 

           ON THE WATER

           The Kajekis’ SPEEDBOATS are roaring out of the inlet, heading 
           for the canals. 

           The speedboat escape won’t be a clean getaway.

           AT THE FENCE

           Kiernan watches the boats close in. He pulls his hand back. 
           He’s not going over the fence. 

                                 BRYCE
                        What are you doing--?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Draw them away from me. I’ll meet 
                        you at the rendezvous.

           Kiernan’s serious, he’s going to run for it on his own --

                                 BRYCE
                        Sean, no--!

           The Commandos running out of the warehouse are closing in, 
           FIRING -- Bryce is an easy target up on the fence. He jumps 
           down, landing on the canal side.

           Bryce and Kiernan face each other across the fence. A final 
           moment before they split up.

                                 BRYCE
                        We have a speedboat. You’re on 
                        foot. At least give me the case. 

           Kiernan unstraps the case, almost throws it over -- doesn’t.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’ll make it.

           Kiernan tucks the case under his arm. Runs. Bryce doesn’t 
           waste time on anger. He runs to the
           EXT. CANAL - NIGHT

           and leaps into the speedboat. Amelia guns the ENGINE --

                                 BRYCE
                        He’s got the certificates.

                                 AMELIA
                        Where the hell is he going?

                                 BRYCE
                        I’ll tell you in a second.

           Bryce opens a compartment, pulls out a GPS TRACKER -- we saw 
           it in his storage unit. He powers it up. 

                                 BRYCE
                        I put a beacon on him in case he 
                        did something incredibly stupid. 
                        Like exactly this.

           Bryce takes the helm. Turns them to follow Kiernan.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT

           Kiernan knifes through the narrow streets, trying to 
           disappear into the city. If he was healthy, he could do it -- 
           but now he’s down a step.

           FOOTSTEPS and car ENGINES are all around him. The Commandos 
           closing in.

           EXT. SPEEDBOAT (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Bryce tries to stay close to Kiernan, following the BEACON 
           display on his tracker. 

           But the two KAJEKI SPEEDBOATS are coming up from behind -- 

                                 BRYCE
                        Get down!

           Amelia hits the deck as GUNFIRE from the pursuing boats 
           caroms off the canal walls. 

           Bryce evades, whipping under a bridge. He rips something from 
           his belt -- chunks of C-4 and DETONATORS.

                                 BRYCE
                        Rig these.

           As Amelia jams a detonator into each chunk of C-4 --
           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT

           Kiernan runs up a staircase, starts racing across the

           ROOFTOPS

           The Commandos are everywhere, swarming, trying to get a bead 
           on him from the street.

           Kiernan ignores the pain -- through sheer force of will -- 
           somehow, he’s almost at a full sprint.

           EXT. CANALS - NIGHT

           Bryce is still cat-and-mouse with the Kajeki speedboats. 
           Amelia’s wired each chunk of C-4 with a detonator.

           They’re coming up on a tight turn -- a line of ROWBOATS is 
           tied up by the wall.

                                 BRYCE
                        Throw them in.

           As Bryce whips through the turn, Amelia hurls chunks of C-4 
           into the empty boats.

           Bryce grabs the REMOTE DETONATOR -- as the pursuing boats 
           come around the turn, he hits the button --

           -- all the C-4 charges go off at once.

           The BLAST engulfs the pursuing speedboats --

           -- both Kajeki boats are now dead FIREBALLS on the water.

           Bryce checks the tracking beacon. He guns the engine -- back 
           in pursuit of Kiernan. 

           EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

           Kiernan comes to a gap in the roofs, he’ll have to jump it -- 
           he forces himself to sprint even faster, ignoring the pain --

           -- Kiernan reaches the edge of the roof, springs off, JUMPS --

           -- and makes it. Just barely. He almost cries out from the 
           pain in his leg -- but he’s still going.
           EXT. CANALS - NIGHT

           Bryce checks the beacon -- Kiernan’s close. He brings the 
           boat to a stop by the wall. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Get clear of here. We’ll meet you 
                        at the rendezvous. 

           Bryce climbs onto solid ground. Amelia takes the helm and 
           speeds off into the darkness.

           Bryce runs down the street, GPS tracker in hand. Hunting.

           EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

           Kiernan, still going. He comes to another gap in the roofs, 
           makes another jump --

           -- but as he’s in midair --

           ON THE STREET BELOW

           -- Petr is there, waiting, he has a clear shot, FIRES --

           -- the BULLET tears into Kiernan’s arm, the one holding the 
           metal case --

           -- Kiernan lands on the far roof, he made it -- but the 
           impact JARS THE CASE LOOSE --

           -- Kiernan is still rolling forward, the case is sliding away 
           from him, he tries to turn, counter his momentum --

           -- the case now skittering towards the edge of the roof --

           -- Kiernan diving for it -- almost to it -- 

           -- no -- 

           -- THE CASE GOES OFF THE ROOF. 

           Kiernan runs forward, peers over the edge -- and almost gets 
           torn apart by a fusillade of BULLETS from below.

           The case has fallen into a group of COMMANDOS. They unload on 
           Kiernan -- it’s a wall of lead. Nothing he can do.

           More Commandos are racing across the rooftops, closing. 
           Kiernan runs to another edge of the roof, leaps onto a 

           BALCONY
           with a view of where the case fell. Petr has already scooped 
           it up -- throws it into a waiting SUV -- the ENGINE guns -- 

           -- gone. The case is gone.

           Kiernan just stands there. Shattered. Oblivious to the danger 
           around him. For the moment, he just does not care.

           INT. SUV (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Ivanov is in the back seat. He opens the case. Flips through 
           the end-user certificates. On his cell:

                                 IVANOV
                        (I’ve recovered the items.)

           INT. LIVITIN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Livitin, on his cell. 

                                 LIVITIN
                        (Now clear the warehouse. And get 
                        both men. I want this done with.)

           INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           KAJEKIS are securing the weapons for transport. Loading them 
           onto trucks. Frantic, working double-time.

           EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

           The Commandos race to the edge of the roof, reaching the 

           BALCONY

           where we last saw Kiernan. But now he’s gone.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT

           Kiernan hobbles down the street, making his escape. Numb. 

           He stops. Leans against a building. Even with his phenomenal 
           conditioning and pain tolerance... he’s spent. 

           SIRENS, but far away. And no sign of the Commandos. 

           There’s a church across the street. Kiernan tries the door. 
           It’s open. He goes in.
           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           Kiernan’s not a religious man. Just needs a quiet place. He 
           sits in a back pew. Stares at nothing. Closes his eyes.

           When he hears a GUN being cocked, he doesn’t even react. 
           Maybe he’s hoping it’s over.

           Bryce has come in. Kiernan is mildly surprised to see him.

           Bryce is about to ask -- but he can see Kiernan’s empty 
           hands. The expression on his face. The question isn’t even 
           necessary.

           Bryce sits. Both men are on empty.

                                 BRYCE
                        By now, they’ve rolled up the whole 
                        operation. Cleared the warehouse.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Yeah.

                                 BRYCE
                        That was our shot.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Yeah. How did you find me?

           Bryce touches the back of his neck. Kiernan reaches -- finds 
           the tiny TRACKING BEACON hooked into the back of his shirt.

           A tired smile from Kiernan. It’s almost funny to him.

                                 BRYCE
                        What now? Do you testify?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Might as well. I’ll be at the hotel 
                        for awhile, working on my leg.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m going to the rendezvous. I need 
                        to tell Amelia what’s happened.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I can get to the Hague by myself.

                                 BRYCE
                             (beat)
                        Is that how you want it?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Put you through enough, haven’t I?
           Bryce goes to Kiernan. Hands him something: the five-euro 
           note. That’s their goodbye. As Bryce heads for the door --

                                 KIERNAN
                        Michael.
                             (Bryce stops)
                        My life got set on a path early. By 
                        the time I was old enough to know 
                        what I wanted for myself, I was 
                        already a fugitive on three 
                        continents. Janet and I never had a 
                        chance. My life was always going to 
                        catch up to me someday.
                             (beat)
                        You found a good girl. Don’t screw 
                        it up. That’s the last of the moral 
                        guidance from Sean Kiernan.

           Bryce leaves.

           EXT. AMSTERDAM STREETS - NIGHT

           Bryce walks through the empty streets. No need to hurry now. 
           On the horizon -- FIRST LIGHT. 

           The city is just starting to glow under the sun. 

           As Bryce takes in the beauty of it all... there’s almost no 
           change in his stride or expression -- he’s careful not to 
           betray a reaction, but -- he knows he’s not alone.

           The threat is close. Bryce scans the streets and alleys, 
           mapping escape routes. And now --

           -- he breaks into a sprint, MACHINEPISTOLS out -- he SHOOTS 
           the two KAJEKIS lying in wait ahead of him --

           -- but MORE KAJEKIS pour out of the alleys, he’s surrounded --

           -- a soft POP, a BUZZ -- Bryce is struck by two TASER DARTS -- 
           he goes down. His guns go flying.

           SIX KAJEKIS descend on him. Bryce recovers, draws a KNIFE, 
           kills one but then loses his blade, now it’s hand-to-hand, 
           Bryce is a blur, a machine --

           -- it takes all five Kajekis to finally bring him down.

           Zipcuffs. Duct tape. Captured. An SUV tears out of the alley, 
           they bundle Bryce inside, flooring it --
           INT. SUV (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           Ivanov sits across from Bryce. Holding the metal case. 

           Bryce only has a moment to appreciate the irony -- the 
           certificates are right in front of him -- before the hood is 
           pulled down over his head.

           INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING

           The rendezvous point. Kiernan limps up the stairs. He’s 
           carrying a nearly-empty bottle of whiskey. He’s hammered.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Hey. Guys? Hello?

           But he’s the only one here. To the empty space:

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’m sorry. I am really sorry. 
                        There, I said it. Can I go now?

           He wanders over to the edge to catch the view. Spots a large 
           PACKAGE tucked behind a pillar, wrapped in plain brown paper. 
           A note on top: “Sean.” He opens it, reads:

           “I doubt they’ll let you keep this in your cell. But I want 
           you to have it. Michael.”

           Kiernan unwraps the paper -- it’s Bryce’s SNIPER RIFLE. 

           Footsteps on the stairs. Amelia.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Ah, Amelia. It’s a long story. With 
                        an unhappy ending.

           That hits her hard. But even worse --

                                 AMELIA
                        Michael’s not with you--? 

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’m sure he’ll be along soon.

                                 AMELIA
                        He’s never late. For anything.

           Fear in her eyes.
           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           The hood is pulled off Bryce’s head. A bright LIGHT shines 
           down on him. He’s tied to a table, spread-eagle. 

           Ivanov, Oleg, Petr, and a few other KAJEKIS all around him. 
           Ivanov pulls up a chair so they can chat.

                                 IVANOV
                        You know what these are, yes?

           Of course -- Ivanov is holding up the stack of end-user 
           certificates, tucked in the metal case. 

                                 IVANOV
                        I believe we have all of them back. 
                        Am I correct?
                             (Bryce nods)
                        Good. Then we have only one more 
                        small piece of business. Where is 
                        Sean Kiernan?

                                 BRYCE
                        I have no idea. 

           Bryce is a good liar. But not good enough to beat Ivanov. 

                                 IVANOV
                        You are Michael Bryce, formerly of 
                        the Central Intelligence Agency. I 
                        showed your picture to some 
                        associates. You are well-known in 
                        certain circles.

           Ivanov gestures for Oleg to come over. He’s carrying 
           something. Bryce strains, trying to see...

                                 IVANOV
                        I heard a story about you being 
                        interrogated.

           Oleg is carrying a CAR BATTERY. 

           Bryce goes white. He’s been through this before. He tries to 
           put on a brave face, but finds himself pulling desperately at 
           his bonds. 

                                 IVANOV
                        Memories, yes? A bit old-fashioned, 
                        but so effective.
                             (Russian, to the others)
                        (This won’t take long.)
           The others LAUGH. Bryce’s breathing is fast, jagged. He’s 
           almost hyperventilating. He knows exactly what’s coming. 

           Oleg wraps a leather strap around Bryce’s head. Connects the 
           wires at his temples. Two more wires go around his feet. 
           Ready to go.

                                 IVANOV
                        Where is Sean Kiernan?

           Bryce doesn’t answer. Trying to prepare himself. Ivanov 
           signals. As Oleg brings the wires to the battery -- 

                                 BRYCE
                        Wait. Wait wait wait.

           Oleg stops. A faint smile from Ivanov.

                                 BRYCE
                        Kiernan needed the certificates 
                        because he has no testimony. Do you 
                        understand? He’s not dangerous to 
                        you now. He doesn’t matter.

                                 IVANOV
                        I see. This is good. If Kiernan 
                        does not matter, then you can tell 
                        me where he is. It’s of no concern. 
                        So. Where is he?

                                 BRYCE
                             (beat)
                        Don’t.

           Ivanov signals -- Oleg touches the wires to the battery, 
           COMPLETING THE CIRCUIT -- 

           -- Bryce HOWLS. He shakes and thrashes against his bonds. His 
           body convulses as the CURRENT surges through him. 

           This goes on for some time. 

           At last, Oleg turns off the power.

           Bryce pulls in huge, teary panic breaths.

           This isn’t a hardened operative absorbing punishment. The 
           agony is instant and overwhelming. 

           Bryce just wants it to stop.

                                 IVANOV
                        Where is Sean Kiernan?
           Bryce almost gives him the answer. He almost does. But he 
           holds back. Ivanov signals -- the CURRENT is turned back on. 

           Bryce SCREAMS. Ivanov watches, impassive. Oleg starts to turn 
           the power off -- Ivanov signals him to keep going.

           Thin tendrils of SMOKE begin to rise from Bryce’s temples.

           The other Kajekis turn away. Even for them, this is hard to 
           watch. Finally, the power is turned off.

                                 IVANOV
                        Where is Sean Kiernan?

                                 BRYCE
                        He’s... somewhere safe.
                             (beat)
                        He’s very, very safe.

           Ivanov is surprised. They all are. It looked like this was 
           over. But Bryce just went deeper inside himself. And found 
           something more.

           Ivanov motions Petr to come over. He’s wearing heavy rubber 
           gloves. Carrying something.

           It’s nothing out of the ordinary -- just a plastic bucket, 
           full of WATER. Petr pours out a little so Bryce can see.

                                 BRYCE
                        Go ahead, asshole.

           Petr DOUSES Bryce with the water -- 

           -- the POWER is turned back on, the CURRENT flows again -- 
           the water conducts it throughout Bryce’s body --

           -- it’s an entirely new level of pain -- SPARKS pop and fly --

           -- but Bryce doesn’t talk. He doesn’t even scream. 

           He simply endures.

           Lost in the agony, Bryce’s vision BLURS. Everything goes 
           fuzzy. He’s only dimly aware as a few BURSTS of LIGHT begin 
           to appear at the edges of his vision.

           They’re MUZZLE FLASHES. 

           One, then another, then another... then many more.

           Bryce doesn’t even realize what’s happening:

           KIERNAN IS KILLING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.
           Even drunk -- and he most certainly is drunk -- Kiernan’s 
           utterly lethal. It doesn’t take him long.

           Kiernan stops firing. He knows he’s killed everybody, but for 
           a moment, he’s not sure where he is.

           Bryce is slowly coming back to the world. Now Kiernan is 
           standing over him, undoing his bonds. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        I didn’t trust you, either.

           Kiernan pulls something off Bryce’s pant leg -- a tiny 
           TRACKING BEACON.

                                 KIERNAN
                        But damn, I should have.

           Kiernan clasps Bryce’s hand. He’s holding something -- the 
           five-euro note. He’s giving it back to Bryce.

                                 BRYCE
                        Are you drunk?

                                 KIERNAN
                        Aye.

           Bryce smiles. He looks off to the side. Kiernan follows his 
           gaze... to the metal case, holding the end-user certificates.

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Amelia waiting anxiously. Hand on her gun.

           Bryce and Kiernan stumble out of the building. Not a pretty 
           sight. Kiernan is limping and drunk, Bryce is still weak from 
           the torture. But they’re triumphant -- they’ve got the case.

           Amelia runs to them. She can see that Bryce has been through 
           something horrible. She looks in his eyes: what happened?

                                 BRYCE
                        They... uh... 
                             (beat)
                        They tore my shirt. I really liked 
                        this shirt.

           She embraces him. Gently.
           INT. A VAN (MOVING) - DAY

           They’re on their way to the Hague. Amelia’s driving. Kiernan 
           is riding shotgun and pounding coffee. Bryce is laid out in 
           back, still recovering.

           Kiernan flips on the RADIO and finds a classical station. A 
           gesture for Bryce.

                                 BRYCE
                        Oh, this is a great piece. It’s 
                        Beethoven’s third symphony, the 
                        maturation of his middle period. 
                        It’s also known as the “Eroica”--

           Kiernan turns around and stares hard at Bryce: don’t push it. 
           Bryce stops talking.

           To Kiernan, quietly, so Bryce doesn’t hear:

                                 AMELIA
                        Thank you.

           INT. ICC - SIDE ROOM - DAY

           Livitin and Demidov. Livitin closes his cell phone. Furious. 
           Wants to punch the wall.

                                 LIVITIN
                        (He hasn’t gotten here yet. We 
                        still have a chance to stop him.)

           Demidov is calm. And still. A coiled serpent.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

           Bryce and Amelia standing outside the van. They’re on a hill 
           overlooking a broad plain. 

           TITLE:

                                  The Hague, Netherlands

           The coastline is visible in the distance. The Hague is 
           dominated by a huge building, angular and gleaming white: 

           The HAAGSE ARC. 

           This is the seat of the International Criminal Court.
           Blue-helmeted UNITED NATIONS TROOPS have established a 
           security perimeter all around the Arc. Most of the 
           surrounding roads have been closed down.

           Everything looks quiet. Under control.

           Bryce has cleaned up and changed into a fresh suit. He’s got 
           a FOLDER full of blueprints and building diagrams -- advance 
           work on the Arc. He watches the plain below with binoculars.

           THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

           Bryce observes several VEHICLES doing patrols just outside 
           the security perimeter. They’re definitely not UN personnel -- 
           KAJEKI COMMANDOS. Demidov’s final line of defense.

           Bryce observes the pattern of the patrols -- in particular, a 
           BLACK VAN with tinted windows. 

           Kiernan climbs out of the van. He’s sobered up. Surprisingly, 
           he’s now wearing a sportcoat. It looks good -- but he hates 
           it. He rips the coat off. Sticking with his usual look.

                                 BRYCE
                        Let’s go to court.

           Amelia dials a cell phone.

           INT. HAAGSE ARC - HALLWAY - DAY

           Casoria steps out of the trial chamber to answer his cell. 

                                 CASORIA
                        Casoria.

           INTERCUT CASORIA & AMELIA

                                 AMELIA
                        It’s Ryder. Call me back from a 
                        landline. We need to discuss the 
                        plans for my very large office.

           Casoria breaks into a huge grin.

           INT./EXT. KAJEKI VEHICLE/HAAGSE ARC - DAY

           Two Kajeki COMMANDOS drive slowly down the street in front of 
           the Arc’s main entrance.

           On the adjoining streets, other Kajeki VEHICLES also circle 
           the building. Including the BLACK VAN.
           They’re just waiting. Nothing yet.

           INT. BACK OF A VAN (MOVING) - DAY

           Amelia is on her cell.

                                 AMELIA
                        We’re ready. Go.

           INT./EXT. KAJEKI VEHICLE/HAAGSE ARC - DAY

           Motion -- suddenly, UN TROOPS start massing in front of the 
           main entrance. The Kajekis go on alert. The PASSENGER gets on 
           the radio:

                                 PASSENGER
                        (Watch the front.)

           The other Kajeki vehicles begin moving to cut off access to 
           the front. Including the BLACK VAN -- it starts coming around 
           from the side --

           -- but then a UN SUV pulls out in front of it, cutting it 
           off. The black van has been made.

                                 PASSENGER
                             (into radio)
                        (Careful. Not too close.)

           POLICE CARS are converging on the black van now -- the other 
           Kajekis have to back off.

           INT./EXT. - BLACK VAN/HAAGSE ARC - DAY

           The side door of the black van slides open -- Kiernan and 
           Amelia are in back, along with two bound KAJEKI COMMANDOS. 
           Bryce is behind the wheel. They pulled a switch.

                                 AMELIA
                             (into cell)
                        Perfect. Thank you, sir.

           The back door of the UN SUV opens -- Casoria is waiting 
           inside.

           Concealed by the stopped vehicles, Bryce, Kiernan, and Amelia 
           slip out of the black van and climb into the SUV.

           As the SUV pulls away, POLICE CARS surround the black van, 
           now empty except for the bound Kajekis.
           The UN Troops -- decoys -- are still massed at the Arc’s 
           front entrance.

           INT. UN SUV (MOVING) - DAY

           No one talks yet. The SUV pulls right up to the Arc’s side 
           entrance, they all get out and rush inside --

           INT. HAAGSE ARC - CORRIDOR - DAY

           -- where four armed ICC GUARDS are waiting.

                                 CASORIA
                        Sean Kiernan, welcome to the Hague.

                                 BRYCE
                        Let’s keep moving.

                                 GUARD
                             (to Kiernan)
                        We won’t cuff you just yet, but I 
                        have to ask you to disarm.

                                 BRYCE
                        Absolutely not. Not until we’re in 
                        the courtroom.

                                 GUARD
                        We can’t let him roam the halls--

                                 KIERNAN
                        It’s fine. I’ll disarm.
                             (re: Bryce)
                        If he can keep his weapons.

           Casoria nods. Kiernan gives the Guards his guns and a large 
           DUFFEL BAG holding more weapons -- keeping only the metal 
           case with the certificates.

           Bryce calls up a BUILDING MAP of the Arc on his phone. He 
           scrolls to show the Guards a route through the building.

                                 BRYCE
                        Gentlemen, this is the path we’ll 
                        take to the courtroom. Two front, 
                        two back. I’ll stay with the 
                        principal.
                             (to Casoria and Amelia)
                        Meet you there.

           The ICC Guards fall in under Bryce’s command. They move down 
           the hall in formation -- Bryce is at maximum readiness.
           Bryce is taking them through the Arc’s

           SERVICE CORRIDORS

           They barrel down the halls, surprising the CUSTODIANS and 
           MAINTENANCE STAFF as they pass. Kiernan lets Bryce go through 
           doors first, stands where Bryce tells him -- Kiernan has 
           become a model client. The trust is there now. 

           So far, no resistance. Now they move into --

           INT. HAAGSE ARC - STAIRWELL - DAY

           The Guards open the door. Bryce walks in, motions for 
           everyone to hold. He scans the stairwell. Clear.

           They escort Kiernan up one flight, then into another

           CORRIDOR

           The Guard indicates a door down the hall. Two more GUARDS 
           standing outside it. 

                                 GUARD
                        Almost there.

           Bryce stays on alert, expecting... something. Now they’re a 
           hundred feet away.

           Eighty. 

           Sixty.

           Forty.

           The door Guards start to move -- 

           -- Bryce’s hands go to his machinepistols -- 

           -- twenty feet -- the Guards swing the door open --

           -- Bryce motions everyone to hold. He walks into --

           INT. TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - DAY

           The courtroom is packed. The GALLERY, the JUDGES, both sets 
           of ATTORNEYS... everyone’s here. So is DEMIDOV, calmly 
           studying his notes. 

           They’re all settling in, just back from a break. Bryce came 
           in through a side door -- no one’s even noticed him yet. 
           Bryce carefully surveys the scene. Everything is exactly as 
           it should be. 

           They made it.

           Bryce surrenders his own weapons to the Guards, who put them 
           in a storage locker. They cuff Kiernan, then bring him in.

           The courtroom goes still. Everyone turns. Demidov looks up. 
           He shows no reaction. Just stares.

           Kiernan gives the metal case to Moreno at the prosecution 
           table. Moreno opens it, flips through... 

           ...and leaps to his feet. He wants a sidebar. Now.

           As the lawyers and judges confer, Kiernan is escorted to a 
           chair behind the prosecution table. 

           Casoria and Amelia have come in as well. Casoria shakes 
           Bryce’s hand. 

                                 CASORIA
                        Many thanks. Perhaps we will be 
                        able to work with you again in the 
                        future. We should discuss.

           Bryce nods. Sure. Then he takes a seat next to Kiernan. 

           Neither man speaks for a moment. They can’t quite believe 
           they’re really here. The effort of the last few days is 
           suddenly catching up to them. 

                                 KIERNAN
                        Been meaning to tell you something.

                                 BRYCE
                        What’s that?

                                 KIERNAN
                        I’m sorry that I killed so many of 
                        your clients over the years.

                                 BRYCE
                        Oh. Thank you.
                             (beat)
                        “So many”? You mean, a few.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Mmm... more than a few.

                                 BRYCE
                        Well, that’s very kind. I’ve been 
                        meaning to tell you something, too.
                                 KIERNAN
                        What’s that?

                                 BRYCE
                        You remember Atienza? The guy, I 
                        switched vehicles on you...

                                 KIERNAN
                        ...then I killed him on his yacht.

                                 BRYCE
                        I also switched yachts.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Really?

                                 BRYCE
                        Yep. You blew up an empty boat.

                                 KIERNAN
                             (beat)
                        You fucker.

           Bryce starts to LAUGH. Kiernan does, too. It’s a combination 
           of giddiness and deep exhaustion. They keep laughing --

           -- people are starting to turn and look. They’re like two 
           kids cracking up in class. They can’t help it.

           Amelia turns and stares: what is wrong with you two? Finally, 
           they settle down. Mostly.

           The sidebar is over. Didn’t go well for Livitin. Back at the 
           defense table, he makes a last-ditch effort:

                                 LIVITIN
                        The defense objects to the 
                        introduction of this--

           Out of nowhere, Demidov slams the table, yells --

                                 DEMIDOV
                        No! Enough.

           Livitin knew this was coming. He’s done all he can do.

                                 LIVITIN
                        My client wishes to briefly address 
                        the court.

           Curious, the lead Judge nods. Demidov rises, satisfied to 
           finally be taking center stage.
                                 DEMIDOV
                        I have spent months sitting in that 
                        chair, nodding along with this 
                        ludicrous charade. It is a waste of 
                        your time, and far more 
                        importantly, of mine. With 
                        apologies to my excellent attorney, 
                        the charges against me are entirely 
                        correct.

           A BUZZ in the gallery -- what? He plows ahead:

                                 DEMIDOV
                        I am the ruler of Kajekistan, a 
                        sovereign nation of this earth. As 
                        the ruler of my nation, I will do 
                        as I wish -- without exception, 
                        without apology. I recognize no 
                        authority that limits my power.

           Bryce and Kiernan are as shocked as everyone else. Bryce is 
           more than shocked -- he’s worried.

                                 BRYCE
                        Did we get in here too easily?

           Kiernan turns to him, confused, as Demidov continues:

                                 DEMIDOV
                        In this trial, the world community 
                        is attempting to make a statement. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Demidov has massive resources. We 
                        just walked in. Where were the rest 
                        of his men?

                                 DEMIDOV
                        But now I would like to make a 
                        statement of my own.

                                 KIERNAN
                             (gets it)
                        The UN team was focused on me. 
                        They’re out of position --

           Bryce and Kiernan get up, rushing towards Casoria -- 

                                 DEMIDOV
                        I do not recognize the jurisdiction 
                        of this court... 

           Livitin has been quietly packing up his briefcase. He nods to 
           a KAJEKI in the gallery, who whispers into his cell --
                                 DEMIDOV
                        ...so I will now take my leave. 
                        With my dignity intact.

           Demidov and Livitin brace themselves as --

           -- we hear a MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- 

           -- the BUILDING SHAKES -- everyone is thrown to the ground --

           -- more EXPLOSIONS offscreen -- now SHOUTING, GUNFIRE --

           -- total chaos --

           -- Bryce and Kiernan trying to regain their feet --

           -- the ICC Guards moving to secure Demidov -- but then --

           -- a wave of KAJEKI COMMANDOS bursts into the courtroom -- 
           wearing full tactical gear -- gasmasks --

           -- FIRING on the Guards, throwing TEAR GAS GRENADES --

           -- the Guards make the mistake of trying to fight through the 
           gas -- they collapse, CHOKING -- 

           -- Bryce and Kiernan know better, they run to the door they 
           came in through, pulling Amelia with them --

           -- the Commandos give masks to Demidov and Livitin, rushing 
           them outside -- Kiernan and Bryce can only watch --

           -- Alexander Demidov is busting out of the Hague.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Bryce, Kiernan, and Amelia make it out of the courtroom -- 
           fresh air -- 

                                 AMELIA
                        How did they--?

                                 BRYCE
                        The weapons at the warehouse.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Demidov was never selling them. 
                        This was his backup plan.

           Kiernan has KEYS he pulled off a fallen Guard -- he unlocks 
           his cuffs, then the door to the --

           STORAGE LOCKER 
           where all their WEAPONS are being kept.

           As Kiernan and Bryce dig through their duffel bag, re-arming 
           themselves, they can hear more GUNSHOTS and EXPLOSIONS. 
           They’re both utterly spent. But it’s time for one last push. 

           Casoria staggers out of the courtroom. Bryce pulls two RADIOS 
           off the door Guards. Gives one to Amelia.

                                 BRYCE
                        Help him. He’s got to direct the UN 
                        force. We’re going after Demidov.

           Kiernan and Bryce race down the corridor, around the corner 
           to the 

           COURTROOM ENTRANCE

           At the end of the hall -- 

           -- a huge HOLE has been blown into the side of the building. 
           SMOKE and DAYLIGHT. Demidov’s escape route.

           There are KAJEKI COMMANDOS and UN TROOPS down the hallway, 
           locked in combat. There’s no clear path for Bryce and Kiernan 
           to follow Demidov --

           Kiernan starts down another hall -- but Bryce pulls two GUNS, 
           runs straight ahead -- FIRING right into the crowd -- 

           -- BODIES start falling -- is Bryce killing the UN troops? --

           -- no -- he has a MACHINEPISTOL in one hand, and his gun that 
           fires RUBBER BULLETS in the other -- left hand lethal, right 
           hand nonlethal --

           -- killing the Commandos, knocking out the UN troops --

           -- clearing the path. He and Kiernan tear down the hall, 
           through the rubble, towards the gash of smoldering daylight --

           EXT. HAAGSE ARC - DAY

           The UN security perimeter has been utterly obliterated. 

           PATROL VEHICLES, smoking and charred, litter the road. The 
           only troops in sight are corpses. 

           A MISSILE LAUNCHER, set up in the back of a truck, is still 
           aimed at the building. SHOULDER-MOUNTED ASSAULT WEAPONS are 
           scattered on the ground. The weapons we saw in the warehouse, 
           now abandoned --
           -- as the Kajekis make their getaway. 

           They’re speeding away in two FAST-ATTACK VEHICLES. Bryce and 
           Kiernan are on foot. No way to catch up.

           Kiernan limping behind him, Bryce races up a low hill to an

           OVERPASS

           Now he can see the final piece of Demidov’s escape plan:

           A small PLANE waiting in the distance. The fast-attack 
           vehicles are closing on it. Bryce gets on the radio:

                                 BRYCE
                             (into radio)
                        Tell Casoria they’re flying out 
                        from the west. And I need you to 
                        get back in that storage locker.

           EXT. AT THE PLANE - DAY

           The fast-attack vehicles screech to a stop. Demidov, Livitin, 
           and the Commandos hustle to get onboard. The PILOT waits in 
           the hatchway -- he greets Demidov with a formal salute. 

           Demidov returns the salute. He’s back in command.

           EXT. OVERPASS - DAY

           Kiernan and Bryce watch the plane begin a slow taxi down a 
           blocked-off road. It’s heading towards the coastline and --

           -- the endless expanse of the NORTH SEA.

           Bryce scans the horizon -- more UN and POLICE VEHICLES are 
           coming from the east, but they’re still far away. Demidov 
           will be in the air before they can get to him.

           The plane is still taxiing -- it has to make a few turns 
           before it can reach the final straightaway.

                                 BRYCE
                        Can you make a shot from here?

                                 KIERNAN
                        With what?

           Amelia is running up the hill towards them -- carrying 
           Bryce’s SNIPER RIFLE.
                                 KIERNAN
                        Absolutely.

           Bryce FIRES into the guardrail, shredding the metal to create 
           a gap -- a perfect sniper position for Kiernan.

           Amelia gets to them. She also brought a MED KIT. Kiernan 
           takes the rifle, starts assembling it. 

           This is the only elevated spot around -- and they’ve been 
           spotted. Surviving Kajeki COMMANDOS are racing towards them. 
           Coming in from all sides.

                                 KIERNAN
                        As soon as they turn onto the 
                        straightaway, I’ll have a shot at 
                        the pilot.

           As Kiernan sets up his position, Bryce turns to Amelia.

                                 BRYCE
                        Get out of here.

           She looks around at the incoming Commandos. Doesn’t want to 
           leave Bryce alone.

                                 BRYCE
                        I need to protect him. I can’t do 
                        that unless I know you’re safe. Go.

           No time to argue. No goodbye kiss. She turns and runs back 
           down the hill. Gets on the radio --

           INT. UN VEHICLE (MOVING) - DAY

           Casoria is riding with the UN TROOPS, racing towards 
           Demidov’s plane.

                                 AMELIA (ON RADIO)
                        Kiernan’s in position.

           Casoria can see Bryce and Kiernan on the overpass. The plane 
           taxiing in the distance. The bullet will have to travel more 
           than a mile. A hell of a shot.

           Casoria starts to respond to Amelia -- but there’s nothing to 
           say. Nothing to do but watch and hope.

           EXT. OVERPASS - DAY

           Kiernan and Bryce are alone. But not for much longer. The 
           Commandos are closing in from all sides.
           Bryce pulls ammo clips from his pockets. Hooks them on his 
           belt. Kiernan sets the rifle in place. Chambers a round. He 
           lies on the ground -- sniper’s crouch. Bryce stands over him.

                                 BRYCE
                        I have you covered. Don’t think 
                        about anything except the shot. 

           Kiernan sights the plane. Zeroes out the scope. He picks a 
           spot farther down the plane’s path -- at the last turn, where 
           he’ll have a clear shot at the pilot.

           THE COMMANDOS

           are closing in.

           AMELIA

           is at the bottom of the hill. Watching. Trying not to watch. 

           ON THE OVERPASS

           Bryce draws his machinepistols. Shakes his hands out. Getting 
           loose.

           Kiernan lying on the ground. Bryce standing over him. The 
           hitman and his bodyguard.

           The Commandos -- 

           -- are now in range --

           -- Bryce opens FIRE. 

           He STRAFES the Commandos. His SHELL CASINGS clatter on the 
           pavement. They return FIRE, but he’s too fast -- won’t give 
           them an opening.

           Kiernan glances up, checking to be sure he’s safe -- Bryce 
           screams down at him:

                                 BRYCE
                        I’ve got you. Make the shot. 

           Bryce continues laying down 360-degree cover fire --

           We’re with Kiernan. He puts his eye to the rifle scope. He 
           breathes. 

           And... EVERYTHING GETS SLOW.

           Kiernan’s tuned out the rest of the world. 

           There’s nothing but the plane. The rifle scope. The trigger.
           Bryce’s shell casings falling like leaves all around him. 

           The plane is turning. Almost in the kill zone.

           Kiernan takes a deep breath. Holds it.

           He listens to his heartbeat. Waiting for a moment between 
           beats, to achieve perfect stillness.

           The plane comes out of the turn -- 

           -- the PILOT is in his cross hairs.

           Kiernan squeezes the trigger.

           A soft POP -- a gentle nudge of recoil --

           -- and --

           -- the cockpit window SHATTERS --

           -- a fine RED SPRAY blooms from the head of the Pilot --

           -- Kiernan lifts his head -- triumphant --

           -- as a shadow passes over him --

           -- Bryce, falling to the ground. 

           His shirt is red with BLOOD.

           The world rushes back in on Kiernan -- FAST again --

           Bryce’s body hits the ground -- Kiernan rolls -- two more 
           Commandos coming, the last two, Bryce took out the rest --

           -- as Kiernan scrambles to grab a machinepistol -- 

           -- both Commandos fall -- Amelia is running up the hill, 
           emptying her SIDEARM -- she’s killed the Commandos --

           -- it’s just Kiernan and Bryce. SIRENS fill the air.

           Kiernan tears away Bryce’s shirt. A round went through the 
           gap in his bulletproof vest. 

           Bryce is distant, glassy. Fading.

           Focused on Bryce, Kiernan doesn’t even notice, off in the 
           distance --
           THE PLANE

           now without a pilot, drifting off to the side, slowing... the 
           wave of UN VEHICLES is closing in on it...

           ON THE OVERPASS

           Kiernan dives for the med kit Amelia brought. Finds packets 
           of CELOX blood clotter -- what they used to patch up Taras.

           Kiernan dumps the Celox powder into Bryce’s wound, packing it 
           in, just the way Bryce showed him --

           -- SIRENS all around now --

           -- Kiernan balls up Bryce’s shirt, a pressure bandage --

           -- Kiernan isn’t aware of the AMBULANCE or the TWO MEDICS 
           until they’re trying to pull him away from Bryce --

           -- Kiernan shakes them off. He’s not leaving Bryce. He holds 
           the pressure bandage in place as the Medics start CPR. 

           Amelia is trying to get to them -- the POLICE won’t let her 
           through --

           Kiernan and the Medics work in silence. 

           Bryce COUGHS. He takes a breath. Another. And another.

           One of the Medics gently pulls Kiernan’s hands away. He 
           applies a clean bandage to the wound. Puts an oxygen mask 
           over Bryce’s mouth.

                                 MEDIC
                        He’s stable.

           The Medics wheel out a stretcher to load Bryce into the 
           ambulance.

           Bryce’s eyes are refocusing. He looks at Kiernan. A question. 
           Kiernan looks up at --

           THE PLANE

           Demidov’s Commandos are getting down on the ground, complying 
           with the UN TROOPS surrounding them.

           Demidov is also on the ground, hands cuffed behind his back. 
           Casoria stands over him.
           ON THE OVERPASS

           Kiernan nods.

                                 KIERNAN
                        They got him. We did it.
                             (beat)
                        Technically, I did it.

           Bryce grins under the mask. Gives Kiernan the finger as he’s 
           loaded onto the stretcher.

           Kiernan watches him get put into the 

           AMBULANCE 

           Amelia has gotten past the police. She runs to Bryce. 

           Bryce pulls off his oxygen mask. The Medic is about to hook 
           him up to an IV, but Bryce waves him away. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Not yet. I need a clear head.

           Amelia takes Bryce’s hand. He’s weak, but he needs to say 
           this now:

                                 BRYCE
                        You asked me to wait until this was 
                        over. It’s over. And I know exactly 
                        what I’m feeling.
                             (beat)
                        Amelia... I love you.
                             (beat)
                        That was really average. I’m sorry. 
                        Can I try again later, when I 
                        haven’t just been shot?

                                 AMELIA
                        That was perfect. I love you, too, 
                        Michael.

                                 BRYCE
                        Okay. Good. That’s good.
                             (to the Medic)
                        And now I would like you to inject 
                        me with every painkiller you have.

           The Medic puts the oxygen mask back over Bryce’s face. Starts 
           up the IV. 

           Amelia lays a kiss on Bryce’s mask. She holds his hand as he 
           drifts away.
           KIERNAN

           kept his distance, but he watched all of that. Now there’s a 
           VOICE from behind him:

                                 GUARD
                        Get down on the ground.

           It’s two of the ICC GUARDS who escorted him to the courtroom 
           earlier. Kiernan complies. They cuff him. 

           From the ground, Kiernan watches the ambulance take Bryce and 
           Amelia away.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. HAAGSE ARC - TRIAL CHAMBER 1 - DAY

           Demidov’s sentencing. Security is beyond airtight.

           The CLERK reads out the sentence:

                                 CLERK
                        ...Alexander Ilyich Demidov, for 
                        your crimes, you are hereby 
                        sentenced to serve the remainder of 
                        your natural life as a prisoner 
                        under the jurisdiction of the 
                        Criminal Court...

           Bryce stands in the back of the gallery. He doesn’t look 
           fully recovered yet, but he’s getting there.

           As the sentence is read out, Bryce slips into the 

           HALLWAY

           The damage from the attack has been mostly patched up. Bryce 
           walks down the hall and into -- 

           INT. TRIAL CHAMBER 2 - DAY

           A much smaller courtroom. A single JUDGE presiding. Two 
           defendants stand before him: Janet and Sean Kiernan. Kiernan 
           is in leg irons, and his hands are cuffed at his waist.

           Bryce takes a seat in the empty gallery.
                                 JUDGE
                        Janet Kiernan, under the plea 
                        bargain as so described, you are 
                        free to go.
                             (beat)
                        Sean Kiernan. This court has 
                        received several pleas for leniency 
                        on your behalf -- from the ICC 
                        prosecutors, the leadership of 
                        Interpol, as well as your ex-wife. 

           Kiernan steals a look at Janet. He wasn’t expecting that. The 
           Judge continues:

                                 JUDGE
                        However, the court finds that your 
                        recent actions cannot outweigh your 
                        past crimes. You are hereby 
                        sentenced to serve the remainder of 
                        your natural life as a prisoner 
                        under the jurisdiction of the 
                        Criminal Court. We are adjourned.

           Kiernan and Bryce knew this was coming. Neither man shows any 
           reaction. As the GUARDS start to escort Kiernan away -- Janet 
           goes to him.

                                 KIERNAN
                        You see? I only ruined your life 
                        the one time.

           She hugs him. A kiss on the cheek.

                                 JANET
                        Ah, Sean. You never did.

           As the Guards lead Kiernan away, his eyes meet Bryce’s. A 
           moment between them. A look, a nod, and goodbye.

           Bryce walks back into the

           HALLWAY

           Casoria sits on a bench, waiting for Bryce. He motions him to 
           sit. Hands him some papers.

                                 CASORIA
                        We have met your terms.

           INT. PRISON TRANSPORT (MOVING) - DAY

           Kiernan rides alone in back. Expressionless.
           The transport rumbles to a stop. The back doors are thrown 
           open. The GUARDS motion Kiernan to get out --

           EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

           The middle of nowhere. The deserted parking lot of a small 
           DIVE BAR. Kiernan has no idea what’s going on. 

           As the Guards lead Kiernan to the door, we might notice 
           Bryce’s Jag parked off to the side.

           INT. DIVE BAR - DAY

           The place is empty except for a few INTERPOL GUARDS -- and 
           Bryce and Casoria. They sit at a table with a bottle of 
           whiskey and three glasses.

           The Guards lead Kiernan to a chair. Bryce has a poker face. 
           Casoria gets right to it:

                                 CASORIA
                        Interpol was first chartered to 
                        coordinate between law-enforcement 
                        arms of various nations. But we’ve 
                        found that by the time we get the 
                        FBI, SIS, FSB, so on to even sit at 
                        the same table, the criminals are 
                        already enjoying their retirement.
                             (beat)
                        Interpol needs to do more than 
                        coordinate. We need to be able to 
                        act. I have been authorized to 
                        create Interpol’s first ever 
                        clandestine division. I have asked 
                        Mr. Bryce to consider joining.
                             (beat)
                        He agreed, on one condition: he 
                        would join if and only if you were 
                        brought on as his partner.

           Bryce nods. Kiernan can’t believe it. Casoria continues:

                                 CASORIA
                        My initial reaction was extremely 
                        negative. But Mr. Bryce and Agent 
                        Ryder finally brought me around. I 
                        am now inviting the two of you to 
                        be the founding and sole members of 
                        Interpol’s clandestine division.

           Kiernan, still stunned, doesn’t say anything just yet. 
           Casoria is happy to continue:
                                 CASORIA
                        Mr. Kiernan, you will need to keep 
                        a low profile, to maintain the 
                        illusion that you are in prison. 
                        Shouldn’t be difficult for you. But 
                        we will insist that you not return 
                        to your prior line of work.
                             (turning to Bryce)
                        You are free to continue in your 
                        executive-protection business, with 
                        the understanding that from time to 
                        time, we will call on you.
                             (beat)
                        It being a clandestine division, 
                        that’s all I can tell you unless 
                        you agree to join.

           Bryce and Kiernan exchange a look. No discussion required. 
           They’re in.

           A Guard unlocks Kiernan’s cuffs while Casoria pours drinks. 
           They make a silent toast.

                                 CASORIA
                        We’ll be in touch soon. For now, 
                        you have both earned a vacation. 
                        Gentlemen.

           They rise to shake hands, then Casoria and the Guards 
           disappear out the door. Now it’s just Bryce and Kiernan in 
           the empty bar.

                                 KIERNAN
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 BRYCE
                        I couldn’t let you do that time. 
                        And strange as it is -- we make a 
                        pretty good team.

                                 KIERNAN
                        We do, don’t we?

           And with that --

           -- Kiernan punches Bryce in the face. 

           Bryce goes down. He truly did not see that coming.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Even! Now we can move on.

           Bryce lies there, dazed. Then he starts laughing. Kiernan 
           helps him back up.
                                 KIERNAN
                        Right, let’s have another.

           Back to the table. Kiernan pours a fresh round of shots. 

                                 BRYCE
                        To a long life.

                                 KIERNAN
                        To a long life.

           They drink -- Bryce slams his empty glass down on the table 
           before Kiernan does. A challenge.

                                 KIERNAN
                        Sure you want to drink against me, 
                        Michael? That’s a dangerous road.

                                 BRYCE
                        Pour.

           Kiernan pours. They drink and slam their glasses down -- at 
           the exact same moment. It’s on.

           As Kiernan pours another round --

                                 KIERNAN
                        Hang on. Who’s driving?

                                 BRYCE
                        Screw it. We’ll call a cab.

           They drink, slam their glasses down --

                                                                THE END
