           The sex sounds made during...sex.

                                                                FADE IN:

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           A bedroom stuck in the 1970’s.  Felt wallpaper, cigarette 
           smoke stains, thick dust.  Pictures everywhere of a MAN 
           (VINCENT) and a WOMAN (SANDY) in love.  They couldn’t 
           look happier.  Young, full of life.

           On the bed, an African American woman, CHARISSE, rides on 
           top of someone we’ll soon meet.  Charisse is lost in her 
           30s, rough, tattooed, too much makeup, and somewhere 
           underneath it all...beautiful.  Furthermore, she’s 
           pregnant.  Who knows how long, she’s so damn skinny.

           Grinding away.

                                 CHARISSE
                        You eat breakfast yet?

           She’s talking to VINCENT (mostly VIN.)  Whom she’s 
           riding.  He’s the guy from the pictures, although now in 
           his 60s/70s.  Beat-to-hell, raw, irreverent.  He gave up 
           on life years ago.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (puffing a cigarette)
                        You didn’t eat?

                                 CHARISSE
                        I forgot.

                                 VINCENT
                        How do you forget to eat?

                                 CHARISSE
                        It happens.

           Vincent returns his gaze to...the TV on top of his 
           dresser.  An old Abbott & Costello movie is playing.  
           Charisse adjusts herself, then continues grinding on 
           Vincent.  Then...

                                 VINCENT
                        You want go to breakfast?

           INT. NAT’S DINER - LATER

           A greasy spoon.  Vincent and Charisse are in a booth 
           eating breakfast.  Charisse is scarfing down Huevos 
           Rancheros, like she hasn’t eaten in days.

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re gonna get gas like that.
                                 CHARISSE
                        I don’t get gas.

                                 VINCENT
                        You will when you’re my age.  I 
                        look at a burrito, I fart.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Can get a pill for that.

                                 VINCENT
                        Bastards have a pill for 
                        everything.  That’s a fact, lady.  
                        Killing us all, ten milligrams at a 
                        time.

           Vincent sifts through his pill pouch.  Pulls out a dozen 
           or so...the day’s dose.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the water?  Didn’t I ask 
                        for water?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Ask ‘em again.

                                 VINCENT
                        Coming here twenty years, still 
                        can’t get their shit together.

           Calling off to a Mexican server (JESUS.)

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.  Aqua.  Pills.

           Jesus smiles, nods.

                                 CHARISSE
                        I ain’t never takin’ me that many 
                        pills.

                                 VINCENT
                        Just crack and meth.  That’s a 
                        better plan.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Fuck you, Vin.  Stay off my shit.  

           She reaches across the table for his toast.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        You wan’ your toast.

           Jesus returns with a glass of water.  Lots of ice.

                                 JESUS
                        Here you go, Mr. Vincent.
                                 VINCENT
                        Can you put more ice in it?  I want 
                        to make sure I choke while I’m 
                        swallowing my poison.

           Jesus is confused.

                                 CHARISSE
                        He don’t wan’ no ice.

                                 JESUS
                        Oh.  Si.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yeah.  Oh, si.  Just like everyday 
                        I come in here.  Water no ice.

           No one really knows what to say.  They’ve heard it all 
           before.  Daily.

                                 JESUS
                        Uno momento, Mr. Vincent.

           Jesus walks off, nonplussed.

                                 VINCENT
                        Uno momento.  That’s all they say 
                        around here.

           Vin takes a pill, swallows.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        What did Jesus say to the Mexicans 
                        before he left?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Don’ know.

                                 VINCENT
                        Don’t do anything till I get back.

           Charisse doesn’t laugh.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Talking for Jesus ain’t right.

                                 VINCENT
                        Really.  From you?

           Vin takes another pill.  Swallows.

           EXT. A BANK - DAY - LATER

           Standard bank.  Vin’s car’s parked outside.  A Dodge 
           Duster in decent shape.
           INT. THE BANK - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s sitting across from a mortgage counselor, TERRY.  
           He’s reviewing paperwork.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (pointing)
                        That one there.  Says the line’s 
                        been frozen.

           Terry shuffles.

                                 TERRY
                        Uh-huh.  Got it.  Yes.  Let’s 
                        see...so...with these reverse 
                        mortgages you can only borrow a 
                        percentage of the equity you have 
                        in the house.

                                 VINCENT
                        I own the damn thing outright.  40 
                        years.

                                 TERRY
                        Yes.  Yes.  Well...you did.  But 
                        now, since you’ve been getting 
                        payments from us for the last... 
                                 (searches the papers)
                        eight years...you’ve reached the 
                        cash out limit.

                                 VINCENT
                        The house is worth-

                                 TERRY
                        It was worth.  Whatever it was 
                        worth.  And I’m sure you know 
                        housing prices have fallen 
                        dramatically since the financial 
                        crisis.  Right.  Unless you’ve been 
                        living under a rock.

           His attempt at humor...not appreciated.

                                 VINCENT
                        You do stand-up?

           Okay.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I’d say keep your day job.  But you 
                        suck at that too.

                                 TERRY
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Canatella...

           Vin stands.
                                 VINCENT
                        This is my life here, pal.  I need 
                        that money.

                                 TERRY
                        There’s really nothing we can do, 
                        sir.  It is what it is.

                                 VINCENT
                        Everybody’s says that now.  You 
                        know what it means, “You’re fucked, 
                        so stay fucked.”

           He walks off.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Closing my accounts tomorrow.  You 
                        don’t get my business another day.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Vin labors into the car.  Charisse is waiting in the 
           passenger seat.  He hands her a few twenties.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m a little tight right now.  So.

           Charisse counts it.

                                 CHARISSE
                        What’s that?

                                 VINCENT
                        What’s what?

                                 CHARISSE
                        This shit ain’t lay-a-way.  I ain’t 
                        no JC Pennies.

                                 VINCENT
                        You know I’m good for it, Charisse.  
                        I always pay you.

           Charisse looks him over.

                                 CHARISSE
                        I’m not making like I used to Vin.  
                        Only a few freaks like the belly, 
                        awlright.  

           She gets out of the car.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Gotta save for maternity leave, 
                        asshole.

           She heads off down the sidewalk.
                                 VINCENT
                        See you next week.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Extra twenty when you do.

           Charisse moves on, bag in hand, adjusting her junk.  Vin 
           drives off.  

           A few NEIGHBORHOOD MEN whistle at Charisse.  She yells 
           over to them.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t a dog, bitch.

           EXT. THE BUCK - NIGHT

           The local dive bar.  SMOKERS outside litter the sidewalk.  
           The windows are painted with “Happy New Year” greetings.

           INT. THE BUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Old neon.  Older PATRONS.  Vin sits at the bar next to 
           LINDA and GUS, a weathered married couple in their late 
           60s.  They’re dressed to the nines.  The hanging TV set 
           plays New Year’s Eve coverage from around the country.

           They’re all fairly lit...although Vin’s in a class by 
           himself.  Very thick tongued.

                                 LINDA
                        You have a good Christmas, Vin?

                                 VINCENT
                                 (slurring)
                        Best Christmas I ever had.  No 
                        people.  No presents.  No bullshit.

                                 LINDA
                        Ah, you don’t mean that, Mister.

                                 VINCENT
                        What do you know what I mean, 
                        Linda?  You a psychic now?

                                 GUS
                        Ay, ease up there, Vinny.  We’re 
                        just talking.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s all you two ever do.  You 
                        should get a talk show.  The “Linda 
                        and Gus Just Fucking Talking Talk 
                        Show.”

           Vin flags the bartender, ROGER.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Rog.  Another Maker’s.

           Roger steps over.

                                 ROGER
                        We got three hours till the ball 
                        drops there, Vin.  Why don’t we 
                        give it a break for a minute.

                                 VINCENT
                        Give what a break?

                                 ROGER
                        The liquor.

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re not gonna serve me?

                                 ROGER
                        For a minute.

                                 VINCENT
                        You know how much money I’ve spent 
                        in this dump over the years?

           Roger tries to keep it smooth.

                                 ROGER
                        Don’t be like that, Vin.  I’m 
                        watching out for you here.

                                 VINCENT
                        Watching out for me?

           Vin stands, wobbles.  He’s drunker than even he realized.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You serve poison to people 
                        everyday.  So they can die while 
                        they’re alive.  Now you’re watching 
                        out...is that right?

           Gus stands, tries to help Vin.

                                 GUS
                        Let me give you a ride home.

                                 VINCENT
                        Don’t touch me, Gus.  Don’t touch 
                        me.  I’ll drive home drunk like 
                        I’ve done every night while Roger 
                        here’s been watching out for me.

           Vin pushes free, walks to the door.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Happy New Year.

           He’s out.
           EXT. THE BUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Vin stumbles out the front door, past the SMOKERS.  On 
           the way to his car, he runs into a LEGLESS HOMELESS GUY 
           (in a wheelchair) holding up a cup, looking for some 
           change.

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Couple bucks for a Veteran?

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m a veteran, pal.  Go get a 
                        fucking job.  This country doesn’t 
                        give a shit.  Legs or no legs.

           With that he knocks the cup from the man’s hand.  Coins 
           go flying.

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Hey, man.  What’s that about?!?

           Vin walks away.  Gets in his car.

                                 HOMELESS GUY (CONT’D)
                        The meek shall inherit the earth, 
                        my friend!

           The Homeless Man collects the coins.  Screaming at Vin 
           all the time.

                                 HOMELESS GUY (CONT’D)
                        Not the assholes.  Asshole!

           Vin drives off, peeling out.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           The Dodge Duster whips into the driveway.  Hits the 
           picket fence on the neighbor’s border.  Crash.  It 
           topples.  Hits his own mailbox on the other side.  Crash.  
           It flies onto the lawn.

           Vin shuts the car off.  Sits for a minute.  Then steps 
           out and swerves to the toppled mailbox.  Gets on all 
           fours, opens the door, gets the mail.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A RED PRINTED FINAL NOTICE BILL lands on a coffee table 
           amongst dozens of bills and unopened letters.  The header 
           reads: Sunnyside Residence for the Elderly.

           Vin puts his feet up on the pile of bills, watching TV 
           from his ancient plastic wrapped couch.  Coverage of the 
           Times Square New Year’s Eve Celebration plays.

           Vin’s cat, FELIX THE CAT, jumps onto his lap.  Starts to 
           pur.
                                 VINCENT
                        There you are.  Where’d you go 
                        tonight, ha?  Screwing that little 
                        Tabby on the corner...

           He rubs the cat all over.  His only love.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I bet you’re hungry, aren’t you?

           He takes Felix in his arms, shuffles to the kitchen.

           THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The kitchen is trashed: dishes to China, mold, stacks of 
           mail a decade old.  Vin opens a can of gourmet cat food.  
           Dumps it in a bowl.  Felix waits patiently on the 
           counter...the food arrives.  He eats like there’s no 
           tomorrow.

           Vin needs another drink.  He holds his tumbler to the ice 
           maker in the fridge door.  It grinds.  No ice.  He opens 
           the freezer door and grabs a glob of ice cubes stuck 
           together, puts them on the counter.

           Grabs a hammer from the junk drawer.

           BANG.  BANG.  He smashes the ice into pieces, chips fly.

           BANG!  He hits his finger.

                                 VINCENT
                        UGHHHH.  Shit.  AHHHH.

           Vin stumbles with the pain.  His foot gets ever so close 
           to an ice chip on the tile floor...

           Slip.  Flip.  Smack.

           Vin flies up in the air, lands on the floor.  Crack!  His 
           head hits the tile hard.  He’s out.  Or dead.

           Felix looks at his owner.  Goes back to eating.  He’s 
           seen it all before.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           TV insert.  The ball is dropping in Times Square.  5, 4, 
           3, 2, 1.  Happy New Year.  PEOPLE hug, kiss, celebrate.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           MEN screaming in Spanish.  We pan away from Vin’s house, 
           over towards the source of the racket.
           In the neighbor’s driveway, a moving truck is backing 
           into the drive and ripping tree limbs along the way.  
           Vin’s tree limbs.  A LATIN MOVER is screaming 
           instructions to the LATIN DRIVER.

                                 LATIN MOVER
                        Alto!  Alto!  You hit the tree, 
                        man.  Come on!

                                 LATIN DRIVER
                        Meda, I can’t see it!

           He notices the roof: half ripped off, pealed like a 
           sardine can.

                                 LATIN MOVER
                        You broke the roof!  Ay Dios mio!

           They fight on.

           INT. KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s where we left him: face down on the kitchen floor.  
           A small pool of blood sits stagnant under his face.

           Felix the Cat moseys over.  Starts pawing at Vin’s head.  
           He rustles.

                                 VINCENT
                        I just fed you, pal.  Get lost.

           He groans.  Tries to hold himself up.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Help me up, would you?

           Vin sees the blood.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Ah, piss.

           He feels his face, and for the first time we see it...he 
           looks like a prize fighter after the twelfth round.  A 
           gash above his eye is the origin of the blood.  It 
           probably needs stitches.  He’ll never get them.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Felix, call 911.

           Vin sits up.  Felix jumps in his lap.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           The yelling outside hits Vin’s universe.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Tell them to shut up out there.
           Felix lies down.

           Vin sits there for a second, collects himself.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vin walks outside, searching for the commotion.  He 
           shields the sun from his eyes.  The fighting Movers are 
           still at it.

                                 VINCENT
                        Hey!  Hey!  What the problem?  This 
                        is a neighborhood.  People are 
                        sleeping.

           The Movers stop.  Stare.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You comprende?!  

           Nothing.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Habla English?

                                 LATIN MOVER
                        We speak English, senor.

                                 VINCENT
                        What the hell are you doing here?

           Vin looks up, notices the tree ripped.  

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        What the?!?  That’s my tree you 
                        assholes hit?!

           There’s a large tree limb sitting on Vin’s car and across 
           the fence (which he knocked down last night.)

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        And my fence!  My damn car!?!

           Silence.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Do you speak English!?!

           Just then a car pulls up, parks in front of the house.  A 
           WOMAN in her late thirties steps out.  This is MAGGIE, 
           Vin’s new neighbor.  She’d be prettier if she weren’t 
           always so worried.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m calling the cops.

           Vin heads inside.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Excuse me...

           He turns.

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re excused.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m Maggie.  I guess I’m your new 
                        neighbor.

           Really.

                                 VINCENT
                        So.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.  We’re moving in today.

                                 VINCENT
                        I noticed that.  These idiots with 
                        you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        They’re with the moving company.

           Maggie walks to the fence, stands on her side.  Looks 
           around.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, boy.

                                 VINCENT
                        Oh, shit...more like it.  That 
                        fence is twenty years old.  The 
                        car’s forty.  And the tree’s older 
                        than me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m really sorry.  I don’t know 
                        what to...this is not the way to 
                        meet.

           She turns to the Movers.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Did you guys do this?

                                 VINCENT
                        Of course, they did it.  What are 
                        you stupid?  Look at the scene.

           Maggie doesn’t take kindly to being called stupid.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Excuse me.  There’s no need to be 
                        rude.  Okay.  I’m just moving in 
                        here.  I hired this company.  Okay.  
                        Accidents happen.
           A LITTLE BOY comes up to Maggie’s side.  This is OLIVER.  
           Twelve.  Frail.  Four eyes.  Painfully awkward and very 
           sensitive.  He’s one of those invisible types.

                                 VINCENT
                        Accidents happen.  What’re you a 
                        fucking adjuster?

           Maggie puts her arm around Oliver.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Do you mind, mister?

           Vin looks at Oliver.  Absorbs him.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (a little calmer)
                        I’m going to sue the moving company 
                        first.  I suggest you call them and 
                        put them on notice.  Otherwise, 
                        I’ll sue you along with them.

           Vin walks off.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll call right now.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m getting the police over here to 
                        file a report.

           He hits the front door.  Oliver looks up at his mom.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s our new neighbor.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yep.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s gonna be a long life.

           INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Oliver’s bedroom.  The room has a bed in it, little else.  
           The evening ritual is in progress: bedtime book time.  
           Although...Oliver is the one reading: “The Giving Tree.”  
           Maggie’s on a beanbag on the floor, nursing a Chardonnay.

                                 OLIVER
                                 (reading)
                        “I wish that I could give you 
                        something, but I have nothing 
                        left.”  I am just an old stump.  “I 
                        don't need very much now," said the 
                        boy. "Just a quiet place to sit and 
                        rest.

                        I am very tired." "Well," said the 
                        tree, straightening herself up as 
                        much as she could, "Well, an old 
                        stump is good for sitting and 
                        resting. Come, Boy, sit down. Sit 
                        down and rest." And the boy did. 
                        And the tree was happy. 

           Maggie drinks her wine.

                                 MAGGIE
                        God, that’s depressing.

                                 OLIVER
                        No, it’s not.  The old tree was 
                        made to give.  That’s why it was 
                        created.  So to be able to give 
                        everything and have nothing left is 
                        the best life the tree could ever 
                        have.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’re you some kind of 
                        philosopher now?

                                 OLIVER
                        Maybe.

           Maggie gets up.  Tucks Oliver into bed.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Need you catch the bus tomorrow.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s my first day.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Mine too.  Can’t be late.

           Maggie kisses him good night.  Goes to turn the light 
           off.

                                 OLIVER
                        Where’s the bus line?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Get on the internet in the morning.  
                        You’re good at that.  Good night, 
                        love.

                                 OLIVER
                        Night.

           She turns the light off.

           Oliver settles into the darkness.
           EXT. CITY STREET - THE NEXT MORNING

           Bus stop.  Maggie’s old Volvo sits in the bus lane.  
           Oliver’s outside the door, leaning in the window.  He’s 
           dressed in an obvious Catholic School uniform.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You have your key?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Map?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What time you get out?

                                 OLIVER
                        2:45.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Straight home, ‘kay.  Start your 
                        homework.

                                 OLIVER
                        Okay.

           A bus pulls up behind Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        This might be yours.  See you 
                        tonight.

                                 OLIVER
                                 (searching his pockets)
                        Ma...I don’t know...if...

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m in the bus lane, Oliver.  Be 
                        good.  Okay.  I don’t need another 
                        ticket.

           Maggie pulls off.

                                 OLIVER
                        I don’t know if I have-

           But Maggie’s gone...

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Enough money for lunch.

           Oliver backs away from the curb, as the bus pulls in.
           INT. BUS - LATER

           Riding the bus.  Oliver’s sandwiched between an OLD 
           JEWISH LADY and a PIERCED HIPSTER.  He’s looking at a 
           Mapquest print out.

           INSERT - THE MAP: AN “X” MARKS THE SCHOOL’S LOCATION - 
           ST. FRANCIS de SALES.

           EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - LATER

           PACKS OF STUDENTS mosey towards the campus.  A classic 
           brick and stone Catholic School.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           St. Francis de Sales Catholic School is just like any 
           other middle school.  Diverse.  Modern.  Noisy.  Dozens 
           of KIDS crowd the hallways, dig through lockers, 
           socialize with FRIENDS.

           Oliver can’t open his locker.  He tries the combination 
           again...no dice.  He looks around for help...no one makes 
           eye contact.

           The tardy bell chimes.

           Oliver gives up, drags all his stuff with him.  Rushes 
           down the hallway.

           INT. MR. CRESPI’S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Religious Studies class.  Mr. Crespi stands in front of 
           THIRTY CHATTY PRETEENS.  Crespi’s in his late twenties, 
           preppy and full of new teacher idealism.  Oliver stands 
           at his side, he could pass out.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Settle down.  I know it’s hard to 
                        come back to school after three 
                        weeks of vaca...but your education 
                        must continue.  Believe me, you 
                        need it.

           The kids settle in.

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        This is Oliver.  He’s joining us 
                        mid-stream here at St. Francis.  
                        We’re happy to have him.  Aren’t 
                        we..?

           The CLASS speaks in unison, albeit bored and cynical.

                                 ENTIRE CLASS
                        Welcome to St. Francis, Oliver.
                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Such genuine caring.  Okay, Oliver, 
                        why don’t you lead us in morning 
                        prayer?

           Shit.  Oliver is frozen.  The class stares.

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        Everyone does it sooner or later.

           Oliver’s turning red.  He leans in to Mr. Crespi, 
           whispers something in his ear.

                                 OLIVER
                        I think I’m Jewish.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Okay.  That’s good.
                                 (to the class)
                        Oliver thinks he’s Jewish.

           A few KIDS speak out.

                                 RANDOM KIDS
                                 (on top of each other)
                        So am I.  I’m Buddhist.  There is 
                        no God.

           Mr. Crespi raises his hands before it gets out of 
           control.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        I heard that last one.  You get an 
                        automatic “F” for the course.

           Laughs.  These kids love Mr. Crespi.

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        We celebrate all religions in this 
                        classroom.  That’s why we’re 
                        called...

           The kids complete:

                                 ENTIRE CLASS
                                 (with fun sarcasm)
                        Religions of the World, with Mr. 
                        Cary Crespi.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Bravo.  Now, I happen to be 
                        Catholic, which is the very best 
                        religion in the world.  Because we 
                        have the most rules.  But some of 
                        us are Buddhist, Agnostic, Baptist, 
                        Presbyterian, Christian, and “I 
                        don’t know.”  Which seems to be the 
                        fastest growing religion on the 
                        planet.  So...now we have Oliver.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT'D)
                        Who “thinks he’s Jewish.”  Which is 
                        a new one for us as well.  But...it 
                        doesn’t preclude you from morning 
                        prayer duty.  Bow your heads...

           Heads down.  Oliver has no idea where to begin.  Crespi 
           whispers to him:

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        Say anything you want.  Doesn’t 
                        have to be special.

           Oliver bows his head.

                                 OLIVER
                        Dear...

           Silence.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                                 (whisper)
                        God...etc, etc.

                                 OLIVER
                        Dear God.  Thank you.

           More silence.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                                 (whisper)
                        Amen.

                                 OLIVER
                        Amen.

           The class repeats.

                                 ENTIRE CLASS
                        Amen.

           Oliver breathes.  Mr. Crespi smiles at him.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        You made it.  Go grab your seat.

           Oliver walks to his desk.

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        Let’s wipe the dust off that 
                        textbook, young ones.  Chapter 
                        twelve.  Catholic Saints.  

           Books shuffle.  Pages turn.  Oliver sits down.  Beyond 
           embarrassed.

           EXT. SANTA ANITA RACE TRACK - DAY

           Horse track.  Shitty cars litter the lot.
           TRACKSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           A TRUMPETER sounds the BUGLE CALL as JOCKEY’S on HORSES 
           settle in their stalls.  The gates open...and they’re 
           off.

           Vin’s sitting in “his” booth.  Eating lunch.  Drinking.  
           He’s always drinking.

                                 VINCENT
                        Come on.  Come on.  Dig in.

           The horses fly around the track.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Dig.  One time.  One damn time.

           And just like that...Vincent’s horse...loses.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Son of a bitch.

           He crumples up his race form.  Throws it on the floor.  
           It lands at a MAN’S FEET.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        No need to get pissy, Vin.  You 
                        lose all the time.  Should be 
                        comfortable by now.

           Vincent looks up and sees...Zucko.  His bookie.  Dirty 
           fingernails.  Hairy eyeballs.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yeah.  Rough day.

           Zucko sits.  Takes a pull of Vin’s Maker’s.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You mind?

                                 ZUCKO
                        You owe me, Vin.  I’m thirsty.

                                 VINCENT
                        I don’t have it right now, kid.  
                        Got a little problem I’m working 
                        out.

                                 ZUCKO
                        Me too.  You.

                                 VINCENT
                        Just need a little time, you know.

                                 ZUCKO
                        You think our past history buys you 
                        some grace.  It don’t.  I gotta 
                        deal with others.  Right.  So...how 
                        long?
                                 VINCENT
                        A month.

                                 ZUCKO
                        You’re funny, Vin.  I always loved 
                        your jokes.  They kill me.

           Zucko drinks the rest of Vin’s Makers.

                                 ZUCKO (CONT’D)
                        Split the difference.  Ya got two 
                        weeks.

           Zucko stands.

                                 ZUCKO (CONT’D)
                        I hear “Lucky By Numbers” is the 
                        inside on the fifth.  But you got 
                        bad luck, right.  So...go the other 
                        way.

           He leaves.  Vin pushes his lunch aside.  Appetite gone.

           INT. RACETRACK - BAR - LATER

           Vin’s standing at the bar watching another race on the 
           hanging TV set.  Maker’s Mark at his lips.

                                 VINCENT
                        Mother of mercy.  Come on.  Run.  
                        Run...

           The HORSES round the home stretch.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Gym class.  Rope climbing.  Oliver’s in mid-climb.  
           Well...he’s barely off the ground, beat-red and shaking 
           from the straining.  On the rope next to him, and damn 
           near the top, ROBERT OZINSKI, the school bully, climbs 
           like he’s a baboon.  As a-matter-of-fact, he looks like 
           one.

           KIDS all around scream, cheer, egg the racers on.

           COACH MITCHELL stands over the competition, whistle in 
           his mouth.

           Ozinski grabs the flag at the top of the climb.  Coach 
           blows the whistle.

                                 COACH MITCHELL
                        Alright.  Good job, Ozinski.

           Ozinski slides down the rope lighting fast.  Coach taps 
           Oliver on the shoulder.  Yep, he’s only that far off the 
           ground.
                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        We’re done.

           Oliver’s mortified.  Kids run off towards the lockers.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        You can let go now.

           He looks down.  About a one foot drop.

                                 OLIVER
                        Okay.

           He drops to the mat.

                                 COACH MITCHELL
                        Go get changed.

           Oliver walks away, in the wrong direction.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s the other way.  Those doors.

           He stops, looks.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                                 (pointing)
                        Over there.

           Oliver moves off.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Oliver enters the locker room.  Most of the KIDS are 
           fully dressed already, and leaving.  Ozinski starts 
           heckling the moment he sees Oliver.

                                 OZINSKI
                        There’s the strong man.

           Laughs.  One of Ozinski’s buddies (BROOKLYN) chimes in.

                                 BROOKLYN
                        “I think I’m Jewish.”

           More laughs.  Oliver takes a seat in front of his locker.

                                 OLIVER
                        My name is Oliver.

                                 OZINSKI
                                 (like a retard)
                        My name is Oliver.

           Just then Coach walks in.
                                 COACH MITCHELL
                        I’m not hearing what I think I’m 
                        hearing.  Am I?

           Silence.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        We don’t do that bully crap here.  
                        This is a Catholic School, 
                        knuckleheads.  We’re kind and 
                        tolerant to everyone.  Right?

           Silence.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        Right?

                                 ALL THE KIDS
                        Yes, Coach Mitchell.

                                 COACH MITCHELL
                        Go on.  Get to class.

           Exodus.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

           Oliver nods.

                                 COACH MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        Double time it or you’ll be late.

           Oliver nods again.  Coach walks off.

           He opens his locker.  It’s empty.  His pants, 
           uniform...everything’s gone.

                                 OLIVER
                        Shit.

           EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - SIDEWALKS - LATER

           School’s out.  KIDS everywhere: jumping in cars, riding 
           bikes, walking home.

           It’s easy to spot Oliver in the crowd, he’s the only 
           student wearing short gym shorts, a tank top and 
           sneakers.  And...it’s damn cold.

           As expected, STUDENTS comment, laugh, text, chide.  It’s 
           not been a good first day for Oliver.

           He reaches the crosswalk.  Looks up at the street sign, 
           it doesn’t look vaguely familiar.  He crosses anyway.
           MONTAGE OF OLIVER WALKING - LOST

           -- Oliver crosses a major Boulevard.  Cars everywhere.

           -- He stops in the middle of a block.  Looks around.  
           Then...turns around and goes back in the direction from 
           wince he came.

           -- Oliver walks in front of a row of houses.  A DOG tears 
           up and jumps on the picket fence, barking.  Oliver runs 
           off.

           -- Oliver reads a street sign.  Thinks.  Walks on.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s driving through major traffic.  He pulls up next to 
           a bus load of PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS.  They stare at him.  He 
           stares back.  The light turns green, the buss pulls off.  

           Then in tandem...the WHOLE WINDOW ROW OF KIDS flip him 
           off.  Damn kids.  Vin lights a cigarette.

           OLIVER WALKING - CONTINUOUS

           Finally, Oliver recognizes his block.  He runs towards 
           what he thinks is his house...looks...that’s it.  He’s 
           home.

           EXT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Oliver, at the front door, reaches into his pocket for 
           the key.  Damn.  He’s not wearing his pants.  His key and 
           phone were in the pockets of his stolen uniform.

           He could cry.  But he’s not the type.  He slumps down in 
           resignation and sits on the cold concrete steps.

           VIN’S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s car pulls in haphazardly.  He runs over some of the 
           toppled fence.  Curses, with the windows up...so it 
           sounds like Charlie Brown’s parents.

           Vin climbs out of the car.  Walks to the fallen mailbox, 
           lowers himself onto the lawn, pulls mail out until...

                                 OLIVER
                        Sir?

           Vin hears something.  Stops, looks around.  Confused.

                                 VINCENT
                        Take me, God.  Don’t play with me.
           Oliver steps forward, down the walk.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s me, sir.

           Vin squints.  Finally sees the kid.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yeah.  What?

                                 OLIVER
                        I was wondering if I could use your 
                        phone?

                                 VINCENT
                        My phone?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes.

                                 VINCENT
                        In my house?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes.

                                 VINCENT
                        For what?

                                 OLIVER
                        To call my mom.  I’m locked out.  I 
                        was in gym class and these kids 
                        took my pants and I had my-

           Vin cuts him off.

                                 VINCENT
                        I don’t need the whole story.

           Vin stares at the little shit.  Pulls himself up off the 
           lawn. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        One call.

           Oliver can’t hear him.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s that, you said, sir?

           Vin walks away.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (over his shoulder)
                        I said come and make your call.

           Vin disappears into the house.  Oliver walks across the 
           lawn and through the demolished fence into Vin’s yard.
           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver’s on an old rotary phone in the kitchen.  Vin’s 
           fixing a Maker’s Mark in the background.

           Ring.  Ring.  Ring.  Voicemail.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hi, Mom.  I...ah...lost my key for 
                        the house.  So, I’m at the old 
                        guy’s next door.

           Oliver turns to Vin.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Sir...what’s your name?

                                 VINCENT
                        Vincent.

                                 OLIVER
                        Vincent.
                                 (whispers)
                        The mean one... 

           The conversation trails...

           VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Vin’s sitting in his La-Z-Boy, facing Oliver on the 
           couch.  Felix the Cat is sitting in Vin’s lap, staring at 
           Oliver.  They don’t get much company around here.

           The silence lasts forever.  And ever.

           A little longer.

           Then...

                                 VINCENT
                        What’s your name?

                                 OLIVER
                        Oliver.

           More silence.

                                 VINCENT
                        Little cold for shorts, don’t you 
                        think?

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s a long story, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m sure it is.

           Silence.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like “sir.”

                                 OLIVER
                        Sorry, sir.

           Hmm.  The phone rings.

           THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Vin picks up the phone.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yes.

           INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           The CAT scan lab.  Maggie’s in scrubs, whispering in the 
           corner of the room.  ANOTHER NURSE is manning the 
           controls, as a PATIENT (seen through the glass) is slid 
           into the tube.

                                 MAGGIE
                        This is Maggie, Oliver’s mom.  Is 
                        this Vincent?

           INTERCUT WITH VIN IN THE KITCHEN

                                 VINCENT
                        Your kid’s here.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.  I just got his message.  Is 
                        that all right?

                                 VINCENT
                        Is what all right?

                                 MAGGIE
                        That he stays there?

                                 VINCENT
                        Stays here.  Like what, stays here?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m at work and...we got a few more 
                        cases.  So, I don’t get off for a 
                        couple of hours and I can’t get him 
                        the key anyway.  I’m in a little 
                        bit of a bind right now...

                                 VINCENT
                        You want me to baby-sit?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, he’s hardly a baby.  He won’t 
                        bother you.  He’ll just do his 
                        homework.
           Oliver walks into the kitchen.

                                 OLIVER
                        Sir?

           Vin holds up his hand, shushes Oliver.

                                 VINCENT
                        What’re you paying?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 VINCENT
                        For baby-sitting.  I’m not a 
                        philanthropy.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ah.  Okay...ten dollars an hour.

                                 VINCENT
                        Twelve.

           Maggie is amazed.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Fine.  Great.  Can I talk to him?

           Vin puts the phone down on the counter, walks off.

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s for you.

           Oliver walks to the phone, picks it up.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hi, ma...

           VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Oliver and Vin are sitting on the couch watching an old 
           Abbott & Costello movie.  Vin’s smoking, drinking.

           Felix the Cat is sitting in Oliver’s lap.  Vin’s not 
           thrilled.

                                 VINCENT
                        He doesn’t like many people.

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m good with animals, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yeah.  He doesn’t usually like 
                        people who say they’re good with 
                        animals either.

           Oliver laughs at the movie.  It’s rare.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You’ve never seen Abbott & 
                        Costello?

                                 OLIVER
                        No, sir.  Are they old?

                                 VINCENT
                        They’re dead.  That’s the oldest 
                        you can be.

                                 OLIVER
                        Or the youngest.  Time freezes when 
                        you die.

           Hmm.

                                 VINCENT
                        Where’d you learn that?

                                 OLIVER
                        A book.

           A beat.

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s dinner time.  You hungry or 
                        something?

           Oliver looks at Vin, studies his face.

                                 OLIVER
                        A little, sir.

           Vincent looks annoyed.  He’s the kind of guy that gets 
           annoyed when someone wants something, even if he offered.

                                 VINCENT
                        Figures.

           KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vin’s scouring the kitchen, looking for something to feed 
           the kid.  All he finds is a can of Spam and a package of 
           Saltines.  He cracks the Spam open, dumps it on a dirty 
           plate and circles it with the stale crackers.

           VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Vin’s eating a Spam cracker sandwich.  Watching the 
           movie.  Oliver’s holding Felix the Cat in his 
           lap...feeding him Spam.  And eating a Spam cracker 
           sandwich himself.

           The doorbell rings.  

                                 VINCENT
                        Probably your mother.
                                 OLIVER
                        Probably, sir.

           Oliver doesn’t move.

                                 VINCENT
                        I guess I’ll get that.

                                 OLIVER
                        Thank you, sir.

           Vin aches his way out of the recliner.

           THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Vin peeks out the peep hole, then opens the door 
           for...Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi.  Vincent.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yep.

           He doesn’t instinctively let her in.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thank you so much for watching 
                        Oliver.  I just started a new job 
                        and...

                                 VINCENT
                        I don’t need the whole story.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ok.  Right.

           Maggie digs in her purse and pulls out some cash.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Here...three hours.  Twelve dollars 
                        an hour-

                                 VINCENT
                        Thirty six.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes, I know.

           She hands him two twenties.

                                 VINCENT
                        I don’t have change.

           Of course he doesn’t.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s...fine.
           Vin looks at the money, puts it in his shirt’s breast 
           pocket.

                                 VINCENT
                        Where’s his father?

           That’s personal.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well.  That’s a long story...see...

                                 VINCENT
                        Don’t worry about it then.

           A beat.  We hear Oliver laughing in the background.  
           Maggie smiles.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        How come you don’t have anyone to 
                        watch him after school?

                                 MAGGIE
                        We just moved in-

                                 VINCENT
                        I was there.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right.

                                 VINCENT
                        You gonna fix my fence?  And the 
                        tree?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.  I just haven’t had a minute 
                        to get-

                                 VINCENT
                        Just give me the cash and I’ll 
                        worry about it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh.  Okay.  How much?

                                 VINCENT
                        I’ll figure out something fair.

           A beat.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Let me know.

                                 VINCENT
                        I can the watch the kid too.  After 
                        school for a few hours.  Same 
                        price.

           Maggie is speechless.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I’ll do eleven bucks an hour if you 
                        supply the snacks.  Little shit ate 
                        all my Spam.

           INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATER

           Maggie and Oliver sit at a tiny round table, off the 
           kitchen.  Oliver is chowing down on a frozen dinner.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You ate at...ah...Vincent’s house, 
                        no?

                                 OLIVER
                        Can we buy some Spam, ma?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sure.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s delicious.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Remind me next time we’re at the 
                        store.

                                 OLIVER
                        Okay.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You like him?

                                 OLIVER
                        Who?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Vincent.

                                 OLIVER
                        He’s interesting.  In an old, 
                        grouchy sort of way.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That he is.  You know, he offered 
                        to watch you after school.

                                 OLIVER
                        He did?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yep.  I was thinking maybe that’s 
                        not such a horrible idea.  It’s 
                        right next door.  Would save me 
                        having to find a baby-sitter.

                                 OLIVER
                        You’ll be home though.  Right.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Late mostly, baby.  We have to eat.  
                        I have to work.  Your 
                        father’s...not helpful.  The new 
                        school isn’t free.  Neither is 
                        Spam.

           Oliver eats, thinks.

                                 OLIVER
                        I guess he’s too old to be 
                        dangerous and not too old to be too 
                        dangerous either.  If you know what 
                        I mean.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s what I thought.  We’ll give 
                        it a whirl.  See what happens.  
                        ‘Kay.

                                 OLIVER
                        Sure.

           Then...

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Excellent.  So...saints are human 
                        beings we celebrate for their 
                        dedication and commitment to other 
                        human beings.  For their 
                        sacrifices.  Their work to make 
                        society better for those around 
                        them and those that’ll come after 
                        them.  I believe there are saints 
                        all around us today.  They might 
                        never be recognized as such by a 
                        religion, but they’re every bit as 
                        important to our society as the 
                        saints that are in our textbook.

                        saint...

           Rachele raises her hand.

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        Rachele?

                                 KEESHA
                        My father is like a saint.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Ah...thank you...no family members.  
                        That’s too easy.

           Oliver scratches out some doodling, a word: ”Family.”

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Oliver’s walking home.  He looks like an ant.  Small, 
           steady, undetectable.  He turns the corner and heads down 
           a residential street.

           RESEDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS

           As Oliver rounds the corner, he damn near runs into FOUR 
           KIDS ON BIKES.  It’s Ozinski, Brooklyn and TWO OTHER 
           JERKS.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Hey...it’s dip shit.

                                 BROOKLYN
                        You live in this neighborhood?

           Oliver doesn’t talk.

                                 OZINSKI
                        I got detention cause a you.  
                        Asshole.

           Ozinski runs his bike tire up unto Oliver’s foot.  Holds 
           it down.

                                 OLIVER
                        You got detention because you took 
                        my pants.

                                 OZINSKI
                        How do you know I took your pants?

           He puts weight on the front tire, squeezing Oliver’s 
           foot.
                                 OLIVER
                        Please...that hurts.

                                 OZINSKI
                        That’s what you get for being a 
                        narc.

                                 OLIVER
                        I have to get home.

                                 BROOKLYN
                        You gonna cry?

           Brooklyn runs his bike up on the other foot.  Oliver 
           falls down on his ass.  The boys laugh, taunt Oliver on 
           the ground.

           Just then Vin’s car pulls up to the curb in front of the 
           scene.

                                 VINCENT
                        What’re you little shit heels 
                        doing?

           They back away from Oliver.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        That you Robert Ozinski?

                                 OZINSKI
                        No, sir.  My name’s John.

                                 VINCENT
                        Bullshit, you little prick.  You’re 
                        Reesa’s kid.  Reesa Ozinski.  I 
                        recognize you from your fat Polish 
                        nose.

           Vin gets out of the car.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Just like your prick father’s nose.  

           Vin reaches under his seat and grabs a tire iron.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Apple doesn’t fall too far from the 
                        rotten tree.

           The kid’s panic at the sight of the tire iron.  They haul 
           ass out of there, riding down the sidewalk.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Get out of here, you little pencil 
                        dicks!  I’ll call your mother when 
                        I get home!

           Vin walks up to Oliver.  Looks down at him.  Checks his 
           watch.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You’re a little early.  I’ll charge 
                        your mother an extra hour.

           Vin offers Oliver his hand.  He accepts it, pulls up onto 
           his feet.  Vin heads to the car.  Oliver waits.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You need a paper invitation?

           Oliver joins him.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Driving.  A large basket of clean laundry sits between 
           them.

                                 VINCENT
                        You got two choices in life.  Fight 
                        or run.  I’m guessing you’re not 
                        fast.

                                 OLIVER
                        Not particularly, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        When I was your age I could run a 
                        half-an-hour in twenty minutes.

           Oliver doesn’t get it.  Vin lights a cigarette.

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m allergic, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        To what?

                                 OLIVER
                        Cigarette smoke.

           Vin rolls down his window, hangs his cigarette outside.  
           Keeps smoking.

                                 VINCENT
                        Your father never taught you how to 
                        take care of yourself.

                                 OLIVER
                        No, sir.  He’s a pacifist.

                                 VINCENT
                        This country wasn’t founded by tree 
                        huggers, kid.  That’s for sure.  
                        You gotta stand up for yourself or 
                        you get mowed down.

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m small, sir.  If you haven’t 
                        noticed.
                                 VINCENT
                        So was Hitler.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s not a great comparison.

                                 VINCENT
                        Making a point, fella.  Small means 
                        nothing.  It’s what you got in 
                        here.

           Vin points to his head.

                                 OLIVER
                        Or here, sir.

           Oliver points to his heart.  Vin looks at the little 
           fella.  This kid’s interesting.

                                 VINCENT
                        I don’t like, sir.  Told you that.

                                 OLIVER
                        Sorry...Vincent.

           They drive on.

           EXT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - DAY

           An expensive, well-kept convalescent center.  Vin’s car 
           pulls in and parks in a handicapped spot.

           INT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - CONTINUOUS

           Vin and Oliver are walking down the hallway.  Oliver’s 
           carrying the laundry basket.

                                 VINCENT
                        Don’t talk when we get in there.

                                 OLIVER
                        Where are we going?

                                 VINCENT
                        Practice not talking now.

           Vin turns a corner.

           PATIENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A WOMAN lies in a bed, watching TV.  This is Vin’s wife.  
           SANDY.  She has advanced Alzheimer's.  Vin and Oliver 
           enter.

                                 SANDY
                        There you are doctor.
                                 VINCENT
                        Nope.  It’s me, Vincent.

           Sandy looks at him, no idea.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Just dropping off the laundry.

           Vin directs Oliver.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Put that stuff in the drawers over 
                        there.

           Oliver complies.

                                 SANDY
                        Today’s my birthday.

                                 VINCENT
                        Okay.  Well, happy birthday.

                                 SANDY
                        They say I’m getting out of here 
                        next week.

           They don’t.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s great.

           This would be sad for Vin...but it’s been several years 
           now.  Plus, he’s thickly calloused.

                                 SANDY
                                 (re: Oliver)
                        Is that your grandson?

                                 VINCENT
                        Nope.  Just a kid.

           Sandy looks him over.  Changes like the wind.

                                 SANDY
                        Can you tell them I don’t like the 
                        green beans when they put the bacon 
                        bits chopped up in there with them.  
                        It’s too greasy for me.

                                 VINCENT
                        You bet, Sandy.

           NURSE’S STATION - LATER

           Vin’s talking with Sandy’s nurse, ANA, a kind-eyed 
           Filipino lady in her forties.  She hands him a bundle of 
           laundry.  
                                 ANA
                        You know, we can do the laundry 
                        here, Mr. Vincent.  We have the 
                        service.

                                 VINCENT
                        Gives me something to do.

           Vin hands the laundry off to Oliver.

                                 ANA
                        Who’s your helper?

                                 VINCENT
                        He’s twelve bucks an hour.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s Oliver actually.

                                 ANA
                        Nice to meet you, Oliver.  I’m Ana.

           Vin heads off.  Stops.

                                 VINCENT
                        She doesn’t like the green beans.

                                 ANA
                        I’ll make a note, Mr. Vincent.

           Ana writes in a pad.

                                 VINCENT
                        Broccoli's good.  She always liked 
                        broccoli.

           Vin walks off.  Oliver catches up.

           INT. VINCENT’S GARAGE - LATER

           Oliver’s standing in a fight stance across from Vin, 
           who’s wearing a bandana, holding a Maker’s Mark in one 
           hand while leaning against a hanging body bag.

           Oliver punches the bag.  It’s like a butterfly kiss.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s just going to get you beat 
                        up real bad.

                                 OLIVER
                        I don’t want to fight anyway.

                                 VINCENT
                        No one wants to fight, kid.  You 
                        think I wanted to go to war?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINCENT (CONT'D)
                        You think an eighteen year old 
                        wants to sit in a rice paddy while 
                        bullets are screaming past his ears 
                        on both sides?

                                 OLIVER
                        When was that?

                                 VINCENT
                        Vietnam.

                                 OLIVER
                        You were there?

                                 VINCENT
                        No, I’m imagining it.

           Vincent steps back, thinks.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        All right.  I’ll teach you one 
                        thing, it’s probably the only hope 
                        you got.  If you do it right, 
                        you’ll break his nose with one 
                        shot.

           Oliver is rattled.

                                 OLIVER
                        Break his nose.

                                 VINCENT
                        Don’t worry, you won’t do it right.

           EXT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

           Maggie’s walking to her car after work.  She’s exhausted.  
           Just as she puts her key in the door...a MAN walks up. 

                                 MAN
                        Maggie?

           She turns, clutches her purse.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I have mace.

                                 MAN
                        I have papers.

           The man holds up an envelope.  Moves closer.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        LA County Family court.

           He hands the papers to Maggie.  She hates taking them.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        As they say, “You’ve been served.”
           He walks off.  Maggie leans against the car.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           It’s late.  Maggie knocks on Vin’s door.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Vin’s leading Maggie into the den.

                                 VINCENT
                        He fell asleep an hour ago.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m sorry, I got tied up at the 
                        hospital...

                                 VINCENT
                        They tie up a lot people over 
                        there.  Some against their will.

           In the den, we find Oliver asleep on the couch.  Felix 
           the Cat is curled up on top of him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll pay you of course for the 
                        extra time.

                                 VINCENT
                        I wasn’t offering a rebate.

           Maggie scoops up a sleeping Oliver.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        What you been crying about?

           It’s very obvious that Maggie’s been bawling.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s a long story.

                                 VINCENT
                        What’s the one liner?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oliver’s father wants custody.

           Vin thinks.

                                 VINCENT
                        There goes my job security.

           Maggie smiles.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        That could’ve gone either way.
           EXT. THE PINK CADILLAC - STRIP CLUB - THE NEXT DAY

           Classic dumpy titty-bar in a rundown industrial strip.  
           Vin’s sitting in his car in the parking lot.  Waiting.

           Charisse eventually comes rolling out a side door.  Spots 
           Vin.  Walks his way.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Charisse hops in, pissed.

                                 VINCENT
                        Who pissed in your Cheerios?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Can’t dance no more.

                                 VINCENT
                        That a surprise?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Screw you, Vin.  I need the money.

                                 VINCENT
                        The self-employed racket is a tough 
                        road, I’ll say that.

                                 CHARISSE
                        I should sue ‘em.  It’s...what’s 
                        that...discrimination.  Against 
                        pregnant women and shit.

                                 VINCENT
                        I think you gotta case.

                                 CHARISSE
                        This baby’s costing me a lotta 
                        jack.

                                 VINCENT
                        Not as much as he’s gonna cost ya.

                                 CHARISSE
                        He’s not a he.

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s a she?

                                 CHARISSE
                        It better be.  I don’ want no boy.

                                 VINCENT
                        You don’t know?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Know what?
                                 VINCENT
                        The sex of the baby?

                                 CHARISSE
                        How I know that, Vin?  I’m some 
                        kinda psychic and shit.

           INT. OBGYN’S EXAMINING ROOM - LATER

           Charisse has her legs up in stirrups, as an ULTRASOUND 
           TECH squirts gel on her belly in preparation for an 
           ultrasound.

                                 CHARISSE
                        That thing’s cold.

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH
                        Sorry.  Forgot to tell you that.  
                        It’s cold.  But just for a minute.

           The Tech places the wand on Charisse’s belly.

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna move this around here and 
                        take some pictures of the baby.

                                 CHARISSE
                        That thing takes pictures?

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH
                        Well.  Sort of.

                                 CHARISSE
                        This is like Star Trek shit, man.

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH
                        It’s pretty cool.  See...there... 
                        right...there.  That’s the head.

           Charisse looks at the monitor.

                                 CHARISSE
                        That’s a big head.

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH
                        Biggest part at this age.

           Adjusts the wand.

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH (CONT’D)
                        And these are her little legs.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Her?

                                 ULTRASOUND TECH
                        Oh, it’s a girl.  You didn’t know? 
                        I’m sorry, did you not want to 
                        know?
           Charisse could cry.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Na.  I wanna know.

           INT. OBGYN’S LOBBY - LATER

           Vin and Charisse are checking out with a MEDICAL 
           RECEPTIONIST.  Vin is digging through his wallet.  He 
           pulls out a tattered insurance card.

                                 VINCENT
                        Here you go.

           The receptionist takes the card.  Inspects.

                                 MEDICAL RECEPTIONIST
                        Is...she...on your insurance as..?

                                 VINCENT
                        A dependant.

                                 CHARISSE
                        I’m his dawter.

           Really.

                                 VINCENT
                        Adopted.  Obviously.

                                 MEDICAL RECEPTIONIST
                        Oh.  Okay.  I’ll just need to 
                        collect your deductible.

           Vin digs through his wallet.

                                 VINCENT
                        What’s that run?

                                 MEDICAL RECEPTIONIST
                                 (inspects the card)
                        Looks like twenty dollars.

           Charisse puts her head on Vin’s shoulder.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Thanks, Poppy.

           Vin forks over a twenty.

                                 VINCENT
                        You owe me for the deductible.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Dodge ball in progress.  TWO TEAMS OF BOYS compete, 
           throwing the ball as hard as they can at each other.
           Coach Mitchell’s on the opposite side of the gym, working 
           on basketball drills with the GIRLS.

           Ozinski and Brooklyn are mowing down their OPPONENTS one 
           after another...until only Oliver remains.  He’s hard to 
           hit, he’s so tiny.

           Ozinski has the ball.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Get ready for a red ass, shit bag. 

           He runs.  Throws.  Oliver jumps.  The ball bounces under 
           him and hits the wall, heading back towards Ozinski.

           Oliver runs for the ball, as fast as his fawn legs will 
           take him.  It’s like slow motion.

           At the half line...the ball is feet away from crossing 
           back onto Ozinski’s side.  Oliver dives for it.

           Thud.  He lands hard on the gym floor, his face smacks 
           the half line.

           Ozinski grabs the ball.  Smiles.  Runs toward Oliver.

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Say your prayers, you little pussy.

           Ozinski winds up.  Oliver stands, trying to get the hell 
           out of there.

           Ozinski’s a few feet away.  He hurls the ball at Oliver’s 
           mug...

           Thwwapppppp.  Right on the kisser.  This is bad.  
           Oliver’s glasses fly off his head.  He crashes to the 
           floor in a heap.  Both hands over his face.

           Silence.  You could hear a pin drop.  KIDS gather around 
           Oliver, concerned, curious, scared.  He’s not moving.

           Even Ozinski looks worried.  He walks over, closer to 
           Oliver.

           A whistle blows.  Coach Mitchell runs across the gym 
           towards the scene.  He gets there just as Oliver lifts 
           his head, uncovers his face.  Blood everywhere.

           Coach Mitchell pushes through the crowd.  Ozinski backs 
           up.  Out of nowhere...Oliver screams, a guttural kind of 
           attack call.

                                 OLIVER
                        You mother fucking, ass-face, dick 
                        bag...

           He has the wildest, animalistic look in his eyes...and 
           he’s running directly at Ozinski.
           The entire class is frozen in disbelief...what the hell 
           is he doing?

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Asshole, cock sucking, son-of-a-
                        whore...

           With his hand in some sort of death grip-blow, he hits 
           Ozinski square in the nose...and up  Driving his schnoz 
           into his brain.

           Splickkkk!  Ozinski’s nose explodes with blood.  He falls 
           flat backwards, passing out along the way.

           Thud.  Ozinski smacks down on the gym floor.  Game over.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Oliver runs up to the house, bangs on the front door.

           Waits.  Bangs again.  Waits.

           Finally...Charisse opens the door, wearing one of Vin’s 
           old robes.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Yeah.

                                 OLIVER
                        Who are you?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Who are you?

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m Oliver.  Vin watches me after 
                        school.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Why you gotta bang so many times?

                                 OLIVER
                        He’s hard of hearing.

           Vin screams from within.

                                 VINCENT
                        Let him in.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Who you yelling at!?

           Charisse opens the door wide for Oliver.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Always yelling at somebody.
           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - THE DEN - LATER

           Vin and Charisse are sitting on the couch.  Oliver’s 
           standing in front of them, his eyeglasses are patched 
           together with tape.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (a tinge of pride)
                        You broke his nose.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes, sir.  I think so.  There was 
                        blood everywhere.  You should have 
                        seen it.

                                 VINCENT
                        You must have hit it just right.  
                        Let me see.

           Oliver demonstrates: the hand position, the stance.

                                 CHARISSE
                        You taught him that?

                                 VINCENT
                        He needs to learn how to defend 
                        himself.  He’s a runt.

           Charisse stands, had enough.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Where’s my cash?

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s on the dresser.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Last week?

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s all there.

           Charisse walks off.

                                 CHARISSE
                        You shouldn’t be teaching nobody 
                        nothing.

           She’s gone.

                                 VINCENT
                        That went over like a fart in a 
                        spacesuit.

                                 OLIVER
                        Who is she?

                                 VINCENT
                        A prostitute.
                                 OLIVER
                        What’s that?

           Vin lights a cigarette.

                                 VINCENT
                        One of the more honest ways to make 
                        a living.

           INT. SANTA ANITA RACE TRACK - DAY - LATER

           Trackside.  Oliver and Vin are sitting in Vin’s booth 
           studying the race program.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s 20 slash 1?

                                 VINCENT
                        Those are the odds.  Some bookie 
                        outta Vegas thinks that horse has a 
                        one in twenty chance of winning.

                                 OLIVER
                        And what do you get if he does?

                                 VINCENT
                        Twenty times your money.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s a good deal.

                                 VINCENT
                        Sure.  In theory.  You feeling 
                        lucky?

                                 OLIVER
                        I think so.

                                 VINCENT
                        Go with the trifecta.

                                 OLIVER
                        English, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        You pick three horses to finish 1-2-
                        3, in the order they’re gonna come 
                        in.  High risk, high reward.

                                 OLIVER
                        Sounds highly improbable.

                                 VINCENT
                        If you’re gonna gamble, you might 
                        as well have the chance to win big.

           Oliver scans the form, thinks.  Then...
                                 OLIVER
                        Wishful Thinking.  Sweeter Lady.  
                        Champagne Flute.  One, two, three.

           Vin pulls some cash from his wallet.

                                 VINCENT
                        Let’s do it.

           They’re off to the betting window.

           THE FINISH LINE - LATER

           The HORSES fly across.  One.  Two.  Three.  We whip over 
           to Vin and Oliver standing at the rail, screaming like 
           school kids.  They hit it!  The trifecta.  For the first 
           time we see Vin’s smile.  It’s the kind of smile that 
           lights up a life.

           INT. THE BUCK - NIGHT - LATER

           Celebration dinner.  Vin and Oliver are bellied up to the 
           bar, eating a feast of bar food.  Burgers, fries, 
           mozzarella sticks, onion rings, Coke, a few Maker’s 
           Marks.  Oliver’s shaking a new bottle of ketchup, it’s 
           futile.

                                 VINCENT
                        Give me that.

           Vin grabs a knife.  Pokes it in the bottle’s spout.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You gotta pop the cherry.

           The ketchup starts to flow.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Flows with ease.

           Oliver takes the ketchup.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s the cherry?

                                 VINCENT
                        Another day, squirt.  Remind me.  
                        Or forget to remind me, even 
                        better.

           Oliver slurps his Coke to the bottom.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You want another?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes, please.
                                 VINCENT
                        Go for it.  We’re living today.

           Oliver calls out weakly to the bartender (Roger.)

                                 OLIVER
                        Excuse me, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        You kids.  All small talkers.  
                        Can’t text the damn bartender.  Use 
                        your voice.  No arrogance, no 
                        apology.  Come on...

           Oliver belts out.

                                 OLIVER
                        Excuse me, sir.

           Roger turns.

                                 ROGER
                        Be right there.

                                 VINCENT
                        Can’t get nothing in this life 
                        without being heard.

           Vin digs in his pocket for a roll of Tums.  Pops a few in 
           his mouth.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m going take a pre-emptive Tums.

           He hands two to Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s it for?

                                 VINCENT
                        This food’s hard on the innards.

           Oliver eats the Tums.

                                 OLIVER
                        Tastes like chalk.

                                 VINCENT
                        You get used to it.

                                 OLIVER
                        You can get used to a lot of 
                        distasteful things.

                                 VINCENT
                        It happens.

           Vin dabs out his cigarette.
           EXT. THE BUCK - NIGHT - LATER

           Vin and Oliver step out of the bar into the night.  On 
           the way to the car...they cross our Legless Homeless Guy, 
           poking through a trash can.

           Oliver stops.  Digs in his pocket and pulls out the 
           remainder of his winnings.  Walks up to the Homeless Guy 
           and holds out the money.

                                 OLIVER
                        Here you go, sir.

           The Homeless Guy takes the offering.

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        God bless you, little fella.

                                 OLIVER
                        Thank you, sir.  You have a good 
                        dinner tonight.

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        I will.  You bet.  A feast.

           Oliver heads back to Vin.  They walk to the car.

                                 VINCENT
                        You gave him your whole stash.

                                 OLIVER
                        I don’t need it.  I’m ten.  
                        Everyone takes care of me.

           At the car.

                                 VINCENT
                        You could start saving for the 
                        future, you know.  There’s 
                        tomorrow.

                                 OLIVER
                        There is no future really.  There’s 
                        only today.

           Vin shakes his head at the kid.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        One of my mom’s self help books.

                                 VINCENT
                        Drop it off after school.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

           Vin’s car pulls into the driveway.  The headlights 
           illuminate a very pissed off Maggie, standing on Vin’s 
           lawn.
           Vin and Oliver climb out of the car.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hi, mom.

                                 MAGGIE
                                 (to Vin)
                        I don’t appreciate you taking him 
                        anywhere in a car without asking 
                        me.

                                 VINCENT
                        This is gonna be fun.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t be a smart ass for once.  I 
                        need to know where my son is at all 
                        times, okay?

                                 VINCENT
                        We went to eat.

                                 OLIVER
                        He’s out of Spam.

                                 VINCENT
                        Among other things.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Get your homework done, Oliver.  Go 
                        on.

                                 OLIVER
                        Okay.

           Oliver slumps off.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Good night, Vin.

                                 VINCENT
                        We’ll see.

           Oliver goes inside.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s fighting at school.  You know 
                        about this?

                                 VINCENT
                        He mentioned something like that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Great.  He tells you.  Not his 
                        mother.

                                 VINCENT
                        If you haven’t noticed...you’re not 
                        home often.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINCENT (CONT'D)
                        Kinda hard to have a conversation 
                        with someone when they’re not 
                        there.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love it when people like you give 
                        people like me advice.  Especially 
                        parenting advice.

                                 VINCENT
                        I didn’t sign on for hormones here, 
                        deary.  That’ll cost you 15 bucks 
                        an hour.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You don’t have kids.  You don’t 
                        have anything to think about but 
                        yourself. 

           Vin starts to walk away.

                                 VINCENT
                        What do you know about me?  Really?  
                        Tell me.  Please.

           Vin stops.  Maggie thinks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.  You’re right.  I don’t know 
                        a whole lot about you.  Because you 
                        don’t want much known.  So you act 
                        like a prick and everyone stays 
                        away.

                                 VINCENT
                        If it ain’t broken...

                                 MAGGIE
                        It is broken.  Look at it.

           Vin goes into his house.  Gets the last word in before he 
           closes the door.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m up to 40 hours this week.  41 
                        starts time-and-a-half.

           He’s gone.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Oliver’s sitting on a bench outside the Principal’s 
           office.  Across from him, Ozinski’s sitting with his 
           MOTHER (REESA.)  Ozinski’s nose is bandaged like a prize 
           fighter’s.
                                 REESA
                                 (to Oliver)
                        You’re a real tiny fella, aren’t 
                        ya.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes, ma'am.

                                 REESA
                        You take Judo or something.

           Ozinski is embarrassed.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Ma.

                                 REESA
                        Shut your face.  You’re not 
                        supposed to talk for a month.

           Ozinski slumps.

                                 REESA (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad it was a little shit that 
                        knocked the snot outta-ya.  Now ya 
                        got no excuses.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie’s sitting across from PRINCIPAL O’BRIEN, a puffy-
           faced official looking gent in his fifties.  Maggie’s 
           reading a report.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I can’t even say these words.

                                 PRINCIPAL O’BRIEN
                        They’re...creative.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s one way to put it.

                                 PRINCIPAL O’BRIEN
                        Adjusting to a new school is tough 
                        on children at this age.  At any 
                        age.  So, I don’t want to minimize 
                        that...but is there anything else 
                        going on that we should be aware 
                        of?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t even know where to start.

                                 PRINCIPAL O’BRIEN
                        How about his father?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh.  Well.  Please.  That’ll take 
                        up your whole day.

                        We’re in the middle of a divorce.  
                        Oliver’s father, ah...was sleeping 
                        with his assistant.  And our 
                        accountant.  And her assistant.  
                        And my hairdresser.  While she was 
                        still cutting my hair.  I have 
                        someone else now obviously.  
                        So...I...we’re not on speaking 
                        terms of course.  The hairdresser.  
                        Oliver’s father too, of course.  
                        Now he’s filed for custody of 
                        Oliver.  Full custody.  And he has 
                        a lot more money than me.  You see.  
                        Plus he’s a lawyer, so he’s getting 
                        his end of the “work” done by a 
                        buddy.  Who used to be my “buddy” 
                        as well.  And so.  I just took 
                        Oliver away as fast as I could and 
                        took this job at Mission Hills.  
                        I’m a CAT scan tech, so I see a lot 
                        of rough situations.  Tumors.  
                        Cancer.  Cysts.  Clots.  All that.  
                        And of course, I know what I see 
                        and I can’t say anything to people, 
                        which is miserable, as you can 
                        imagine.  But I’m not a doctor and 
                        that’s not my end of the deal.  So.  
                        People get into that machine with 
                        lots of fear.  They’re scared.  So.  
                        And I work really late, trying to 
                        get our act together.  Give Oliver 
                        a better education and a semi-
                        normal life.  And fight David and 
                        this custody shit.  Excuse me.  
                        That’s his name.  My ex.  Soon to 
                        be ex.  Even.  David.  He never 
                        wanted kids anyway.  He just 
                        doesn’t want me to be happy or have 
                        anything.  Oliver’s adopted.  Do 
                        you know that?  How would you.  I’m 
                        not able to have kids.  Something 
                        about my Fallopian tubes being 
                        twisted.  I think they were just 
                        recoiling from David’s sperm.

           Maggie reaches for a tissue.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Do you mind?

           Principal O’Brien shakes his head “no.”  He has no words.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure all of this has permeated 
                        into Oliver’s little being.  And 
                        he’s acting out, as they say kids 
                        do in these situations.  Right?

           Principal O’Brien smiles.  Maggie blows her nose.
           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - CLASSROOM

           Detention room.  Oliver’s sitting in an empty classroom.  
           Ozinski is sitting a few seats in front of him, facing 
           him.  Both boys have a one piece of paper and a pencil.

           Quiet.  Finally Ozinski breaks the silence.

                                 OZINSKI
                        My real name’s Robert.  Ozinski is 
                        my last name.  People call me 
                        Ozinski cause Crespi called me that 
                        last year.  Now everyone calls me 
                        that.

           Oliver stares at him, pensive.  

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        I don’t really like it.  Ozinski.  
                        Just too many kids call me that 
                        now, so it’s not like I can go 
                        ‘round all day and tell ‘em, “Hey, 
                        don’t call me Ozinski, my name’s 
                        Robert.”  Cause I would spend my 
                        whole life doin’ that.

           Oliver writes on his paper: “Doesn’t like Ozinski.  
           Prefers Robert.”

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Robert was my dad’s name.  So, I’m 
                        a junior.  He’s not around though.  
                        I don’t really know him, cause he 
                        left when I was a baby.

           Oliver writes.  Looks up.  Sees Ozinski for the first 
           time really.  Then...

                                 OLIVER
                        My dad’s not around either.  He did 
                        some bad things to my mom and so we 
                        left and I haven’t seen him in a 
                        while.

                                 OZINSKI
                        No shit.

           Oliver nods.  Ozinski stares.  He’s thinking.  It looks 
           painful.  He then digs into his backpack.  Grabs 
           something.  Walks over to Oliver and puts...Oliver’s 
           house key and cell phone on the desk.

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Your dad the one that taught ya how 
                        ta fight?

           Oliver takes the phone, keys.

                                 OLIVER
                        Nah.  My baby sitter.
           INT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - DAY - LATER

           Tacky office.  Vin’s sitting across from the rehab 
           director, SHIRLEY JORSTIN, a tight-lipped, tough egg in 
           her 50s.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        There’s plenty of affordable health 
                        care options, Mr. Canatella.  
                        Sunnyside’s very exclusive.  Not 
                        for everyone.

                                 VINCENT
                        My Sally, she’s gotta have the 
                        best.  So, I’ll just figure this 
                        thing out.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Of course.  But, you’re a few 
                        months behind here.  So.  We’re not 
                        in the credit business, as you 
                        know.

                                 VINCENT
                        I get that.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        So...

                                 VINCENT
                        So, what’s that mean?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        We’ll transfer her wherever you 
                        decide to put her.

                                 VINCENT
                        Put her.  That’s it.  We’re getting 
                        the boot?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        That’s not the best way to phrase 
                        what’s happening.

                                 VINCENT
                        We been here eight years.  Just 
                        asking for a little grace.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        This is the health care business, 
                        sir.  I’m sorry.  It is a business.  

           INT. SUNNYSIDE REHABILITATION FACILITY - LATER

           Vin’s in Sandy’s room, putting clean laundry in her 
           dresser drawers.
                                 SANDY
                        Doctor, can you tell the nurse that 
                        I need a cold pillow.  My pillow’s 
                        too hot.

                                 VINCENT
                        Yep.  I’ll tell her.

                                 SANDY
                        She can even put it in the freezer 
                        for a few minutes to make it 
                        colder.

                                 VINCENT
                        Okay.  We’ll do that.

           Vin brings Sandy another pillow.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you use this one and let 
                        me have the other, so I can put it 
                        in the freezer.

           Sandy looks at Vin.  Studies his face.  She remembers 
           something...

                                 SANDY
                        That’s a good idea.

           She takes his hand.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        You always have good ideas, Vin.

           Vin...she said Vin.  He can’t move.

                                 VINCENT
                        Sandy.

           A beat.

                                 SANDY
                        Betty.

           And just like that, she’s gone.

                                 SANDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like it’s hard to 
                        remember, doctor.  I know you have 
                        a lot of patients.

           Vin could die.  It’s just too much.  He swaps pillows.

                                 VINCENT
                        Let me get that pillow fixed up for 
                        you.
           INT. NURSE’S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Vin hands Ana the Nurse the pillow.

                                 VINCENT
                        Maybe just keep one in the freezer 
                        and rotate them out every so often.

                                 ANA
                        Okay, Mr. Vincent.  I’ll leave a 
                        note for the night nurse too.

           Vin reaches into his pocket, pulls out some cash.  A few 
           wrinkled twenties.  He hands them to Ana.

                                 ANA (CONT’D)
                        No.  No, sir, Mr. Vincent.  This is 
                        my job.  I take care of people.  
                        Please.

                                 VINCENT
                        You go way beyond doing your job, 
                        Ana.  You been an angel for my 
                        Sally.  So...please

           He puts the money in her smock pocket.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Just please.  For me.  It’s the 
                        least I can do.

           Ana’s practically blushing.

                                 ANA
                        Oh, goodness, Mr. Vincent.  It’s 
                        really not necessary.

                                 VINCENT
                        Neither is freezing the damn 
                        pillow.

           She laughs.

                                 ANA
                        This is crazy idea.

           Vin smiles.

                                 VINCENT
                        Bat shit crazy.

           They laugh.  Vin never laughs.

                                 ANA
                        Okay, Mr. Vincent.  We don’t make 
                        habit now.  Okay?

                                 VINCENT
                        Deal.  I’m shit broke anyway.
                                 ANA
                        You are very funny, sir.  Okay.  I 
                        put this in the freezer right now.

                                 VINCENT
                        Thanks, Ana.

           Ana walks off with the pillow, disappearing behind the 
           station.

           Vin looks at the cabinet on the wall behind the 
           counter...full of meds.  He looks over his shoulder.

           INT. RACETRACK - CONTINUOUS

           Betting window.  Vin is placing a huge bet.

                                 VINCENT
                        Lucky Lincoln.  New Dime and 
                        Sammy’s Savior.  One, two, three in 
                        the third.

           The ATTENDANT takes the cash.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        That’s going to make me all better, 
                        my friend.

           Vin collects the ticket.  Rubs it for good luck.

           INT. RACETRACK - BAR

           Vin’s watching the race on the bar TV.

           The race trumpet blows.  The HORSES writhe in their 
           stalls.  The buzzer sounds.  The gates fly open.  
           And...they’re off.

           Vin can’t watch, he closes his eyes.  Takes a long drink 
           of his Maker’s.  Puffs his cigarette.  Listens.

           The ANNOUNCER calls the race.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        And that’s New Dime taking the 
                        early lead on the rails, followed 
                        by Pretty Patty and Lucky Lincoln.

           Vin talks to himself.

                                 VINCENT
                        Come on.  Now.  One time.  One 
                        time.  I been faithful.

           The Announcer keeps barking in the background.  Vin keeps 
           talking to himself.
           EXT. RACETRACK - LATER

           Vin’s walking towards his car.  He lost.  It’s in his 
           gait.

           INT. THE BUCK - LATER

           Vin’s slumped, ruined in his mind.  Head down.  Cigarette 
           dangling from his lips.  Gus and Linda are sitting on 
           their regular stools, playing Kino.

                                 GUS
                        Vin give me a number?

                                 VINCENT
                        Five grand.

                                 GUS
                        A Kino number.

                                 VINCENT
                        You got five grand I can borrow, 
                        Gus?  I’ll probably die before I 
                        pay you back even.

                                 GUS
                        You serious?

                                 VINCENT
                        Dead serious.

                                 GUS
                        If I had five grand, I wouldn’t be 
                        sitting here.  Let me tell ya.  
                        We’d be on that Carnival Cruise 
                        ship somewhere.

                                 LINDA
                        The Alaskan one, Gus.  They say 
                        that one’s the prettiest.

                                 GUS
                        Whatever one.  Eating the damn 
                        buffet.  They say those buffets are 
                        like something else.  Endless crab 
                        and lobster and salad bar.

                                 LINDA
                        The drinks are gratis too.  
                        Champagne in the morning with 
                        orange juice.  They gotta name for 
                        it...

                                 VINCENT
                        Mimosa.

                                 LINDA
                        That’s it.
           Vin stands, throws some money on the bar.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (calls out to Roger)
                        Rog.  Get these two some Mimosas on 
                        me.

                                 LINDA
                                 (surprised in the least)
                        Oh.  That’s sweet of ya, Vin.

           Vin walks off.

                                 VINCENT
                        I hope you two get to that cruise 
                        one day.

           He leaves.  Gus and Linda are in shock.

                                 LINDA
                        That was real nice a him.

                                 GUS
                        Sure was.

           EXT. CITY STREET - LATER

           Vin’s car labors through traffic.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s reading the label on a bottle of prescription 
           medication.

           INSERT: OxyContin. Warning, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION 
           WITH ALCOHOL.

           Vin tosses the bottle in the passenger seat.  It 
           hits...several bottles of prescription meds, stolen from 
           Sunnyside.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER

           Vin buys a bottle of Maker’s Mark.  Leaves.

           EXT. VIN’S CAR - LATER

           Vin’s driving through a seedy part of town.  Looking 
           around for...
           STREET CORNER - CONTINUOUS

           ...Charisse...walking down the block.  A Mercedes pulls 
           up curbside.  Charisse talks to a MAN in the car, then 
           loads in.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Vin looks sad.  Maybe he finally knows he’s all alone.  
           He lights a cigarette and drives off. 

           EXT. VIN’S DRIVEWAY - LATER

           He pulls into his driveway.  Parks.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Vin sits there.  Looking at his house.  His life.  It’s 
           all shit.  He grabs the vials of pills, stuffs them in 
           his pockets.  Grabs the bottle of booze, heads inside.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Vin walks in.  Shuts the door behind him.  Turns when he 
           hears... 

                                 ZUCKO
                        You must think I’m not a very 
                        serious person, Vinny.

           How the hell did he get here?

                                 VINCENT
                        You broke into my house?

                                 ZUCKO
                        The back door was “ajar.”

                                 VINCENT
                        You have no right to be here.  How 
                        the hell do you know where I live?

                                 ZUCKO
                        I do homework on assholes that owe 
                        me money.

           Another THUG walks into the room from the bedroom.  This 
           is ANTWAN.  Big, dirty.  He’s carrying a jewelry box.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s my wife’s, you son-of-a-
                        bitch.

           Vin makes a move for the kitchen.
                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m calling the police.

           Zucko stands, pulls out a gun.

                                 ZUCKO
                        Really.  You think that’s 
                        realistic?  We’re just gonna sit 
                        here and let you pick up a phone 
                        and dial 911.  Are you that old?  
                        Or that stupid?

           Vin turns to Antwan, yanks the jewelry box out of his 
           hands.

                                 VINCENT
                        Get the hell away from this.  You 
                        can’t have it.

           Antwan pushes Vin.  He flies across the room.  Hits the 
           fireplace wall.  Jewelry everywhere.

                                 ZUCKO
                        You always have to take the hard 
                        way, Vin.  Why is that?

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s more interesting.

           Vin rolls up his sleeves.  Preparing to fight.

                                 ZUCKO
                        It’s more painful.  Even I know 
                        that.

           Vin takes a step towards Antwan.

                                 ANTWAN
                        This mother fucker’s crazy.

                                 ZUCKO
                        Don’t kill him, just get close.

           Vin takes another step.  Stops.  Something’s wrong.  He’s 
           wobbly.  He grabs his head.  Shakes it.

                                 ZUCKO (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing, old man?

           Vin is blurry eyed.  He drops to his knees.  Hard.  His 
           eyes roll back in his head.  It looks like a seizure.

                                 ANTWAN
                        He’s dying, man.

           Vin falls face first onto the floor.  Thud.

                                                              BLACK OUT.
                                 ZUCKO (V.O.)
                                 (in the darkness)
                        Don’t touch him.

           EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - SIDEWALKS

           Oliver’s walking out of the school with Ozinski.

                                 OZINSKI
                        I have a cousin that’s Jewish.  He 
                        had a big shit party when he turned 

                                 OLIVER
                        A barmitzah.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Yeah.  That’s it.  Biggest party I 
                        ever seen.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s a coming-of-age ceremony.  
                        Supposedly a boy becomes a man at 
                        that age.

           Ozinski thinks long and hard.  It hurts.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Nah.  My cousin ain’t no man.  He’s 
                        a little pussy.  His wiener ain’t 
                        even shaved.

                                 OLIVER
                        Circumcised.

           They stop at Ozinski’s bike, chained to a rack.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Man, you know a lotta fancy words, 
                        Oliver.  You’re like an Einstein.

           Oliver smiles.

                                 OLIVER
                        I read a lot.

                                 OZINSKI
                        That’s cool.  I’ll see ya tomorrow.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yep.  Bye, Robert.

           Ozinski smiles.  Oliver walks away.  Then...

                                 OZINSKI
                        Hey, how come ya don’t have a bike?
           EXT. CITY STREET - LATER

           Oliver’s riding on the back of Ozinski’s bike.  Scared 
           for his life, but loving every minute of it.

           EXT. RESEDENTIAL STREET - LATER

           Ozinski and Oliver arrive in front of Vin’s house.  
           Oliver jumps off the bike.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Ya think I could meet the old 
                        bastard?

                                 OLIVER
                        Sure.  Just know that he’s not real 
                        friendly at first.  It takes him a 
                        long time to warm up.

           Ozinski parks his bike.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Oliver keys in.  Ozinski right on his tail.  Something’s 
           not right, the house, the energy.

                                 FELIX THE CAT
                        Meow.  Meow.

           Felix rushes up to Oliver, hides behind his legs.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s going on, Felix?

           Oliver walks into the room...and then he sees...Vin.  
           Sprawled out on the floor, face first.  Still.

           INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - LATER

           CAT Scan lab.  Maggie and ANOTHER NURSE are strapping 
           in...Vin.  His eyes are open, but no one’s home.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi, Vincent.  It’s me Maggie. 
                        Oliver’s mom.

           He looks blankly at her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to put you in this 
                        machine here and run some tests, 
                        okay?  It won’t hurt a bit.

                                 ANOTHER NURSE
                        He can’t understand you, Maggie.
           Maggie nods.  Upset.  Vincent grabs her hand.  Holds it.  
           He understands.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.  There you are.  This takes 
                        about thirty minutes, okay?

           Vin says, “I understand” with his eyes.

           CAT SCAN TECH ROOM - LATER

           Maggie and Another Nurse monitor Vin’s CAT Scan.  A map 
           of his brain stares at them from an LCD Monitor.

           INSERT - VIN’S BRAIN MAP

           There’s a very clear obstruction in Vin’s brain.  It 
           looks like a mini-explosion.

           Maggie knows what this is.  She leaves the room.

           THE WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Oliver’s sitting in the waiting area.  Amongst STRANGERS.  
           Maggie walks in, worried, looking for her son.  Finally 
           she sees him...

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        He okay, ma?

           She puts her arms around him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re such a brave little man.

                                 OLIVER
                        We thought he was dead?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who’s we?

                                 OLIVER
                        Robert Ozinski and I.

                                 MAGGIE
                        The bully kid?

                                 OLIVER
                        He has a deep sense of respect for 
                        me since I broke his nose.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t even know what you’re doing 
                        anymore.
           Maggie starts to get teary.

                                 OLIVER
                        Ma.  Stop feeling sorry for me.  
                        And yourself.  We’re doing good.  
                        You’re working hard, every day and 
                        we need the money.  It’s okay.

           Holy shit.  Maggie is speechless.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You seeing a shrink on the side?

           Maggie rubs Oliver’s head.

                                 OLIVER
                        I know you know what’s going on.

           She can’t avoid it, he’s a grown-up all of a sudden.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I think he’s had a stroke.  You 
                        know what that is?

                                 OLIVER
                        I’ve seen some billboards.  “Know 
                        the signs of a stroke and call 911 
                        immediately.”  But they never say 
                        what the signs are so...not really 
                        good advertising.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s a blockage in a brain artery.

           Oliver knows this is serious.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s not good.

           Maggie puts her arm around him.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - DAY

           Crespi’s class.  Oliver’s standing in front of the 
           darkened classroom, presenting, using the Smart Board.

                                 OLIVER
                        I chose Saint William of Rochester, 
                        the patron saint of adopted 
                        children.

           Oliver clicks the Smart Board and a picture of Saint 
           William pops up on the screen.
                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        As a young man, William led a “wild 
                        and misspent youth.”  Which 
                        included gambling, womanizing, 
                        drinking and other things 
                        considered inappropriate...back 
                        then.

           Mr. Crespi interrupts (from the back of the room.)

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Why did you chose Saint William of 
                        Rochester?

           Throughout, Oliver clicks through slides on the Smart 
           Board.

                                 OLIVER
                        I admire how he changed his whole 
                        life when he found a baby on the 
                        church steps and took it in and 
                        raised it as his own.  He named the 
                        baby David.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Very touching, Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        And then years later, he went on a 
                        pilgrimage to the Holy Land with 
                        his son.  And David went, I 
                        guess...crazy, and clubbed Saint 
                        William and cut his throat and then 
                        robbed the body.

           The slides are stock footage pictures of a crime scene.  
           Blood.  Mayhem.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Ouch.  Okay.  Didn’t see that 
                        coming.

                                 OLIVER
                        So he’s a martyr actually.  A saint 
                        martyr.  But the beginning of the 
                        story is the part I’m most affected 
                        by.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        I would hope so.

           The CLASS laughs.

                                 MR. CRESPI (CONT’D)
                        Very interesting stuff, Oliver.  
                        And your modern day saint?

                                 OLIVER
                        I haven’t picked one yet, sir.
                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Our assembly’s coming up.  You 
                        might want to dig in there.

                                 OLIVER
                        The thing is...I don’t really know 
                        anyone that’s...that...saintly.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Many men and women have lived less 
                        than angelic lives, before they 
                        turned a corner and 
                        became...whatever they became.  
                        Like Saint William of Rochester, 
                        right?

                                 OLIVER
                        I guess so, sir.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Don’t look for what you think is a 
                        perfect person.  You won’t find 
                        one.  Just chose someone who means 
                        something for you.  That’s affected 
                        your life in a positive way.

           HALLWAY OUTSIDE CRESPI’S CLASS - LATER

           We pull back from Oliver’s picture to reveal the entire 
           wall plastered with pictures.  Under each student’s name 
           we see a picture of their patron saint next to a picture 
           of their real-life saint. 

           Above the collage, stenciled letters: “SAINTS AMONG US.”  

           Oliver stands in front of the wall.  Lost.  Under his 
           name...only one picture: Saint William of Rochester.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Oliver’s walking home from school.  He sees SOMEONE 
           sitting on Vin’s steps.  It’s Charisse.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Where’s he at?  His car’s here.

                                 OLIVER
                        He’s in the hospital.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Doin’ what?

           Oliver just stares at her.
           INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - LATER

           Oliver and Charisse are walking down a hallway of PATIENT 
           rooms. 

                                 CHARISSE
                        I don’t like the smell of 
                        hospitals, man.  Gives me the 
                        willys.

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s disinfectant.  You get used to 
                        it after a while.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Why you act like you’re forty and 
                        shit?

                                 OLIVER
                        Don’t know.  I’m only ten and shit.

           Oliver turns a corner.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        He’s down here.

           INT. VIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Vin’s lying in bed, wide-eyed.  He looks pissed.  Maggie 
           and a SPEECH THERAPIST are trying to “therapize” Vin.

           The stroke has caused Aphasia and language apraxia.  It’s 
           a struggle for Vin to talk, and hard to understand.

           The Speech Therapist holds up a flash card with the word 
           “Dog” printed on it.

                                 SPEECH THERAPIST
                        Try to sound it out.

           Vin pretends to think, then holds up his middle finger.

                                 SPEECH THERAPIST (CONT’D)
                        Not quite.

                                 MAGGIE
                                 (loudly, like he’s deaf)
                        Still have your sense of humor, 
                        Vin.  That’s something, ha?

           Vin holds up the other middle finger.  Double bird.  
           Oliver and Charisse walk in.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hi, ma.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi, love.
           Maggie looks over Charisse, introduces herself.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Hello.  I’m Maggie.  Oliver’s mom.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Charisse.

           Maggie waits for more.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Just Charisse.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.  Nice to meet you.

           Oliver walks to Vin’s bedside.

                                 OLIVER
                        Hey, Vin.  You look a lot better.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (slurred)
                        Getttt these dippppshitts outta 
                        here.

           Oliver’s confused with Vin’s slurred speech.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s wrong with your mouth?  You 
                        sound like you’re drunk or 
                        something.

           Maggie interrupts.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay, Oli.  Let’s let Vin work with 
                        his therapist.

                                 SPEECH THERAPIST
                        Thank you.  We’ll be about an hour.

                                 VINCENT
                        Fuccckkk you, annnnn hour.

                                 SPEECH THERAPIST
                        Maybe less.

           Maggie covers Oliver’s ears.  Guides him towards the 
           door.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Let’s go get a snack.

           INT. HOSPITAL BREAK / SNACK ROOM - LATER

           Maggie, Oliver and Charisse are sitting in the visitor’s 
           lounge drinking coffee.  Charisse is eating a candy bar.
                                 MAGGIE
                        He may talk like that for a while.  
                        That’s what happens sometimes when 
                        a person has a stroke.

                                 OLIVER
                        He sounds...

                                 CHARISSE
                        Retarded.

           Out of anyone else’s mouth that would be offensive.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Well, he ain’t smart anyways.  So 
                        retarded ain’t that far owf.

           Charisse finishes her candy bar.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Anybody gotta dollar?  I’m 
                        starvin’.  I didn’t eat nothing 
                        today.

           Maggie digs in her purse.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I do.

           She opens her wallet.  Pulls out a dollar.

                                 CHARISSE
                        I think it takes a dollar fifty.

           Maggie...gives her two bucks.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Cool.

           She’s off to the vending machines.

                                 MAGGIE
                                 (re: her belly)
                        Is that Vincent’s...?

                                 OLIVER
                        Baby?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yea.

                                 OLIVER
                        Don’t know.  It’s not polite to ask 
                        a woman if she’s pregnant.  So, I 
                        avoid the whole situation.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well.  She’s obviously 
                        pregnant...so...
                                 OLIVER
                        Vin’s like 90 something.  That 
                        would be inappropriate.

           Charisse returns with two chocolate bars.  She offers one 
           to Oliver.

                                 CHARISSE
                        If you hit it just as it’s dropping 
                        the first one, you can get two to 
                        come out.

           Oliver takes it.  Unwraps.  The three of them sit 
           awkwardly comfortable together.

           EXT. VAN NUYS - DAY

           Time passes.  Spring is in the air.

           -- Our Homeless Legless Guy is now wearing shorts.

           -- The Buck.  An ARTIST is painting the front window for 
           St. Patty’s Day.

           -- Doctor’s Office.  Ozinski gets his nose bandage 
           removed.  His nose is completely crooked.

           -- Vin’s House.  The lawn is out of control.  A foot 
           high.  A MAILMAN bends down and puts mail in the toppled 
           mailbox.

           INT. VIN’S KITCHEN - ANOTHER DAY

           Charisse is feeding Felix the Cat a can of Spam.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Here you go, pussy.

           Felix scarfs.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t eat too fast.  I ain’t comin’ 
                        back till tomorrow.

           Charisse looks at the stacks of dishes, mold, dirt, 
           grime, shit everywhere.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        You’re paying me, asshole.

           Charisse rolls up her sleeves, turns the sink on.  Starts 
           to clean.
           INT. VIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           Vin’s perched in a recliner.  Oliver is sitting on his 
           bed shuffling a stack of flash cards.

                                 OLIVER
                        Try this one.

           Oliver holds up a card.  It reads: “I want fresh crab.”  
           Vin studies the card.  Then:

                                 VINCENT
                        I waannnnnt fresssshh crap.

           Oliver looks at the card.  Damn Vin.  They laugh.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - ANOTHER DAY

           Crespi’s class.  Ozinski is presenting in front of the 
           class.  His voice is nasally, due to the “new” nose 
           alignment.

                                 OZINSKI
                        And for my real-life saint, I 
                        picked...

           He clicks the Smart Board.  A picture of Oliver pops up.

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Oliver Bronstein.  He’s like one a 
                        them martyrs.  Cause he was 
                        persecuted too, when he first got 
                        here.  By me.  Mostly, you know.  
                        And a few others, who I’m not gonna 
                        rat out.  You know who you are. 

           Ozinski stares directly at a few FELLAS in class.  
           Brooklyn sinks in his chair.

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Anyways.  He’s my saint.  Cause he 
                        forgave me for being such a 
                        dingleberry, when I was acting like 
                        an a-hole.

           The CLASS laughs.  Oliver is all smiles.  He’s a hundred 
           feet tall.  Crespi applauds the effort.

           INT. VIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           Oliver and Vin are working the flash cards when Maggie 
           walks in carrying take-out.  Vin and Oliver light up like 
           Christmas trees.

           Vin tosses his tray of hospital food in the trash.
           IMAGES OVER MUSIC:

           -- Charisse is vacuuming Vin’s living room.  It sounds 
           like she’s sucking up marbles.  It’s so damn dirty.

           -- Vin is walking outside the hospital in his gown.  He 
           ducks into a nook and lights a cigarette.

           -- At a grocery store, Maggie and Oliver are buying cat 
           food.  Lots.

           -- Oliver wheels a piece of carryon luggage into Vin’s 
           room.  He lays the luggage carefully on the bed and 
           unzips.  Felix the Cat pops out...runs right over to Vin 
           on the recliner and jumps in his lap.

           -- Vin’s sitting in a wheelchair outside the hospital (in 
           street clothes.)  A NURSE stands behind him.  Charisse 
           pulls up in Vin’s car.  Honks.  Vin stands up, walks to 
           the car.

           -- Driving.  Charisse can barely steer the car over her 
           about-to-pop belly.  Vin lights a cigarette.  Charisse 
           snatches it out of his hand.

                                 CHARISSE
                        What’s wrong wit you?

           She tosses it out the window.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Living room.  The place is spotless.  Vin’s sitting on 
           his couch, looking around.  The place is foreign to him.

           Charisse waddles in with a plate of food.  A turkey 
           sandwich with a side of carrots.  Healthy.  Vin inspects.

                                 VINCENT
                        Weeeeee outta Spppam?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Yeah.

                                 VINCENT
                        We gonnnnnnna get some?

                                 CHARISSE
                        When I get to the store, bitch.

           Vin picks up the sandwich.  Takes a damn bite.  What 
           choice does he have?

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        You paying me hourly now, pappi.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Whaaaattt for?
                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Whatcha mean, what for?  I’m taking 
                        care of your ass.  Cleaned this 
                        shithole top to bottom.  And we 
                        obviously ain’t bumping uglies no 
                        more.  So don’t be askin’.  I’m too 
                        fat and you’re too old.

           Vin thinks.  Shakes his head in agreement.  The sandwich 
           is pretty good.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Fifteen an hour, plus room and 
                        board.

           Charisse walks out.  Vin damn near chokes.

           EXT. LA COUNTY FAMILY COURT - ANOTHER DAY

           A gray stone court house.  A gray day.

           INT. COURT LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie and Oliver are dressed in their Sunday best.  
           Their attorney, RICHARD WALTERS, is briefing them.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                        These proceedings are pretty 
                        straight forward.  Just answer the 
                        Judge’s questions, through me of 
                        course.  I’ll do all the talking.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Good.  I’m a wreck.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                        Just be honest.  Nine times out of 
                        ten the judge rules in favor of the 
                        mother.  It’s just how the system 
                        works.

           Maggie puts her arm around Oliver.

           INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Family court in session.  Maggie, Oliver and Richard 
           Walters are on one side.  On the other side: Oliver’s 
           father, DAVID BRONSTEIN, tall, dark and disconnected, 
           sits next to his attorney BARRY BRILLSTERN.

           JUDGE REYNOLDS presides, he’s examining a file full of 
           photos.

                                 JUDGE REYNOLDS
                                 (directed to Richard)
                        Who is Vincent Canatella?
           Richard is stumped.  He turns to Maggie.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                        You know him?

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s our next door neighbor.  He 
                        watches Oliver some times.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                        Your honor, he’s my client’s 
                        neighbor.  He occasionally watches 
                        Oliver.  Some times.

                                 JUDGE REYNOLDS
                        He’s a baby sitter?

           Again, Richard turns to Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.  Of sorts.  I pay him.  And 
                        Oliver goes there after school for 
                        a few hours while I’m at work.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                                 (to Judge)
                        He’s a baby sitter, your honor.  Of 
                        sorts.  A paid position.  May I ask 
                        why this is relevant?

           Judge Reynolds flips through more pictures.

                                 JUDGE REYNOLDS
                        Is your client aware that Mr. 
                        Canatella takes her son to a race 
                        track and they gamble?  He also 
                        takes him to a local bar, The Buck?  
                        And a strip club, The Pink 
                        Cadillac?

           Maggie is lost.  She looks to Oliver.

                                 OLIVER
                        We went to see the horses a few 
                        times.

           Maggie could die.  She turns back to Richard.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I...this...is news to me.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                        My client is unaware of these 
                        events...as am I.  Which is a big 
                        surprise, I must say, right now.

                                 JUDGE REYNOLDS
                        I’ll bet there are quite a few 
                        surprises in this folder then.
           Judge Reynolds holds up a pound of pictures.  Maggie 
           gasps.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, God.

                                 JUDGE REYNOLDS
                        I’d say.  Charisse Langers?  Are 
                        you aware of her...occupation?

           Richard turns to Maggie.  Maggie turns to Oliver.  Oliver 
           whispers in Maggie’s ear.  She turns pale white.  Maggie 
           whispers in Richard’s ear.  He goes blank.

                                 RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.
                        Your honor, I need a few minutes to 
                        confer with my client.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Maggie bangs on Vin’s door.  No answer.  Vin’s car is in 
           the driveway.  She walks around to the side of the house, 
           let’s herself in through the gate.

           VIN’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s wearing only underwear, watering the dirt pit that 
           he calls a lawn.  It hasn’t seen water in a month.  
           Maggie yells out to him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Vin!

           She yells louder.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Vin!

           He turns.  Squirts her with the hose.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Ah.  What the...!

           Vin releases the handle.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m a littttle slower with the 
                        reaction time these days.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You were never fast.  Just stupid.

                                 VINCENT
                        Oh.  Gooodie.
                                 MAGGIE
                        What kind of man takes a child 
                        gambling, drinking, smoking?  
                        Hanging out with prostitutes.

                                 VINCENT
                        What kind of mother leaves her son 
                        with a mannnnn like that?

           Ouch.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Fuck you, Vin.

                                 VINCENT
                        Now we’re talkinnnng.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Fifty-fifty custody with his 
                        asshole father now.  I have you to 
                        thank for that.

                                 VINCENT
                        You have yourrrrrrself to thank for 
                        that.   He needs someone besides 
                        his deadbeat mother.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know just what to say to hurt 
                        people.  I hope that’s been good 
                        for you over the years.

                                 VINCENT
                        Been finnnne.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t talk to him again.  Stay away 
                        from him.  Leave us alone.  I’ll 
                        start looking for a new place to 
                        live.

           Maggie walks off.  Vin squirts the hose, it hits Maggie’s 
           back.

                                 VINCENT
                        Sorrrryy.

           She storms off.

           INT. VIN’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Vin sits at his counter.  Looking at the biggest pile of 
           bills and mail.  He fishes through, tossing most aside.  
           Eventually...the answering machine comes into view.  The 
           red light is blinking.

           Vin hits play.
                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Hello, Mr. Vincent.  This is Ana 
                        from Sunnyside.  I have some news 
                        about your wife, Sandy, sir.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - THE NEXT DAY

           Charisse is driving.  Vin riding.  The answering machine 
           plays under.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                                 (another message)
                        Mr. Vincent, this is Ana again at 
                        Sunnyside, sir.  I’ve left you a 
                        few messages now.  I hope that you 
                        are okay...

           INT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s walking down the hallway.  The answering machine 
           continues.

                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        Mr. Canatella, this is Shirley 
                        Stafford over here at Sunnyside.  
                        Sir, I hate to be the bearer of bad 
                        news, but your wife is dead.  And 
                        she’s been dead for a few weeks 
                        now.  And we haven’t heard from 
                        you.

           SHIRLEY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vin’s sitting at Shirley’s desk.  Shirley enters with a 
           box of personal items.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Okay, Mr. Canatella.  Here we go.

           Shirley sits.  Puts the box on her desk.

                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                        All her personal items are in 
                        there, sir.

           Vin looks at the box.

                                 VINCENT
                        Where is shhhee?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Who?

                                 VINCENT
                        My wwwife.
                                 SHIRLEY
                        She died, Mr. Canatella.

                                 VINCENT
                        I know that.  Where isss she?

                                 SHIRLEY
                                 (indicates the box)
                        She’s in there, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        Where?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        In the box.  Her remains.

           Vin is speechless.  For once.

                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                        She died a few weeks ago, Mr. 
                        Canatella.  We tried to contact you 
                        several times.  So there’s that.  
                        And when we didn’t hear back from 
                        you.  Well.  We just went ahead and 
                        followed your death directives, 
                        sir.

           She pushes a signed paper towards, Vin.

                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                        You did want her cremated.  That’s 
                        what’s on the signed directives 
                        here.

           Vin looks at the paper, then back at the box.

                                 VINCENT
                        She’s in that bbbox?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Her remains are, sir.  Yes.  In a 
                        box inside that box.   We can’t 
                        just keep a body lying around.  I’m 
                        sure you understand.  That would be 
                        inappropriate.  And legally we just 
                        can’t do that, of course.  You 
                        could imagine the litigation 
                        potential.

           Vin stands.  Takes the box.

                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. 
                        Canatella.

           Vin stares at here, then walks away.
                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                        There is the other matter of your 
                        outstanding balance we should 
                        discuss.

           Vin keeps walking.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (over his back)
                        I’ll maiilll it to you.

           He’s gone.

           EXT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - LATER

           Vin’s sitting on a bench with Ana the Nurse.  The box 
           sits between them.

                                 VINCENT
                        Did she sssay anything?

                                 ANA
                        No, Mr. Vincent.  Just sleeping.  
                        Fell asleep.  Went away.

                                 VINCENT
                        You still freezinnng her pillow.

                                 ANA
                        Oh.  No, sir.  You are too much.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m tooooo little, that’s the 
                        problem.

           She puts her hand on Vin’s shoulder.

                                 ANA
                        It was nice to work with your wife, 
                        Mr. Vincent.  She was good.

           Vin nods.  No tears.  Repressed.  Ana stands.

                                 ANA (CONT’D)
                        You took good care of her.  Now 
                        take care of yourself.

           She walks off.  Vin sits, staring off at nothing.  Lights 
           a cigarette.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - ANOTHER DAY

           Oliver and Ozinski are sitting against a wall.  A dodge 
           ball game in progress in front of them.
                                 OZINSKI
                        Being with your dad ain’t so bad.  
                        Least he’s around.  And wants to 
                        see ya and stuff.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah.  My mom’s the one who hates 
                        it.

                                 OZINSKI
                        That’s her problem.  These woman 
                        gotta learn to let go.

           Oliver is impressed with the rare deep thought.

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        I’m seeing a shrink.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s cool.

                                 OZINSKI
                        My Ma’s makin’ me.  Thinks me 
                        acting out all the time is due to 
                        the fact that my father left us and 
                        I got no positive male role model 
                        in my life.  So I do bad shit to 
                        get attention.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s the shrink say?

                                 OZINSKI
                        He thinks my Ma is overbearing and 
                        controlling and actually I’m acting 
                        out to rebel against her.

                                 OLIVER
                        That makes more sense.

                                 OZINSKI
                        That’s what I’m fucking thinkin’.

                                 OLIVER
                        You talk to her about it.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Hell no.  She’d whop my ass.  I 
                        gotta hide behind that patient 
                        privacy stuff.

           A whistle blows.  The dodge ball game is over.  Next up.

                                 OZINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Let’s tag team these ass fags.  You 
                        go high, I’ll shoot for the nuts.

           Oliver and Ozinski run onto the court.
           EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - SIDEWALKS

           After school.  KIDS everywhere.  Oliver’s walking out 
           with Ozinski.  A HORN honks.  Maggie is sitting in her 
           Volvo in parent pickup.

           INT. MAGGIE’S VOLVO - LATER

           Maggie’s driving.  Oliver’s riding.  And a strange Latin 
           lady is sitting quietly in the backseat.  This is AMELDA.  
           Oliver’s new nanny.  Short, stout, useless.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s your father’s idea of safer 
                        child care.

                                 OLIVER
                        Does she speak English?

                                 MAGGIE
                                 (to Amelda)
                        Poquito?

                                 AMELDA
                        Si.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Guess that’s good enough.

                                 AMELDA
                        Si.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.  Si.

                                 OLIVER
                        Everyday?

                                 MAGGIE
                        And every other weekend when you go 
                        to your dad’s.

           Oliver’s not thrilled.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s the deal now.  You get 
                        shuffled back and forth between 
                        your father and I.

                                 OLIVER
                        He is my dad.

           Maggie takes this in.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        I know he cheated on you...a bunch 
                        of times.  And that why we left.
                                 MAGGIE
                        You know that?

                                 OLIVER
                        It’s a secret?  You tell anybody 
                        who’ll listen.  Grandma, Aunt Judy, 
                        all the cousins...it’s your 
                        Facebook status.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I been meaning to change that

                                 OLIVER
                        I think it’s time. 

           Maggie considers this.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll just say that I’m single.

                                 OLIVER
                        Thank you.  I guess.

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - DAY

           Backyard.  Vin’s sitting on a beach chair, staring at the 
           box with Sandy in it, perched on the lawn table in front 
           of him.

           Oliver calls out.

                                 OLIVER
                        Vin?

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m nnnot here.

           Oliver walks around the side of the house.  Amelda’s 
           right behind him.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You cannnn’t be here.

                                 OLIVER
                        Mom said I could say...goodbye.

           Oliver just stands there.  Not knowing what to say.

                                 VINCENT
                        That mmmy replacement?

           Amelda chimes in.

                        Si.

                        Mr. Oliver, vamanos.

           She makes her way back from where she came.

                                 OLIVER
                        What’s in the box?

                                 VINCENT
                        Mmmmmy wife.

                                 VINCENT
                        No.  Sssshe shrunk herself and now 
                        she’s living in there rent free.

                                 OLIVER
                        Oh.  I’m really sorry, Vin.

                                 VINCENT
                        Never understood wwwwhy people 
                        sssssay that.

                                 OLIVER
                        They don’t know what else to say.

                                 VINCENT
                        Welllll, it’s a shit saying.  How 
                        ‘bout, “What was she like?”  “Do 
                        you miss her?”  “What’re ya gonna 
                        do now?”

                                 OLIVER
                        You want me to ask your those 
                        things?

                                 VINCENT
                        Listennnn.  Do yourself a favor, 
                        kid, and get a life.  Oookay.  Stop 
                        living mine.  It hasn’t been for 
                        shit.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s not true.

           Vin lashes out.
                                 VINCENT
                        The hell do you know about me?  The 
                        hell does anyone know about anyone 
                        really?  You act like I’m some 
                        kinda role model.  Are you stupid?  
                        Look at me.

                                 OLIVER
                        Why are you being so mean?

           Oliver starts to tear.

                                 VINCENT
                        Tttrue colors, kid.  Go on.  Get 
                        lost.  I’m not your father.  Go 
                        shadow him.  And take the tears 
                        with ya.

           Oliver runs off.  Vin stares at the box.

           VIN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Vin sitting on the bed.  The box is next to him.  He 
           talks to it.

                                 VINCENT
                        I loved you to the moon there, 
                        Sandy.

           He waits for a response.  Then...

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You coulda waited ya know.  I was 
                        tied up for a wwwwhile.  Woulda 
                        been nice to say goodbye.

           Listens.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        So...what nnnnnow?

           As if he hears from her...

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?  You sure?

           Vin inspects the room: packed full of shit, memories, 
           pictures.  It hasn’t been touched since she left.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Aaaalright.  You’re the boss.

           Vin grabs a picture of himself and a FEW MARINES posing 
           in Ho Chi Minh, while on tour in Vietnam.  He studies it.  
           Then throws it in a bag.  He grabs another picture...then 
           another.  Throwing everything in site, all the memories, 
           pictures, knickknacks into the bag.  Purging.
           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Vin drags two full trash bag loads of junk across the 
           lawn.  He dumps them into trash barrels.

           INT. OLIVER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Oliver watches Vin from his bedroom window.  He shuts the 
           blinds and sits on his bed.  Thinking.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - LIBRARY - DAY

           Computer lab.  Oliver, Ozinski and OTHER STUDENTS are 
           working on computers, wearing headsets.  Oliver digs in 
           his backpack and pulls out Vin’s Vietnam picture.  The 
           one Vin tossed in the trash.

           He flips the picture over, reads the handwritten 
           inscription: “la Drang, Vietnam, 1965.  Sgt. Vincent 
           Canatella.”

           Oliver pecks on his keyboard:

           Insert - Google search bar typing: “Sgt. Vincent 
           Canatella.”

           The search reveals several pages with headings: “War 
           Hero,”  “Bronze Star,” “Sgt. Canatella Rescues Two 
           Officers,” “The Battle of la Drang.”  Etc.

           Oliver is beyond curious.  He clicks on the first link 
           and starts reading.  A picture of a younger Vin pops up.  
           He’s a proud looking soldier.

           Oliver hits Ozinski.  He leans over and looks over his 
           shoulder.

                                 OZINSKI
                                 (too loud)
                        That’s the old fucker.

           Oliver nods.  Everyone and their mother heard that.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CRESPI’S CLASS - LATER

           The Saint Wall.  Oliver’s on Ozinski’s shoulders stapling 
           a picture to the wall.

           He’s picked a Real-Life Saint.  It’s Vin.  And he’s one 
           fucked-up looking “saint.”  Eyes black, face distorted, 
           clearly on drugs, lying in his hospital bed.

           Ozinski lowers Oliver down.  Oliver inspects Vin’s 
           picture perched next to Saint William of Rochester.  Mr. 
           Crespi walks up behind them.
                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Good deal.  You picked someone.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yes, sir.  He’s my baby sitter.  
                        Well, ex-baby sitter.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Looks like saint material.

                                 OLIVER
                        He’s not.  But he could be.

                                 OZINSKI
                        He’s a real shit neck, sir.  Sorry, 
                        sir.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        I’m actually becoming used to your 
                        expletives, Ozinski.

                                 OZINSKI
                        Mr. Crespi...my name’s Robert.

                                 OLIVER
                        He doesn’t like Ozinski, sir.  
                        Never has.

           And with that the two boys walk off.

           MONTAGE OF OLIVER RESEARCHING, VIN MOVING ON...

           EXT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ozinski waits on his bike outside Oliver’s house.  Oliver 
           comes running out, jumps on the back of the bike.  Amelda 
           waddles out after him, holding a jacket.  She puts the 
           jacket on Oliver.

           And they take off.

           STREETS - LATER

           Oliver and Ozinski ride through traffic.  Hauling ass.

           EXT. THE BUCK - NIGHT

           Ozinski’s bike is parked in front of the bar.

           INT. THE BUCK - NIGHT

           Oliver and Ozinski are sitting at the bar drinking 
           Shirley Temples.  Oliver is interviewing Gus and Linda.
                                 GUS
                        Oh heck, he won the Bronze Star in 
                        in Vietnam.  Pulled two officers 
                        out of an ambush in la Drang.  Only 
                        a few got outta there.

                                 LINDA
                        It’s famous.  He never told ya 
                        about it?

                                 OLIVER
                        No, ma'am.

           Oliver takes notes.

                                 LINDA
                        Such a stubborn ass, that Vin.

                                 GUS
                        Hey now, Linda.

                                 LINDA
                        I’m sorry, Gussy.  He has his 
                        moments.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

           Kitchen counter.  Charisse serves Vin and herself a Spam 
           sandwich.  She feels the baby kicking in her belly.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Ah.  Chill out, chicca.

           She holds her stomach.  Looks at Vin...

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        You wanna...?

           Vin nods.  Sure.  Puts his hand on her belly.  Feels a 
           kick.

                                 VINCENT
                        Damn ninja iiin there.

           INT. BABIES-R-US - LATER

           The crib section.  Vin and Charisse are looking at cribs.  
           Charisse checks prices.  Expensive.  Vin pulls out his 
           wallet.  Checks how much he’s got.
           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

           Spare bedroom.  Vin is lying on the floor, assembling the 
           crib in what’s been converted into a baby room.  Felix 
           the Cat is lying on the installation instructions.  Vin 
           slides him aside.  Puts on his glasses, reads the 
           instructions.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - ANOTHER DAY

           The ropes.  Oliver is in mid-climb.  He’s damn near the 
           top.  A CROWD OF CLASSMATES, lead by Ozinski, scream him 
           on from the ground.

                                 OZINSKI & CLASSMATES
                        Oliver!  Oliver!  Oliver!  Oliver!

           Coach Mitchell smiles, watching in anticipation.

           Oliver strains, pulls, twists.  And finally, he grabs the 
           flag.  The kids erupt in cheers.  Then...

                                 OLIVER
                        How do I get down?

           EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - SIDEWALKS - DAY

           Oliver is walking towards a new Jaguar parked in parent 
           pickup.  It’s his dad, David.

           Oliver hops into the car.

           INT. FROZEN YOGURT SHOP - LATER

           Oliver and David are sitting in the window eating frozen 
           yogurt.  David’s trying to connect.

                                 DAVID
                        So.  How’s things?

                                 OLIVER
                        Good.  Can’t complain.

                                 DAVID
                        School.  Good?

                                 OLIVER
                        Yep.

                                 DAVID
                        Friends?

                                 OLIVER
                        Dad.  We don’t have to small talk.  
                        I’m not mad at you.  Whatever 
                        happened between you and ma, that’s 
                        grown-up business.

                                 OLIVER (CONT'D)
                        I don’t want to be in the middle.  
                        We can just be us.  Okay?

                                 DAVID
                        You are...an alien.

           David rubs his son’s head.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        So...where did you want to go?

           EXT. SUNNYSIDE RESIDENCE FOR THE ELDERLY - ANOTHER DAY

           Oliver is interviewing Nurse Ana.  David’s sitting on the 
           lawn a few feet away.

                                 ANA
                        Everyday he came to see her.  Never 
                        missed one time.  Most people just 
                        get forgotten here.  Not Sandy.

                                 OLIVER
                        How long was she here?

                                 ANA
                        Oh.  Close to eight years.

           Oliver scribbles in his notebook.

           EXT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           David carries a sleeping Oliver into the house.  Maggie

           EXT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATER

           Maggie and David stand by David’s car.  Awkwardness is 
           all they know.

                                 DAVID
                        I can pick him up after school on 
                        Friday.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sure.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay, then.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yep.
           David gets into the car.  Maggie knocks on the passenger 
           window.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You know, this is okay.  I’m okay 
                        with it.  You’re his father.  An 
                        asshole.  But still his father.  
                        So.  I’ll get over it.  Just going 
                        to take some time.

                                 DAVID
                        Good night.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s all you’re going to say?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t disagree with anything you 
                        said.  So.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Even the asshole part.

                                 DAVID
                        Especially that part.

           Maggie thinks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Alright.  Good night.

                                 DAVID
                        See ya.

           David drives off.

           INT. HOME DEPOT - ANOTHER DAY

           Oliver and Ozinski are loading a cart full of fence 
           building materials.  Pickets, posts, nails, etc.

           CHECK OUT COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie pays for the supplies.

           EXT. STREETS - LATER

           Maggie’s Volvo cruises down the road.  Fencing supplies 
           tied haphazardly to the roof.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Vin is peeking out the living room blinds...watching 
           Oliver, Ozinski and Amelda fixing his fence.
                                 VINCENT
                        Ttthat’ll be straight.

           He shuts the blinds. 

           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver, Ozinski and Amelda are working on the fence.  
           Amelda’s the “foreman,” as she’s the only one who knows 
           what she’s doing.

           Charisse pulls up in Vin’s car.  Lumbers down the 
           driveway with a bag of groceries.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Vin know you’re doing that?

                                 OLIVER
                        He peeks through the blinds every 
                        few minutes.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Ain’t come out?

                                 OLIVER
                        Nope.

                                 CHARISSE
                                 (disgusted)
                        Still playing the stroke card.

           INT. NAT’S DINER - ANOTHER DAY

           Oliver is interviewing Charisse.  Amelda is eating, along 
           for the ride.  Charisse is holding a flier for Oliver’s 
           school assembly: “Saints Among Us.”

                                 CHARISSE
                        Man, why you want him to come to 
                        shit?  He ain’t been nothing but an 
                        asshole.

                                 OLIVER
                        I think he’s just misunderstood.  
                        By himself mostly.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Cause he’s an asshole.

                                 OLIVER
                        That’s a possibility.

           Charisse stares at Amelda.

                                 CHARISSE
                        She better than having Vin watch 
                        you?
           Oliver shrugs.  Amelda keeps eating.

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Oliver’s room is full of Vin’s pictures.  The memories 
           rescued from the trash.  Oliver’s getting ready for 
           school.  Standing in front of a mirror, tying a Windsor 
           Knot on his tie.  Maggie calls from the kitchen.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Oliver.  Breakfast is ready.

           Oliver furrows with confusion.

           THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver walks in to find a full pancake breakfast.  Bacon.  
           Toast.  The works.  A big surprise in this household.  
           Maggie’s pouring OJ.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Gotta have fuel for your big day.

           Oliver is touched.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I took the day off.

           He hugs his mom.  

                                 OLIVER
                        Thanks, mom.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love you, Oli.

           Somehow Maggie’s become a mother.

                                 OLIVER
                        Me too.  You, that is.

           INT. VIN’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Vin’s sitting is his Lazy Boy, zoned out on Abbott & 
           Costello.  Charisse rushes into the room.

                                 CHARISSE
                        I think my water busted.

                                 VINCENT
                        The hhhhell does that mean?

                                 CHARISSE
                        This thing’s coming out.
                                 VINCENT
                        Ssshit. 

           Vin climbs out of his chair.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           The auditorium is packed to the gills with STUDENTS, 
           TEACHERS, PARENTS and GUESTS.  The curtain opens and Mr. 
           Crespi’s entire class walks out and takes seats behind 
           the on-stage podium.  Oliver and Ozinski sit next to each 
           other.  Friends for life.

           A projection screen displays the banner, “Saints Among 
           Us.”  The CROWD applauds.

           INT. VIN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Charisse is driving like a nut.  Vin’s white knuckled.  
           He tries to light a cigarette.  Charisse swipes it from 
           his mouth, tosses it out the window.

                                 CHARISSE
                        When you gonna grow up, man?

           She shakes her head in disgust, then goes back to fake 
           deep breathing.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Crespi steps up to the podium and announces the next 
           speaker.

                                 MR. CRESPI
                        Our next speaker is Mr. Oliver 
                        Bronstein.  He’ll be presenting 
                        Saint William of Rochester and Mr. 
                        Vincent Canatella of Van Nuys.

           The CROWD claps.  Maggie hoots from her seat.  She’s 
           sitting next to ex-husband David.  They may end up civil.

           Oliver walks up to the podium.  Strong.  Courageous.  A 
           different kid than the one who couldn’t utter a word in 
           front of his class.  He clears his throat.

                                 OLIVER
                        Saints are human beings we 
                        celebrate for their dedication and 
                        commitment to other human beings.  
                        Mr. Cary Crespi, circa 2011...

           Laughs.
           EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - CONTINUOUS

           Charisse whips the car into the school's lot.  Pulls into 
           a handicapped spot.  Vin is suspect.

                                 VINCENT
                        This isn’t the hospital.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Can’t fool a genius.

           Charisse tosses the flier in his lap.

                                 CHARISSE (CONT’D)
                        Get your ass inside.

           Charisse steps out of the car, moves on.  Vin looks at 
           the flier.

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Oliver’s in mid-presentation.  On the massive projection 
           screen behind him, we see Vin’s “Saint” portrait next to 
           St. William of Rochester’s.

                                 OLIVER
                        For my modern day saint, I chose a 
                        man who shares many of the same 
                        qualities as St. William of 
                        Rochester:  Mr. Vincent Canatella.

           He continues...

           INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the auditorium.  Vincent stands in front of the 
           marquee board, staring at the picture of himself next to 
           St. William of Rochester.

           He hears Oliver’s voice within.  Walks to the auditorium 
           doors.

                                 OLIVER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Canatella was born in Brooklyn, 
                        NY, in 1945, the son of first 
                        generation Italian immigrants.

           Vin cracks the door open.  Just as he’s doing this a 
           PRIEST comes up behind him and opens it the rest of the 
           way.

                                 FATHER
                                 (whispers)
                        After you...

           Vin defaults.  Walks in first.  He stands at the back of 
           the auditorium.  Oliver continues:
                                 OLIVER
                        Growing up poor on the streets of 
                        Brooklyn, Vincent learned all the 
                        things a kid shouldn’t need to 
                        know.  Fighting, cursing and 
                        gambling.

           The slide show shuffles images of VINCENT AS A BABY.  
           Then a YOUNG BOY.  Poor.  Tough.  Street.  Pictures of a 
           hard life.  All the memories Vin had tossed in the trash.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        In 1965, as a member of United 
                        States Army’s 5th Regiment, Vincent 
                        was among the 450 soldiers dropped 
                        into the la Drang Valley, and 
                        immediately ambushed by 2000 
                        Vietcong troops.

           A headshot of Vincent as a young Marine in Vietnam.  
           Smoking a cigarette, proud, strong.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        There he heroically saved the lives 
                        of two officers pinned down by 
                        enemy fire and carried them to 
                        safety.  

           Newspaper clippings of Vin’s heroics.  A picture of Vin 
           receiving the Bronze Star.  In the back of the 
           auditorium, Vin is frozen...seeing his life through the 
           eyes of another.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        But I guess the best way I can tell 
                        you who Vincent Canatella is...is 
                        to tell you what he’s done for me.

           For the first time, Oliver sees Vin standing in back.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        When my mom and I first moved here, 
                        we knew no one.  And Mr. Canatella 
                        took me in.  When he didn’t have 
                        to.  And probably didn’t want to.  

           Laughter.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        But he did it anyhow.  That’s what 
                        saints do.

           A wedding picture of Vin and Sandy pops up on the screen.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        He took me to meet his wife of 
                        fifty years, Sandy.  Vin’s visited 
                        her at the old folks home everyday 
                        for the past eight years, even 
                        after she no longer recognized him.
           Another picture of Vin and Sandy.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Because saints never give up.

           A picture of VIN AS A FIGHTER, with boxing gloves on.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        He taught me how to fight.  How to 
                        stand my ground and be brave.  How 
                        to speak up and be bold.

           Maggie is crying.  David hands her a tissue.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Because saints fight for themselves 
                        and others.  They are heard.

           Vin is glued, hearing what he means to others, is the 
           warmth that melts an iceberg.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Vin taught me how to gamble.  Horse 
                        racing, Keno.  Which is a big 
                        reason why I’m grounded till I’m 
                        eighteen.

           Laughs.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        But in that I learned how to take 
                        risks and go for broke.  Because 
                        life waits for no one.

           A picture of Vin’s cat, Felix.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        This is Vin’s cat, Felix, who eats 
                        gourmet cat food.  Vin eats Spam.

           The CROWD loves it.  Maggie, David and Charisse are 
           mesmerized, proud, inspired.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Because saints make sacrifices.  
                        And finally...Mr. Canatella is 
                        flawed.  He’s rough, drinks too 
                        much, smokes and curses.  He’s got 
                        a lot of anger, pain and I’m sure 
                        some regrets.

           Vin takes it in.  

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Because after all, saints are human 
                        beings.  Very human beings.

           The picture of St. William next to Vincent replays on the 
           projection screen.
                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Courage, sacrifice, compassion and 
                        humanity.  These are the markings 
                        of a saint.  And what makes Mr. 
                        Vincent Canatella not so far 
                        removed from St. William of 
                        Rochester...

           Vin’s picture solos on the presentation.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        And with that I’d like to present 
                        my friend and baby sitter, Mr. 
                        Vincent Canatella for sainthood.  
                        And hereby proclaim him St. Vincent 
                        de Van Nuys.

           The place is wild with applause. 

           Vin doesn’t know what to do.  People are looking around 
           for him.  Finally...he starts walking down the aisle.

           Mr. Crespi helps Vin up the steps.  And towards Oliver, 
           who’s holding the “Saint Medal.”

           Vin steps in front of Oliver.  He leans over as Oliver 
           puts the medal around his neck.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 VINCENT
                        Thanks, Oli.

           And...without warning...Vin starts crying.  Maybe for the 
           first time in his life.

           PEOPLE rise in their seats to applaud him.

           Oliver hugs Vin.

           INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - ANOTHER DAY

           The break room.  Oliver and Vin stand in front of a 
           vending machine considering their options.  Vin’s wearing 
           scrubs.  His speech impediment is not so abstruse.

                                 VINCENT
                        They got the same selection from 
                        when I was a kid.

                                 OLIVER
                        Surely not.  They’d be really 
                        rotten by now.

                                 VINCENT
                        Nah.  They’re all jacked up on 
                        preservatives.  Crap has a half 
                        life of plutonium.
           Oliver digs in his pocket for change.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        I got it.  I got it.  What’cha 
                        want?

                                 OLIVER
                        The hard pretzels.

                                 VINCENT
                        Only thing I was looking at.

           Vin puts coins in the slot.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Hit the buttons would ya.  If I do 
                        it we’ll end up with Twinkies.

           Oliver keys in the selection.

                                 OLIVER
                        If you hit it just right...you 
                        can...

           Oliver hits the machine just as the bag of pretzels is 
           about to drop.

                                 OLIVER (CONT’D)
                        ...get two for the price of one.

           A second bag of pretzels drops down behind the first.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m impressed.

                                 OLIVER
                        Yeah.  Pretty cool.

           Oliver grabs both bags, hands one to Vin.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s stealing though.

           Oliver thinks about it.  A NURSE pops her head into the 
           room.

                                 NURSE
                        Mr. Canatella, it’s about that 
                        time.

           Vin rushes off.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m coming.

           Oliver stands there, eating his pretzels.  He digs into 
           his pockets, grabs some change and slips it in the coin 
           slot.  He walks off.
           INT. LABOR & DELIVERY ROOM - LATER

           Charisse is in the final stages of giving birth.  She’s 
           calm and focused.  A DOCTOR between her legs calls out 
           the final push.  The BABY is crowning.

                                 DOCTOR
                        One more time.  Big breath.  Big 
                        push.

                                 CHARISSE
                        You said one more time last one 
                        more time.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This time I mean it.  You’re almost 
                        there.

           Charisse pushes.  And...a BABY is born.  The doctor does 
           his thing, suctioning, inspecting.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Let me see.

           The doctor holds her up.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Here she is.

           The baby cries.  A Nurse offers Vin a scissors to cut the 
           umbilical cord.

                                 NURSE
                        You want to do the honors?

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m a little shaky.  Let a 
                        professional handle that.

           The Nurse cuts the cord.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        What is she?  Black, white, in 
                        between.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Get him outta here.

           Vin defends himself.

                                 VINCENT
                        What’s wrong with asking?

                                 CHARISSE
                        Get out of here.

           Vin walks off.  Mumbles.

                                 VINCENT
                        All doped up.  No sense ‘a humor.
           The doctor rests the baby on Charisse’s bosom.

                                 CHARISSE
                        Come here.  My little princess.  
                        Let mommy hold ya.

           INT. VIN’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

           A “family” dinner.  Charisse is serving a homemade meal 
           of spaghetti and green beans.  Fancy it’s not.

           Oliver and Ozinski sit on one side of the table.  Maggie 
           on the opposite side.  The baby’s in a bassinet, set 
           within a high chair.  And Vin is in the captain’s seat.

                                 VINCENT
                                 (re: the food)
                        It’s colorful.  I’ll say that.

                                 CHARISSE
                        How ‘bout you don’t say nothing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love green beans.

           Oliver jumps in.

                                 OLIVER
                        You do?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sure.  Don’t get ‘em that often.

                                 OZINSKI
                        My ma makes ‘em out of the can.

                                 VINCENT
                        That’s why your brain is stilted.

           Charisse sits.  Vin starts to dig in.  

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Well.  Beats Spam.  By a hair.

           Everyone just stares at him.

                                 OLIVER
                        Don’t you want to say something?

                                 VINCENT
                        Like what?

                                 OLIVER
                        A blessing or something.

           Vin thinks.

                                 VINCENT
                        Nope.
           EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The camera floats past the “fixed” fence and up into the 
           atmosphere above Van Nuys.

                                 VINCENT (O.S.)
                        You waiting for an invitation?  
                        This crap ain’t good enough to eat 
                        cold.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.

                                        The end.
