                                Writer's STUDIO DRAFT

                                    May 24, 2011
           CAMERA SOARS over a sea of lush, green TREETOPS, their tips 
           reaching for the stars and moon above.  We are --

           EXT. FAIRY FOREST - NIGHT

           CAMERA CONTINUES until it finds a peculiar treetop covered by 
           what appears to be a GARGANTUAN CANVAS SOCK.  The socked tree 
           jerks and lurches out of harmony with the other trees.

           REVEAL TWO LOGGERS (ANTONIUS and ANTONIO) climbing off the 
           low branches, pulling the sock tight around the tree base.  
           Quickly and quietly, they retrieve a six foot hand saw from a 
           HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE, placing the blade against the trunk.

           UNDER THE CANVAS SOCK

           EVERY LEAF of the tree begins to VIBRATE as if blown by an 
           invisible wind.  An organic alarm.

           ON ANTONIUS AND ANTONIO

           The loggers saw faster and faster, glancing over their 
           shoulders and all around as if they were doing something they 
           shouldn’t -- so much so, they fail to notice that their 
           frantic movements inadvertently worked A SINGLE LEAF out from 
           under the canvas sock.  The leaf drifts to the forest floor 
           and upon its leisurely impact, there’s a distant and eerie 
           THUMMMM, like an explosion under water.  Then silence.

           Antonius and Antonio stop and stare at each other as they 
           listen.  Nearly audible gulps as they swallow their hearts.  
           Then they begin furiously sawing again in an absolute panic.

           CAMERA CLIMBS BACK UP TO FIND THE SEA OF TREETOPS ABOVE

           Deep in the distance, an EERIE, ETHEREAL BLUE GLOW stirs and 
           ignites.  As the GLOW grows in intensity, the CANVAS SOCKED 
           TREE CRACKLES AND SNAPS and FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

           ON THE HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE

           The CANVAS SOCKED TREE lands with a WOMPF, rocking the long 
           carriage and startling the already spooked HORSE, who kicks 
           at the ground in anticipation.  Antonius and Antonio 
           hurriedly secure ropes over the stolen tree before scrambling 
           up onto the drivers box.  Antonio glances back to see through 
           the trees an EERIE, ETHEREAL GLOW starting to brighten the 
           distant horizon.  Antonius grabs the reins and snaps them:
                                 ANTONIUS
                        Arre, arre!

           The horse BOLTS.  

           RACING TOWARD THE FOREST PERIMETER

           A near frantic gallop.  Antonio keeps his eyes on the ever-
           brightening horizon behind as Antonius keeps his eyes on the 
           path through the trees ahead... that appears to be NARROWING.  

           FOREST TREES seem to be COMING ALIVE around them, reaching 
           out with TERRIBLE CLAW-LIKE BRANCHES that swat and lash.  
           Roots flex out of the soil under the spinning cart wheels and 
           the ride gets increasingly bumpy.  Antonius drives the horse:

                                 ANTONIUS (CONT’D)
                        Cavalluccio, arre --

           Antonius is SNATCHED mid-sentence into the air by a ROVING 
           TREE BRANCH, the reins ripped from his hands.  Antonio 
           catches a brief glimpse of his fellow logger Antonius as he 
           is TOSSED SCREAMING FROM TREE TO TREE, carried deeper into 
           the forest toward the source of the EERIE, ETHEREAL GLOW.

           Antonio turns his attention back to the path ahead just as an 
           unfortunately exposed tree root causes the cart to BUMP with 
           a sudden jolt.  Antonio is sent flying into a gully as the 
           horse drawn carriage bolts recklessly ahead and out of sight.

           Antonio shrinks into the thick underbrush, backing away from 
           the EERIE, ETHEREAL GLOW -- which he can now see is cast by 
           HUNDREDS OF FLOATING BLUE BALLS OF LIGHT approaching from 
           overhead.  He runs away as quickly and quietly as he can.

           A MURKY POND COVERED WITH REEDS AND LILY PADS

           Antonio wades into the pond, silhouetted by the advancing 
           ETHEREAL GLOW.  He snaps off a reed, puts one end in his 
           mouth, and submerges himself before the GLOW can find him.

           IN THE COLD, WET DARKNESS OF THE POND

           Antonio squats just below the surface, out of sight.  A 
           curious fish takes a closer look at its visitor, prompting a 
           brief staring contest.  Then the dark water begins to 
           BRIGHTEN ever so slightly and the curious fish scatters.
           Antonio looks up beyond the surface of the pond to see a 
           BEAUTIFUL BLUE FAIRY floating above him as if she were on the 
           other side of a looking glass, COMPOSED OF DOZENS OF GLOWING 
           BLUE SPHERES OF LIGHT, constellation-like.  She’s radiant.

           The submerged logger stares at the majesty of the WINGED 
           WOMAN hovering above the water, lulled by her beauty.  She 
           places her lips seductively over the other end of Antonio’s 
           breathing reed.  Then she becomes SOMETHING HORRIBLE that we 
           only see in a GLIMPSE as its HORRIFYING REFLECTION ripples 
           across the pond surface.  A TINY, WHITE HOT BEAD OF LIGHT 
           shoots through the reed and strikes the logger like a mighty 
           fist, knocking the air out of him in a flurry of bubbles.

           Antonio is VIOLENTLY TRANSFORMED INTO A TREE, his limbs 
           TWISTING INTO BRANCHES as the water muffles his screams.

           ON THE POND

           Antonio’s TWISTED TREE LIMBS break the surface, reaching 
           pleadingly up to the sky above as if for mercy, his anguished 
           features strained and wrenched into RIDGES OF BARK.  A moment 
           of horror then the EERIE, ETHEREAL GLOW fades into darkness.

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           PLINK-PLINK-PLINK.  Standing near his horse, chewing the 
           mouth piece of his smoking pipe, MASTER CHERRY (a thick, well-
           dressed craftsman in his 50s) finishes counting gold pieces 
           into a small leather satchel and ties the money bag shut.   
           Somebody’s about to get paid.  He looks up to see a lone 
           weary horse galloping into the field, pulling the long 
           carriage and the canvas-socked tree.  No passengers.

           The weary galloping horse shows no signs of stopping.  
           Nevertheless, Master Cherry confidently strides into its 
           path, raising his outstretched arms and commanding:

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        Whoa!  Whoooooa!

           The weary, galloping horse is nearly upon Master Cherry.  
           Trampling appears imminent and then... the BEAST STIFFENS ITS 
           LEGS in a sudden attempt to brake, sliding across the field 
           to a stop practically face-to-face with Master Cherry.  The 
           terrified horse stares wide-eyed, breathing heavily.  

           Master Cherry strokes the rattled horse’s head and neck, 
           attempting to calm it.  He surveys the carriage and asks:

                                 MASTER CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        Where are your masters?
           The horse’s only response is more staring and heavy 
           breathing.  Master Cherry shrugs and pockets the sack of 
           coins intended to pay the horse’s missing masters.

                                 MASTER CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        Penny saved.

           He unbridles the horse and it once again BOLTS.  Master 
           Cherry exchanges a look with his own horse.  Something 
           terrified that poor beast, spooked it beyond reason.

           Master Cherry makes a clucking sound with his tongue and 
           gestures for his horse to assume the position just vacated.

           OVERHEAD CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY 

           Master Cherry, his horse and the canvas-socked tree shrink 
           against the field, which shrinks against the countryside, 
           which shrinks against the surrounding mountain range...

           ...until the FRAME INCLUDES a dark, green patch of forest, 
           deep within which is an EERIE, ETHEREAL BLUE GLOW.

           CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL UP

           The entire country of Italy, boot and all shrinks against the 
           curvature of the Earth as the GLOBE ITSELF becomes an ACTUAL 
           PAINTED WOODEN GLOBE surrounded by WOODEN TOY FLYING MACHINES 
           floating on strings concealed in tufts of cotton cum clouds.

           CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK REVEALING we are --

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE - MORNING

           A DOZEN CHILDREN crowd around the windows, cupping their 
           hands to get a glare-free look at the window display 
           featuring the giant wooden globe and wooden flying machines.  
           The Toy store is a hub of activity for the local children, 
           squeezed into a row of brick and mortar shop fronts on a 
           winding cobblestone road semi-populated with PEDESTRIANS.

           THROUGH CUPPED HANDS OF CHILDREN

           Beyond the window display, across the show room of TOYS, the 
           partially obscured TOY MAKER hunches over his work bench, an 
           apparently ill-tempered mystery for the children.
           THE THRONG OF CHILDREN

           Each of them jockeying for a better look through the front 
           windows of the toy store.  Then the crowd begins to part.

           REVERSE TO REVEAL MADAME BUCCI and her 10 year old daughter 
           STEFANIA crossing the cobblestone street with purpose.  
           Madame Bucci carries a mini-coffin-like box under her arm.  
           They wade through the CROWD OF CHILDREN to Geppetto’s door.

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE - MORNING

           The bell RINGS as Stefania ENTERS.  GEPPETTO THE TOY MAKER, a 
           peculiarly handsome man in his 40s, drops his brush on the 
           work bench and points at the little girl:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Not.  Without adult supervision.

           Stefania stares then steps aside, opening the door the rest 
           of the way, making room for her mother Madame Bucci.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (brighter)
                        Good day, Madame.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        The quality of my day depends 
                        entirely on you, Signore Geppetto.  
                        You sold me a defective toy. 

           A HUSH falls over the crowd of children gathered at the Toy 
           Store’s open door, illustrating the audacity of Madame 
           Bucci’s claim.  Scattered whispers from the children.

                                 STEFANIA
                        We want a full refund.

           Geppetto politely indicates a sign that clearly reads:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No refunds.  

           Madame Bucci produces the lopsided LADY PUPPET from its box.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        This, sir, is shoddy craftsmanship.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Shoddy?  Really?

           Geppetto crosses to the door and casually KICKS IT SHUT on 
           the crowd of children gawking from the sidewalk.
                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s have a look.

           ON GEPPETTO’S WORK BENCH

           The doll is laid to rest as if awaiting an autopsy.  Outside, 
           CHILDREN press their faces to windows, desperate for a peek.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        This was the doll’s condition at 
                        the time of purchase?

                                 STEFANIA
                        Yes.

           Geppetto unfastens the doll’s dress and deftly slips it off.  
           He examines the garment, even taking a scientific sniff.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        River water.  Ashes and lye.  A 
                        splinter from a laundry bat.  This 
                        doll’s garment has been washed and 
                        washed.  And washed.  Repeatedly.
                             (brightening slightly)
                        But consider the stitch work.  It 
                        remains impeccably tight. 

           He hikes up the doll’s bloomers.  One leg is nailed into the 
           hip, instead of secured in a clean joint like its twin.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (re: nail)
                        How do you suppose that got there?

                                 STEFANIA
                        You’re the Toy Maker.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I don’t use nails, don’t believe in 
                        them.  I find them offensive.  

           He taps the doll’s leg that is secured in the clean joint:

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        This is my signature ball joint.  

           Stefania and her mother only stare.

           Geppetto picks the doll up and proceeds to beat the doll’s 
           one good leg against his work bench.  BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG.

                                                          QUICK POP TO:
           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE - MORNING

           The THRONG OF CHILDREN react to the sounds of the BEATING 
           taking place inside the store, exchanging worried glances.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE - MORNING

           Geppetto ceases to beat the doll’s hip joint, explaining:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        The ball joint’s unique design 
                        makes it extra sturdy.  Look.  Not 
                        a dent.  And I’m a reasonably 
                        strong man so imagine the level of 
                        abuse the doll must have suffered.   

           He gently places the doll back on his work bench.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        As you can see, the craftsmanship is 
                        anything but shoddy.  This doll has 
                        been mistreated.  By some horrible 
                        little animal.  It would seem.

           Geppetto eyes the girl with respectfully contained disdain.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Did you just call my daughter a 
                        horrible little animal?

                                 GEPPETTO 
                        Certainly not.  I only implied the 
                        doll came across a horrible little 
                        animal after the time of purchase.  
                        Whether or not it was your daughter 
                        is only fit for her mother to say.

           He takes a mildly noisy sip from an espresso to punctuate.  
           Madame Bucci’s chin trembles slightly and she suppresses it.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Has this happened before?

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Only with her little lady dolls.

                                 STEFANIA
                        Mother.
                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        She’s not a beast.  Only beastly.  
                        On occasion.  The girls at school 
                        tease her and she brings it home.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        If someone doesn’t like other 
                        little ladies, I would recommend a 
                        young gentleman marionette...
                             (to Stefania)
                        ...which would be an elite edition 
                        custom order, of course.

           Madame Bucci exchanges a glance with her daughter.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        How would you like to pay for that?

           INT. MASTER CHERRY’S WOODMILL - DAY

           An elaborate and very well-equipped miniature wood mill, 
           complete with steam-punk powered saw blades surrounded by 
           cords of wood.  Geppetto stands amongst them.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Master Cherry, I require wood.

           He’s addressing MASTER CHERRY, the man previously seen 
           collecting the stolen tree in an open field.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        I’m making a little wooden boy for 
                        a horrible little girl.

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        Help yourself to the discard pile.

           He points to a pile of nubby branches and discarded logs.

                                 MASTER CHERRY (CONT’D)
                        I never like a child to go without, 
                        even the horrible ones.  As a toy 
                        maker you must adore all children.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        One would assume.

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        None yourself?

           With Master Cherry’s back turned, Geppetto picks up a nubby, 
           bark-covered, knot-ridden block NOT from the discard pile.  
           THE BLOCK OF WOOD

           Geppetto examines the partial branch, loving the weight and 
           the way it feels in his hand.  This is the wood for the job.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m lousy with them.  

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        Customers.

           Geppetto crosses back to the discard pile with the block.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Loiterers, mostly.  

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        I found having children helped me 
                        to examine my life.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I try to avoid doing that, which is 
                        why I prefer the company of toys.

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        Toys can’t love you back.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Love is overrated, so are children.  
                             (re: block of wood)
                        What’s this?

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        It’s an exotic pine.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        An exotic pine? 

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        From some place exotic.  That’s not 
                        supposed to be in the discard pile. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It was right here on top.

                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        Perhaps the horrible girl would 
                        like a doll made from a local pine.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What horrible little girl wouldn’t 
                        want an exotic pine doll? 

           Master Cherry regards the block of wood hesitantly, then:
                                 MASTER CHERRY
                        If you insist.

           ON THE BLOCK OF WOOD

           The bark-covered, knot-ridden severed tree limb sits and 
           stares.  Two gnarled knots give the impression of eyes and a 
           small snapped branch gives the impression of a nose.

                                 GEPPETTO (O.S.)
                        What kind of boy do you want to be?

           We are --

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE - DAY

           Geppetto stares at the block of wood on his work bench then 
           sets about chipping away at the bark, peeling it off like a 
           well-maintained scab.  The bare knots under the bark look 
           even more like eyes now that they’re exposed.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        There’s a word for odd little pine 
                        wood eyes like yours.  Pinocchio.

           The moment Geppetto looks away, the KNOT RINGS move ever so 
           slightly, as though they are trying to focus.

           As Geppetto carves, oblivious to knotty activity, CAMERA 
           PUSHES IN ON THE TWIN KNOT RINGS above the snapped twig nose.

           THROUGH THE IMPRESSIONS OF KNOT-RINGED EYES

           A HEAVILY MUFFLED SILENCE, as if submerged in something 
           thicker than water.  We’re watching the Toy Maker work from 
           the block of wood’s point of view.  

           MOVEMENTS ACCELERATE as Geppetto carves at TIME LAPSE SPEEDS.  
           Geppetto removes the top portion of the block of wood (its 
           head, for all intents and purposes), placing it (and the 
           POINT OF VIEW) on the work bench next to the lower portion -- 
           which is now directly in front of us and is well on its way 
           to being identifiable as the doll’s torso complete with legs.

           Day becomes afternoon becomes early evening becomes night.

           Geppetto’s ACCELERATED MOVEMENTS continue to CARVE and 
           SCULPT, finally picking up the top portion of the block of 
           wood and placing it back on the shoulders.  ACCELERATED 
           MOVEMENTS SLOW as TIME RETURNS TO NORMAL.
           CLOSE ON KNOT-RINGED EYES

           CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the ROUND FACE OF A WOODEN PINE-
           EYED PINOCCHIO.  He stares into middle-distance, arms slack 
           by his side.  Apparently lifeless, the boy has freshly sanded 
           pine skin.  It’s hours later and Geppetto is clearly fatigued 
           but even so, he regards the wooden boy with pride of a job 
           well done.  As it is now night, a CRICKET CHIRPS quietly.

           Geppetto bends over to grab a palette of paints and THUNK -- 

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Ow.

           It felt like something just kicked him in the head.  He rubs 
           his noggin and shoots the inanimate wooden boy a look.  One 
           of its legs is extended on its signature joint.  Must have 
           left that leg up.  Geppetto bends the extended leg at the 
           knee and sets about painting Pinocchio’s eyebrows and mouth.  

           The KNOT RINGS of his PINE EYES shift, dilating as an eye 
           would.  They focus on the PAINT BRUSH in Geppetto’s hand and 
           Geppetto finally notices wide-eyed.  Pinocchio stares as 
           Geppetto moves the brush to and fro, the KNOT EYES follow.  

           On his rolling stool, Geppetto pushes himself away from the 
           wood carved puppet.  Once again, the KNOT RINGS follow.  And 
           then its head turns.  Geppetto GASPS, drops the brush and 
           crosses himself.  He watches silently for a moment then: 

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Are you...?  What are you?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What are you?

           There is a numb shock in Geppetto’s voice.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m a toy maker.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What am I?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You’re a toy.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        If you already knew what I was then 
                        why did you ask me?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Seemed like there was more to you 
                        than the average wooden boy.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What a nice thing to hear.

           The whites of his eyes glare zombie-like without any pupils.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Your eye whites are unnerving me.  
                        What color do you want them?

           Geppetto grabs the palette of colors.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Same as yours.
                             (then)
                        How do we know each other?

           Geppetto lifts his paint brush to Pinocchio’s face...

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I carved you out of wood.

           ...and meticulously paints the boy’s eyes as he speaks:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You asked me what kind of boy I 
                        wanted to be.  Hey.  Since you seem 
                        to already have answers to 
                        questions when you ask them, do you 
                        have an answer to that question?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’ll come up with my own answer.  
                             (then)
                        What kind of boy do you wanna be?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’ve always admired quiet boys who 
                        sit very still.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Mmmm.  I don’t think I’d like that.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (stares, then)
                        I’ll be right back.

           With that, Geppetto abruptly stands and walks out, wide-eyed 
           and worried.  Pinocchio watches the door, curious.  After a 
           moment, the CRICKET hops out of the shadows, rubs his wings 
           together in the cricket-chirping equivalent of an “ahem,” 
           approaches Pinocchio and begins SPEAKING.  
           (NOTE: The Cricket’s mouth doesn’t move when it speaks, 
           instead it CHIRPS dialogue by articulately rubbing its wings 
           together resulting in what sounds like a high-pitched voice.)

                                 CRICKET
                        I think you really upset him when 
                        you talked.  It’s been my 
                        experience that he prefers to be 
                        the talker.  He just talks and 
                        talks and talks and never asks me 
                        anything about me or my day.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Does he know you can talk?

                                 CRICKET
                        He’s never asked.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Should I not be talking? 

                                 CRICKET
                        Maybe best if you don’t.

           Pinocchio considers that for a non-talking moment, then:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        How was your day?

                                 CRICKET
                        Uneventful until recently.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Really?  What happened?

                                 CRICKET
                             (studying Pinocchio)
                        How was your day?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Very brief.  It was dark and then 
                        it wasn’t.  So far, so good.

           The DOOR BANGS OPEN as Geppetto returns with a BAR MAID from 
           a nearby tavern still carrying a tray of Limoncellos.  
           Pinocchio is absolutely motionless as the Cricket quietly 
           backs back into the shadow from whence it came.

           Geppetto pulls the Bar Maid over to his work bench and places 
           her directly in front of the little wooden boy.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Wait.  Watch.
                             (to Pinocchio)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEPPETTO (CONT'D)
                        So you were saying... about, uh, 
                        what kind of boy you want to be.

           The wooden boy sits motionless.  A CHIRP from the shadows.

                                 BAR MAID
                        Is it saying something?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.

                                 BAR MAID
                        What about now?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.

                                 BAR MAID
                        Now?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Just  a second.
                             (sotto, to Pinocchio)
                        If you don’t say something I’m 
                        going to throw you in the fire 
                        place and strike a match.

           No response.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Alright.

           The Toy Maker scoops up Pinocchio and puts him in the fire 
           place and strikes a match as promised.  Over it’s flame:

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        So help me, I’ll do it.

                                 BAR MAID
                        This is making me uncomfortable.

           Realizing he looks insane, Geppetto blows out the match.  His 
           demeanor changes as abruptly as the extinguished flame.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Thank you for indulging me.

           He grabs a Limoncello and downs it, then turns the Bar Maid 
           back toward the door, swallowing another shot as he goes.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        I guess I’m really tired.  
                                 BAR MAID
                        I heard a story about a paisano in 
                        the next posto who saw things that 
                        weren’t really there.  Undertaker 
                        said his head was full of tumors. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No, I’m just really, really tired.

           The Bar Maid turns to leave but not before Geppetto grabs yet 
           another Limóncello, shoots it, and places the empty glass 
           back on the tray before she can get out the door.  

           Geppetto slumps into a chair and buries his face in his 
           hands.  He starts giggling, the absurdity of the toy he’s 
           making coming to life finally dawning on him.  He was a fool 
           to consider it for even a moment.  It was all in his head.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What’s so funny?

           Geppetto chokes on his last giggle with a stifled snort.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Awfully chatty all of a sudden.

           He self-consciously checks his head for abnormal swelling.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I was just seeing if I liked being 
                        quiet and sitting still.  I don’t.

           Pinocchio climbs out of the fire place and stumbles on his 
           wobbly, newly carved legs.  Geppetto incredulously steadies 
           the wooden boy, holding him as he finds his balance -- as a 
           father would with a son.  It’s a distinctively paternal 
           gesture on the Toy Maker’s part and he’s aware of it.  He 
           marvels at the creature he crafted not only talking, but...

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You can walk.  You can walk.

           His eyes swell, marveling at Pinocchio with awe.  Geppetto 
           suddenly becomes aware of the sentiment of the moment, and 
           also the myriad things Pinocchio can also do while walking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PINOCCHIO IS IN A BIRD CAGE

           He swings on the perch, bored but complacent.  CAMERA PULLS 
           BACK TO REVEAL we are --
           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - NIGHT

           CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK over Geppetto’s exposed feet 
           and the blanket that almost covers them.  REVERSE ON Geppetto 
           curled up in an overstuffed chair, staring wide-eyed at the 
           little wooden doll swinging on the perch in the birdcage.

                                                      HARD TIME-CUT TO:

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - DAY

           An utterly exhausted Geppetto has finally fallen asleep.  
           Pinocchio continues to swing higher and higher, trying to get 
           a glimpse of the BUSTLING SIDEWALK outside the store windows.

           There’s a SUDDEN RAPPING at the door.  A curious Pinocchio 
           unlatches the bird cage and easily crawls out of his prison.  
           He climbs down and walks toward the rapping at the door like 
           a naked toddler (as he is not yet wearing clothes).

           There’s a familiar yet ominous silhouette of a little girl 
           and her mother against the shade covering the front door.  
           Madame Bucci and Stefania have returned.  Pinocchio’s little 
           arms reach little hands up and unlock the door with a CLICK.

           The Toy Maker’s front door swings OPEN, a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT 
           sweeps across the floor about to REVEAL to Madame Bucci and 
           Stefania the living wooden boy named Pinocchio... 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.

           ...then GEPPETTO’S bare feet rush up behind the living doll, 
           and Pinocchio is swept into the crook of the Toy Maker’s arm.  
           Madame Bucci and Stefania push their way inside the shop.

                                 STEFANIA
                        We’ve come for my wooden gentleman.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        He’s not ready.

                                 STEFANIA
                        You said he’d be ready today.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It’s going to be today all day 
                        long.  Right up until tomorrow.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        She was hoping she would have an 
                        escort for school this morning.  
                                 GEPPETTO
                        Probably best not to go looking for 
                        things to be teased about.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                             (re: doll he’s holding)
                        Is that him?

           Stefania studies naked Pinocchio back side poking out from 
           the crook of Geppetto’s arm.

                                 STEFANIA
                        He doesn’t look like a gentleman.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        He will when he’s all finished, 
                        which is not how he is now.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                             (re: Pinocchio’s pelvis)
                        You didn’t... he’s not...?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Not anatomically, no.

                                 STEFANIA
                        I know what you’re talking about.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                             (moving on)
                        Can we have a proper look?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        He’s a work in progress.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Aren’t we all?

           Geppetto, who has no idea what the unpredictable Pinocchio 
           will do next, looks at the wooden doll and slowly turns him 
           around to face Madame Bucci and horrible, little Stefania.

           Stefania stares long and hard at Pinocchio, then:

                                 STEFANIA
                        I suppose I like him enough.

           Madame Bucci breathes an audible sigh of relief and gathers 
           and guides Stefania out the door.  Geppetto watches them go.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        We’ll come back later today.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        Come back tomorrow.

           Before Madame Bucci or little Stefania can turn and protest, 
           Geppetto has already CLOSED THE DOOR and locked it.  
           Pinocchio crawls down from the crook of Geppetto’s arm.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What’s gonna happen when she comes 
                        back tomorrow?

           Geppetto watches, still in shock, as Pinocchio toddles around 
           the toy store and work shop, opening cupboards and exploring.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I haven’t decided.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PINOCCHIO LOCKED IN THE BIRD CAGE

           Geppetto twists a key in a paddle lock and SNAPS THE LOCK 
           CLOSED, taking the key with him.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m going to talk to a man about a 
                        block of wood.  What kind of boy 
                        are you going to be while I’m gone?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        A quiet boy who sits very still.

           Pinocchio’s nose unexpectedly SWELLS AND POPS half an inch in 
           growth.  Geppetto eyes it suspiciously:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Say that again.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m gonna be quiet and sit still.

           Another SWELL AND POP.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Why’d it do that?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Do what?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Why’d your nose grow?
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Must happen when I’m feeling sincere.

           A LEAF SPONTANEOUSLY SPROUTS from the tip of his nose.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        See.  I’m feeling very sincere. 

           The LEAF FANS OUT, multiplying with the “sincerity.”

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Stop being so sincere.

           Geppetto SNIPS THE TIP OFF PINOCCHIO’S NOSE with clippers, 
           restoring it to its original length.  

           The Toy Maker shrugs on his coat, placing the key to the lock 
           on Pinocchio’s cage by the door as he EXITS.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           THE KEY

           Pinocchio’s little WOODEN HAND reaches into FRAME and takes 
           the key.  CAMERA POPS WIDE TO REVEAL:

           A HEADLESS PINOCCHIO

           The wooden boy’s body crosses (albeit a little off balance) 
           to the BIRD CAGE where its HEAD watches, too large to squeeze 
           through the bars like his thinner parts.

           The Cricket hops through the bird cage bars and lands next to 
           Pinocchio’s sweetly distracted head.

                                 CRICKET
                        He said to sit still.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I am sitting still.  Part of me.

                                 CRICKET
                        He meant the part that commonly 
                        does the sitting that’s currently 
                        walking around the room.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Maybe he should have been clearer.

           Pinocchio’s hands feel for the lock, finally getting a hold 
           of it.  As he fumbles with the key...
                                 CRICKET
                        He trusted you.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (”not really”)
                        He did put me in a cage.

           CLICK.  The lock opens and the bird cage swings open. 

                                 CRICKET
                        That is no excuse for bad behavior.

           Pinocchio’s body grabs his noggin, puts it on his shoulders.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Sure it is.
                             (changing subjects)
                        How are you?  How’s your day?

                                 CRICKET
                        You know what will happen tomorrow 
                        when that little girl comes back?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        More scowling?

                                 CRICKET
                        If you don’t behave yourself, the 
                        Toy Maker will give you to her.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t want to be given away.

                                 CRICKET
                        You’re not a real boy.  You can be 
                        given away and she’ll take you home 
                        where unspeakable horrors await. 

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        The Toy Maker made me.  I’m his.  
                        Why would he give me away?

                                 CRICKET
                        Why would you make him want to give 
                        you away?  Consequences.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What-a-whences?

                                 CRICKET
                        Not even love is unconditional.  
                        Those who say it is are either 
                        insane or they are lying.  You are 
                        responsible for your behavior.
           Pinocchio pulls the shade on the door which flaps up abruptly 
           REVEALING a ragtag line of UNIFORMED SCHOOL CHILDREN marching 
           in two files down the street, girls on the outside, boys on 
           the inside, led by a PRIEST.  Pinocchio watches them go.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What are those?

                                 CRICKET
                        Boys.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m a boy.  

                                 CRICKET
                        Not really.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What kind of boys are those?  

                                 CRICKET
                        Real boys.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        They already know what kind of boys 
                        they wanna be?  

                                 CRICKET
                        That’s why real boys go to school.

           A moment as the Pinocchio’s wooden head calculates, then:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I want to be a real boy.

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - MORNING

           A SCRAWNY SCHOOL BOY lags behind the rest of the school 
           children who have just walked past the store.  The door OPENS 
           A CRACK as the SCRAWNY SCHOOL BOY passes:

                                 PINOCCHIO’S VOICE
                        Psssst.

           The Scrawny School Boy stops and glances around for the 
           source of the “Psssst.”  The TOY STORE’S DOOR is OPEN and a 
           WOODEN STEGOSAURUS pokes its head out.  It appears to beckon 
           the Scrawny School Boy with a series of small nods.

           The Scrawny School Boy’s eyes brighten.  He follows the 
           Stegosaurus as it retreats back inside Geppetto’s toy store, 
           the door promptly shutting behind him.
           The doors OPEN once more and the Scrawny School Boy walks out 
           holding the Stegosaurus and no longer wearing his school 
           uniform -- just Geppetto’s apron.  Dressed in the SCHOOL 
           BOY’S UNIFORM, Pinocchio darts out of the Toy Store and 
           hurries to catch up with the ragtag line of SCHOOL CHILDREN, 
           slinging his belt-strapped books over his shoulder.

           EXT. ITALIAN VILLAGE - STREET - MORNING

           Pinocchio finally catches up with the ragtag line of SCHOOL 
           CHILDREN, glancing around at the Italian Village around him 
           with fresh, new eyes.  He watches as the BUSINESS MEN in 
           their impeccable suits, pass chattering, unaware that 
           Pinocchio just snatched their pocket watches.

           As Pinocchio swings the pocket watches around on their 
           respective chains, he hears a voice from an alleyway:

                                 FOX
                        Excuse me, young sir.  

           Pinocchio stops and sees a very normal looking FOX and a very 
           normal looking CAT standing side by side in the alleyway.

                                 FOX (CONT’D)
                        A word?

           Pinocchio steps curiously into the mouth of the alley.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Just one?  Which one is it?

                                 FOX
                        Which what?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Which word.  With the way you’re 
                        puffing it up, I hope it’s 
                        something I haven’t heard before.  

                                 CAT
                        Usually people are more impressed.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        This has gotta be some word.

                                 FOX
                        Impressed that we’re talking.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Why wouldn’t you be?  Are you shy?
                                 CAT
                        We wouldn’t be talking because we 
                        don’t talk.  I’m a cat, he’s a fox.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You gonna tell me what the word is?

                                 FOX
                        The word is Play.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’ve already heard that word.  
                        Do you have any other ones?

                                 CAT
                        You’ve heard of the Land of Play?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Oh, I didn’t know it was a land.

                                 FOX
                        Nobody does.  It’s a secret.  
                        That’s why we’re telling you.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Because you don’t talk.

                                 CAT
                        Traditionally.

                                 FOX
                        Something that doesn’t talk telling 
                        you a secret is sort of like not 
                        being told a secret at all.

                                 CAT
                        So it stays secret.

                                 FOX
                        Do you know what a secret is?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I do now.  And I already like them.

                                 CAT
                        Where were you off to?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        School.  It’s where real boys go.

                        not smart enough to know better.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’ve been misinformed?

                        What’s dumber than working all day 
                        in school when you can play all day 
                        in a land that has play in its name?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        This place sounds fantastic.

           And then A PAIR OF HANDS SNATCH PINOCCHIO OUT OF FRAME.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The same PAIR OF HANDS plant Pinocchio INTO FRAME.  CAMERA 
           PULLS BACK TO REVEAL he’s surrounded by SCHOOL CHILDREN 
           facing a PRIEST.  He glances out the window to see, sitting 
           patiently outside the school yard, the CAT and FOX.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODED PATH - DAY

           Geppetto rides his STEED at a steady gallop, the trees 
           whipping past as they charge forward.  The Toy Maker’s mind 
           is poring over events when the GLINT of something metallic 
           high in a tree catches his eye.  He pulls the reigns and his 
           horse slows so he can get a better look.

           It’s a STOVE dangling precariously from the highest branches 
           by its stovepipe -- how it got there appears to be a mystery.  
           This would be the first indication that something is horribly 
           awry.  Geppetto whips his reigns, his horse galloping toward:

           EXT. MASTER CHERRY’S WOOD MILL - DAY

           Geppetto and his horse emerge from the wooded path to find 
           the entire front of Cherry’s mill has been torn away.  It 
           appears as though a tornado touched down on his porch and 
           rang the bell.  The immediate grounds are littered with a 
           smattering of logs and saw blades and chunks of wood mill.

           In the clearing in front of the mill, an INCONSOLABLE WOMAN 
           weeps and wails in fits and starts.  She’s ineffectively 
           comforted by the formally dressed DRIVER of a parked 
           CARRIAGE.  An ARISTOCRATIC MAN watches from the CARRIAGE 
           WINDOW.  Geppetto climbs down from his steed and approaches 
           the Driver and Inconsolable Woman, already anxious.
                                 GEPPETTO
                             (re: wood mill)
                        How -- ?

                                 DRIVER
                        Don’t know.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (re: Inconsolable Woman)
                        Who -- ?

                                 DRIVER
                        Don’t know.

                                 ARISTOCRATIC MAN
                             (from the carriage window)
                        She’s been like this since we found 
                        her.  Wailing jags.  Then she gets 
                        quiet and you think she’s going to 
                        say something then more wailing.

                                 INCONSOLABLE WOMAN
                        Fuh-fuh-fuh...

                                 ARISTOCRATIC MAN
                        Much as anyone’s gotten out of her.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Huh.

           A little overwhelmed with what he’s seeing, Geppetto 
           nevertheless moves toward the gaping maw of Master Cherry’s 
           wood mill that was once its front door.

           INT. MASTER CHERRY’S WOOD MILL - DAY

           CONTINUOUS as Geppetto crosses the demolished threshold.  The 
           wood surfaces are BLACK, SPROUTING BLACK BRANCHES and LEAVES.  
           In the middle of Master Cherry’s presently indoor/outdoor 
           workshop, behind Master Cherry’s blackened toppled workbench, 
           is a TWISTED TREE not unlike the one seen earlier sprouting 
           from a pond... but no sign of Master Cherry himself.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Master Cherry?

           No response.  Geppetto circles the tree, examining it.  It 
           appears to have spontaneously sprung from the floorboards, 
           launching itself through the roof of the wood mill.  But how?   
           It wasn’t here yesterday.  This is all very strange.

           Outside, the Inconsolable Woman and the Driver can be heard:
                                 INCONSOLABLE WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Fuh-f-fuh...

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        That’s it.  Spit it out.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Master Cherr --

           Geppetto looks closer at the tree and sees the visage of 
           MASTER CHERRY’S FACE ETCHED IN THE BARK, grimacing with one 
           eye squeezed shut and a knot where the open eye should be.  
           And then the knot blinks.  Geppetto’s jaw suddenly goes slack 
           on its hinge, falling open as he backs away, terrified.  

           EXT. MASTER CHERRY’S WOOD MILL

           CONTINUOUS as Geppetto backs out of the demolished wood mill 
           just the Inconsolable Woman finally gets her word out:

                                 INCONSOLABLE WOMAN
                        Fuh-fuh-f-fairies!

           Geppetto goes pale at the mention of the f-word.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

           Pinocchio is surrounded by boys led by a tall, thin, narrow-
           necked surly boy with licks of ginger hair called CANDLEWICK.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What’d you call me?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Candlewick.  Cause your head looks 
                        like a candlewick with hairy flame.  

           Every boy but Candlewick bursts into raucous laughter.  
           Pinocchio doesn’t understand why this is so funny.  He’s 
           confused by their reaction as he is not intending to be mean.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t everybody named after a 
                        descriptive body part?  My name 
                        means Pine Eyes.  Didn’t occur to 
                        me to be any kind of mad about it.  
                        What about Lampwick or Match Stick?

           Another round of raucous laughter at Candlewick’s expense.
                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Maybe you should repeat that and  
                        say something else so I can pretend 
                        you didn’t say it at all.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I liked Hairy Flame when I said it.

           The ginger-haired boy shoves Pinocchio HARD, sending him 
           skidding across the playground.  Pinocchio stands and smiles.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        That was fun!  Do it again!

           Candlewick obliges, sending Pinocchio skidding once again, 
           this time a little harder.  He gets up, not smiling.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Not as much fun that time.

                                                  CAMERA WHIPS TO FIND:

           STEFANIA, THE HORRIBLE, LITTLE GIRL

           WOMPF.  She’s pushed HARD, skidding across another part of 
           the playground.  Stefania has her own bully to contend with: 
           an even more horrible big girl named FRANCA.  Franca is 
           surrounded by her little ladies of the yard mean girl posse.

                                 FRANCA
                             (to the other girls)
                        She has to beat up her dolly cause 
                        she can’t beat up anybody else.

                                 STEFANIA
                             (quietly)
                        I haven’t been beating up my dolly.
                             (with intent)
                        I’ve been practicing.

                                                  CAMERA WHIPS BACK TO:

           PINOCCHIO HITS THE GROUND AGAIN

           He dusts himself off, having had quite enough.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        No longer fun for me at all.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I’m still having fun.
           Pinocchio casually side-steps Candlewick’s next push.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        That is a very narrow view of fun.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What do you know?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m telling you this is not fun.  I 
                        know fun.  I live in a toy store.  

           ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE BACKGROUND

           Franca and her little ladies of the school yard turn their 
           backs and Stefania SPRINGS.  She leaps onto Franca’s back and 
           a whirling, kicking, biting, scratching girl fight commences.

           ON PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           The real one standing over the wooden one.  The group of boys 
           surrounding Pinocchio and Candlewick is steadily disbanding 
           to watch the more interesting Stefania Vs. Franca showdown.

                                 CANDLEWICK 
                        Only toys live in a toy store.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (getting his back up)
                        You’re not suggesting I’m a toy.  
                        What a dumb thing to suggest.  Did 
                        you suggest that cause you’re dumb?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Dumb is suggesting I’m dumb.

           Candlewick abruptly collars Pinocchio.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Dumb enough to go to school.  If 
                        you were smart we’d be having this 
                        conversation in the Land of Play, 
                        where fun actually makes you happy.  

           Candlewick considers that for a moment, releasing Pinocchio.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Never heard of the Land of Play.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Just because you haven’t heard of 
                        it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
                                 CANDLEWICK
                        How’d you hear about it?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You hear about these places when 
                        you are a real boy.  Like myself.

           POP his nose SWELLS and GROWS.  Candlewick stares, disgusted:

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        You’re a real freak.

           Candlewick violently SHOVES Pinocchio away from him.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t know what that means and I 
                        don’t like the way you said it.

           Pinocchio removes one of his arms and slaps Candlewick across 
           the face with it.  Candlewick stares, horrified a moment, 
           then he starts SCREAMING.  And he doesn’t stop.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           Pinocchio sits on a bench next to a thoroughly rattled 
           Candlewick.  Directly across from them, sitting on their own 
           bench, are a dirty and disheveled Stefania and Franca.  Both 
           girls stare into middle-distance, pissed.  It takes a moment 
           for Stefania to notice something familiar about Pinocchio.

           As Stefania curiously cocks her head, trying to place him...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE

           Pinocchio sits opposite the HEAD MASTER, the PRIEST who 
           taught the wooden boy’s class stands behind him.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Why haven’t we seen you before?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Today’s the first day I’ve been out.

                                 PRIEST
                        Out where?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Out anywhere.
                                 HEAD MASTER
                             (trying to understand)
                        You’ve lived a sheltered life.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I was in a cage.

                                 PRIEST
                        Who put you in a cage?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        The big man who made me.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Your father put you in a cage?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Only when he goes out drinking or 
                        falls asleep.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Where’s your mother?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        He hasn’t mentioned my mother.  
                             (off their looks)
                        Should he have?

           The Priest leans to whisper in the Head Master’s ear:

                                 PRIEST
                        He’s clearly malnourished.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Doesn’t your father feed you?

           Pinocchio stares, not sure what he’s talking about.

                                 PRIEST
                             (clarifying)
                        Does he put food in your cage?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Not that I’m aware of.  Unless I 
                        was supposed to eat the cricket.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        What does your father say when you 
                        tell him you’re hungry?
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        He doesn’t like it when I talk.  He 
                        doesn’t like it when I do much of 
                        anything.  He’d be so mad if he 
                        knew I escaped.  Can you imagine?

                        HEAD MASTER
                                                         PRIEST
           No.
                                              No.

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - AFTERNOON

           The door BURSTS OPEN as a frantic Geppetto storms inside and 
           stops abruptly short.  REVERSE TO REVEAL, surrounding the 
           empty bird cage, the Priest, Head Master and a very stern 
           CARABINEER (the POLICE OFFICER of the day).  Pinocchio sits 
           at the work bench looking over an open school book.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Hi, poppa.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What are you doing out of the cage?

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        It’s true.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Who are you?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Why haven’t you told me about mom?  

           Geppetto’s head is spinning.  This has to be a dream.  Has he 
           lost his mind?  He calls out to god, God or whomever:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What is going on?

                                 PRIEST
                        You put your son in a cage.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        That’s not my son.

                                 CARABINEER
                        Whose son is he?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        He’s nobody’s son.  I carved him.  
                        Out of wood.  He’s not a real boy.  
                        He’s a wooden puppet who all of a 
                        sudden started talking and walking.   
                        So of course I put him in a cage.  
           That just hangs in the air for everyone to mull, then:

                                 HEAD MASTER
                             (to Priest)
                        Take the boy outside.  

           CAMERA FOLLOWS the Priest as he escorts Pinocchio out into:

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

           The Priest shuts the door behind him, pulls out his Bible and  
           quietly reads as Pinocchio rocks back and forth on his heels.

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - AFTERNOON

           The Head Master and the Carabineer stare at harried Geppetto.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        You don’t really think that child 
                        is a puppet you carved out of wood.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You could talk to the man I got the 
                        wood from but... he’s a tree now.

                                 CARABINEER
                        Why is he a tree now?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Fairies.  Evidently.  

           The Head Master and the Carabineer exchange a dubious look.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Fairies turned the man who gave you 
                        the block of wood that you carved 
                        your son out of into a tree?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It sounds ridiculous when you put 
                        it like that.  But yes.  And please 
                        stop referring to it as my son.

                                 CARABINEER
                        I myself have never met a fairy.  I 
                        hear you should be complimentary as 
                        they are generally cranky.  If you 
                        believe in that sort of thing.

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        I don’t.  Fairy superstition.  It’s 
                        the religion of fools.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        Go to the wood mill.  You’ll find 
                        behind Master Cherry’s over-turned 
                        work bench a tree that looks 
                        remarkably like Master Cherry.  You 
                        will also find an inconsolable 
                        woman wailing about fairies.  If 
                        you do decide to head out that way 
                        feel free to take “it” with you.

           The Head Master has had enough and snaps at Geppetto:

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Fairies have no bearing on the well 
                        being of your son.  You, sir, are 
                        unfit to be a father.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m not his father.

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - AFTERNOON

           The door OPENS and the Carabineer pulls a struggling Geppetto 
           out of the store, followed by the Head Master.  The Priest 
           closes his Bible, but Pinocchio continues to rock his heels 
           as Geppetto is led away by the Carabineer.  He doesn’t 
           understand this is bad for Geppetto, offers a cheery:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (with a little wave)
                        See you later!

                                 PRIEST
                        What about the boy?

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (calling back)
                        He’s not a real boy.

           A heavy-hearted sigh, then simply:

                                 HEAD MASTER
                        Take him to the orphanage.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A PAIR OF LARGE WOOD DOORS

           They SWING OPEN REVEALING a walled-in yard filled with DOZENS 
           AND DOZENS OF BOYS AND GIRLS, ages 6 to 16.  We are --
           EXT. ORPHANAGE - AFTERNOON

           The Priest and Pinocchio ENTER FRAME, walking through the 
           open gates of the penitentiary-like orphanage.  Once across 
           the threshold, the LARGE WOOD DOORS swing ominously SHUT.

           A moment, then Pinocchio climbs over the wall and walks away.

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - EARLY EVENING

           Still.  Dark.  Nothing but a steady, rhythmic CHIRP-CHIRP-
           CHIRP.   The door OPENS and Pinocchio ENTERS, carefree.

                                 CRICKET
                        Well...
                             (CHIRP)
                        ...well...
                             (CHIRP)
                        ...well.

           The Cricket slowly walks out of shadows for dramatic effect.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        How are you?  How is your --

                                 CRICKET
                        Shut up.  And stay shut up until 
                        you’re told to do otherwise.  Do 
                        you know where your “father” is?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Is he out drinking?

                                 CRICKET
                        He’s in jail because you told 
                        everyone he starved you in a cage.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You’re not supposed to do that?

                                 CRICKET
                        You can’t be starved in a cage.  
                        You can be inconvenienced, but not 
                        starved.  You’re not a real boy.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I am so a real boy.

           PUH-POP goes his nose, sprouting a new inch of nose.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        See how true that was.  Telling the 
                        truth helps real boys grow.
           PWUP, a full couple of inches of fresh nose now.  Pinocchio 
           stares at the Cricket who only stares back.  Then:

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        If I’m not a real boy, what am I?

                                 CRICKET
                        You’re a wooden toy.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        A wooden toy is a thing.  I’m not a 
                        thing.  I’m something else.  That 
                        is not as good as being a real boy.

           He waits for his nose to grow and is satisfied it doesn’t.

                                 CRICKET
                        You’re a something else that lived 
                        that doesn’t usually do that.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        That why my dad’s gonna give me to 
                        that girl to do horrible things with?

                                 CRICKET
                        He’s going to give you to that girl 
                        because you don’t know the 
                        difference between right and wrong.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Between what and what? 

                                 CRICKET
                        It’s very simple to understand even 
                        for a boy with a wooden head.  
                        Right is when you make life good.  
                        Wrong is when you make life bad.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (considers, then:)
                        For who?

           Before he can answer, the DOOR BURSTS OPEN behind the 
           Cricket, followed by a GIGANTIC (in scale to the Cricket) 
           BOOT HEEL coming down INTO FRAME and CRUSHING HIM SUDDENLY.

           CAMERA CLIMBS THE BOOT, LEG AND BODY TO REVEAL it belongs to 
           CANDLEWICK, who has just ENTERED, oblivious to the crushed 
           cricket under his heel.  He demands that Pinocchio:

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I’m going to the Land of Play.
           Pinocchio just stares at the spot under Candlewick’s heel.  
           After a moment, the ginger-haired lifts his boot to REVEAL 
           the TWITCHING TANGLE OF LEGS, WINGS and ANTENNAE.  

                                 CANDLEWICK (CONT’D)
                        Did I --?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        It’s okay.  I saw my pop do this.  
                        He’ll lay there like that for a 
                        little while and then he’ll get up.  

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Where is your pop?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        In jail. 

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        My pop’s always in jail.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Did you send your pop to jail, too?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        He’d kill me if I sent him to jail.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        My pop’s going to give me away to a 
                        horrible little girl.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Can’t give you away if you’re not 
                        here.  Come to the Land of Play.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What do you know about it?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Oh, I know about the Land of Play.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Since when?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Since... recently.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Who told you?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Can’t say.  It’s a secret.

           Pinocchio gasps, he knows what that means:
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I know that secret.

           Candlewick works up the courage for a big confession as the 
           CRUMPLED ANTENNAE and LEGS under his heel try to move:

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        A cat and fox were waiting for me 
                        after school, they told me about 
                        the Land of Play.  They shouldn’t 
                        be telling anybody anything, much 
                        less a secret.  But they told me.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        They told me the secret first.  The 
                        cat and the fox.  Just to be clear.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Did they tell you how to find it?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        We were interrupted.  

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        They told me how to find it.

           OFF Pinocchio’s curiosity piqued...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - EARLY EVENING

           The door SWINGS OPEN and Pinocchio and Candlewick step out.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        They said to go here.

           Candlewick produces a crudely drawn map of a village, a hill, 
           a valley, a river and the Mediterranean sea with a DIRTY 
           KITTY PAW PRINT in a meadow serving as the spot-marking X.

                                 CANDLEWICK (CONT’D)
                        From here we’ll be “whisked away to 
                        a Land of Play to do as we please 
                        with sweets to our knees.”  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        They said sweets up to our knees?!

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Also mentioned liquor and tobacco.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t know what any of those 
                        things are, but I want them all!  
                        And at knee-height or higher!

           Pinocchio and Candlewick locks arms and skip down the 
           cobblestone street with a song in their step:

                        CANDLEWICK
                                                        PINOCCHIO
           Whisked away to a Land of 
           Play to do as we please!
                                              Whisked away to a Land of 
                                              Play to do as we please!

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        With sweets up to our knees!

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        And liquor and tobacco!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. PRISON CELL - EARLY EVENING

           Twenty feet below a round, barred window, sitting on the 
           cold, stone floor is Geppetto.  Sitting across from the Toy 
           Maker, partially concealed in the shadows, is a scruffy, 
           scrawny, petty criminal in his thirties named FULVIO. 

                                 FULVIO
                        I hear you believe in Fairies.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Oh god.

                                 FULVIO
                        I believe in them, too.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It’s not that I believe in them, 
                        necessarily, but I will say I had 
                        experiences and I’m open minded.

                                 FULVIO
                        Sant Arcangelo di Bosco.  A colony 
                        tucked in the shadow of the Fairy 
                        Forest built with Fairy wood.  They 
                        didn’t know, nobody told them.  
                        Then the Fairies came.  Not just 
                        for their wood, they came for every 
                        signori, signorina and bambino.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What did the fairies do to them?
                                 FULVIO
                        No one knows.  They vanished.  Sant 
                        Arcangelo di Bosco is just another 
                        abandoned borgo overrun with trees.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        They turned the people into trees.

                                 FULVIO
                        I think they just took them.  Or 
                        ate them.  I heard it both ways.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.  Those people are trees.  

                                 FULVIO
                        That’s not how I heard the story.

           Geppetto heaves a worried sigh and decides not to argue.                    

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - NIGHT

           A FEW CRUMPLED CRICKET LEGS stick out from between the floor 
           boards.  They CRICK and POP as they unfurl from the damage 
           caused by Candlewick’s boot heel.  Two ANTENNAE dart up out 
           of the crack FEELING the air, before climbing out.

           The Cricket’s feelers are suddenly ILLUMINATED by a 
           fluttering SHAFT OF BLUE LIGHT emanating from the keyhole.  
           The Cricket darts between warped and ruddy floor boards.

           The FLUTTERING BLUE LIGHT passes through the keyhole and into 
           the room, followed by two more similarly fluttering BLUE 
           LUMINESCENT BALLS.  Then DOZENS MORE.  The room is filled 
           with BLUE BALLS OF LIGHT, gliding over every surface.  

           ONE FLUTTERING BALL OF LIGHT -- within each are FAIRIES, 
           tiny, beautiful insect-winged women, three inches in length --
           finds the snipped nose-branch on the work bench and hovers 
           above -- is TURQUOISE.  The FLUTTERING OF HER WINGS whipping 
           up glowing tendrils of light as the TURQUOISE FAIRY calls all 
           the other BLUE FAIRIES to her.  The OTHER FAIRIES SURROUND 
           the TURQUOISE FAIRY, turning FROM BLUE TO TURQUOISE.

           The BALLS OF TURQUOISE LIGHT COALESCE into one beautiful, 
           life-size INSECT-WINGED FAIRY.  A scattered few tiny glowing 
           spheres continue to buzz about as CLOTHO THE TURQUOISE FAIRY 
           takes shape from the dozens of tiny fairies huddled together, 
           their SILVERY BLUE WINGS becoming scale-like skin.

                                 CLOTHO
                        There was a branch here.  
           She glances around the room, at the wood floors and walls:

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the rest?  
                             (no response)
                        Wood, wood everywhere yet none of 
                        it speaks to me.  Difficult to be 
                        impressed with un-enchanted wood.

           She asks the snipped tip of Pinocchio’s nose:

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        Where is the rest of you?

           There’s a FLUTTERING across the room as a TINY FAIRY inside 
           LUMINESCENT BALL fusses over the work bench.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        Shavings?  

           Clotho drifts across the room as if floating through water, 
           propelled by her translucent wings.  She examines the tools 
           on Geppetto’s work bench and finds a curly cue of wood on the 
           blade of a carving knife.  A cold fury washes over her.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        I.  Could just.  Spit.  

           The floors and ceiling and walls -- essentially every wood 
           surface -- begins to DARKEN and SPROUT BLACK LEAVES.

           ON THE CRICKET

           He hides between the ruddy floor boards, accidentally 
           CHIRPING his poor, bent wings as he watches the WOOD GO BLACK 
           all around him.  He reacts to his CHIRP, tucking his antennae 
           out of sight and crouching lower in the crack -- which glows 
           with fluttering reflective light as Clotho approaches.

           The Cricket tries to back away and finds himself entrenched 
           between floor boards and flanked by the TWO TINY, BEAUTIFUL 
           INSECT-WINGED WOMEN -- who are essentially his size.

           ON THE FLOOR

           TWO TINY, BEAUTIFUL BLUE FAIRIES haul the Cricket out from 
           the crack between floor boards.  Clotho flutters, the SWARM 
           OF FAIRIES she’s composed over SCATTER briefly and COME BACK 
           TOGETHER as she descends on the Cricket.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        I hope I’m not interrupting.
           The Cricket only CHIRPS.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t have happened to 
                        notice who shaved the shavings? 

                                 CRICKET
                        I... there’s a... let me... think.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I’d be grateful for any assistance, 
                        as you can see I’m terribly pissed. 

           The wood continues to BLACKEN AND CREEP spreading across the 
           floor from Clotho, moving toward the Cricket.

                                 CRICKET
                        The Toy Maker shaved your shavings.

                                 CLOTHO
                        To what end?  Besides his own.

           The Cricket looks over the counter at the Toy Store on the 
           other side.  Clotho’s eyes narrow, then go wide with horror.

           THE TOY STORE

           The TURQUOISE GLOW of approaching Clotho illuminates the wall 
           of TOYS.  She’s flanked by the other Fairies as they take in 
           marionettes, carved animals, dolls, even a jack in the box.  
           The TWO THREE INCH FAIRIES BUZZ their shared horror.

                                 CLOTHO
                        What horrors are these?  Puppets?  
                        Pull things?  Is that a horsey?  

                                 CRICKET
                        That is a horsey.

                                 CLOTHO
                        And what’s this?

           Two STRAGGLER FAIRIES pick up the Jack in the Box off the 
           shelf and fly it into Clotho’s waiting hand.

                                 CRICKET
                        A jack in the box.

           She the musical crank on the box.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        Jack in the box?  Sounds filthy. 
           The Jack SPRINGS from his BOX, briefly riling the fairies of 
           Clotho’s hand as she stares, unimpressed.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        Whoever did this --

                                 CRICKET
                        The Toy Maker.

                                 CLOTHO
                        -- is mocking us.  This is a 
                        mockery.  He took what was ours, is 
                        ours, and mocked us with it.

                                 CRICKET
                        He’s actually very self-centered.  
                        I’m sure it was unintentional.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        Unintentional isn’t the point.  
                        Unforgiveable is more the issue.
                             (then)
                        Loggers... carpenters... toy-
                        makers... I didn’t leave my forest 
                        to compile an enemies list.

                                 CRICKET
                        Why did you leave your forest?

                                 CLOTHO
                        To bring my forest back.  Not a 
                        splinter nor a shaving left behind.  
                             (re: shavings and nose)
                        And this is not the rest of it.

           The TINY, BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES descend on the toy shelf looking 
           for the rest of the missing fairy wood, not finding anything.

                                 CRICKET
                        The rest may have run away.

           The TINY, BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES stop -- what was that?

                                 CLOTHO
                        Run away on what?

                                 CRICKET
                        Legs.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Did the Toy Maker give it legs?

                                 CRICKET
                        I believe so, yes.
                                 CLOTHO
                        A tree isn’t meant to have legs and 
                        run.  A tree is meant to take root.

                                 CRICKET
                        I’m sure it’s not meant to do a lot 
                        of things but it’s out there some 
                        where doing them and on two legs. 

           Clotho is calm but the fairies composing her BEGIN TO STIR.

                                 CLOTHO 
                        Where’s the Toy Maker now?

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - NIGHT

           The WOOD EXTERIOR is already GROWING DARKER and SPROUTING 
           BLACK VINES AND LEAVES that creep across the windows.  And 
           then the WINDOWS EXPLODE OUTWARD IN A SHOWER OF GLASS.

           Shortly there after, the SWARM OF TINY BLUE FAIRIES (and ONE 
           TURQUOISE FAIRY) fly out the key hole of the creaking door.  
           The door finally falls REVEALING the Cricket standing in the 
           doorway watching the FAIRIES buzz away down the street.

           OFF the Cricket’s wide-eyed stare punctuated by a blink...

           EXT. ITALIAN VILLAGE - COURT YARD - NIGHT

           Candlewick and Pinocchio strut along the cobblestone streets 
           as the ITALIAN NIGHT LIFE whirls all around them.  They push 
           through the lower halves of the PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC, chatting:

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Of course I know the difference 
                        between right and wrong.  But it’s 
                        what you do with the difference.  
                        Some would say stealing is wrong.

           Pinocchio is horrified -- it hadn’t occurred to him.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Oh, no, I’ve been stealing all day.

           Pinocchio opens his coat REVEALING it’s stocked with watches, 
           jewelry, sling shots, and all a manner of buckles and toys.  

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Should I give it back?

           Candlewick quickly closes the coat and hides the evidence.
                                 CANDLEWICK
                        No, stealing is the right kind of 
                        wrong.  It didn’t feel bad, did it?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        It felt good.  I got stuff.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What’s wrong about that?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t know.  You said it was 
                        wrong.  Now I feel bad.  Why are 
                        right and wrong so confusing?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        It’s only confusing if you care.

           Then something catches Pinocchio’s little pine eyes.

           MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER 

           CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ornate, palace-inspired facade.  On 
           the MARQUIS, dramatic letters ILLUMINATING one at a time:    

           M-A-N-G-I-A-F-U-O-C-O’S M-A-R-I-O-N-E-T-T-E T-H-E-A-T-E-R.

           REVERSE TO FIND PINOCCHIO staring gob-smacked as he 
           approaches with Candlewick, who is oblivious to the theater’s 
           appeal and keeps walking, but Pinocchio pauses to take it in.

                                 CANDLEWICK 
                        Why’re you stopping?

           Almost in answer to his question, they hear a BURLY VOICE:

                                 MANGIAFUOCO’S VOICE
                        Who sir?  You sir!  Don’t be shy!  

           Pinocchio and Candlewick turn to see:

           MANGIAFUOCO, MARIONETTE THEATER DIRECTOR

           He’s a large man with a beard as black as ink and so long it 
           threatens to cover his belly.  A large whip made of snakes 
           and fox tails knotted together hangs from his belt.  He 
           stands next to a large podium shaped like a miniature 
           proscenium arch complete with velvet curtains.  Mangiafuoco 
           barks the crowd, generating excitement for tonight’s 
           performance with Elizabethan stage style bawdiness.
                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Roll up!  Roll up!  I, magnificent 
                        Mangiafuoco, the master of the Gran 
                        Teatro dei Burrattini invite you to 
                        live vicariously through my 
                        marvelous marionettes.  It is 
                        because of the power of my 
                        imagination and the limitations of 
                        your own that I can tell you the 
                        adventure on this stage tonight is 
                        the greatest story ever told.

           Pinocchio and Candlewick push their way through the crowd as 
           the podium’s VELVET CURTAINS PART TO REVEAL:

           A WOODEN MARIONETTE NAMED ROSA

           She’s beautifully carved and fashionably dressed.  Although 
           her eyes are totally lifeless and her limbs are under 
           Mangiafuoco’s control, her flirtatious smile is permanent.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO DOING ROSA
                        It’s just a simple love story.

           Candlewick abruptly turns heel and walks away.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Yuch.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                             (correcting Rosa)
                        A simple love story, Signore Rosa?  
                        This is a violent tale of survival.  

           This gets Candlewick’s attention again.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Violent?

                                 MANGIAFUOCO DOING ROSA
                             (cheerfully flirtatious)
                        Every story is a love story.  It’s 
                        only a matter of what you love and 
                        how you love it.  In this case, 
                        violently.  Tickets one lira.  

           Through the crowd of spectators and passers-by, the lifeless 
           eyes of Rosa the marionette fall on Pinocchio.  A moment, a 
           fleeting recognition of some kind, as her eyes suddenly don’t 
           look quite so lifeless, then they return to lifelessness.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Roll up! Roll up! Tickets one lira!
           As Pinocchio wonders if what happened between he and Rosa 
           just happened, a CATHOLIC GENTLEMAN, his WIFE, and FIVE 
           CHILDREN (ages four through twelve) approach waving lira.

                                 CATHOLIC GENTLEMAN
                        Seven tickets, per favore.

           Rosa’s head keeps drifting back to Pinocchio despite 
           Mangiafuoco’s best efforts to keep it on the crowd.

           Mangiafuoco snatches the lira from the Catholic Man and 
           replaces them with a fist full of theater tickets.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Blow the handsome man a kiss.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO DOING ROSA
                        I blow you a kiss.

           Mangiafuoco gives Rosa’s strings a graceful tug and the 
           marionette raises her hand to her mouth and launches a kiss 
           at the CATHOLIC GENTLEMAN in the crowd.  Then it APPEARS Rosa 
           moves completely on her own volition.  It’s subtle, but not 
           even Mangiafuoco notices Rosa blows her kiss to Pinocchio 
           instead.  Pinocchio notices, too, with a curious swoon. 

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Roll up! Roll up! Tickets one lira!

           As the Catholic Gentleman turns away, pocketing his wallet, 
           Pinocchio pick-pockets the wallet right back out again, 
           taking the cash and returning the billfold where he got it.  

           Candlewick’s mischievous smile of approval goes sour when 
           Pinocchio slaps cash on the counter:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Two tickets, per favore!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ITALIAN COAST - NIGHT

           CAMERA SOARS ACROSS CRASHING WAVES until it finds a STONE 
           PRISON built into the side of a cliff.  The FLITTERING WINGS 
           OF THE CRICKET ENTER FRAME as it flies above the sea at a 
           break-neck pace -- particularly for a desperate cricket.

           The Cricket flies as fast as he can in an effort to get ahead 
           of the SWARM OF TINY, BLUE FAIRIES (and ONE TURQUOISE FAIRY) 
           approaching the prison from land.  CAMERA SOARS OVER THE 
           CRICKET AND CONTINUES toward the prison MOVING INTO A ROUND, 
           BARRED WINDOW to find:
           INT. PRISON - CELL - NIGHT

           Twenty feet below the round, barred window, Geppetto paces as 
           his cell mate Fulvio picks his teeth in the shadows.  The 
           Cricket lands in the window sill with a weary PLIP, shakes 
           the fatigue from his wings and begins rubbing them together:

                                 CRICKET
                        CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRP!
                             (then clearer)
                        The Fairies are coming.

           Geppetto goes pale with sudden, growing anxiety.  

                                 FULVIO
                        Did that cricket just say the 
                        Fairies were coming?

           INT. PRISON - GUARD POST - NIGHT

           The familiar Carabineer who arrested Geppetto reacts as a 
           nearby WOODEN POST BLACKENS and SPROUTS VINES.  He looks up 
           as a TURQUOISE GLOW illuminates him with reflective light.

           Surrounded by a DOZEN SCATTERED MINIATURE FAIRIES, turquoise 
           Clotho floats on human-sized insect wings, towering above the 
           Carabineer, who stares at the Fairy, jaw hinged open.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Toy Maker.

                                 CARABINEER
                             (voice-cracking in fear)
                        Last cell.  End of the hall.

           INT. PRISON - CELL - NIGHT

           Geppetto climbs the twenty foot stone wall finding the 
           smallest foot and hand holds in the decaying mortar as Fulvio 
           cranes his head against the barred cell door, trying to get a 
           glance down the length of the very long corridor.  

           FULVIO’S POINT OF VIEW

           The long corridor of cells is dark... for a moment.  Then the 
           furthest reaches brightens with an EERIE TURQUOISE GLOW.
           ON GEPPETTO

           He pulls himself onto the deep stone window sill next to the 
           Cricket.  Geppetto kicks at the barred window, trying to 
           widen the bars.  Below, Fulvio has started to climb the wall.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Are you the cricket from my shop?

                                 CRICKET
                             (flattered)
                        You remembered me.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You always been able to talk?  How 
                        come you never talked to me before?

                                 CRICKET
                        You didn’t seem that interested.  
                        And I might ask you the same thing.

           The Toy Maker can’t believe he’s having this conversation.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Can everythi --  Wait.  You talked 
                        to the fairies about me didn’t you?  
                        What did you tell them?

           Cricket has lost its ability to communicate as it only says:

                                 CRICKET
                        Chirp.  Chirp-chirp.

           INT. PRISON - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

           CAMERA MOVES DOWN THE CELL BLOCK as the REFLECTIVE LIGHT from 
           CLOTHO and the SWARM OF FAIRIES that compose her (and the 
           dozen or so stragglers) cause the VARIOUS PRISONERS to shrink 
           into the recesses of their respective tanks and cower.

           INT. PRISON - CELL - NIGHT

           Fulvio dangles from the window sill as the room starts to 
           BRIGHTEN WITH THE OMINOUS TURQUOISE GLOW.  Geppetto presses 
           himself against the bars and out of sight of whatever is 
           coming through the doorway.  Fulvio whips his head around to 
           see the source standing just outside of their cell.

                                 FULVIO
                             (”holy shit”)
                        Madonna.
           ON CLOTHO

           The DOZENS OF TINY FAIRIES she’s composed of briefly scatter 
           as they FLUTTER THROUGH THE BARS to REFORM on the other side.

           ON FULVIO

           The petty criminal tries to pull himself up onto the window.  
           Geppetto reaches out to give him a helping hand and there is 
           a sudden TURQUOISE GLOW followed by a dramatic LURCH as 
           FULVIO IS VIOLENTLY TRANSFORMED INTO A TREE, cracking the 
           stone wall and window sill with his SPONTANEOUSLY UNFURLING 
           BRANCHES AND ROOTS.  The WINDOW BARS are torn from the stone 
           wall by the momentum of FULVIO’S DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION.

           ON GEPPETTO

           Unable to get out of the way, he holds onto one of Fulvio’s 
           branches as it plunges through the prison wall, stretching 
           far out over the raging sea below.

           Geppetto dangles briefly before swinging his legs up and 
           wrapping them around the tree branch from which he hangs.  He 
           rights himself and starts to carefully pull himself in a 
           shimmy toward the sturdier trunk of the tree.  Then...

           CRRRRRRRRACK.  

           The stone wall of the prison -- compromised by Fulvio’s wily 
           root system -- begins to crack, tipping the branch partially 
           through the crumbling window sill.  Geppetto scrambles up the 
           tipping tree trunk coming face to face with:

           CLOTHO

           She hovers on the other side of the window, inside the cell.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Hello.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Hello.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I was just smiting somebody.  I 
                        didn’t see where you came from.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I happened to be plummeting from up 
                        there somewhere.  Higher than this.
                                 CLOTHO
                        How fortuitous.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        The fortuitous-ness is all mine.  
                        What an honor it is to be in the 
                        presence of such a lovely creature.

                                 CLOTHO
                        You’ll have to forgive me for being 
                        somewhat susceptible to charm.  
                        I’m mostly in the company of wood.  
                        Enchanted wood, but nevertheless.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        How could it not be enchanted in 
                        your presence?

                                 CLOTHO 
                        Now you got me suppressing giggles.

           Geppetto slips slightly and gets hand-holds in what are now 
           Fulvio’s terrified features etched into the bark.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Oh.  Oh, that’s his face.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Watch your fingers.  Such a rarity, 
                        fairy folk making appearances.  
                        Shame to leave a bad impression by 
                        turning somebody into a tree.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m sure you had your reasons.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I have a lot of them.  Punishment 
                        fitting the crime, and the such.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        His crime was tree-related?  Hard 
                        to imagine anyone doing anything to 
                        hurt a tree... I love them so much.

                                 CLOTHO
                        You do realize I am well aware that 
                        you’re the tree carving Toy Maker.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I didn’t realize that, no.
                                 CLOTHO
                        At first it was cute.  You were so 
                        bold.  And then it got annoying.  
                        Then it got a little sad.  Here you 
                        are telling lies as you cling to 
                        the remains of an innocent man - 
                        innocent in terms of this sentence.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        In my defense, I do feel bad.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I should hope so.  I feel horrible.  
                        If he were a fairy, I could turn 
                        him back.  But this is permanent.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Also in my defense, I didn’t know 
                        the wood I was carving was fairy 
                        wood or that fairy wood existed or 
                        that it was a crime to carve it.  
                        After this experience, I feel weird 
                        about carving anything anyway so 
                        I’m not planning on doing it again.  
                        If you could just find it in your 
                        heart to take your wood and go...

           Geppetto clutches the tree that was once Fulvio, his grip 
           slipping.  Clotho is absolutely without compassion.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Even if my heart were open to that, 
                        which it isn’t because, well, it 
                        just isn’t, my wood isn’t yours to 
                        wager with.  Mostly since it ran 
                        away on the legs you gave it.

           CRRRACKING and CRRRUMBLING SOUNDS.  Before either Clotho or 
           Geppetto can entirely process their severity:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Please don’t turn me into a truh --

           CRR’FWOMPF!  Geppetto plummets abruptly OUT OF FRAME along 
           with the barred window and some of the stone wall around it.

           The DOZENS OF FAIRIES comprising Clotho SWARM briefly, 
           REFORMING BACK TOGETHER at a better vantage point to see:

           GEPPETTO CLINGING TO THE TREE THAT WAS FULVIO AS IT FALLS

           Wind whistles through Fulvio’s branches and past Geppetto’s 
           ears, the CRASHING SEA RAPIDLY APPROACHING from below.  
           The Cricket climbs out of Geppetto’s pocket, spreads his 
           wings and PARACHUTES UP AND AWAY mere moments before:

           UNDER THE SEA

           SPLOOOSHHH!  Geppetto and the tree that was Fulvio PUNCH A 
           FLEETING HOLE IN THE SURF in an EXPLOSION OF BUBBLES.  
           Geppetto holds his breath as he is buffeted by the relentless 
           tide.  He reaches for something, anything and finds himself 
           caught up in Fulvio’s branches that buoy him to the surface.

           ON CLOTHO

           She FLOATS in the gaping hole in the side of the Prison, 
           surrounded by dozens of GLOWING FAIRY STRAGGLERS.  From OVER 
           CLOTHO’S SHOULDER, we can see far below Geppetto and the tree 
           that was once Fulvio BOBBING TO THE SURFACE OF THE SEA, 
           drifting toward JAGGED ROCKS.  Geppetto is very much alive.

           Clotho watches as the tree that was Fulvio JAMS INTO A 
           CLUSTER OF ROCKS allowing Geppetto to JUMP onto the rocks and 
           LEAP FROG onto another outcropping before climbing onto a 
           SEMI-POPULATED BEACH -- A DOZEN PEOPLE gathered around a camp 
           fire.  Geppetto runs to a ROW BOAT beached in the sand and 
           quickly PUSHES IT OUT TO SEA.  A MAN gives chase.

           Geppetto loses the PURSUING MAN in the surf and rows 
           furiously out to sea and away from the coast.  

           Clotho confides annoyance in the fairies that compose her:

                                 CLOTHO
                        He fled to the sea.  We shall let 
                        the sea claim him.  Stand by while I 
                        summon the terrible dogfish.

           CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLOTHO as every FAIRY WING that comprises 
           the surface of her skin BEGINS TO VIBRATE WITH A DEEP HUMMMM.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT

           CAMERA SOARS OVER THE UNDULATING WAVES toward an ISLAND with 
           a tall, distinctive mountain jutting out of its land mass.

           There’s a FLUTTERING TURQUOISE LIGHT in the distant sky 
           beyond the islands that IGNITES the horizon with a TURQUOISE 
           AURORA BOREALIS.
           The ISLAND SHAKES SUDDENLY AND VIOLENTLY.  It’s MOVING.  
           Large chunks of sand and rock and trees CRUMBLE into the 
           Mediterranean REVEALING the distinctive mountain to be a 
           GIGANTIC DORSAL FIN.  This is THE TERRIBLE DOGFISH.

           CAMERA ACCELERATES, SOARING OVER THE GIGANTIC DORSAL FIN and 
           across the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  The BOOT OF 
           ITALY appears under the DANCING LIGHTS OF AURORA BOREALIS.

           CAMERA CONTINUES ACROSS THE WAVES toward the LIGHTS OF 
           GEPPETTO’S SMALL VILLAGE on the coast, fast approaching:  

           GEPPETTO

           The Toy Maker ROWS HIS STOLEN ROW BOAT FAR AND FURIOUSLY AWAY 
           FROM THE SHORE.  He paddles TOWARD AND UNDER THE CAMERA AS IT 
           WHIPS OVERHEAD.  CAMERA CONTINUES TRAVELING DIRECTLY PAST:

           THE CRICKET

           The poor bug is flapping its wings against whipping winds of 
           the sea, desperate to catch up to the fleeing Toy Maker.

           CAMERA CONTINUES TOWARD:

           CLOTHO

           She hovers in the gaping hole of the STONE PRISON, HUMMING IN 
           SYNCHRONICITY with the VIBRATING AURORA BOREALIS above.  
           CAMERA SOARS THROUGH THE AURORA BOREALIS OVER THE STONE 
           PRISON and BEYOND.  CAMERA finally SLOWS MARGINALLY TO FIND:

           THE ITALIAN VILLAGE

           CAMERA FLIES ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS TOWARD MANGIAFUOCO’S 
           MARIONETTE THEATER.  CAMERA CONTINUES through the front 
           doors, into the lobby, through another set of doors to FIND:

           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           We are --

           INT. MARIONETTE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           The wooden boy and the organic boy sit in the back of the 
           theater, quietly squabbling as the AUDIENCE files in.
           The ORGANIST performs a solo at the rear of the theater near 
           the theater entrance under the ORCHESTRA BALCONY.  The 
           CATHOLIC GENTLEMAN, his WIFE and FIVE CHILDREN are getting 
           settled in their row and finally taking their seats. 

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Every minute in this theater is a 
                        minute not in the Land of Play.  So 
                        this better be shockingly violent.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m not here for the violence.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        You know she’s not really a real 
                        girl, don’t you?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What a thing to say about someone.  
                        You’re not really a real boy.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        You’re not really a real boy.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Am so.

           PLI-POP.  Pinocchio whips around, quickly removing his shears 
           and his sand-paper.  As he SNIPS and SANDS and SANDS, 
           Pinocchio decides to change his tactic with Candlewick:  

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        I know she’s not really a real 
                        girl.  I’m not here for her either.

           Pinocchio SANDS FASTER to fight his RAPIDLY GROWING NOSE.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        I’m here for stealing, the good kind.

           Furious sanding now.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What are you going to steal?

           Pinocchio turns, stares, blinks, then:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What do you think?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                             (shrugs)
                        Money?
                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (turning away)
                        Yes, I’m going to steal their money.

           Another big SPROUT.  Pinocchio snips it off with his SHEARS.

           A DOOR MARKED PRIVATO

           Candlewick boosts Pinocchio within reach of a TRANSOM WINDOW 
           (already ajar) above the door.  Pinocchio pulls himself up 
           and slides his body into the narrow transom opening.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        You won’t fit.

           Pinocchio ignores him, but his head is much too big to pass.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I won’t fit.

           Candlewick tries to adjust his grip as Pinocchio wiggles.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Stop fussing.

           With the weight of Pinocchio’s body pushing it down, the 
           HEAVY TRANSOM ABRUPTLY SLAMS SHUT ON PINOCCHIO’S NECK.

           SNAP!

           PINOCCHIO’S HEAD is PINCHED OFF by the HEAVY TRANSOM slamming 
           shut.  Candlewick stares at his friend’s decapitated cap 
           dropping and bouncing onto the floor, goes instantly pale and 
           FAINTS dead away in a heap in front of the door.

           The DOOR OPENS and Pinocchio’s HEADLESS SILHOUETTE appears.

           CANDLEWICK’S POINT OF VIEW - BLACK

           His BLINKING EYELIDS slowly open to REVEAL and FOCUS ON:

           PINOCCHIO

           Head back on shoulders, he gently slaps Candlewick’s cheeks 
           as he props him up against the canted metal cellar doors.

                                 CANDLEWICK (CONT’D)
                        I saw you get your head cut off.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        If you’re seeing things that aren’t 
                        really there you may have a tumor.

           Pinocchio quietly slips inside the DOOR MARKED PRIVATO.

           INT. MARIONETTE THEATER - STORAGE TUNNEL

           Pinocchio ENTERS A LONG ROOM LINED FLOOR TO CEILING WITH 
           MARIONETTES, MORE PUPPETS OVERHEAD.  Though they are made of 
           wood not flesh, it is no less creepy.  Pinocchio examines the 
           lifeless puppets.  They don’t seem to be like him at all.

           Pinocchio dons the costume of a stored marionette over his 
           school clothes, dressing in the iconographic pants and vest, 
           before continuing to investigate the recesses of the theater.

           As Pinocchio makes his way deeper into the dark, MARIONETTES 
           CREEPILY COME TO LIFE behind him, climbing down from their 
           stands CRAFTING A WEB OF CRISSCROSSING PUPPET STRINGS, 
           cutting him off from getting out the way he came in.  With 
           all the LIMBS MOVING, the marionettes have the shadow of a 
           haunting spider closing in on a hapless Pinocchio.  

           PUPPET ROOM

           Pinocchio emerges from the spider-trap tunnel of puppets into 
           an immediate access area for puppets about to go on stage.  
           He studies the marionettes hanging from varying lengths of 
           string until his eyes fall upon the one who blew him a kiss:

           ROSA

           The beautiful marionette hangs motionless on strings fixed to 
           a wooden handle propped up on a puppet stand.  Pinocchio 
           can't peel his eyes away from her, not only looking for any 
           signs of life but genuinely enjoying looking at her.

           Oblivious to the trap that’s being woven behind him, 
           Pinocchio leans close to Rosa, studying her, and whispers:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Did you blow me a kiss?

           No response.  No sign of life.  Nothing.  He keeps looking.

           A DOOR OPENS illuminating a rickety staircase behind Rosa 
           with a narrow shaft of light.  Pinocchio looks up as SOMEONE 
           STOMPS down the stairs.  Reluctantly, Pinocchio backs away 
           from Rosa and makes a dash back under the stage and into:
           A WEB OF MARIONETTE STRING

           Pinocchio YELPS as his legs get TANGLED in the string trap.  
           There’s a FLURRY OF LIMB MOVEMENT all around our wooden hero, 
           impossible to know how many and who they’re attached to.  

           Pinocchio struggles unsuccessfully and is quickly WRAPPED IN 
           PUPPET STRING, PARTIALLY COCOONED, and YANKED OUT OF FRAME.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           MANGIAFUOCO

           Large and hairy and frightening.  He strikes an intimidating 
           pose sitting opposite poor partially cocooned Pinocchio.  The 
           theater director thumbs his snake and fox tail whip.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        I was just looking for my seat.

           PLIPOP.  An INCH OF SPONTANEOUS GROWTH on Pinocchio’s face.  
           Mangiafuoco considers Pinocchio’s nose a brief moment, then 
           looms, simultaneously calm and threatening:

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        When choosing a seat, best not to 
                        sit so close.  Ruins the illusion.

           There’s a WHISPERING TITTER OF LAUGHTER coming from every 
           where.  Pinocchio glances about only seeing lifeless puppets.

                                 ROSA’S VOICE
                        What does he know about illusion?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I know about secrets.  How to keep 
                        them, who to tell, who not to tell.  
                        Nobody and everyone, in that order.

           CAMERA REVEALS ROSA as she plucks off the last of her 
           remaining puppet strings and steps down from her stand.  If 
           Pinocchio had a heart, it would have skipped a beat.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        You did blow me a kiss.

                                 ROSA
                        Tell me your secret.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m not a real boy.

           More TITTERS OF LAUGHTER, louder now, a bit more oppressive.
                                 ROSA
                        You have a bigger secret than that.

           Pinocchio nervously eyes the HALF DOZEN LIVING MARIONETTES 
           EMERGING FROM THE SHADOWS OF THE LIFELESS PUPPETS.  They’re a 
           GROUP OF BRUISERS, taped, glued and pieced back together.  
           Among the living marionettes are HARLEQUIN and PUNCH, who is 
           taping his fists and joints like a CAGE FIGHTER.  The air of 
           the room is less cute and more MARIONETTE FIGHT CLUB.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Are you like me?

                                 ROSA
                        We’re like you in that we are wood.  
                        We’re not like you in that we 
                        haven’t always been wood.  We were 
                        flesh before we were turned.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Can you tell me what I am?

                                 PUNCH
                        You don’t know?

                                 ROSA
                        You’re a little wooden dreamer of 
                        the forest.  I’ve just never seen 
                        one awake before.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        That’s sort of vague.

                                 ROSA
                        You’re a wood sprite.  You’re 
                        supposed to be wood.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t want to be a wooden boy.  I 
                        want to be a real boy.  One that 
                        can’t be given away.  

                                 PUNCH
                        Am I alone in finding it odd that a 
                        walking wood sprite tarted up like 
                        a boy has wandered into our midst?

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        I thought it was strange.

                                 HARLEQUIN
                        He’s a spy.  
                                 ROSA
                             (to Pinocchio)
                        Are you a spy?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        No.

           Rosa considers Pinocchio’s nose and its lack of growth.

                                 ROSA
                        Not a spy.  Regardless, it’s much 
                        too dangerous for us if you linger.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Why?

                                 ROSA
                        Fairies will be looking for you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           UNDER THE SEA

           The BELLY OF A ROW BOAT cuts through the waves above, OARS 
           SPLASHING on the surface, propelling it forward.  We are --

           EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT

           Geppetto rows and rows once more, before collapsing in a 
           weary heap on the floor of the boat.  He glances up at the 
           strange TURQUOISE AURORA BOREALIS hanging across the sky, 
           then realizes there is a PICNIC BASKET under his head.  

           The Toy Maker rummages through the picnic basket, finding a 
           sandwich and a bottle of wine, and looks up to see:

           THE CRICKET

           It flutters INTO FRAME and land on the picnic basket lid.  
           Geppetto isn’t terribly pleased to see the little bug.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.  You get out of here.  

           Geppetto eats and drinks hungrily as the Cricket begins 
           rubbing it’s wings together articulating:

                                 CRICKET
                        I don’t have any place else to go.  I 
                        only ever rubbed in your toy store, 
                        now there’s little left of it.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        Can you clarify “little left.”  I’m 
                        curious because it’s my home.

                                 CRICKET
                        The fairies did their part then...

                                                          QUICK POP TO:

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - NIGHT

           The VILLAGE CHILDREN are actively LOOTING, crawling through 
           the broken glass of the windows and the fallen door, pushing 
           past the other children spilling out with TOYS IN HAND.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT

           Geppetto is once again furiously rowing.  The Cricket stands 
           on its hind legs on the bench opposite him.

                                 CRICKET
                        Where are you paddling to?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I don’t know.  I’m just paddling.  
                        I’ve been traumatized.  I want to 
                        paddle someplace trees don’t grow.
                             (then)
                        Where’s Pinocchio?

                                 CRICKET
                        You’re worried about him?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.  I want to know where he is so 
                        I can be far, far away from there.

                                 CRICKET
                        He called you poppa.

           Geppetto pauses briefly in his rowing to consider that, then 
           shrugs it off and continues his stroke.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I didn’t think that was earned.  At 
                        all.  He was only around a day.  I 
                        certainly didn’t get that attached.
                                 CRICKET
                        You’re attached to all the other 
                        toys you’ve made.  You practically 
                        weep every time you sell something. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m very comfortable with my 
                        emotions when I don’t think anybody 
                        is watching.  Besides, this toy 
                        talked.  And then it talked back.  

                                 CRICKET
                        He needs a father.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I carved a wooden marionette with 
                        no intention of it coming to life.  
                        No fatherly obligation there.

                                 CRICKET
                        He’s alone.  

           The word “alone” strikes Geppetto where the Cricket intended.

                                 CRICKET (CONT’D)
                        He’s as alone as you are and he 
                        doesn’t know the difference between 
                        right and wrong.  No one taught him.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m the target of fairy assassins.  
                        I wish him well.  Am I rowing away 
                        from wherever he is currently?

                                 CRICKET
                        Yes.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Good.  What I wanted to hear.

           He continues to row two more strokes, then stops.  He stares, 
           his head slightly twitching as if shaking it “no” at the 
           notion in his head.  Then a grimace.  Then he says aloud:

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        No.  No.

           And starts rowing again, same direction.  Then stops, quickly 
           and quietly turning around so that he is rowing the opposite 
           direction back to shore... toward Pinocchio.

           There’s a small glance at the Cricket who grins and places 
           his wings together about to comment.
                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.

           Before the Cricket can respond, his gaze is drawn upward just 
           as A SHADOW FALLS OVER THE MOON.  Geppetto turns to see:

           AN ISLAND

           It LOOMS OVER the tiny row boat that bobs in its wake.  
           Geppetto holds onto the rim of the boat, steadying himself..

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Has that island always been there?

           A moment of eerie silence then Geppetto opens his mouth and --

           WHABOOM!

           The Toy Maker clutches the sides of the ROW BOAT as it is 
           PROPELLED VIOLENTLY INTO THE AIR in an EXPLOSION OF WATER.  

           ON THE CRICKET

           The bug is pressed to the bench before briefly floating off 
           of it as they reach the apex of their ascent.  Then the ROW 
           BOAT AND GEPPETTO DROP OUT OF FRAME.  

           ON GEPPETTO

           The Toy Maker glances up to see the Cricket hovering mid-air 
           as he and the ROW BOAT FALL back to the sea, toward:

           THE ISLAND

           Which appears to be REARING UP OUT OF THE SEA.  It’s GIANT 
           HEAD AND MAW breaking the surface of the water REVEALING:

           THE TERRIBLE DOGFISH

           A MEGADALON SHARK, each jagged tooth is several stories in 
           height, pokes its dogfish head out of the sea.  The breadth 
           of its gaping maw easily spans the size of a CITY BLOCK as it 
           stretches open beneath Geppetto and the PLUMMETING ROW BOAT.  

           CRR’CHUNK!

           The ROW BOAT WEDGES BETWEEN ICEBERG-SIZED MEGADALON TEETH 
           like an irksome MEGASCALE BLACKBERRY SEED.  The Dogfish’s 
           SNOUT AND JAWS THRASH coming out of the Mediterranean.
           ON GEPPETTO

           The Toy Maker is TOSSED out of his TINY ROW BOAT, flailing 
           through the air only to LAND WITH A HARD SLAP on a GARGANTUAN 
           WHITE SLAB OF SHARK TOOTH.  He slides across the surface like 
           WET SLATE, PLUNGING INTO THE SOFTER-TISSUE OF THE GUM LINE.

           He glances over the edge of the tooth to see A CAVERN OF 
           TEETH, ROWS AND ROWS, OLD ONES IN THE FRONT, NEW IN BACK.  A 
           SHADOW FALLS, then Geppetto looks up just in time to see:

           A GIGANTIC ROW OF SHARK TEETH FROM THE OPPOSING JAW

           ICEBERG STALAGMITES slicing GIANT PEARLY WHITE DEATH directly 
           toward Geppetto as the MEGADALON GNASHES ITS TEETH.  The 
           TEETH BITE as Geppetto DIVES TO AVOID THEIR SHEARING FORCE.

           The Toy Maker hangs onto the gum line as the Terrible 
           Dogfish’s TEETH CHOMP AND GRIND all around him, nearly 
           rattling him loose.  The JAWS OPEN WIDE AGAIN REVEALING:

           THE ROW BOAT

           Still wedged between two ICEBERG-SIZED TEETH, one tooth over.

           THE TOY MAKER

           He runs in a SLIPPERY MAD DASH across the tooth, legs sliding 
           out of control as he navigates the heavily enameled surface.  

           He leaps across a NARROW CHASM BETWEEN TEETH, lands and in 
           one last desperate move, DIVES FOR THE ROW BOAT.

           CLPOMPF!

           Geppetto lands in a bone-rattling heap so jarring its impact 
           KNOCKS THE ROW BOAT LOOSE FROM BETWEEN THE SHARK’S TEETH.  

           OVER THE BOW OF THE BOAT

           Geppetto watches white-knuckled as the little ship RATTLES 
           ACROSS THE ENAMEL of ONE TOOTH, SKIPPING ONTO THE NEXT TOOTH, 
           ONE AFTER ANOTHER like a TOBOGGAN.  The ROW BOAT has enough 
           momentum when it hits the next tooth to GO AIRBORN.
           ON THE CRICKET

           Its hovering in the air on rapidly beating wings, high above 
           the proceedings with Geppetto and the Terrible Dogfish, but 
           below the FLUTTERING BLUE LIGHTS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS.  The 
           Cricket watches Geppetto clinging to his row boat as it sails 
           over the giant shark’s gaping toothy maw.

           THE ROW BOAT

           It soars through the air as GIGANTIC JAWS RISE ALL AROUND.  
           The OCEAN APPEARS TO DROP OUT FROM UNDER THE ROW BOAT.  It 
           DISAPPEARS DOWN THE TERRIBLE DOGFISH’S GULLET as the shark 
           rises almost half its body length out of the water.  

           ON THE CRICKET

           The flying insect desperately tries to CLIMB HIGHER, UP AND 
           AWAY FROM THE SHARK’S LOOMING JAWS rising out of the sea as 
           Geppetto and his Row Boat disappear inside.

           CHOMP!  The Terrible Dogfish’s TEETH CLAMP SHUT merely inches 
           away from the Cricket’s hind legs as it continues upward.

           ON GEPPETTO AND THE ROW BOAT

           The SHARK’S JAGGED TEETH CLOSE OVER the MOONLIGHT as the Toy 
           Maker and his ship fall into the digestive track abyss.

           POP WIDE ON THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA

           The Terrible Dogfish’s head finally sinks beneath the surface 
           of the sea with a COLOSSAL SPLASH that laps at the beaches of 
           THE ISLAND ON ITS BACK.  A moment as the FOAM DISSIPATES IN A 
           SHIMMERING FIZZ.  Then the FLUTTERING BLUE LIGHTS of the 
           AURORA BOREALIS ABOVE FADE AWAY into a starry night.

           ORNATE VELVET CURTAINS DROP DRAMATICALLY OVER THE SCENE

           CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are --

           INT. MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

           PLUCKY, COMEDIC MUSIC KICKS from the STRING QUARTET and WINDS 
           TRIO accompanying the ORGANIST from the orchestra balcony.  
           BACK STAGE

           Behind the CYCLORAMA BACK DROP, Rosa is dolled up like a 
           HOUSEWIFE (complete with rolling pin) mid-conversation with 
           Pinocchio.  A PUPPETEER “dresses” her with strings to 
           complete her marionette illusion for the audience.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What’s the worst a fairy could do?  
                        They sound harmless.  “Fairies.”

                                 ROSA
                        Fairies will snatch you and fly you 
                        back to their forest and bury you 
                        alive.  In that living grave, you 
                        will take root and short of a stiff 
                        breeze, you will never move again. 

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’ve tried not moving.  I didn’t 
                        like it.  Not one bit.  Why me?

                                 ROSA
                        You’re why people knock wood when 
                        they knock wood as the saying goes.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Why do people wanna knock my wood?

                                 ROSA
                        To take your luck.  But it seems 
                        you’ve kept all yours.  For now.  

                                 PUNCH
                        He’ll take all of ours if he stays.

                                 ROSA
                             (to Pinocchio)
                        He was just leaving.  Never come 
                        back.  Never speak of us to anyone.

           Pinocchio stares at her.  The first time he’s met someone 
           like him and they are kicking him to the proverbial curb.  

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Wait.  How did you escape the forest?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        First thing I remember was the Toy 
                        Maker and I was already escaped.  

                                 ROSA
                        A Toy Maker saved you from the forest 
                        and tempted the wrath of fairies?
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        He did?  He did.  He’s my dad.

                                 ROSA
                        How can you not feel real when 
                        someone loves you that much?

           Pinocchio feels a pang of guilt, missing the Toy Maker.  
           Punch saunters by on his way to the stage, strings draped 
           over his arm like the long tail of a robe.

                                 PUNCH
                        Weren’t you told to leave?

           Punch shoots Pinocchio one last look as he hands his PUPPET 
           STRING HANDLE to his PUPPETEER.  The CURTAINS OPEN as Punch 
           walks onto the stage singing a jaunty little tune:

                                 PUNCH (CONT’D)
                        My name is Punchinello!  All dressed 
                        in red and yellow!  I’m such a jolly 
                        fellow!  Rootitootitooey!  
                        Rootitootitooey!  Rootitootitooeytay!

           ON PINOCHIO AND ROSA

           Punch EXITS TO THE STAGE, but we can still hear him SING O.C.  
           Rosa turns Pinocchio’s attention back to their conversation:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m not leaving until you knock on 
                        my wood for luck.

           She unceremoniously knocks head.  Pinocchio is unsatisfied.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Why did you blow me that kiss?

                                 ROSA
                        It was a stray kiss.  You got in 
                        the way.  You were lucky.

           He studies her a brief moment looking for a “tell.”  Nothing.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I was hoping you would say you 
                        liked looking at me and that it 
                        made your eyes feel good.  That’s 
                        what I’d say if you asked me.

                                 ROSA
                        I did like looking at your pine eyes. 
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m named after them.  
                             (a flirtation)
                        Since we’re so close you wouldn’t 
                        have to blow very hard if you 
                        wanted to blow another kiss.

                                 ROSA
                             (sans kiss)
                        Goodbye, Pinocchio.

           With that Rosa is WHISKED INTO THE AIR ON STRINGS by her 
           PUPPETEER.  Pinocchio watches her disappear on stage.

           INT. MARIONETTE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Pinocchio sits down next to Candlewick, who is completely 
           engrossed in what’s happening on the stage.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        We have to go.

           Candlewick notices Pinocchio is empty handed.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Where’s the money?

           EXT. MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER - TICKET WINDOW 

           MANGIAFUOCO, the theater director, is counting the MONEY from 
           the evening’s ticket sales.  Then his booth starts to glow 
           with an EERIE BLUE LIGHT.  Mangiafuoco looks up to see:

           CLOTHO

           She takes shape as the DOZENS OF FAIRIES huddle together, 
           floating outside the ticket booth window.  

           Mangiafuoco stares -- it’s both awe-inspiring and awful at 
           the same time, FAIRIES at his window with a serious smile.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I’m looking for a little wooden boy 
                        wandering around without strings.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        All the wooden boys at 
                        Mangiafuoco’s have strings. 
                                 CLOTHO
                        See anything like that without 
                        strings walking by?

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        I only see customers.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Any wooden customers?

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Not that you could tell by looking.

                                 CLOTHO
                        If I were a wooden marionette 
                        walking around on legs I shouldn’t 
                        have, I might walk those legs to 
                        the local marionette theater, and I 
                        might even take in a show.

           The VARIOUS DOZEN OR SO STRAGGLER FAIRIES surrounding Clotho 
           SQUEEZE IN so she’s all in one tight HUB OF FAIRIES, then:

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        One please.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        We don’t sell tickets after the 
                        performance has started.

           The STRAGGLER FAIRIES working so hard to SQUEEZE-IN have 
           given up, spreading out in a collective sigh of sorts.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I’d like you to consider changing 
                        your policy or at the very least 
                        making an exception this once.  

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        There aren’t any seats left.  
                        Packed house.

           Clotho stares for a cold, hard moment.  The wood floorboards, 
           beams and supports of the ticket booth begin to DARKEN all 
           around Mangiafuoco, SPROUTING BLACK VINES and LEAVES.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        If something saved your life, would 
                        you want to know what it was or 
                        would you rather live not knowing 
                        how close it all came to ending?

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        I suppose I would be curious.
                                 CLOTHO
                        Today I turned an innocent man into 
                        a tree who had done no wrongs 
                        against me, had never denied me 
                        admittance to anything.  It was a 
                        rush to judgement and I was sloppy.  
                        This benefits you because I don’t 
                        want to rush to judge you, capiche?

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Capiche.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Even though I’m not judging, I can 
                        imagine how horrible you’ll feel 
                        once you realize all I’m doing is 
                        trying to buy a ticket so I don’t 
                        have to turn you into a tree.

           A tense moment as Clotho lets that statement hang in the air 
           in hopes that it will have some impact.  Then:

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        One ticket please.

           OFF the BEAD OF SWEAT sliding down Mangiafuoco’s temple...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER - ON STAGE - NIGHT

           Under the proscenium, in a STYLIZED KITCHEN SET, Punch and 
           Rosa are “puppeteered” from above as Rosa VIOLENTLY BEATS at 
           Punch with a rolling pin.  A WOODEN CROCODILE PUPPET watches.

           The ORGAN PLAYER under scores the emotions on stage when the 
           note he’s playing HONKS to an abrupt end.  Stefania and her 
           mother, the Catholic Gentleman and his family, all the rest 
           of the audience, turn to see what caused the sour note.

           Even the BEATING stops abruptly -- with Rosa getting in one 
           last whack before both marionettes suddenly GO LIMP.

           REVERSE TO REVEAL:

           CLOTHO

           She drifts past the ORGANIST and down the aisle, VARIOUS 
           STRAGGLING FAIRIES buzzing around her.  The crowd stirs.  
           ON PINOCCHIO

           He shrinks behind Candlewick, out of Clotho’s sight.

           INCLUDE THE AUDIENCE 

           The Catholic Gentleman and his family stand to beat a hasty 
           retreat, but Clotho very clearly instructs:

                                 CLOTHO
                        Sit.  Right where you are.

           The standing members of the audience take their seats.  
           Clotho and her buzzing stragglers stop next to Stefania and 
           Madame Bucci.  The pair stare absolutely gobsmacked.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        Except you.  Move over.

           Stefania and her Mother both do as instructed as Clotho sits.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        What have I missed?

           Stefania comes out of her stare quicker than her mother:

                                 STEFANIA
                        He accidently fed their baby to a 
                        crocodile and now his wife is mad.

           Clotho blinks, not impressed.

                                 CLOTHO
                        This is what passes for 
                        entertainment?
                             (to the performers)
                        By all means.  Please.  Continue.

           The ORGANIST, STRINGS and WINDS all take up instruments and 
           hesitantly resume the now inappropriately comedic MUSIC.

           THE PUPPETEER LOFT

           A MALE PUPPETEER and a FEMALE PUPPETEER exchange glances.  
           Neither Rosa nor Punch are moving on their own accord, 
           revealing how unskilled their Puppeteers are, particularly as 
           they improvise Punch and Rosa’s GRUNTS and SCREAMS.  
           UNDER THE PROSCENIUM ARCH

           Rosa and Punch are awkwardly manipulated, their limp limbs 
           not moving nearly as precisely as before.  Rosa clumsily 
           beats at Punch, who takes the hits less enthusiastically.

           THE AUDIENCE

           Although they are terrified by the MYTHICAL CREATURE(S) in 
           the theater, they are keenly aware of the bad performance.

           Clotho studies the marionettes performing on the stage.  Her 
           eyes narrow as she watches Punch, in particular.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                             (an order)
                        The wooden boy on stage.

           SEVERAL FAIRY STRAGGLERS separate from Clotho’s body apparent 
           and drift toward the stage and the puppet performers.  

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        I have to say I’m not entirely 
                        convinced by his performance.

                                 STEFANIA
                        He was funnier before you got here.

                                 CLOTHO
                        What an interesting observation.

           The TINY BLUE INSECT-LIKE FAIRIES glide over the expression-
           less face of marionette Punch as Rosa clubs him, also gliding 
           up to inspect their hapless PUPPETEERS above the stage who 
           are doing their best to “go on with the show.”

           ON PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           Candlewick stares, jaw hanging open.  Fairies.  Pinocchio 
           watches -- there but for the grace of god go I -- as the 
           straggler fairies begin PLUCKING OFF PUNCH’S STRINGS ONE BY 
           ONE until he FALLS forward, still strung up by his legs.  
           Rosa takes a few more clumsy swings as the PUPPETEERS above 
           continue to improvise half-hearted puppet GRUNTS and SCREAMS.

           ON CLOTHO

           She locks eyes with the fallen PUNCH, who gambles a glance at 
           the fairy at the wrong split-second.  
           As the corners of Clotho’s lips creep up in a smile the WINGS 
           that comprise them and the rest of her face ERUPT IN A 
           WHIRLWIND CLOUD OF FAIRIES sweeping over the audience toward 
           the stage.

           ON STEFANIA AND MADAME BUCCI

           Stefania’s Mother PULLS HER AWAY FROM HARM as they both dive 
           out of the FAIRY SWARM’S RAGING PATH.

           ON PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           The real boy PULLS the wooden one OUT OF THE THEATER as ALL 
           HELL BREAKS LOOSE inside Mangiafuoco’s Marionette Theater.

           ON PUNCH

           He tries to flee the STORM OF FAIRIES, but is tangled in his 
           own strings still connected to his legs.  He grabs a handful 
           of his tethers in a desperate bid to free himself and YANKS -- 
           pulling his PUPPETEER over the fly rail and onto the stage.

           ON ROSA

           HIT BY PUNCH’S FALLING MALE PUPPETEER and SENT FLYING, her 
           strings are snapped and snatched out of the Female 
           Puppeteer’s hands.  Rosa lands in a jumbled pile on the 
           stage, but stays in character as a lifeless marionette.

           THE SWARM OF FAIRIES

           They ENVELOP PUNCH IN A CLOUD, dragging him through the 
           theater, pulling the terrified PUPPETEER behind him in a mad 
           slalom across the stage and into the CYCLORAMA BACKDROP.

           EXT. MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER - TICKET WINDOW

           Now sprouted in the TICKET BOOTH is a LARGE TREE with a 
           hauntingly familiar pattern in its bark reminiscent of 
           MANGIAFUOCO’S mug.  Candlewick drags Pinocchio behind him, 
           stepping over the broken glass and splintered structure of 
           what used to be the ticket window, running from the theater.

           A moment, then Candlewick returns to the ticket booth to 
           “pick” the wads of cash in the trees branches like paper 
           fruit before quickly running off once again.
           INT. MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           CHAOS.  The human members of the audience bolt in a terrified 
           panic.  The Catholic Gentleman hurries his Wife and five 
           children toward an EXIT as the FAIRIES SWARM ALL AROUND THEM.

           ON PUNCH

           TWO TINY BALLS OF FAIRY LIGHT drag the living marionette 
           toward the ceiling of the theater, “PUNCHING” A HOLE IN THE 
           ROOF WITH PUNCH, flying him on furious wings into the night.

           ON THE WOODEN CROCODILE

           In a panic, it dashes from the stage in an attempt to escape, 
           knocking down the STYLIZED SET KITCHEN DOOR DRESSING 
           REVEALING the HARLEQUIN MARIONETTE hiding behind it.

           THE SWARM OF FAIRIES

           They VERY QUICKLY ASSEMBLE INTO CLOTHO’S HUMAN-SIZED FORM as 
           she reacts incredulously to another LIVING WOOD MARIONETTE:

                                 CLOTHO
                        It’s a nest.  Get them all.

           She ERUPTS INTO THE SWARM OF FAIRIES, attacking HARLEQUIN and 
           the CROCODILE MARIONETTE.  FAIRIES swarm through and around 
           the CYCLORAMA, dragging LIVING MARIONETTES from BACK STAGE.

           ON MADAME BUCCI

           She reaches through the BLINDING SWARM OF FAIRIES that are 
           SWIRLING ALL AROUND HER, dodging ROGUE TREE LIMBS AND 
           BRANCHES, as she searching for her daughter in the PANIC THAT 
           HAS GRIPPED THE TERRIFIED AUDIENCE.

           She REACHES OUT and gets a hand on her daughter’s collar and 
           holds tight, pulling her little girl through the theater.

           EXT. MANGIAFUOCO’S MARIONETTE THEATER - NIGHT

           Madame Bucci flees the CHAOTIC SCENE, little girl in tow, as 
           ONE BY ONE, the LIVING MARIONETTES OF MANGIAFUOCO’S are 
           dragged out of the theater -- through the front doors, the 
           back doors and holes in the roof -- by FURIOUS FAIRY BALLS OF 
           LIGHT and FLOWN DEEP INTO THE NIGHT toward the FAIRY FOREST.  
           THEATER-PATRONS run for their lives.  Mangiafuoco’s WALLS 
           CRACK and SPLIT, ROOTS and BRANCHES ERUPTING through the 
           structure as ANOTHER SOMEONE inside is TRANSFORMED.  Bright 
           ARCS OF BLUE LIGHT can be seen through the ruptured walls.

           CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING the chaos has attracted a crowd 
           of DOZENS OF LOOKY-LOO VILLAGERS watching slack-jawed, 
           including the PRIEST and HEAD MASTER from Pinocchio’s school.

           CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK OVER ROOF TOPS, THROUGH SMOKE 
           STACKS, leaving the village behind until it FINDS:

           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           They are --

           EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT

           Overlooking the village from a safe distance away, they watch 
           Mangiafuoco’s Marionette Theater -- which can be identified 
           by the SWARMING BALLS OF BLUE LIGHT swirling around it.

           His mind reeling by what he just witnessed, Candlewick’s jaw 
           hangs open at the entertaining outrageousness of the evening.  

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        This is the most exciting thing 
                        that has ever happened to me.

           He slaps Pinocchio on his shoulder, turns to his friend, 
           whose eyes brim with a watery sap, and sobers slightly.

           Pinocchio finally, reluctantly, turns away from the chaos in 
           the distance that was once Mangiafuoco’s Marionette Theater.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

           A well-appointed interior.  The carriage door suddenly swings 
           open and a SMALL GIRL quickly climbs in followed by Madame 
           Bucci, both of whom are completely disheveled, body and soul.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Drive!  DriveDriveDriveDriveDrive!

           She slams the door shut as the DRIVER cracks his whip and 
           sets the horse pulling the carriage into motion.  Terrified, 
           Madame Bucci glances out the rear window to make sure they’re 
           not being followed.  She catches her breath, turns and:
                                 MADAME BUCCI (CONT’D)
                        You’re not my daughter.

           CAMERA REVEALS sitting across from Madame Bucci is NOT her 
           daughter Stefania but INSTEAD a wooden marionette named ROSA.

           OFF Madame Bucci’s confusion...

           EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT

           Pinocchio and Candlewick make their way through the tall 
           grass under a starry night and a fat moon.  Both boys are 
           shell shocked from the panic at the Marionette Theater.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Those were definitely fairies.  My 
                        pop told me all about them.  Never 
                        make a fairy mad at you.  He said 
                        if I ever come across a fairy I 
                        should just be real sweet and tell 
                        them how pretty they are.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        They were looking for somebody.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        My pop told me about this town where 
                        the fairies came and took everybody.  
                        Or ate them.  He told it both ways.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Is it because they tempted the 
                        wrath of fairies?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        They weren’t telling them they 
                        looked nice, that’s for sure.

           CAMERA REVEALS TWIN PATHS moving through the tall grass 
           toward Pinocchio and Candlewick, unbeknownst to them.  It 
           appears TWO THINGS have followed the boys from the theater.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I wanna go back to the toy store.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        We’re going to an entire Land 
                        that’s a toy store, why would you 
                        wanna go back to a regular one?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I should wait for my dad.  
                                 CANDLEWICK
                        That’s a lot of waiting.  If you’re 
                        pop spends the kind of jail time my 
                        pop spends, your time will be 
                        better spent in the Land of Play.

           The TWIN RUSTLING PATHS are almost upon them now.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        There fairies in the Land of Play?

                                 VOICE
                        They’re not allowed.

           The boys turn to see the CAT and FOX emerge from the grass:

                                 FOX
                        Fairies.  They act like they 
                        invented magic.

                                 CAT
                        They invented fairy magic.  

                                 FOX
                        Hello, boys!

                                 CAT
                        We’re rounding up stragglers. 

                                 FOX
                        Last coaches to the Land of Play 
                        are about to disembark.

           WIDE SHOT

           TWIN RUSTLING PATHS lead Pinocchio and Candlewick in a 
           running gallop through the tall grass toward:

           A CARAVAN OF DONKEY-DRAWN CARRIAGES

           BOYS and GIRLS are piling onto the carriages, climbing over 
           each other to get a seat for this glee-ticket ride.

           CAMERA RACES AHEAD OF PINOCCHIO and CANDLEWICK to find:

           THE COACHMAN

           He stands next to the pack of donkeys leading his carriage.  
           An Ice Cream Man’s grin under dark, menacing eyes.  His 
           smoking cigar casts a glowering light against his cheeks.  He 
           takes one last puff and puts the cigar out on a donkey’s ass.
           OFF the DONKEY’S BRAY...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           The CARAVAN OF DONKEY-DRAWN CARRIAGES hobbles along, nearly 
           crippled by the MASSES OF BOYS AND GIRLS piled onto each one.

           CAMERA FLIES OVER THE CARRIAGES to FIND:

           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           They’re sitting between the COACHMAN and the FOX, the CAT is 
           sitting on Candlewick’s lap, staring curiously at Pinocchio.

                                 CAT
                        Do you like being told no?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t like it at all.  

                                 CAT
                        We don’t recognize the word no in 
                        the Land of Play.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What happens in the Land of Play if 
                        someone says “no?”

                                 FOX
                        They would be misunderstood and 
                        misconstrued.

                                 CAT
                        Because the word “no” is not in the 
                        dictionary.

                                 FOX
                        More accurately, there is no 
                        dictionary in the Land of Play.

                                 CAT
                        Because looking up a word in the 
                        dictionary would not be playful.

                                 FOX
                        By definition.

           Candlewick is thrilled by that prospect, but Pinocchio is 
           distracted by the events earlier in the night.  OFF 
           Pinocchio’s worry, CAMERA FLIES UNDER THE CARRIAGE TO FIND:
           A PAIR OF STOCKING CLAD LEGS

           They run in a full sprint under a hiked up dress behind the 
           carriage, finally catching up.  CAMERA REVEALS it is:

           STEFANIA

           She pulls herself onto the rear of the carriage, determined 
           as ever, wedging herself between children who carry on.  She 
           remains inconspicuous as she follows Pinocchio, but studies 
           the PACK OF DONKEYS leading the carriage behind hers.

           ON THE DONKEYS

           Their gazes are almost human in their expressiveness.  One of 
           the donkeys makes eye contact with Stefania and BRAAAYS 
           something that sounds vaguely like “RUUUUUNNN.”  The donkey 
           in question is suddenly LASHED by the CARRIAGE DRIVER’S whip.  
           Stefania has to wonder if she heard anything at all.

           EXT. LAND OF PLAY - GATES

           The donkey-drawn CARAVAN OF CARRIAGES pulls up to a set of 
           INCREDIBLY ORNATE KING-KONG SIZE GATES.  They OPEN and the 
           over-stuffed carriages, lousy with disobedient children, 
           saunter in on wobbly wooden wheels.  

           CAMERA FOLLOWS THE CARAVAN INSIDE THE LAND OF PLAY

           The giant KING KONG SIZED GATES slowly close behind the 
           caravan.  The carriages unburden they’re soon to be over-
           stimulated cargo of dozens of boys and girls into the Land of 
           Play.  Pinocchio and Candlewick can't move from their seats, 
           staring slack-jawed, immobilized by what they see:

           Enclosed by KING KONG SIZED WALLS, an amusement park the size 
           of an entire city filled with HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN.  They 
           ride LIFE-SIZE TOY HORSES on a LIFE-SIZE HORSE RACING TRACK.  
           STEAM-PUNK DINOSAURS stomp through streets serving as public 
           transportation (imagine AT-AT WALKERS from STAR WARS, except 
           fun and non-threatening) to and fro a VARIETY OF AMUSEMENT 
           PARK RIDES from CAROUSELS and FERRIS WHEELS..  

           ON PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           Pinocchio marvels at the 10-STORY MARIONETTES SWORD-FIGHTING 
           ABOVE THE BUILDINGS, their puppet strings tethered to MASSIVE 
           DIRIGIBLES floating over the expansive playground.  
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Rosa would like it here.

           Candlewick cuts him a look and rolls his eyes.

           OVERHEAD CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY

           Pinocchio and Candlewick shrink against the Land of Play 
           courtyard, bustling with hundreds of children milling about a 
           virtual sea of amusement park attractions.

           CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL UP

           Zipping past the LEGS OF A GARGANTUAN MARIONETTE, up its 
           ENORMOUS BODY, over its GIGANTIC HEAD, along its THICK CABLE-
           LIKE STRINGS, to the DIRIGIBLES they’re attached to.

           CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL UP UNTIL IT FINDS...

           THE CRICKET

           It FLUTTERS INTO FRAME on perpetually weary wings and makes a 
           spiral descent into the Land of Play.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           They ride side by side on the LIFE-SIZE TOY HORSES around a 
           LIFE-SIZE TOY HORSE RACING TRACK.  Candlewick is whooping and 
           hollering while Pinocchio just stares into middle-distance.

           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           They ride side by side in a LARGE-SCALE TRANSPARENT HAMSTER 
           BALL resting in the scoop of a CATAPULT.  THWONG!  Candlewick 
           SCREAMS WITH EXCITEMENT while Pinocchio continues to stare 
           forlornly -- even as they are CATAPULTED out of the scoop and 
           ACROSS THE LAND OF PLAY...

           ...before being caught by ANOTHER CATAPULT SCOOP and re-
           launched the direction they came from.  Pinocchio sighs.

           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           They ride side by side in the PASSENGERS BASKETS mounted to 
           the STEAM PUNK DINOSAUR TRANSIT BUS, wedged uncomfortably 
           between a CROWD OF UNRULY BOYS AND GIRLS, everyone holding 
           FOAMING, SLOSHING, MESSY MUGS OF ROOT BEER. 

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Ever experience one of those things 
                        where you think about things?  I’m 
                        experiencing one of them right now.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Me, too.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I’ll tell you mine first and if I’m 
                        still interested, you can tell me 
                        yours.  Here’s mine.  Ready?  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Sure.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I have peaked.  I am hard pressed 
                        to think how my life could possibly 
                        get any better than this.  

           Pinocchio glances around at the ugly, unruly, sticky crowd.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Than this?  Right now?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I’ve got my best and only friend at 
                        my side.  And I’m over-stimulated 
                        so I have everything I want.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I don’t have any of the things I want.  

           Candlewick considers that a moment, then:

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I just need to finish my thought.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           PINOCCHIO AND CANDLEWICK

           They sit side by side, bellied up to a bar.  We are --
           INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

           Candlewick swills a MILK SHAKE, slamming his glass on the bar 
           top, and sucking down a HOT FUDGE SUNDAE.  Pinocchio raises 
           his spoon as if to take a bite, then throws the scoop over 
           his shoulder.  The entire Saloon is crammed with children.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        The completion of my thought is 
                        this: I don’t have to try anymore.  
                        I already had my very best day.  
                        Now I can just live life filled 
                        with sugar and milk.  Worry-free.  

           PLUP.  The Cricket lands on the bar in front of the boys.

                                 CRICKET
                        Something horrible’s happened --

           Candlewick picks up his empty root beer mug and places it 
           over the Cricket, trapping him and silencing him underneath.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I think that was for me.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I’m doing you a favor.  Who wants 
                        that message?  It just sounds like 
                        something to worry about.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        But what if it’s about one of the 
                        things I want and don’t have?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Maybe you should want what you have 
                        right now and be done with worries, 
                        goals and aspirations.  Like I am.

           Instead Pinocchio picks up the glass imprisoning the Cricket.

                                 CRICKET
                        It’s your father.  He was swallowed 
                        alive by a really big fish.

           Stefania slides into the seat next to Pinocchio, placing the 
           glass back over the poor Cricket:

                                 STEFANIA
                        I know what you are.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Why is everybody interrupting me?  
                                 STEFANIA
                        I saw you in the toy store.  Then I 
                        saw you at school.  Then I saw you 
                        at the theater.  Now here you are.  

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        He lives in the toy store.

                                 STEFANIA
                        Because he’s a toy.  I can prove it. 
                             (to Pinocchio)
                        Take off your clothes.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What a dumb thing to suggest.  Did 
                        you suggest that cause you’re dumb?

                                 STEFANIA
                        Were you not there when that swarm 
                        of fairies attacked all the 
                        marionettes at the Marionette 
                        theater and then they came alive 
                        and ran for their lives?  

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        We left when it got weird.  I 
                        didn’t know it got that weird.

                                 STEFANIA
                        They ran for their lives because 
                        they had lives to run for.

           Candlewick gives Pinocchio a slow sidelong glance.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        I knew it.  I knew it.  Well, I 
                        knew something.  You took your arm 
                        off.  Even amputees have to 
                        unbuckle some straps.  But 
                        your’s... it came right off!

                                 STEFANIA
                        It’s his signature ball joints.

           Candlewick now can’t stop staring at Pinocchio who, now that 
           the jig is up, wants to get to brass tacks:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What happened to Rosa?

                                 STEFANIA
                        The lady doll?  Fairies got her.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        But she knocked on me for luck.

                                 STEFANIA
                        Should have knocked harder.

           Stefania produces from her collar a BILL OF SALE.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What’s that?

                                 STEFANIA
                        It’s a bill of sale.  Which is 
                        another way of saying you belong to 
                        me.  You were a custom order.

           As Pinocchio wraps his mind around that, a series of dull 
           FWUMP-FWUMP-FWUMPFWUMP eruptions draw their attention 
           outside.  The ENTIRE PARLOR empties out within seconds.  

                                 STEFANIA (CONT’D)
                             (to Pinocchio)
                        Don’t go anywhere.  You’re mine.

           Candlewick and Stefania EXIT leaving Pinocchio with the 
           Cricket trapped under the overturned whiskey glass.

           EXT. LAND OF PLAY - COURTYARD - NIGHT

           CROWDS OF CHILDREN are lured out of every building and into 
           the open air where they are totally exposed.  The FWUMP-FWUMP-
           FWUMP continues above.  BOYS and GIRLS look up to see:

           AN ARRAY OF FIREWORKS

           They EXPLODE ACROSS THE SKY immediately above the Land of 
           Play in a SPECTACULAR DISPLAY OF SPARKLING COLORS.

           CANDLEWICK AND STEFANIA

           The REFLECTIVE LIGHT of the fireworks dances across the 
           awestruck faces.  Then Stefania glances down to see:

           THE FOX AND CAT

           Both animals are wearing state of the 1870s art DIVING GEAR 
           (the full-body “Captain Nemo” variety), staring back 
           nonchalantly through glass face plates.
                                 FOX
                             (tapping face plate)
                        Protective goggles.

                                 CAT
                        The fireworks, they’re so bright.  
                        They hurt our sensitive eyes.

           OFF Stefania’s furrowed brow...

           INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

           Pinocchio pulls the glass off of the Cricket, ignoring the 
           FIREWORKS lighting up the windows from the outside.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (re: bill of sale)
                        Do real boys have a bill of sale?

                                 CRICKET
                        Not usually.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I deserve every horrible thing 
                        she’s going to do to me, don’t I?  

                                 CRICKET
                        At least you know the difference 
                        between right and wrong enough to 
                        know you did everything wrong.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I met a girl.  She blew me a kiss 
                        then said she didn’t mean to but 
                        she was lying then fairies got her.
                             (then)
                        It wasn’t my fault my father got 
                        swallowed alive by a really big 
                        fish, was it?  Say it wasn’t.

                                 CRICKET
                        No, that was your fault, too.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I told you not to say that.  How 
                        can I make it right?  Can he be 
                        unswallowed?  How do we unswallow 
                        him?  Can we do that?

                                 CRICKET
                        Sometimes wrongs can’t be made 
                        right.  Sometimes the only thing 
                        you can do is feel bad about them.
           A moment as Pinocchio considers that thoughtfully, then:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        That is the stupidest thing I have 
                        ever heard.  Why would I settle for 
                        feeling bad when I could feel good?

           Slightly annoyed, Pinocchio puts the glass over the Cricket.

           EXT. LAND OF PLAY - COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Candlewick and Stefania are watching the fireworks overhead 
           when Pinocchio walks past, handing Stefania her bill of sale:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m going fishing.
                             (looks up)
                        Oooo, pretty.

           THE FIREWORKS

           The glowing embers flicker and decay into a GLITTERING DUST 
           that descends on the children below.  The boys and girls high 
           in ROLLER COASTERS and STEAM PUNK MASS TRANSIT DINOSAURS are 
           the first to get enveloped and totally obscured in the DUST 
           CLOUD.  Scattered COUGHS are followed by CRIES AND SCREAMS.  

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        That’s not good.

           ON PINOCCHIO, STEFANIA AND CANDLEWICK

           They dash across the courtyard to the nearest shelter as the 
           COUGHS and CRIES above turn into haunting, horrible BRAYS.

           INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

           The GLITTERING DUST CLOUD splashes across the surface of the 
           windows as Stefania crosses the threshold first then 
           Candlewick and Pinocchio, who slam the door behind them as 
           the dust mists their bodies before clearing the air.

           Pinocchio approaches the window as Candlewick and Stefania 
           press their faces against the glass in an attempt to see 
           what’s happening in the streets of the Land of play.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I can’t see anything.
           EXT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

           Pinocchio, Stefania and Candlewick -- trapped like fish in a 
           fish bowl -- squint their eyes to see what they can outside.

           As the HAUNTING BRAYS continue...

           CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL

           Concealed in the shadowy fog and SEEN ONLY IN SILHOUETTE, all 
           over the park, CHILDREN ARE TRANSFORMING INTO DONKEYS.  

           SHADOWY SHAPE-SHIFTING BOYS and GIRLS scramble away from MEN 
           IN CAPTAIN NEMO DIVING GEAR, moving through the crowd as if 
           they were walking on the ocean floor.  OXYGEN HOSES trail 
           behind each of the Men, leading back to an air compressor 
           feeding them air to breath as they corral and cage DONKEY 
           CHILDREN in an eerily efficient sweep.

           CAMERA FINDS THE COACHMAN, also wearing CAPTAIN NEMO DIVING 
           GEAR, and FOLLOWS HIM through the DUST CLOUD toward:

           INT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

           Pinocchio, Candlewick and Stefania duck below the rim of the 
           window sill as the NEMO DIVING GEARED COACHMAN looks inside.

           OUTSIDE - COACHMAN’S POINT OF VIEW

           Through his face plate, through the window at the seemingly 
           empty saloon, his heavy breathing bounces around the helmet 
           as he scans the interior for signs of children.

           BACK INSIDE

           The BELL above the door RING-A-LINGS as the COACHMAN opens it 
           allowing the CLOUDS OF GLIMMERING DUST to spill in all around 
           his legs like DENSE SPARKLING GROUND FOG.  

           ON THE CRICKET 

           He has the edge of the glass up enough to squeeze through, 
           but upon seeing the Coachman tromp into the saloon, he 
           quietly places the edge of the glass back on the counter.
           POP WIDE

           CAMERA FINDS Pinocchio, Candlewick and Stefania hiding behind 
           an ARCADE GAME as the environmental suited Coachman EXITS.  
           The door shuts creating SWIRLING WISPS in the SPARKLING DUST.

           Pinocchio, Candlewick and Stefania speak in hushed tones:

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What are they going to do to us?

                                 STEFANIA
                        I followed you here.  What did they 
                        say they were going to do?

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        They promised sweets to our knees.

                                 STEFANIA
                        Strangers offered you candy?  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        And liquor and tobacco.

                                 STEFANIA
                        Didn’t your mother tell you if a 
                        stranger offers you candy or money 
                        they’re trying to lure you into a 
                        child slavery ring?  These people 
                        are going to work us to death in 
                        salt mines and circuses.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        No, no, no.  They specifically said 
                        there would be no work.  Just play.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        They can’t smuggle this many kiddy 
                        slaves without someone somewhere 
                        getting some kind of suspicious.

           Stefania tries to rub the misted dust off and out of her 
           skin, she is suddenly swatted in the face by a donkey tale.  
           This naturally gets the boys’ attention.  They all glace 
           around looking for the source.  Stefania is the first to see:

                                 STEFANIA
                        Ohmygod.  That’s attached to me.

           Pinocchio and Candlewick burst out laughing.  Pinocchio feels 
           his ears and notices they are about ten inches longer than 
           how Geppetto carved them.  The boys laugh, trying to wiggle 
           ears as Stefania watches her hands TRANSFORM INTO HOOVES.
           Pinocchio and Candlewick’s laughter catches in stutter-like 
           BRAYS.  They grow suddenly somber when the teeth in their 
           mouths SWELL AND POP, doubling in size, as their JAWS 
           VIOLENTLY ELONGATE, SNAP AND RE-SET into DONKEY SNOUTS.  

           They all three stare at each other incredulously, now having 
           the very strange and surreal appearance of what we will call 
           “WERE-DONKEYS” -- upright jack-asses dressed in clothes.

           There’s a sudden, quiet FLUP-FLUP-FLUP coming from the front 
           of the arcade.  WERE-DONKEY CANDLEWICK and WERE-DONKEY 
           STEFANIA press themselves against the back of the arcade game 
           as WERE-DONKEY PINOCCHIO pokes around the corner to see:

           THE CAT

           Still wearing its ENVIRONMENTAL SUIT, it’s standing just 
           inside a SWINGING PET DOOR cut out of the much larger saloon 
           door the Coachman just used.  Another FLUP-FLUP-FLUP and the 
           Fox ENTERS, also still wearing its environmental suit.

                                 FOX
                        It’s hard to take them seriously 
                        when they’re braying like that.

           The Fox and Cat stop short when they see Were-Donkey Stefania 
           and Were-Donkey Pinocchio standing in front of them.  They 
           turn but Were-Donkey Candlewick is already blocking the door.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Whatever you did to us, un-do it.  
                        I have a really big fish to catch.

                                 CAT
                        This isn’t the kind of thing that 
                        can just be reversed.  Dusts are a 
                        very potent discipline.

                                 FOX
                        That’s not to say we don’t 
                        understand how terrifying and 
                        confusing this must be for you.  

                                 CAT
                        Your bodies changing... all that 
                        unwanted hair growth.

                                 STEFANIA
                        Puberty’s more terrifying than 
                        anything you can do.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        It is?
                                 STEFANIA
                        They’re bullies.  Just like any 
                        bully, they’re counting on us being 
                        too scared to fight back.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        What do we do?

                            FOX
                                                           CAT
           Let it happen.
                                              Just let it happen.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Fight back.

                                 CAT
                        You already made asses of yourselves.  
                        No need to compound the error.

                                 CANDLEWICK
                        Maybe we should concentrate on our 
                        own escape and less of a revolt.

                                 FOX
                        You won’t get past the coachmen.  

                                 CAT
                        Not in your current state.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Did you just tell us “no?”

           Without hesitation, Pinocchio smashes the Cat’s face plate 
           and shatters it.  The Cat MEOWS and HISSES, shrinking inside 
           its suit as the SPARKLING DUST seeps inside.  The MEOWS turn 
           to miniature BRAYS.  Were-Donkey Stefania practically swoons, 
           batting her donkey eyelashes at Pinocchio over a long sigh.

                                 FOX
                        What did you do that for?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        If we can’t change our current 
                        state, we’ll change your’s.

           With that, Pinocchio promptly SMASHES the Fox’s face plate.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. LAND OF PLAY - COURTYARD - NIGHT

           The MEN IN CAPTAIN NEMO DIVING GEAR continue through the 
           GLITTERING DUST CLOUD.  OXYGEN HOSES trail behind each of 
           them, leading back to an air compressor feeding them air.  
           FACE PLATE POINT OF VIEW

           Scanning the GLITTERING DUST CLOUD for any sign of donkey 
           children in a slow, steady panning movement until...

           DONKEY PINOCCHIO

           Darts out of the FOG WITH A JAB OF HIS HOOF, shattering the 
           face plate.  A quick GASPING SHRIEK then BLACK.

           ON ANOTHER CAPTAIN NEMO SUITED HENCHMAN

           He WHIPS a DONKEY CHILD through the THICK DUST, herding it 
           into a pack with SEVERAL OTHER DONKEY CHILDREN cowering 
           nearby in a pen.  Before the Henchman can CLOSE THE PEN GATE, 
           there’s a sudden tugging on the Henchman’s air hose.  

           The Henchman turns to see... nothing.  His air hose runs 
           along the ground until it disappears in the dense DUST CLOUD. 

           IN THE FOG

           CAMERA FINDS DONKEY STEFANIA and DONKEY CANDLEWICK getting a 
           grip on the air hose just as...

           THE NEMO SUITED HENCHMAN

           He grabs the hose and tries to shake it loose from whatever 
           it snagged on... then is YANKED VIOLENTLY INTO THE NIGHT.

           The penned up DONKEY CHILDREN cautiously approach the open 
           gate.  Pinocchio appears triumphantly out of the GLITTERING 
           DUST CLOUD, nosing the gate open to facilitate DONKEY ESCAPE.

           STEAM PUNK AIR COMPRESSOR WAGON

           A beaten down donkey pulls the wagon through the MISTY DUST.  
           Several thick AIR HOSES UNSPOOL off of the compressor like 
           tentacles, hooking into the helmets of A DOZEN HENCHMEN -- 
           who herd the terrified fresh batch of DONKEY CHILDREN.  The 
           wagon ROCKS slightly and briefly as if something came aboard.

           THE BEATEN DOWN DONKEY

           It glances at the wagon it’s pulling to see the SILHOUETTE OF 
           A WERE DONKEY climbing on top of the air compressor.
           CLOSE ON DISTRIBUTOR CAP

           DONKEY PINOCCHIO, DONKEY STEFANIA and DONKEY CANDLEWICK raise 
           their back hooves, takes aim and commences kicking at the 
           seal on the DISTRIBUTOR CAP, each taking a turn like they’re 
           driving stakes.  KLUNK-KLUNK-KLUNK-KPOP, the cap finally POPS 
           OFF.  The THICK GLITTERING DUST pours into the mouth of the 
           distributor, funneling into the HENCHMEN’S AIR HOSES.

           ON THE HENCHMAN

           CAMERA MOVES ACROSS THE FACE PLATES of SEVERAL HENCHMAN as 
           their helmets FILL WITH THE GLITTERING DUST.  They PANIC, 
           SCREAMING as their BODIES TRANSFORM inside the DIVING SUITS.

           ON THE COACHMAN

           He STEPS INTO FRAME noticing a surprising stillness in the 
           air.  Previously ubiquitous brays are conspicuously silent.  
           He hears a quick CLATTERING OF TINY HOOVES approaching 
           through the fog.  The Coachman turns to see:

           A CAT-SIZED DONKEY AND A FOX-SIZED DONKEY

           They scurry out of the GLITTERING DUST CLOUD in a panic.

                                 DONKEY FOX
                        Help!  Please!

                                 DONKEY CAT
                        Save us from the children!

           A LARGE RED BUTTON

           The Coachman slams his gloved fist down on the button.

           MULTIPLE VENTS

           All over the Land of Play -- in the streets, in the gutters, 
           in the floor boards -- VENTS OPEN and BEGIN SUCKING UP THE 
           GLITTERING DUST CLOUD that has enshrouded the entire area.

           ON THE COACHMAN

           The air finally starts to clear REVEALING HE AND DONKEY-CAT 
           and DONKEY-FOX ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY DONKEY CHILDREN.  
           Every other HENCHMAN in the park appears to have been turned 
           into the DONKEYS presently writhing inside their Nemo suits.
           The Coachman slowly removes his helmets, taking in the scale 
           of the threat, before quickly turning and RUNNING.  He 
           frantically climbs inside a CARRIAGE, pulling the door shut.

           CAMERA PULLS BACK as the CARRIAGE IS CHARGED by the THRONG OF 
           ANGRY DONKEY CHILDREN and ROCKED ONTO ITS SIDE.

           CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK OVER THE DONKEY HENCHMAN 
           trapped in the CAPTAIN NEMO gear, still connected to their 
           oxygen hoses tethering them to an air compressor.

           CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK OVER THE CHAOTIC LAND OF PLAY, 
           completely disheveled in the DONKEY RIOTS, until it FINDS:

           DONKEY PINOCCHIO AND THE CRICKET

           They are standing near and on, respectively:

           THE GIANT CATAPULT

           Several DONKEY CHILDREN push with the their heads, turning 
           the large scale scoop 180 degrees so it faces the SEA.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Which way did the big fish go?

                                 CRICKET
                        What exactly do you intend to do?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        From one end or the other, I’m 
                        getting my dad out of that fish.
                             (then)
                        Point.

                                 CRICKET
                        See that island?

           The Cricket points and the Donkey Children make a slight 
           adjustment to the catapult’s intended trajectory.

                                 CRICKET (CONT’D)
                        That’s the big fish.  

           INSIDE THE SCOOP

           Donkey Pinocchio climbs into the scoop of the catapult.  
           Donkey Stefania and Donkey Candlewick watch from the safety 
           of the KING KONG SIZED WALL the catapult is mounted on.
                                 CANDLEWICK
                             (stares, then:)
                        I hope you get what you want and 
                        not have to want what you get.
                             (then)
                        See you at school.

           Donkey Stefania nudges Donkey Candlewick aside:

                                 STEFANIA
                             (to Donkey Pinocchio)
                        I’m only letting you go because if 
                        you love something --

           PFWONG!  Before Stefania can finish, DONKEY PINOCCHIO IS 
           CATAPULTED OUT TO SEA.  Donkey Stefania, Donkey Candlewick 
           and the Cricket watch Pinocchio growing smaller and smaller 
           until he is only a spec on the distant horizon.

           UNDER THE SEA

           A moment of calm, undulating current rolling against a SCHOOL 
           OF SEA HORSES as they bob along serenely.  Then...

           SPLOOOSHHH!  DONKEY PINOCCHIO PLUNGES INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN.  
           The SEA HORSES SCATTER in the flurry of bubbles as Donkey 
           Pinocchio sinks briefly before starting a rhythmic donkey 
           paddle under the water.  Curious Sea Horses slowly gather 
           around their distant quadrupedal cousin from above the sea.

           ON DONKEY PINOCCHIO

           As he settles onto the SEA FLOOR and begins hoofing it across 
           the depths, he casually regards his legion of Sea Horse 
           admirers and their donkey-like snouts.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (distorted through water)
                        You’ve been to the Land of Play.  I 
                        just came from there.  Obviously.  

           The SEA HORSES only stare and study as Donkey Pinocchio walks 
           under a SPRAWLING SCHOOL OF TUNNY FISH.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                             (distorted through water)
                        I’m looking for a big fish that 
                        could also possibly be an island.

           A CURIOUS TUNNY FISH breaks off from the school to get a 
           closer look at Pinocchio, almost predatory as it circles.   
                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                             (distorted through water)
                        Hello.  It’s a really big fish.

           He demonstrates by holding his hooves apart but looses his 
           footing and tumbles over a low coral shelf landing on:

           SOMETHING SLICK BLACK AND ICKY

           Donkey Pinocchio is slowly sliding down what appears to be a 
           MASSIVE BLACK YOLK roughly the size of a FOOTBALL FIELD.  The 
           ENTIRE SCHOOL OF TUNNY FISH peers over the lip of low coral 
           wall Pinocchio tumbled over and are about to follow when:

           A LARGE WHITE MEMBRANE 

           Slides over the MASSIVE BLACK YOLK like MUSCULAR OIL SLICK.  
           It SLAPS into Donkey Pinocchio SQUEEGEE’S HIM ACROSS THE YOLK 
           and we realize this is A GARGANTUAN EYELID AND ITS BLINKING.

           ON PINOCCHIO

           He is summarily wiped off the BLACK YOLK, looking up to see:

           A GIGANTIC BLACK EYE STARING BACK AT HIM

           The SCHOOL OF TUNNY FISH SCRAMBLE as CAMERA POPS WIDE TO 
           REVEAL how tiny Donkey Pinocchio is when he says:

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                             (distorted through water)
                        Hello.  Is my father inside you?

           THE TERRIBLE DOGFISH

           It opens its giant mouth and the powerful current of the 
           shark's massive suck pulls donkey Pinocchio and DOZENS OF 
           FISH in a deadly slalom through ROWS AND ROWS OF HUNDREDS OF 
           GNASHING AND CHOMPING GARGANTUAN TEETH, washing him through 
           the spiracle flap-like openings of the INNER MOUTH.

           ON PINOCCHIO

           He’s caught in a TIDAL WAVE of FISH and SEA WATER washing him 
           down the TERRIBLE DOGFISH’s CAVERNOUS MOUTH toward a 
           grotesque MUSCULAR TUBE that would dwarf the Lincoln tunnel -- 
           the TERRIBLE DOGFISH’s ESOPHAGUS.  
           Pinocchio’s donkey limbs kick and flail in an attempt to swim 
           TOWARD the throat while all the terrified fish around him 
           swim away from it.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  
                        Pardon me.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.

           THE THROAT

           Pinocchio tumbles in the wet darkness of the Terrible 
           Dogfish’s throat, searching for a hoof-hold of any kind 
           before he's falling and falling in a RAIN OF FISH.

           THE STOMACH

           Donkey Pinocchio and the surrounding SHOWER OF FISH fall 
           toward GREEN GLOWING CLOUDS OF GAS erupting below like 
           fireballs in an inferno underworld.  As each of the fish hit 
           the surface of the stomach acid, they SIZZLE and SMOKE 
           emitting a bright yellow haze as they are broken down.

           PLOOSH!  Donkey Pinocchio BELLY FLOPS into the STOMACH ACID 
           LAKE and immediately starts to swim, even as it eats away at 
           the wooden boy's donkey flesh with a YELLOW SMOKING FIZZLE OF 
           TINY BUBBLES.  Donkey Pinocchio dog-paddles to an undigested 
           bowel obstruction island of SCUTTLED SEA-FARING VESSELS.  

           SCUTTLED SHIP ISLAND

           A COUNTLESS MASS OF SAILING SHIP stacked one on top of the 
           other like a pile of discarded bones in a feeding pit.

           Pinocchio climbs out of the sea of stomach acid and notices 
           it's more or less eaten away the submerged portion of his 
           donkey hide, giving him the appearance of a wooden boy 
           wearing a donkey pelt Native American style.  He summarily 
           sluffs off the donkey hide, only clad in his underwear.

                                 PINOCCHIO 
                        Hello?  Poppa?  Pop?  Dad?  If 
                        there’s something you’d rather 
                        answer to, just tell me what it is.

           He eyes the mountain of scuttled ships towering over him and 
           starts climbing.  Moving through the hole in the HULL OF ONE 
           WRECKED SHIP, he climbs the stairs onto the deck, then crawls 
           onto the MAST of the UPSIDE DOWN BOAT stacked on top of it.
           ON PINOCCHIO

           He climbs the MOUNTAIN OF SCUTTLED SHIPS -- a MILITARY 
           SCHOONER (complete with GUN CANNONS poking out of open cannon 
           doors) apparently landed on its peak -- calling out:

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        I hope this is the right big fish. 

           A CANNON BALL 

           It drops from above, SMASHING THROUGH THE DECK Pinocchio is 
           standing on, leaving a clean round hole.  He looks up:

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        You dropped something.

           SPLANK!  Another CANNON BALL SMASHES and narrowly misses 
           Pinocchio.  SPLANK!  SPLANK!  More CANNON BALLS fall from 
           above as Pinocchio makes a mad dash leaping from the deck to:

           THE SAILING MAST OF ANOTHER SCUTTLED SHIP

           Pinocchio scrambles up the pole to get a better look at his 
           unseen assailant.  An OFF-CAMERA GRUNT draws his gaze up at a 
           GHOSTLY SHAPE SWATHED in remnants from TATTERED CANVAS SAILS.  
           The GHOSTLY SHAPE has just hurled a CANNON BALL in a SPINNING 
           SLING like an oversized shot put.  The CANNON BALL arcs down 
           SMASHING into the SAILING MAST, SPLINTERING it into two.

           ON PINOCCHIO

           He holds tight riding the FALLING MAST as it plunges into the 
           side of the MILITARY SCHOONER creating a make-shift ladder 
           Pinocchio uses to climb aboard:

           THE MILITARY SCHOONER’S POOP DECK

           Pinocchio looks down at the deck below, now having the drop 
           on the GHOSTLY SHAPE -- who UNWRAPS its head to REVEAL it is:

           GEPPETTO

           He is the GHOSTLY SHAPE swathed in the tattered canvas of 
           scavenged sails.  Pinocchio brightens, thrilled to see him:

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Poppa!
           Pinocchio climbs down from the Poop Deck running toward 
           Geppetto, wrapping his arms around his legs and hugging.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I thought you were something that 
                        came out of its intestines. 

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I’m here to take you home.

           Geppetto stares at the wooden boy, trying to understand why:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You got yourself eaten by a sea 
                        monster so you could rescue me?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You rescued me from the forest.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I picked you off a wood pile.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You still picked me.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I did pick you. 

           The Toy Maker doesn’t know what to make of this living toy, 
           but is finding himself grateful that he is here with him.  He 
           takes off his jacket and wraps it around Pinocchio -- there’s 
           a sweet sense of a father putting his coat on his child.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        I’m... so proud of you.  

           The words are foreign on his lips, but not to Pinocchio.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You should be.  You made me.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Do you have a plan for how we’re 
                        getting out of here?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        No.  Do you?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.  That’s why I’m still here.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I know what we can do once we get 
                        out of here.  Now that I know the 
                        difference between right and wrong.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I don’t think we’re getting out.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        That’s a form of no.  Here’s what I 
                        think about the word no.  Nobody 
                        likes to be told no, everybody 
                        likes to say no.  And the best 
                        version of no is when you say it to 
                        somebody who said it to you first, 
                        which is saying yes to yourself.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (unconvinced)
                        Alright.  Yes to us.  What’ll we do 
                        once we get out of here?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        You’re keeping me.  We’re going to 
                        live in the toy store and we’ll 
                        open a school for donkey children.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        In this hypothetical scenario that 
                        will never come to pass because 
                        we’re both going to die here, why a 
                        school for donkey children?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Because they’ll need one.  I won’t.  
                        Because I’ll have you.  Unless you 
                        still want to give me away.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You’re mine.  I made you.

           Pinocchio smiles.  That is exactly what he wanted to hear.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        If you ate you, what would be the 
                        best way to get out of you?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I would have to upset my tummy but 
                        this thing’s tummy doesn’t strike 
                        me as being particularly sensitive.

           Pinocchio points at the ROWS OF GUN CANNONS.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What’re those?  Are those upsetting?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Would be if we could light them.

           He says as he glances at Pinocchio’s wooden features.

           CLOSE ON - PINOCCHIO’S NOSE

           It GROWS STEADILY, inches becoming feet, as a stream of lies 
           spew from his little wooden mouth:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Now that I think of it, you would 
                        be a horrible father.  Horrible.  I 
                        can’t imagine you’d put much effort 
                        into making me happy and I will 
                        very likely go out of my way to 
                        make you miserable.  This is a bad 
                        idea other ideas don’t play with.

           Geppetto stares, eyebrows raised.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Is that how you sincerely feel?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        No, my nose grows when I lie.  I 
                        was hoping to keep that from you.
                             (then)
                        Because you’re stupid and you have 
                        a face like a donkey’s --

           Geppetto SNIPS Pinocchio’s FOOT LONG NOSE off at the base 
           even as it continues to grow with his latest lies.

                                                                CUT TO:
           TWO NOSE STICKS

           Geppetto rubs them together vigorously.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        This is how the Cricket talks.

           There’s an INITIAL SPARK between his nose sticks, followed by 
           smoke.  Geppetto rubs harder and eventually there’s a FLAME.
           ON PINOCCHIO AND GEPPETTO

           Each of them hold a FLAMING WOODEN NOSE STICK like a torch.  
           They run simultaneously down the length of the ROW OF GUN 
           CANNONS, lighting the FUSES on their respective sides before 
           immediately snuffing out the flames on their nose sticks.

           A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS ON THE FUSES

           They burn toward their roots with a fzzzFzzzFZZZZ, then:

           SCUTTLED SHIP ISLAND 

           BOOM-BOOM-BBBOOM-BOOM-BOOM.  Like an explosive arterialized 
           cherry on top, the MILITARY SCHOONER FIRES ALL ITS GUNS.  
           CANNON BALLS FLY across the Terrible Dogfish’s tummy SMASHING 
           INTO STOMACH LINING that ROLL AND SHUDDER on IMPACT.

           ON PINOCCHIO AND GEPPETTO

           They react as an ABRUPT BIOLOGICAL GURGLE SHAKES THE ENTIRE 
           SCHOONER.  The mountain of scuttled ships vibrates as wood 
           planks SNAP under the Schooner’s bow.

           Geppetto and Pinocchio glance over the gunwale to see:

           A WAVE OF STOMACH FLUID

           It WASHES DRAMATICALLY across the Schooner’s bow.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Looks upset to me!

           Geppetto pulls Pinocchio inside the CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS just 
           as the WAVE SPLASHES against its ABRUPTLY CLOSING DOOR.

           SCUTTLED SHIP ISLAND

           The SEA-FARING VESSELS are finally starting to break apart.  
           The VARIOUS SHIPS beneath the MILITARY SCHOONER CRUMBLE 
           sending it sliding down their broken heaps.

           INSIDE THE CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS

           Geppetto and Pinocchio slide from one end of the room to the 
           other as the MILITARY SCHOONER rides over the wrecked ships.
           ON THE BOW OF THE MILITARY SCHOONER

           SPLASH!  The big ship hits the LAKE OF STOMACH FLUID and 
           rides the crest sailing mightily.

           POP WIDE - THE TERRIBLE DOGFISH’S STOMACH 

           The WALLS VIOLENTLY CONTRACT forcing the TUMMY CONTENTS to 
           RISE HIGHER and HIGHER toward the throat’s back door.

           ON GEPPETTO AND PINOCCHIO

           They burst out of the CAPTAIN QUARTER’S DOORS grabbing the 
           railing and surveying the direction of the ship.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I think the mouth is upstream and 
                        the... other way is down stream.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        We’re going up.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Beats the alternative.

           CLOSE ON TERRIBLE DOGFISH’S GIGANTIC CLENCHED TEETH

           They OPEN launching the STOMACH CONTENTS TOWARD CAMERA.  

           THE SCHOONER

           Propelled out of the Dogfish’s mouth on the TSUNAMI OF GREEN 
           FLUID, it lands in shallow water with a RATTLING BWOMPFSHHHH.

           We are --

           EXT. BEACH - BEAUTIFUL DAWN

           THE SCHOONER slides through the shallow surf and onto the 
           sand bank, LURCHING to a sudden halt in a beach head.

           GEPPETTO AND PINOCCHIO

           Thrown by the sudden LURCH TO A HALT, they tumble across the 
           Schooner’s deck, rolling to a stop on the ship’s pulpit.
           A thoroughly shaken Geppetto, gripping the railing for dear 
           life, looking up at the blue sky above and the rising sun, 
           lets out a brief but loud SCREAM of trauma, horror and 
           gratitude.  Off Pinocchio’s concern, Geppetto wraps his arms 
           around the wooden boy, hugging him with a reassuring:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I had to get that out.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        The scream or the hug?

           As Geppetto realizes the answer is “truthfully, a little of 
           both” and it surprises even him, he glances up to tell 
           Pinocchio but SHRIEKS instead as CAMERA REVEALS:

           CLOTHO

           The SWARM OF FAIRIES tighten her silhouette as she hovers 
           above the beach but below the ship’s bow.  Pinocchio cowers 
           behind Geppetto, genuinely terrified.  The Toy Maker is oddly 
           bolstered by Pinocchio’s hiding behind him, feeling fatherly.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Thank you.  That will be all.

           CAMERA REVEALS she is speaking to:

           THE TERRIBLE DOGFISH

           Some distance off the coast, the MEGADALON SHARK’s snout 
           disappears below the surface, leaving only the ISLAND on its 
           back visible as it drifts out to the Mediterranean Sea.

           Clotho turns her attention back to the deck of the Schooner 
           and Geppetto, who instinctively pushes Pinocchio behind him 
           as he backs toward the ANCHOR MOUNTED on the ship’s railings.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        The fish works for me.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You are truly stunning to behold.  I 
                        never get tired of looking at you.

           Then he VIOLENTLY KICKS THE RAILING, RELEASING THE ANCHOR, 
           which SWINGS DOWN IN A DEADLY ARC TOWARD CLOTHO.  In almost 
           the same motion, he pushes Pinocchio and mouths “GO.”  The 
           FAIRIES COMPOSING CLOTHO merely fly out of the anchor’s way 
           and it PLUMMETS to the beach below.
           The SWARM OF FAIRIES again tighten back into Clotho’s human 
           sized shape, shaking her head at Geppetto for his clumsy 
           attempt, then realizes Pinocchio is no longer behind him.

           She glances over to see:

           PINOCCHIO

           He’s running down the beach away from the MILITARY SCHOONER 
           dry docked in the beach head.  He glances down briefly to 
           make sure he doesn’t loose his footing only to see his FEET 
           SUDDENLY LEAVE THE GROUND.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:

           A PARTIAL SWARM OF FAIRIES

           They have picked Pinocchio off the beach and are flying him 
           back toward the MILITARY SCHOONER where PARTIAL HUMAN-SIZED 
           CLOTHO scolds Geppetto as she waits for the rest of herself.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        I wish I wasn’t obligated to turn 
                        you into a tree because I think I’d 
                        enjoy doing it out of spite.  

           The PARTIAL SWARM reconnects with the REST OF CLOTHO after 
           dropping Pinocchio on the ship’s pulpit almost as if he were 
           standing trial on a witness stand.  He more or less is.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Fine.  Turn me into a tree.  Cherry 
                        would be my preference.  Plant me 
                        some place nice and pick my fruit.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I don’t want to pick at your fruit.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Since you’re about to get yourself 
                        an entire non-fruit bearing tree, 
                        you don’t need a block of wood from 
                        the scrap pile.  Whatever it is 
                        you’re going to do to him --

                                 PINOCCHIO’S VOICE
                             (from the witness stand)
                        She’s going to bury me alive.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        Ohmygod.  Just let him go.  You 
                        could use someone telling people 
                        fairies are forgiving and generous 
                        of spirit now that everybody’s 
                        scared of you.  Scared people do 
                        scary things.  Think about it.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Honestly, who do you think you are?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m his father.  He has my eyes.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        You may call yourself his father, 
                        but we were his mother first.  And 
                        he’s not supposed to have eyes.  Or 
                        legs or use either one of them.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        But he has them now.  You can’t 
                        just take them away from him.

                                 CLOTHO
                             (then realizing)
                        Do you love him?  

           That draws Pinocchio’s particular interest from the pulpit.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I have some affection for him.

           Clotho has to consider that a moment, before continuing with:

                                 CLOTHO
                        I’m not utterly without affections.  
                        I can be touched by sentiments.
                        A lonely toy maker who loves his 
                        wooden toy is not beyond my grasp.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m not lonely.  I’m independent.

                                 CLOTHO
                        This wood doesn’t belong to you.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Why do I have to belong to anybody?

                                 CLOTHO
                        You belong to the forest.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        The forest have a bill of sale?

                                 CLOTHO
                        It doesn’t need one.  It has me.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I belong to me.  I will trade you me 
                        for him.  You get me and he gets to 
                        go home.  It’s an incredible bargain.

           Clotho has never encountered such strange resistance and has 
           to remind Pinocchio the lay of the land:

                                 CLOTHO
                        He offers himself for your freedom, 
                        then you offer yourself for his 
                        freedom and neither one of you are 
                        in the position to offer anything.
                             (then)
                        Nevertheless, I accept your terms.  

           Clotho’s ENTIRE BACKSIDE ERUPTS IN A WHIRLWIND CLOUD OF 
           FAIRIES that sweeps across PINOCCHIO as her FRONT watches.

           The Toy Maker instinctively reaches for Pinocchio, but it’s 
           too late.  He watches helplessly as the FAIRY SWARM flies 
           into the night with Pinocchio crying:

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Poppa!

           As Pinocchio is dragged into the air and flown away toward 
           the forest, Geppetto stares slack-jawed for a long beat 
           before he heaves a defeated sigh and turns to face:

           CLOTHO

           Like a spool of thread slowly unraveling, the REMAINING 
           FAIRIES COMPOSING CLOTHO’S FRONT-SIDE fly one by one into the 
           night from her BACKSIDE, trailing after the SWARM carrying 
           Pinocchio.  Her work nearly done, she considers Geppetto.

                                 CLOTHO 
                        I’m going to give you a gift.  
                        Something I’ve never gifted before.  

           Clotho’s appearance is that of a LIFE-SIZE PUZZLE missing an 
           INCREASING NUMBER OF PIECES as the individual fairies leave.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        I will take my wood and go.  
           Only a FEW OF THE FAIRIES COMPOSING CLOTHO remain.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        Spread the word.  Fairies are 
                        forgiving and generous of spirit.

           And then they are all gone, a winding trail of BEADED BLUE 
           LIGHTS trailing into the night toward the Enchanted Forest.

           Geppetto watches the BLUE LIGHTS disappear in the distance, 
           inscrutable as he considers a sum of events, then defiantly:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.  I will not spread the word.

           A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

           GALLEY DOORS swing open to the HARSH LIGHT OF DAY 
           silhouetting Geppetto in a DRAMATIC FRAME.

           LIGHT SPILLS ACROSS a TOOL RACK.

           HANDS REACH INTO FRAME and grab a SHOVEL and a PICK-AX.

           CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:

           GEPPETTO

           PICK-AX and SHOVEL strapped to his back, he’s ready to dig.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Nobody buries my boy -- my god. 

           CAMERA REVEALS Geppetto has just caught sight of a TREASURE 
           CHEST hidden in the galley overflowing with GOLD COINS.  
           Geppetto sits on the coins, running his fingers through them.  
           His mind spins as he considers this latest temptation.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Hmmm.  Mmm-mm-mm.

           He shakes off the temptation then springs to his feet, then 
           returns to fill his pockets with gold coins before EXITING.

           THE MILITARY SCHOONER ON THE BEACH 

           Geppetto shimmies down the ANCHOR CHAIN with the pick-ax and 
           the shovel, jumps into the sand, and chases after the 
           retreating FAIRIES, leaking gold coins the entire way.
           ON GEPPETTO

           He runs through a HEAVILY WOODED meadow, trying to keep up 
           and notices the METAL WHEELS of TWO BICYCLE TIRES on either 
           side of a tree -- as if the tree were riding a bike.

           He glances around at the trees immediately surrounding him.  
           Under a DENSE CANOPY OF BRANCHES AND LEAVES, CAMERA REVEALS a 
           small township tucked in the shadow of the LOOMING FAIRY 
           FOREST.  It’s completely disheveled and abandoned, totally 
           overrun with trees.  Branches and roots seemingly sprouted 
           decades ago from every wooden structure like spore tentacles 
           growing out of an old potato.  Homes and shops are wrapped in 
           bands of INTERWOVEN ROOTS like giant nautical rope.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s nice.  I’ve wandered 
                        into the scary town where they 
                        turned everybody into trees.  

           MAIN STREET

           Geppetto walks down the center of town.  Not only is the 
           street lined with trees, but the road is filled with them, as 
           well.  Trees of all shapes and sizes, some giving the 
           appearance of running, some huddled together, each possessing 
           a haunting facial recognition in their twisted barks.

           Geppetto digs through his pockets looking for a coin to toss.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Heads I keep going.  Tails I turn 
                        around.  Did I lose all my coins?  
                             (re: his empty pockets)
                        This is like having a real child.

           He steps cautiously and respectfully around the trees in the 
           street and then out of the eerie silence, a SINGLE BELL TOLL.  
           It rings briefly, almost by accident.  Geppetto looks up to 
           see the LARGE IRON BELL in a SEMI-TOPPLED STEEPLE in the 
           branches above Sant Arcangelo di Bosco’s TOWN HALL.

           INT. TOWN HALL 

           Geppetto pushes a door open and steps into an INDOOR FOREST.  
           Shafts of light pour through gaping holes in the ceiling, 
           pews and chairs hanging from high branches, the highest of 
           which supports the LARGE IRON BELL.

           Geppetto notices several of the INDOOR TREES have been cut 
           down leaving only splintered stumps.  Sitting on one is:
           MADAME BUCCI

           She’s perched stiff and hostage like on a tree stump.  Both 
           Geppetto and Madame Bucci startle at the sight of each other.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        My driver left me all alone.  He 
                        saw the living doll and ran away.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Was it a little wooden boy?  The 
                        one from my toy store?

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        No, it was a little girl.  She took 
                        me hostage.  She tried to convince 
                        me she was my daughter so I would 
                        help her.  She was being so nice I 
                        finally figured out it wasn’t her.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Help her do what?

                                 ROSA’S VOICE
                        Same thing you want to do.

           Geppetto turns as the CREAKING DOOR SLAMS SHUT REVEALING:

           ROSA

           She stands still in her dirty, disheveled costume from the 
           disastrous night of theater the evening before. 

                                 ROSA
                        Fight the blue fairies.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I don’t want to fight.  I want to 
                        be sneaky and not draw attention to 
                        myself.  Are you one of the people 
                        those fairies turned into trees?

                                 ROSA
                        Those fairies didn’t just turn 
                        people into trees.
                             (studies him)
                        You’re the Toy Maker?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m looking for a wooden boy.  Last 
                        seen flying this direction in a 
                        swarm of small blue fairies.
                                 ROSA
                        Pinocchio’s luck finally ran out.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        All you living dolls know each other?

                                 ROSA
                        I know Pinocchio.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Fairies are going to bury him alive 
                        and I’m going to dig him up again.  
                        Unless you talk me out of it.
                             (to Madame Bucci)
                        You could talk me out of it, too.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Am I being punished because my 
                        daughter is mean to dolls?

           Rosa ignores Madame Bucci, focusing on Geppetto:

                                 ROSA
                        Even if you were able to dig him up 
                        you’ll never get out of the woods.  
                        The trees will tell on you.  Unless 
                        you know how to ask them not to.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Do you know how to ask them not to?

                                 ROSA
                        It’s how I got out the first time.
                             (then)
                        Still.  The only way you’re going 
                        to save your little wooden boy is 
                        to fight fairies with fairies.

                                                                CUT TO:
           DIRT

           CAMERA MOVES UP THROUGH THE SOIL to find the gnarled tips of 
           a ROOT STRUCTURE, FOLLOWING them to their source:

           THE WOODEN CROCODILE

           Along with PUNCH and HARLEQUIN, all the living marionettes of 
           Mangiafuoco’s Marionette Theater are buried alive in the 
           fairy forest.  This is their GRAVEYARD.

           CAMERA CONTINUES UP THROUGH THE SOIL to FIND:
           EXT. FAIRY FOREST - MARIONETTE GRAVEYARD -  MORNING

           Under a SPOTLIGHT OF MORNING SUNSHINE, Clotho flutters above 
           a curious Pinocchio near a hole in the ground.  All around 
           him are the FRESH MOUNDS OF DIRT indicating the DOZENS of 
           captured marionettes and their individual GRAVES.

                                 CLOTHO
                        I don’t blame you, you know.  How 
                        could I?  You are as much a victim 
                        of this as anybody, really.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I didn’t feel like a victim til you 
                        grabbed me and flew away with me.

                                 CLOTHO
                        If we give up the tiniest sliver of 
                        the forest, our giving will never 
                        stop.  We must hold with vigilance 
                        onto every splinter.  Every sprite.  
                        Or legged mankind will take it all.  
                        I went lengths to bring you home.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        My home is the toy store.

                                 CLOTHO
                        You’re not a toy.
                             (then, cooler)
                        None of this should have happened.  
                        We are simply putting things back 
                        where they belong.  Including you.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        When I’m a tree, will my dad come 
                        and visit me in the forest?

                                 CLOTHO
                        That is very sweet, but no.  And 
                        you’ve always been a tree.  You’re 
                        just whittled down to near nothing.  
                        But in the soil you will grow...

           Frustrated, Pinocchio begins knocking on his head.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        ...what are you doing?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Knocking on myself for luck.  

           Pinocchio surveys the LIVING GRAVES of the buried Mangiafuoco 
           Marionettes, continuing to knock on himself.
                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        Which one is the lady marionette?  
                        I want to be buried next to her.

           Pinocchio lifts his foot and side steps as A TINY SPROUT 
           reaches for his leg, almost pleadingly.

                                 CLOTHO
                        All the marionettes are looking 
                        forward to spending time with you.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Can trees blow kisses?

           Clotho stares at him a moment, what a thing to ask.

                                 CLOTHO
                        You’ve had an adventure that no 
                        wood sprite in the history of 
                        forests forever has had.  It’s a 
                        wonderful time to lay your weary 
                        head to rest and go back to sleep.

           She clears a path for Pinocchio into his open living grave.

                                 CLOTHO (CONT’D)
                        In you go.

           Pinocchio feigns cooperation briefly before seizing the 
           opportunity to bolt.  He leaps onto the nearest FAIRY and 
           starts PARKOURING from one BALL OF LIGHT to the next, before 
           jumping onto a large tree and skittering up the trunk.  

           Clotho drifts up on her fluttering wings, watching the other 
           FAIRIES apprehend Pinocchio without too much trouble, 
           dropping him from the tree top into his freshly dug grave.  
           The opening in the forest floor opens a little wider before 
           CHOMPING CLOSED and swallowing Pinocchio.  

           ON CLOTHO

           The FAIRIES THAT COMPOSE HER slowly drift apart until a meek 
           voice calls out from the woods, suppressing its fear.

                                 MADAME BUCCI’S VOICE
                        Pardon me.

           Clotho turns to see MADAME BUCCI standing about twenty feet 
           away waving her arms to get Clotho’s attention.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        You’re trespassing.
           As Clotho drifts closer and closer, Madame Bucci continues:

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        No, we’ve met.  Remember?  From 
                        earlier at the theater.  You sat 
                        next to my daughter who I seem to 
                        have lost.  You wouldn’t by any 
                        chance have her, would you?  Not 
                        that I’m accusing you of anything.

           A SHOVELING NOISE gives them all pause.  They turn to see:

           GEPPETTO

           He’s calmly digging up Pinocchio’s living grave as if he 
           doesn’t have a care in the world.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        What are you doing?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m just collecting my son.  

           He throws another shovel full of dirt over his shoulder.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Stop digging.  

           He paws at the ground with the shovel, moving soil around.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I see an elbow.  I bet he’ll come 
                        out of the dirt just like a carrot.  

                                 CLOTHO
                        Some days I’d like to turn the 
                        entire human race into trees.

           Geppetto pulls Pinocchio out of the soil like said carrot.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I was right.

           Pinocchio shakes the soil from his pine eyes and wooden limbs 
           at the opportune moment to witness:

           CLOTHO

           She BLOWS A BEAD OF LIGHT ACROSS HER PALM LIKE A BULLET 
           STRIKING GEPPETTO SQUARELY IN THE CHEST, THROWING HIM ACROSS 
           THE FOREST where he lands with a sturdy FWOMPF.
                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Poppa!

           Clotho hovers there a moment waiting for a tree to 
           spontaneously grow where Geppetto landed.  Nothing happens.  
           She looks to her co-fairies for explanation and finds none.

           Clotho and the other fairies float across the forest to:

           GEPPETTO

           He groans in the underbrush, pulling open his coat to FIND 
           the SMOKING REMAINS OF ROSA which CRACK LIKE AN EGG before 
           crumbling under Geppetto’s touch.  But out of that silvery 
           CRUMBLED CRACKED MARIONETTE SHELL rises a GREEN BALL OF 
           LIGHT, shaking off the ash with FLUTTERING WINGS REVEALING:

           ROSA IS A FAIRY

           Like the other individual fairies, she is a tiny, beautiful 
           insect-winged woman, three inches in length.  She rises out 
           of and above her marionette remains.  Sensing confrontation, 
           the INDIVIDUAL FAIRIES COMPOSING CLOTHO drift away from her 
           turning from her shade of TURQUOISE to their own BLUE HUE.

                                 CLOTHO
                        This changes a thing or two.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                             (to Rosa)
                        You’re a fairy?

                                 CLOTHO
                        A fairy who chose a village of 
                        people over her own forest.  

                                 ROSA THE GREEN FAIRY
                        I chose leniency.  You chose crazy.

                                 CLOTHO
                        Shame so much ugliness came out of 
                        one little difference of opinion.

           Rosa FLINGS A GREEN BEAD OF LIGHT at Clotho before she can 
           return the favor, but CLOTHO BREAKS INTO DOZENS OF FAIRIES.  
           The individual CLOTHO FAIRY dodges the BEAD OF LIGHT, 
           allowing it to STRIKE ANOTHER BLUE FAIRY -- it’s lower 
           extremities SWELL AND POP, SPROUTING BLUE VINES that slink 
           from its waist and clutch at the SOIL, getting a grip and 
           PULLING EXPANDING BLUE FAIRY DOWN BY ITS ROOTS.  
           A FLASH as Clotho hurls RETALIATORY BEAD OF LIGHT at Rosa, 
           who SHOOTS UP out of its path allowing a clean miss.

           ON CLOTHO

           Pieces of her FLY APART as the FAIRIES SHE IS MADE OF BREAK 
           FORMATION and go after Rosa in a WHIRLING, SPINNING FUNNEL 
           CLOUD OF DOZENS OF BLUE FAIRIES led by ONE TURQUOISE FAIRY, 
           all of whom are FIRING BEADS OF LIGHT at the GREEN ONE.

           Rosa leads the BLUE FAIRIES and ONE TURQUOISE FAIRY HIGH 
           ABOVE THE FOREST FLOOR, snaking around the TALL BRANCHES.

           While the ELECTRIC DISPLAY OF FAIRY WEAPONS FIRE continues 
           overhead through the trees, BEADS OF HOT LIGHT arcing back 
           and forth in BLUE, TURQUOISE and GREEN STREAKS, CAMERA FINDS:

           GEPPETTO AND MADAME BUCCI

           They commence digging up the FRESH LIVING GRAVES, pulling the 
           soil free of the CAPTURED MANGIAFUOCO MARIONETTES as a dazed 
           and slightly confused Pinocchio looks on.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        What are you doing?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Fighting fairies with fairies.

           Geppetto and Madame Bucci dig out PUNCH, the CROCODILE and 
           HARLEQUIN from their living graves.  They continue to dig up 
           more of Mangiafuoco’s Marionettes as ROSA FLIES THROUGH the 
           GRAVEYARD, drawing FAIRY FIRE.

           Geppetto, Madame Bucci and Pinocchio all dive for cover as 
           the BLUE FAIRIES (and ONE TURQUOISE FAIRY) FIRE BEADS OF 
           LIGHT that tear up the FOREST SOIL like artillery shells.

           ON ROSA 

           She weaves in and around the GRAVEYARD FIRING HER OWN BEADS 
           OF LIGHT at PUNCH, the CROCODILE and HARLEQUIN, REDUCING 
           THEIR MARIONETTES BODIES TO SMOKING SHELLS, which CRACK AND 
           CRUMBLE AS GREEN FAIRIES rise out of each of them in a 
           GATHERING SWARM OF GREEN FAIRIES FIGHTING the BLUE FAIRIES.
           A CLASH OF BLUE AND GREEN FAIRIES

           At the CENTER OF THE WHIRLING STORM OF FAIRIES sweeping 
           through the forest like a localized tornado, CLOTHO and ROSA 
           (both only three inches tall) ENGAGE ONE LAST TIME.

           Rosa FLINGS A BEAD OF LIGHT STRIKING CLOTHO MID-AIR.  Clotho 
           recovers from the blast, but even as she attempts to fly, her 
           lower extremities SWELL AND POP, SPROUTING TURQUOISE VINES 
           that slink from her waist and clutch at the SOIL, getting a 
           grip and PULLING CLOTHO DOWN BY HER ROOTS.  

           Her FLUTTERING WINGS HARDEN as she VIOLENTLY TRANSFORMS, arms 
           TWISTING INTO BRANCHES sprouting TURQUOISE LEAVES.  A hush 
           falls over the BUZZING BLUE FAIRIES as they watch.  Clotho’s 
           last SHRIEKING GASP as a Fairy ECHOES through the forest.

           The BLUE FAIRIES buzz around the TURQUOISE-LEAFED BRANCHES of 
           the FORMIDABLE TREE that sprang from Clotho, then fly off 
           deeper into the forest, defeated.  The FLUTTERING OF ROSA’S 
           WINGS whip up glowing tendrils of light as she calls the 
           other GREEN FAIRIES to her and they COALESCE INTO:

           ROSA THE (HUMAN-SIZE) GREEN FAIRY

           Like Clotho, she’s composed of the SWARM OF FAIRIES and bears 
           more than a passing resemblance to her marionette self.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Do I get to go home now?

                                 ROSA THE GREEN FAIRY
                        As long as you are made of wood, 
                        the forest will be your home.  I 
                        can’t let you leave like you are.  

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Then can I at least have my kiss?

           She smiles at him, offering this consolation:

                                 ROSA THE GREEN FAIRY
                        I will give you the perfect kiss.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I wasn’t expecting any other kind.

           Rosa kisses him on the forehead.  A green glow emanates 
           outward from her kiss, spreading over the surface of his 
           body.  The glow focuses into sharper streaks of green, 
           becoming veins, a nervous system and finally a heart before 
           fading under the ruddy complexion of a living, human boy. 
           Rosa’s KISS TRANSFORMED PINOCCHIO INTO A FLESH AND BLOOD BOY.

                                 PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t expecting this.

           CAMERA FINDS Geppetto, awestruck by the human Pinocchio.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You’re a real boy.

           As the magic and weight of his responsibility sinks in for 
           Geppetto, Pinocchio can’t stop touching himself.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           PINOCCHIO

           He shrugs on the jacket of his school uniform, still 
           marveling at his own fleshiness.  

           CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE NOW --

           INT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP - DAY

           The Cricket squats in the window sill rubbing his wings 
           together in a RHYTHMIC CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRP as Geppetto 
           finishes dressing Pinocchio for school.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What kind of boy do you want to be?

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Yours.

           OFF Geppetto’s smile...

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S TOY STORE/WORK SHOP

           Geppetto and now human Pinocchio, dressed in his own school 
           clothes and carrying his school books, step into the street.  

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Buon Giorno.

           CAMERA REVEALS he is speaking to MADAME BUCCI, who replies:

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Buon Giorno.

           CAMERA REVEALS she’s walking with DONKEY STEFANIA fully 
           clothed, who in turn nods her donkey head to Pinocchio.
                                 STEFANIA
                        Hi, Pinocchio.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Hello, Stefania.

           DONKEY CANDLEWICK, also fully clothed in school uniform, 
           butts Pinocchio in the seat of his pants and BRAYS.

                                 MADAME BUCCI
                        Fatherhood suits you.

           OFF Geppetto’s surprise at hearing those words...

           ...CAMERA PULLS BACK THROUGH THE COBBLESTONE STREETS and 
           CONTINUES PULLING BACK OVER ROOFTOPS FINDING THE COASTLINE 
           and eventually THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.  CAMERA CONTINUES 
           ACROSS THE UNDULATING WAVES FLYING OVER the HIGHEST SAILS of:

           A HANDSOME SCHOONER 

           The large ship rides the waves out to sea following the 
           CAMERA AS IT CONTINUES PULLING BACK TO INCLUDE:

           AN ISLAND

           It has a tall, distinctive mountain jutting out of its land 
           mass.  As the HANDSOME SCHOONER draws near, the TERRIBLE 
           DOGFISH rears its head and SWALLOWS THE BOAT IN ONE GULP.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
