           WE SEE an actual clip from the television show MASH.  

           We’re in the MASH operating room. It’s crowded with the cast:  
           ALAN ALDA (HAWKEYE), WAYNE ROGERS (TRAPPER JOHN), MCCLEAN 
           STEVENSON (HENRY BLAKE), LARRY LINVILLE (FRANK BURNS), 
           LORETTA SWIT (MAJ. HOULIHAN) plus nurses at each table.

           GARY BURGHOFF enters as RADAR, the only actor not in surgical 
           scrubs. He holds a mask to his face and carries a telegram.

                                 RADAR
                        Colonel?

                                 BLAKE
                        Yo?

                                 RADAR
                        Do you know what I found in this 
                        morning’s mail?

                                 BLAKE
                        Ah, now that’s a tough one.  Hum a 
                        few bars will you, Radar?

                                 RADAR
                        You’re going home.

                                 BLAKE
                        I’m going home?

                                 RADAR
                        You got all your points.  They’re 
                        discharging you.

                                 BLAKE
                        Discharged?

                                 RADAR
                        Tokyo, San Francisco, then home.

                                 BLAKE
                        I’m going home?  I’m discharged?  
                        I’m going home!

           The cast breaks out into ad-libbed congratulations as Blake 
           is overcome with joy on the news.  WE HEAR:

                                 LARRY (O.S.)
                        And cut!  Print it.  We’re wrapped, 
                        everyone.  See you tomorrow.

MASH SET (1974)

           SUPER:  “Los Angeles, 1974.” With actors still in surgical 
           masks, WE SEE CAST and CREW wrap for the day. LARRY GELBART, 
           45, and producer GENE REYNOLDS, 40s, watch video replay of 
           the scene as ALAN ALDA, 30s, comes over and removes his mask. 
           An EXECUTIVE, MIKE, 20s, joins them.

                                 LARRY
                        Everyone know Mike from CBS?

                                 ALDA
                        What brings you out?

                                 MIKE
                        Larry called.  About a new scene?

                                 ALDA
                        There’s a new scene?

                                 LARRY
                        Gene.  Mike’s here.

                                 ALDA
                        There’s a new scene?

           Larry ushers them off to the familiar “swamp” set, where 
           Alda’s character lives.

                                 LARRY
                        A final scene we shoot tomorrow.

           Larry hands a YELLOW LEGAL PAD with dialogue on it to Alda.  

                                 ALDA
                           (reading aloud)
                        Radar enters, telegram in hand, and 
                        says,‘I have a message. Lieutenant 
                        Colonel Henry Blake’s plane was 
                        shot down over the Sea of Japan.  
                        It spun in. There were no 
                        survivors.
                           (stunned, to Larry)
                        Jesus, Henry dies?  He dies? 

                                 MIKE
                        In a comedy?  How is that funny?

                                 ALDA
                        It’s not.  It’s brilliant.

                        We show extras getting killed every 
                        week. I want to make a point. War 
                        doesn’t always happen to some one 
                        else. Don’t tell the cast. I want 
                        it to hit them hard when we shoot.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, it will. Let me rephrase. Do we 
                        really need to end the season on a 
                        downer? 

                                 LARRY
                        Yes.

                                 ALDA
                        Yes.

                                 REYNOLDS
                        Yes.

           EXT. CBS RADFORD PARKING LOT

           Larry and Mike walk to their cars. Larry’s is a ‘74 Cadillac. 
           Mike’s is a Mercedes. Larry has the legal pad in hand.

                        Let me rephrase. Last army show on 
                        CBS was Gomer Pyle. Nobody died on 
                        Gomer Pyle.  

                                 LARRY
                        And Gomer was the only marine in 
                        America who never heard of Vietnam. 
                        The war’s on Cronkite every night 
                        for dinner.

                        Maybe people want to forget it by 
                        prime time. Let me rephrase. MASH 
                        is finally a hit. It’s what, four 
                        years since CBS canned the Smothers 
                        Brothers for this kind of thing.

                        They didn’t have our ratings.

                        Lar, it’s OK to just be funny.

           Mike takes off. In his car, Larry reads his legal pad notes.

           INSERT - YELLOW LEGAL PAD

           SUPER:  “Los Angeles, 1950.” WE HEAR a girl LAUGHING. The pad 
           has jokes scribbled on it. It’s held in a girl’s hands.

           EXT. 1950 CADILLAC

           Larry, 21, and NAOMI, 19, who reads his jokes on the pad.

                                 NAOMI
                        Larry, these are hilarious.

           At Sunset and Vine, people line up on the sidewalk at a door 
           that says “The Bob Hope Show.” At the studio gate, a guard 
           raises the gate. Larry waves to him. Naomi is star struck.

                                 GUARD
                        Hi Larry.

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh. My. God. He knows you. 

                                 LARRY
                        He is getting kind of familiar.  
                        He’s fired.

                                 NAOMI
                        No, Larry, please don’t --    

                                 LARRY
                        I kid. Writers don’t fire anyone. 
                        They get fired.

           INT. NBC STUDIOS HOLLYWOOD

           Larry escorts Naomi thru a stage door. On stage is DORIS DAY, 
           27, rehearsing. Naomi tightens up, squeezing Larry’s arm.

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh my God.  Doris Day!

           Doris stops singing to look Larry’s way. Larry is mortified. 
           JIMMY SAPHIER, 30s, the show’s producer-manager, comes over.

                                 JIMMY
                        Bob is muy unhappy with the mono.

                           (to Naomi)
                        Bobspeak:  meaning, the monologue 
                        isn’t funny, or so Bob says, and he 
                        wants a big closing joke. 

                                 JIMMY
                        And you’re still standing here. Let 
                        me find this lady a seat. Front row 
                        for VIPs. Tonight our guest star is 
                        Mr. Burt Lancaster.
                           (to Larry as she walks on)
                        Is she legal? You’re 21 now.

                                 LARRY
                        Gimme a break.

           Larry heads for the writers room and FREEZES as WE HEAR:

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        Oh my God – BURT LANCASTER!  

           Larry sees her gush over BURT LANCASTER, 36, on stage.

                                 LARRY
                        She’s twelve!

           ANGLE - BACKSTAGE

           Larry hurries past wardrobe, make-up, dressing rooms. He 
           slows at the gold-starred one with “Bob Hope” on it. A loud 
           argument is going on inside, the door half open.  CHUCK, 30s, 
           the show’s ad agency rep, leans on the desk, smoking. We get 
           GLIMPSES of BOB HOPE, 40s, agitated, pacing.

                                 CHUCK
                        Joe McCarthy jokes? Nobody cares.

                                 BOB
                        He’s making headlines every day. I 
                        went off on HUAC it didn’t hurt me.

                                 CHUCK
                        It’s OK to just be funny. Besides, 
                        you’re both Republicans.

                                 BOB
                        No, I’m a Republican.  He’s nuts. 

                                 CHUCK
                        He’s also a vindictive asshole. 
                        It’s an election year.

                        No. But he can chase sponsor money 
                        away. My agency’s seen him do it. 
                        Same money you pay your cast, crew,

           Sitting at a big table: MORT, 30s, WW II vet, always in a 
           baseball cap, junior producer; FRED, 40s, dark, the oldest 
           writer, graying hair, BLACK SUIT, sips from a flask, bandage 
           on forehead, imagine Robert Mitchum writing gags; CHET, 35, 
           proto-beatnik, Tiki shirts, green shades, always scruffy. 
           They spot Larry as he enters.

                        I dunno. Bob hates McCarthy. I like 
                        him. Kicking ass and taking names. 

                                 MORT
                        Kicking ass and making up names.

                        Bob should use my baseball stuff. 
                        World Series ends in four yesterday 
                        so Bob says he wants a today topic. 
                        Worked all night on’m. No sleep.

The PHONE 
           RINGS. Fred answers, listens, hangs up, smiling at Chet.  

                                 FRED
                        New topic. Santa Anita race track.

                                 LARRY
                        Santa Anita?  That’s so old.

                                 MORT
                        Are you gonna tell Bob?

                                 FRED
                        Nooooo.

                                 LARRY
                           (thinking)
                        Fine – my horse is so old, the bet 
                        was win, place, or live.
                           (the guys groan)
                        So old, out of the gate he tripped 
                        on his hearing aid.  

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        OH MY GAWD - BOB HOPE!

           Indeed, behind Larry, is Bob, amped-up before the show. He’s 
           looking back at Naomi. Chuck and Jimmy are there, too.

                                 BOB
                        Catch her when she faints, Jimmy.  
                        They’re never ready for me the 
                        first time.
                           (to Larry)
                        I heard the Santa Anitas.  Keepers. 
                        Freddy, fall off a bar stool again?

           The writers CRACK UP like it’s the funniest thing they ever 
           heard, even Fred. Seeing Chuck, Bob closes the door on him.  

                                 BOB
                        Lar, let’s hear’m again.

                                 LARRY
                        C’mon, I was kidding. Use those and 
                        you’ll really sound like Bob Hope.

                                 BOB
                        What’s that supposed to mean?  

           Bob gives Larry a cold look. The room goes quiet. 
                                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)

                        I just meant --

                                 BOB
                        Think I can’t sell those?  

                                 FRED
                        Nobody said that.

                                 MORT
                        Of course you could.

                        World Series. Still front page.  

                                 BOB
                        A hundred says I can sell’m. 

           Bob throws money on the table. The writers all ad-lib that 
           they’re in and shoot looks at Larry that say “thanks, a lot.”  

           INT. NBC STUDIOS CONTROL ROOM

           Larry and the writers watch Bob from the control booth. Bob 
           stands before a live radio audience that laughs LOUDLY. 

                                 BOB
                        I won’t say my horse was old, but 
                        out of the gate he tripped over his 
                        hearing aid. In fact, the bet was 
                        win, place, or live.

           After the laugh, the writers pull out money.

                                 BOB
                        Thank you! And don’t forget, my new 
                        movie Fancy Pants, with Lucille 
                        Ball, opens Friday in your town.  

           Bob soaks up applause as they go to commercial. Wardrobe runs 
           out, puts him in a 10-gallon cowboy hat and chaps as he holds 
           up his hand to the writers making the universal “money” sign.

           INT. NBC STUDIOS BACKSTAGE

           Jimmy and the writers wait. WE HEAR Bob sing “Thanks For The 
           Memory” to applause.

                                 JIMMY
                        Stay! Bob’s got a big announcement.
                                     (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)

To writers:

                                 BOB
                        Ah, they love that Bob Hope sound!

           Bob runs out and the applause level goes WAY UP.

                                 JIMMY
                        That was not the announcement.

                                 CHET
                        He wants to go double or nothing.

                                 JIMMY
                        You want to get off probation you 
                        might just listen for a change.

                                 CHET
                        It wasn’t my fault. I told you.

                                 JIMMY
                        Do I know? Was I there? You got a 
                        big mouth sometimes, Chet. Some 
                        things about Bob Hope you don’t say 
                        in front of Mrs. Bob Hope. To you I 
                        have to explain this.

           Bob runs back. Everyone circles around him. 

                                 BOB
                        Ok, big news. Got your passports?

                                 FRED
                        Shit.

                                 BOB
                           (pointedly ignoring Fred)
                        I was on the phone this afternoon 
                        with President Truman.

           Bob pauses for maximum name-dropping effect.

                                 LARRY
                        Sorry, I didn’t catch the name.

                                 BOB
                        We’re going to Korea. Biggest USO 
                        show ever. The whole band!

           The writers wear frozen smiles, except an excited Larry. 

                                 LARRY

           There’s a beat coupé next to Larry’s shiny Cadillac. Bob 
           heads for the coupé. Larry heads for the Cadillac.

                        That’s yours? What am I paying you?

           They hop in as Bob goes over numbers in his head. He finds a 
           bag of 78 records on the seat and looks them over: Dizzy 
           Gillespie, Charlie Parker. Larry puts on a bop station.

                        I’ve seen all your movies. Twice.

                                 BOB
                        So, a fan of that Bob Hope sound 
                        after all. If you live at home, 
                        what do you do when you get a girl?  

                                 LARRY
                        Hope she has an apartment. I hate 
                        motels.

                                 BOB
                           (re the giant back seat)
                        Now I know why you got a Cadillac.  
                        When I was 21 I was dancing in 
                        vaudeville and lucky to eat. Always 
                        on trains. Ever been to Altoona?  
                        Louisville? 

                                 LARRY
                        I haven’t been anywhere.

                                 BOB
                        I was gonna be the next Fred 
                        Astaire.

                                 LARRY
                        A dancer?  What happened?

                                 BOB
                        World already had a Fred Astaire.  
                        It needed a Bob Hope.

           EXT. CIRO’S NIGHTCLUB

           They pull into Ciro’s parking lot as Bob waves to fans and 
           valets rush over.

                                 VALET
                        Miss Maxwell’s almost done with the 
                        first set, Mr. Hope.

                                 BOB
                        Thanks, guys.  My wallet ...

           Bob pats his pockets for tip money. Larry tips them.

CIRO’S NIGHTCLUB

           It’s the swankiest nightclub in LA, if not the hippest. Bob 
           and Larry enter and the maître d' cozies up, ushering them to 
           the back of the big room.  

           INT. MAIN SHOWROOM

           On-stage is blonde bombshell Marilyn Maxwell, 29, singing “I 
           Didn’t Want to Do It.” Bob waves at her and she winks to him.  
           Larry soaks up the pure sex appeal and glamour.

                                 MAÎTRE D'
                           (much too loudly)
                        Would you like to wait in Miss 
                        Maxwell’s dressing room tonight?

                                 BOB
                        With all the music no one could 
                        hear you out in the parking lot.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Yeah, quiet. I want an exclusive.

           Unseen by Bob, columnist EARL WILSON, 43, has sidled up -- 
           short, squat, buzz cut, notebook in hand, wearing big thick 
           Mr. Peepers glasses befitting the author of the gossip column 
           It Happened Last Night. Bob reacts as if he just noticed a 
           centipede on his shirt.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        What was that about you in Miss 
                        Maxwell’s dressing room?

                                 BOB
                        Hah! Lar, Earl Wilson. Lar’s one of 
                        my writers, a pistol if you need 
                        jokes for the column.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Why do they call Marilyn “the other 
                        Mrs. Bob Hope?” Is that good for a 
                        guy pushing himself as America’s 
                        favorite family comic?

                                 BOB
                        Me? That’s Ozzie Nelson. I never 
                        push my family on the show. The 
                        censors are all over me.

                        True ... 

                                 BOB
                        No. Your friend Sidney Skolsky says 
                        that “other Mrs. Bob Hope” crap.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        You know I hate Sidney’s guts and 
                        he hates mine.

           Just then, Marilyn finishes to applause. Bob, Earl, Larry, 
           and the Maître d' applaud loudly for a polite second then get 
           back to business. 

                                 BOB
                        Then maybe you’d like a real scoop 
                        instead of his bullshit. 

                                 EARL WILSON
                        A real scoop. Not Marilyn starring 
                        in your next movie. Heard it last 
                        night. 
                           (re Larry)
                        You gonna have your guys sign 
                        loyalty oaths like NBC’s other 
                        shows?  Most writers are reds.

                                 BOB
                        Loyalty oaths? First, nobody on my 
                        show works for NBC. They work for 
                        me. And I don’t need any loyalty 
                        oaths. You know I’ve gone on the 
                        air against that HUAC stuff.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        People want real Americans on their 
                        shows. You’re from England, right?

                                 BOB
                        I was born in England.  I’m from 
                        Cleveland. You think Larry here’s a 
                        commie? You should see his 
                        Cadillac. I’m no red, but people 
                        gotta calm down. 

           Marilyn arrives, smiles at Larry, who kind of melts in her 
           presence.  She’s appalled to see Wilson eyeing her legs.

                                 MARILYN
                        Hiya Larry.  Looking good.

                        mentioned a scoop?

           Everybody eyes Bob, it’s on him.

                                 BOB
                        Get your pencil ready. You’re 
                        breaking this story and getting 
                        Marilyn’s reaction, too. I just got 
                        official word that I’m going to 
                        Korea for the biggest show in USO 
                        history, and I am herewith asking 
                        Miss Maxwell if she will join me on 
                        that tour.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Pretty good -- Maxie?

                                 MARILYN
                        Sure. I did USO shows in the last 
                        war, I’ll go now.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Why Korea?  MacArthur says the 
                        war’ll be over in three months.

                                 BOB
                        Then I better get there fast. Look, 
                        I go where the guys go.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Why no Doris Day? Bad blood? Huh? 
                        She a bitch?  She looks like it.

                                 BOB
                        No! She’s shooting a movie. No GI’s 
                        gonna turn down Marilyn. Perhaps 
                        you saw her striptease in Key to 
                        the City with Clark Gable?

                        (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 EARL WILSON
                        Yeah ... and Lost in a Harem. Love 
                        a live version.

           Wilson turns back to his notes as Marilyn refrains from 
           hitting him. Everyone waits on his reaction.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Ok, it beats Skolsky’s shit. Love 
                        to keep beating him.  Don’t lose my 
                        number, Bobby.

                                 BOB
                        I won’t.

                                 EARL WILSON
                        Good.  You two behave, or papa’ll 
                        hear about it.

           Wilson exits. They all exhale. 

                                 BOB
                        I did come to tell you the news.  
                        Sorry it had to be that way.

                                 MARILYN
                        I record in the morning ...

                                 BOB
                        I’m headed down to Palm Springs.  

           Just then, two autograph hounds arrive, blowing the moment.

           EXT. CIRO’S PARKING LOT

           Larry and Bob comes out and the valets scramble to get 
           Larry’s car. They see Wilson driving out, waving to them.

                                 BOB
                        Twenty-one ... you want to trade 
                        places, lemme know. Let’s hit Big 
                        Boy in Burbank. I’m starved.

           INT. GELBART HOME - NIGHT

           HARRY GELBART, 40s, sits in his living room easy chair in a 
           bathrobe reading a newspaper headlined “Truman and MacArthur 
           to Meet at Wake Island; Reds Flee North.” Another reads: 
           “Nixon Edges Douglas in Senate Poll.” Larry enters from the 
           front door. Harry speaks in a Yiddish accent.
                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                 LARRY
                        Waiting up for me?

                                 HARRY
                        It’s 10:15, Mr. Excitement.  You’re 
                        twenty-one now. You can stay out if 
                        you want.  

           Larry hands him his pay envelope, flops down on the couch.  

                                 LARRY
                        Pay day.

                                 HARRY
                        Too much.

           Harry hands it back. Larry won’t take it. Larry picks up the 
           paper, reading new car ads. Larry’s mom, FRIEDA, 40s, enters, 
           and she has the same Old World accent.

                                 HARRY
                        Look, Sinatra’s home.

                                 FRIEDA
                        The show was funny. The horse 
                        tripping over the hearing aid.

                                 HARRY
                        Funny.

                                 LARRY
                        That wasn’t a real joke.

                                 FRIEDA
                        It was as funny as a real joke.

                                 HARRY
                        What do you mean not a real joke?

                                 LARRY
                        I was making fun of Bob’s style.  

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t make trouble. Just be funny. 

           Harry swats Larry with the newspaper. Larry sees the Korea 
           headline.

                                 LARRY
                        Oh, yeah, I forgot. Can’t make 
                        Sunday dinner. I’ll be in Korea.

                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                      (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                 FRIEDA
                        Korea?  Of the Korean War, Korea?

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah. We leave Saturday. Gonna be 
                        amazing. Probably meet MacArthur. 

                                 HARRY
                        Certainly sound excited to go to a 
                        war.  Most people avoid them.

                                 LARRY
                        It’s my job? Besides, I’ll be with 
                        Bob. Nobody shoots at him except 
                        critics.  

                                 FRIEDA
                        Communists would.

                                 LARRY
                        Not if they want to work in this 
                        town.  

                                 HARRY
                        Korea. We’ll get Chinese tomorrow 
                        night. You’ll get over it. Try 
                        Tijuana, like your college friends.

                                 FRIEDA
                        Be nice. Say, ‘I appreciate the 
                        offer, but I prefer not to go to 
                        the Korean War at this time.’

                                 LARRY
                        Larry Gelbart, courteous objector.

                                 FRIEDA
                        Tell him wars aren’t funny.

                                 LARRY
                        You tell him. Nobody plays a war 
                        like Bob.

                                 HARRY
                        What are we going to do, write a 
                        note that says Larry’s excused?

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, I’m too well to attend.

           Bob, a bleary-eyed Fred, and Jimmy wait on the field near two 
           army C-54 transports. 40 cast and crew board the planes.  Bob 
           hangs out with the Hi-Hatters, an African-American dancing 
           team.  Bob shows them a move. The dancers act impressed.

           The three Hi-Hatters then do the move, all better than Bob.

           ANGLE - THE WRITERS

           Chet, Fred, Larry, and Mort all sit in a group.  Larry reads 
           Billboard and the other three play poker and talk.

                                 CHET
                        Eisenhower? America will never 
                        elect a bald President.

                                 MORT
                        Ike. The guy who beat Hitler? 

                                 CHET
                        Douglas MacArthur beat Tojo. And 
                        Big Mac don’t need a rug. And that 
                        chin. Puh-res-i-den-tial. 

                                 FRED
                        Had no idea you were so political, 
                        Chester. Oughta run for Congress.

                                 CHET
                        How’d you hear the word Congress? 
                        There a Congress liquor store?

           Fred flips him off. Mort sees what Larry’s reading.

                                 MORT
                        Ditch that. Their critic called our 
                        tv special warmed over vaudeville. 

                                 CHET
                        Seen Sid Caesar? Fun-nee.

                                 FRED
                        Need a Ph.D. to watch that guy. 
                        Bob’s show is good enough for me. 
                        Pays my bar tab, anyway.

                                 LARRY
                        Your bar tab?  I want a raise.

                                 CHET
                        Hey, I don’t blame Bob doing what 
                        he does. He invented it. But times 
                        change.

                                 LARRY
                        Invented what?   Jokes?

                        His kind of a show.

           Larry is baffled here -- shrugs. What?

                                 FRED
                        No characters, plots, situation -- 
                        just jokes. A lot of vaudeville 
                        guys tried it. Bob figured it out.

                                 LARRY
                        Figured what out?

                                 CHET
                        The no-story comedy show. Bob cold 
                        opened the monologue – which they 
                        did not want him to do.  

                                 LARRY
                        Wait.  They didn’t want the star of 
                        the show to open his own show?

                                 MORT
                        No. They thought the star should 
                        come on after the band, the 
                        announcer, the commercials. In all 
                        of show business, what star is his 
                        own opening act? Bob figured radio 
                        works best if he goes first. And 
                        all topical jokes. That day’s news.

                                 FRED
                        First to hire a room of writers. 
                        Doubled the jokes in a show. If 
                        Chet’d quit we could triple it.

           Now Chet flips Fred off.

                                 CHET
                        After the mono, Bob kids the band.  
                        Does bits, has a guest star out for 
                        an interview about their new movie 
                        or whatever bullshit. 

                                 MORT
                        Then music to close. It builds from 
                        Bob solo to that big Bob finish.

                                 LARRY
                        Everybody does that.

                                 FRED
                        You were burping up your lunch back 
                        then.

                                 LARRY
                        You’re burping yours up now.

           Fred just eyes Larry coolly as Bob sits down with them.

                                 FRED
                        You know, I’m glad you’re Jewish. 
                        That way I always got a reason not 
                        to like you.

                                 BOB
                        Jesus.  Shut up.

                                 CHET
                        That’s our Freddie, giving drunk 
                        Klansmen a bad name.

                                 FRED
                        Listen, eightball --

           Just then, turbulence causes Fred to slosh his paper cup of 
           bourbon and some of it hits Bob’s sleeve.  

                                 BOB
                        Goddammit.  Go to sleep.

                                 FRED
                        Don’t tell me what to do.  

           It’s uncomfortable, silent, just the sound of the plane.  
           Fred gets up, goes back a few aisles and drops into a seat, 
           pulling his hat over his face. Bob eyes Fred, pissed. Jimmy 
           sits down next to Chet.

                        and it’s hard to get fired. For

           ANGLE - BOB, WRITERS, JIMMY

           Bob returns to optimist mode and signals to Mort.

           EXT. HANEDA AIRFIELD, TOKYO - DAY

           SUPER: “Tuesday, October 24th, 1950. Tokyo.”  Bob’s planes 
           land on the airfield runways.

           INT. USO PLANE - DAY

           Everybody wakes up stiff on seats with rolled up jackets as 
           pillows. They get up to deplane, Bob first.

           EXT. PLANE

           Bob stands in the plane’s door and a CHEER goes up like it’s 
           a Beatles show. Two Japanese men are dressed up as Bob and 
           Jane Russell from The Paleface.  Bob signs autographs and 
           poses for pictures as crowds of Japanese fans greet him.

           INT. BUS - DAY

           Bob’s bus rolls through downtown Tokyo as fans chase after. 
           Suddenly, the bus stops, as the street is clogged with fans. 
           WE HEAR the crowd singing “Buttons and Bows,” Bob’s hit song 
           from The Paleface. He leans out the window to cheers and 
           sings along with them.

                                 MORT
                        We fought a war with them?  We 
                        shoulda just sent him.

                        My World Series stuff!

           The writers whip out notebooks and feed Bob pages. WE HEAR 
           HUGE LAUGHS.  Chet gives Fred an I Told You So Look.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        You know none of these people speak 
                        English, right?

                                 LARRY
                        Then why are they laughing?

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        He’s Bob Hope. They know when he’s 
                        being funny.

           Bob peeks back into the bus, loving it.

                        No, fair’s fair.

                                 CHET
                        Fair? Fair? I can’t come to Japan 
                        and not meet Big Mac.

                                 BOB
                        Maybe you should go and I’ll stay?

                                 CHET
                        Really?

                                 JIMMY
                        No!

           Everybody heads for their rooms except the writers.

                                 CHET
                        Guys, come on, how much for a 
                        Macarthur ticket?  $50. $100.

                                 LARRY
                        No way.

                                 MORT
                        Uh-uh.

                                 FRED
                        Forget it.  

                                 CHET
                           (to Fred)
                        You’re not even going.

                                 FRED
                        I just like turning you down.

           EXT. IMPERIAL PALACE - DAY

           An army bus pulls up, met by a full dress military guard. Bob 
           and his people and Prescott step out. Larry and Mort stare up 
           at the white, imperial walls in front of them.

                        Already lives like he’s President.

                                 LARRY
                        If Presidents had the money.

           INT. IMPERIAL PALACE

           Inside, GENERAL and MRS MACARTHUR, 70ish, welcome Bob’s 
           company with a cadre of miliary officials.

                                 MRS. MACARTHUR
                        Mr. Hope, welcome to our home.

                                 LARRY
                        Cozy. 

                                 MACARTHUR
                        Bob Hope, what a pleasure.

                                 BOB
                        Likewise, general.

           MacArthur laughs, as if Bob just told a hilarious joke. 

                                 LARRY
                        Guess MacArthur doesn’t speak 
                        English, either.

           MacArthur watches GIs surround Bob. Mort sees MacArthur 
           eyeing Bob coolly, and tries to break the ice with him.

                                 MORT
                        I used to be one of those guys. In 
                        a quonset hut in Alaska. I heard a 
                        Christmas show Bob did on radio. 
                        Like a lifeline home. A year later 
                        I was writing jokes for him.

           MacArthur just watches. Mrs. MacArthur and Prescott pass by.

                                 MRS. MACARTHUR
                        A chair short?  We have twenty-one 
                        guests and twenty chairs?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yes, ma’am. I counted three times.

           WE HEAR a very familiar LAUGH. Larry and Mort turn to see 
           CHET laughing TOO LOUDLY at something MacArthur said. Bob 
           slowly walks over, staring daggers at Chet, who snaps 
           pictures of himself with MacArthur on a Brownie camera.

           (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                               (cid:13)                                 CHET
                        Bob, did you hear that? The 
                        General’s a comedian, too.

                                 BOB
                        Is he looking for a writer?

                                 MRS. MACARTHUR
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, lunch.

           As everyone moves to the table, MacArthur sits at the head. 
           Bob, Chet, Larry, Mort sit on one side of him. The officers 
           sit on the other. Chet brazenly slides in next to MacArthur, 
           in Bob’s seat. As everyone sits on silk covered formal dining 
           chairs, Mrs. MacArthur sits in a metal folding chair. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Waiters clear plates, serve coffee. Chet sucks up to 
           MacArthur, who loves it.

                                 CHET
                        Tell us about your invasion at 
                        Inchon. In one move you turned the 
                        whole war around.

                                 MACARTHUR
                        Well Chet, it’s not really a war by 
                        my standards. Not when the enemy is 
                        North Korea’s President Kim Buck 
                        Tooth -- excuse me, Kim Il Jong. 

           Chet and the officers laugh, with Chet slapping the table.

                                 MORT
                        Not a real war?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        It’s more of a policing action.

                                 CHET
                        It’s a real war now. Bob’s here.

           Now Bob and MacArthur both give Chet a dead stare. 

                                 MACARTHUR
                        The Inchon landing means our boys 
                        will be home by Christmas. 

                                 MORT
                        What if the Chinese get involved?

                        I heard Mao Zedong says if we 
                        invade past the 38th parallels -- 

                                 MACARTHUR
                        The 38th Parallel. The border with 
                        North Korea. We’re not invading.  
                        We’re liberating. I forgot. You 
                        golf with Ike, my old secretary. 

                                 BOB
                        No, I mean, it’s in the papers.

                                 MACARTHUR
                        Mao has an army of laundry men. He 
                        fears a confrontation with me -– 
                        the United States. After Inchon, 
                        his moment passed. In fact, I 
                        ordered our forces North to his 
                        borders today to finish the North 
                        Korean army. Well, you have a 
                        comedy show to do.

           MacArthur gets up, signalling the end of lunch.

                                 CHET
                        Back to the grind. What a thrill, 
                        Mr. President – general.

           MacArthur wags a finger as if to say “naughty, naughty.” As 
           MacArthur shakes hands with everyone, Bob smacks Chet upside 
           the back of the head like he’s a five-year-old.

                        Ladies and Gentlemen, we are now 
                        approaching Seoul, recently 
                        liberated from communist oppression 
                        and under new management.

                        The New York Times, and Bob Hope. 
                        Just like downtown Omaha.

                        Mao said don’t go into the North.

                        “Rommel’s on the run.” Two hours 
                        later, I’m in a shelter with Nazi

                        wanted Bob to go on the radio and

           As he smokes, talking to a machine gun crew sitting on a jeep 
           with a 50 MM gun on back, loading up. Their eyes follow 
           Fred’s cigarette as he waves it around while he talks.

                        communist, not me. In June,

                        week, capitalist say I’m immoral.  
                        Know what, I always make money.

                        might work an F-80 into your show.

                        Is it a funny jet?

           As they exit the car, CAPTAIN JOHN KRUPA, 20s, walks over. 
           He’s the opposite of Prescott, a burly, tough fighter jock 
           with five o’clock shadow, all Chuck Yeager cool. Bob reaches 
           over to shake hands with Krupa, who eyes Marilyn.

                        Been writing jokes since I was 16.

                                 KRUPA
                        Danny Thomas walks into a 
                        barbershop.  Sounds like a joke.

           EXT. AIRPORT

           Larry, on shaky legs, exits the plane with Krupa.

                                 LARRY
                        Well, you must be happy. This war 
                        is practically over.

                                 KRUPA
                        “Practically.” It still gets hairy.

                                 LARRY
                        Gets what?

                                 KRUPA
                        Hairy. Ugly. Russian MiG jets are 
                        tough. Chinese come across the 
                        border for quick hits then go back.  

                                 LARRY
                        Chinese? You saw them?

                                 KRUPA
                        Just the ones trying to kill me. 
                        Why?

                        Macarthur says China isn’t in it.

                        Ok. Then they’re not. 

                                 LARRY
                        You said you saw them.

                        Where did you not see them?

                                 KRUPA
                        North near the Chinese border. We 
                        buzzed low. Under a tree was a 50 
                        millimeter gun. Shot up my wings 
                        and fuel tank. My wingman got shot 
                        down. Mike. From by you. San Diego. 

           Krupa turns quiet. Larry stops writing, not expecting that. 

           INT. MESS HALL

           Fred, Mort, and Chet go over jokes at a table. Larry rushes 
           in with new pages that he hands out to them.

                        Late. You find a comic book stand?

                        I got GREAT stuff from the GIs. I 
                        went up in a jet, too.

                                 FRED
                        Flu shots. I’m half asleep already.

                                 CHET
                        No wonder people take an instant 
                        dislike to you, Freddie.

                                 LARRY
                        It saves time.

           Chet, Mort, and Fred read the pages.

                        I’ll punch it up. Ok, they hate 
                        Almond, get laid at Rosie’s, hate 
                        Wednesday beef. And it’s flu shot 
                        day. It’s officially an army show.

           ANGLE - BOB AND THE WRITERS

           Bob, in leather bomber jacket, smirks as he reads the jokes. 
           He eyes Larry:

                                 BOB
                        The flu shot bit. You play the GI.

                        Don’t worry, I’ll try not to sound 
                        too much like Bob Hope for you. Ok, 
                        Le Mono.

                        Better cancel dinner.

           Bob smiles, laughing, circles his favorites, then pockets it.

                        You’re hiding the mono in Korea?

                                 BOB
                        The mono is sacred. If only I know 
                        what it is, no one can change it.

           EXT. FIELD ARMY BASE

           It’s all tents, out in the country somewhere. GIs climb into

                        When Bob Hope tells a joke you will 
                        laugh.  Slackers who do not laugh 
                        will see the show again until they 
                        find it funny. Is that understood?

           The guys crack up. Wise Ass sits down, with a New Yorker.

                                 CORPORAL
                        Rides for the show are here. You’re 
                        gonna stay here and read magazines?

                                 WISE ASS GI
                        Bob Hope’s my old man’s idea of 
                        funny.

                        He must be real old if he don’t 
                        like Marilyn Maxwell.

           The guys leave. Then, Wise Ass GI eyes a Bettie Page pin-up 
           on the wall. Beat. He hops up and runs out to the trucks.

           INT. BACKSTAGE AMPHITHEATER

           As Bob’s crew sets up, Larry checks the crowd thru the 
           curtains. He’s in costume, in khakis. Krupa looks NERVOUS.

           LARRY AND KRUPA’S POV FROM CURTAINS

           Troops sit on folding chairs, trying to keep warm in the 
           autumn chill.  The surrounding hills are bare grass. Then, 
           from the hills, troops file in from the battlefield. 
           Unshaven, dirty, tired, they plop down, rifles on shoulders. 
           Thousands, until every visible spot is covered in GI green.

           Bob and the other writers walk up to check the crowd.  Larry

                        Chet, did you forget to tell Larry 
                        we added that line for Bob?

           ANGLE - LARRY AND BOB

           As Larry jumps back into the sketch.

                                 LARRY
                        As you know Mr. Hope, it’s flu shot 
                        day here in Seoul. 

           HUGE BOOS come up from the crowd.  Larry takes out a giant 
           syringe from the kit, to LAUGHS FROM THE CROWD.

                                 LARRY
                        After he heard the monologue, 
                        General Almond sent me over.

                                 BOB
                        Wait a minute, I got every shot in 
                        the book in Tokyo. Flu, malaria, 
                        measles, headaches, and a round 
                        trip to Rosie’s. 

           Bob gets LAUGH, and is about to segue, when Larry cuts him 
           off.

                                 LARRY
                        Oh no, Bob. This isn’t for flu.  
                           (Bob eyes him, surprised)
                        It’s to protect the Koreans from 
                        you.

Bob steps away from the microphone, 
           trying not to crack up.

                                 BOB
                        You ad-libbed on me you son of a 
                        bitch?

           Larry aims the needle at Bob’s ass. Bob grabs the microphone:

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Fellas, while I get out of this, 
                        take a look at what you’ve been 
                        fighting for, and I don’t mean 
                        democracy – Marilyn Maxwell!

           THE APPLAUSE and HOOTING and WHISTLING IS DEAFENING as 
           Marilyn enters in a tight fitting dress. 

                                 MARILYN
                        Bob, look at all these big strong 
                        men. Don’t you wish you were one?

           Mock hurt, he leaves. She opens on “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.”

           INT. BACKSTAGE

           Hope corners Larry, cracking up.

                                 LARRY
                        Bob, Bob, I’ll make it up to you.

                                 BOB
                        Like how?

                                 LARRY
                        That last joke?  No charge.

           Bob and the writers laugh.  

                                 JIMMY
                        That’s the only way you could.

           Larry joins Krupa, who looks nervous.  

                                 LARRY
                        You’re on next. You know the lines.  
                        There’s cue cards just in case.
                           (sees Krupa’s nerves, 
                            talks quietly, calmly)
                        You’re out there with Bob Hope. 
                        When you’re playing ball with Joe

AMPHITHEATER STAGE

           Bob walks over to the mic, sounds surprisingly earnest.

                                 BOB
                        And now fellas, a word from our 
                        sponsor, Uncle Sam. Yesterday I 
                        took a ride in one of the new 
                        fighter jets that’s helping win 
                        this war. That’s how fast General 
                        Almond wants me gone.  But against 
                        orders, the pilot brought me back. 
                        So before he gets court marshalled, 
                        meet Captain John Krupa.  Captain?

           Krupa lopes on and gets applause and hoots from his friends.

           ANGLE - LARRY

           Backstage, script rolled up in his hand, tight.  He’s more 
           nervous for Krupa than Krupa is. Prescott stands next to him.

           Krupa’s co-pilots and crewmen stand up and cheer.

           ANGLE - BOB AND KRUPA

           Krupa comes out, stares into the crowd, mesmerized for a 
           moment. Bob grabs his hand to shake hands, otherwise Krupa 
           might not have stopped, and he calms down.

                                 BOB
                        Well, captain, I’ll understand if 
                        you’re nervous being in my show.

                                 KRUPA
                        I’m a pilot, Bob. I’m used to 
                        bombs.

                        Yeah, but since I dropped you off I 
                        don’t draw half as much sniper 
                        fire.

                        Up near Pusan my squadron, the 
                        25th, came in low over some trees.  

           The guys stand up and take a bow, getting pelted with any

                        The 25th was looking for a North 
                        Korean supply line, when a 50 
                        millimeter gun opened up on me.

                        Fellas, I don’t want to encourage 
                        the enemy, but this is a song Bing 
                        Crosby made famous. We loved coming 
                        to see you. We hear you’ll be home 
                        by Christmas, where we want you 
                        most.

           Bob and Marilyn step out front and the cast joins them.

           It’s dark and GIs stare at the show, rapt, singing along. A

                        Yeah. Big.

           drink from their own bottle with paper cups, tipsy. Bob is

                        to the show. Guess who heard about 
                        it? 

                                 BOB
                        Oh, Freddie?  Road trip! There’s 
                        some boys need some laughs.

           Fred turns from the bar and falls flat on his face, stone 
           drunk.  GIs rush to pick him up.  Bob looks at Larry.

                                 BOB
                        Lar, you’re up.  Tony!

           A guitarist, TONY, 20s, playing, gets the nod from Bob.

           EXT. KOREAN ROAD - NIGHT

           A jeep and a full troop truck full of armed men bookend 
           Hope’s car. The drivers use moonlight - no headlights.

           INT. CAR

           The car hits giant potholes. Bob and Marilyn sit in back, 
           sipping from their paper cups, like high school kids on prom 
           night.  They kiss, sloppily. Larry makes the mistake of 
           looking in the back seat. Bob sees Larry’s judgmental look:

                                 BOB
                        Yes, Lawrence?

           Larry turns away. He and Prescott’s Driver sit up front, 
           MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. Then there’s giggling again.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, this is how we did it in Italy 
                        in ‘43. Me, a honey, a guitar, and 
                        a gag man. Wait’ll these GIs see 
                        us.  They’re sitting in mud 
                        freezing their asses off.

                        Like us?

           Larry looks over his shoulder as Bob strokes her hair.  

                                 BOB
                        Try it on thirty a week, smart ass. 
                        They’re out here stuck in mud at 
                        three in the morning because they 
                        got drafted. Remember that.  

           Larry turns, keeps his eyes out the window. WE HEAR Bob and 
           Marilyn giggling to themselves again.

           EXT. MUDDY ROAD - NIGHT

           A convoy of trucks is trapped in mud. Headlights illuminate 
           the scene as a truck tows a stuck vehicle from mud. It’s the 
           trucks from the WISE ASS GI’s outfit. The guys pushing are 
           tired, cold, dirty. The truck pulled from the mud is backed 
           up, rear gate down. Bob’s cars arrive and Prescott’s GIs jump 
           out to help. Bob sees the flatbed truck with the lights 
           shining on it, thinking. A SERGEANT, 20s, steps up. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Unpack that coffee. Get these guys 
                        some coffee and food.  

                                 SERGEANT
                        Is that really him?

                                 BOB
                        It’s me, pal.  I deliver.  
                           (re the flatbed truck)
                        Leave that. It’s my stage.  

           SFX: WE HEAR “Thanks for the Memory” on acoustic guitar.

                                                           CUT TO:

           The GIs sit in a circle around Bob’s truck.  A curtain has 
           been hung over the back as his impromptu stage.  Tony the 
           Guitarist sits on the edge of it, warming them up.

           INT. TRUCK

           Behind a BLANKET, hung as a curtain, Marilyn awaits her cue. 
           Larry reads off his notes:

           ANGLE - BOB IN FRONT OF THE BLANKET

           finishing Larry’s joke on the back of the truck, golf club in 
           hand.

                                 BOB
                        ... after General Almond heard my 
                        monologue he gave me a top secret 
                        assignment: prisoner exchange.

           This gets a LAUGH. Now Marilyn sticks her head out.

                                 MARILYN
                        Well, hello Bob!

                                 BOB
                        Marilyn! I haven’t seen you in 
                        three weeks.

                                 MARILYN
                        But Bob, you said not to come out 
                        until you got your first laugh.

           Marilyn steps outside in her dress, getting wolf whistles.

                                 BOB
                        Well, how about a song? Those 
                        always work.

           The Guitarist goes into “My Funny Valentine,” which Marilyn 
           sings to the GIs, but emphasizes lines for Bob, who mugs 
           along with her.  

                                 MARILYN
                        Sweet comic Valentine 
                        You make me smile with my heart
                        Your looks are laughable, 
                        unphotographable
                        Yet you're my favorite work of art.

           ANGLE - TWO MARINES

           It’s the MARINE CAPTAIN and MARINE PRIVATE who left Bob’s 
           show during “White Christmas.” They’re more into hot coffee 
           and food than him. They wear wet, torn uniforms, faces 
           scraped raw from brush and gravel.

                                 BOB
                        What happened to you guys? The 
                        local girls must be rough.

                                 MARINE PRIVATE
                        Ho, ho, ho. They weren’t local.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, the key word is girl, right?

           ANGLE - CAPTAIN AND PRIVATE

                        We went as back-up at Unsan. By the

                        was dead. Wiped out.

                        Dugout Doug, lieutenant. Just like 
                        the Philippines. Never leaves HQ. 
                        Been out here one day to hand out 
                        medals and take pictures.

           The Captain unslings a gun from his shoulder. He hands it to 
           Bob.  There’s a low whistle from Prescott’s Driver.

                                 MARINE PRIVATE
                        Chinese zip gun. Merry Christmas, 
                        Bob Hope.  

                                 MARINE CAPTAIN
                        Sorry there’s not a red bow on it. 
                        But it’s not Christmas anyway. It’s 
                        Halloween.

           INT. SEOUL MESS HALL - DAY

           Bob’s cast and crew sit and finish breakfast and coffee.  
           Their bags are with them.  They look exhausted, hung over, 
           and feeling the morning chill.  

           Then Chet rushes by, in a South Korean local’s shirt, Bermuda 
           shorts, sunglasses, and a Kansas City Monarchs baseball cap. 
           He pops breakfast rolls in his pockets and grabs coffee.  As 
           the officers eye Chet, Bob just shrugs.

                                 BOB
                        Best not to ask where Chester’s 
                        concerned, general. Where are the 
                        first marines today? I always do a 
                        show for them. I’m not on in 
                        Pyonyang til tonight.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        First Marines? They just took 
                        Wonsan. It’s the second Inchon.

                                 KRUPA
                        We can fly up there in an hour and 
                        make Pyonyang in good time.

PLANE

           Larry and writers doggedly work out jokes, doing weak Bob 
           impressions.  Fred and Chet are hung over.

                                 FRED
                        These fighter jets are wild.  I 
                        thought one flew by, but it was ... 
                        ah forget it, I got nothing. 

                                 CHET
                        Hey, how about these fighter jets?  
                        I haven’t been on anything that 
                        fast since Gloria DeHaven!

           Everybody starts to laugh, then stops.  Bob sits down with 
           them.  He picks up Larry’s notebook.  Chet’s busted.

                                 BOB
                        Come again, Chester?

                        Don’t bother. How’s the mono?  

           Bob reads over Larry’s notebook, starts whistling.

                                 FRED
                        Robert, you only whistle when 
                        you’re unhappy.
                           (Fred reads Larry’s jokes)

                        We met some marines last night who 
                        fought the Chinese.

                                 FRED
                        They say.

                                 LARRY
                        They gave Bob a Chinese zip gun.

                                 FRED
                        China supplies the North. So what?

                        MacArthur told us. No Chinese. Big

                        Bob doesn’t take orders.

                                 CHET
                        From MacArthur?

                        From any one.

                                 FRED
                        A zip gun’s not a Chinaman. Same 
                        thing with Krupa. Stick to funny.

                                 BOB
                        Wait. Krupa? What happened?

           Fred realizes he made a mistake. Reluctantly:

                                 FRED
                        Krupa’s story about getting shot 
                        at? He says it was the Chinese. 
                        Also, his wingman was killed.  I 
                        changed it to North Koreans and 
                        left the other guy out.

           For the first time, Bob truly looks angry.

                                 BOB
                        Goddammit. Don’t ever do that to me 
                        again. They know when it’s bullshit 
                        up there. I don’t bullshit them.

           Bob tosses the notebook to confused Larry.

                                 BOB
                        And you. Just say communists. Reds. 
                        Got it? Maybe they did fight some 
                        Chinese. There’s Russians here, 
                        too. Does it change anything? The 
                        whole world says Korea’s done by 
                        Christmas. We’re winning. Maybe 
                        MacArthur, the CIA, the United 
                        States military, and the President 
                        of the United States know what 
                        they’re talking about. Maybe they 
                        don’t. Me? I hope they do. I don’t 
                        make the news. I make fun of it.

           Marilyn bustles by and Bob, alert to the possibilities, jumps 
           up to join her.

           As he follows her up the aisle.

                                 BOB
                        Honey, what?

                                 MARILYN
                        I want some time with you.

                                 BOB
                        This isn’t exactly Paris.

                                 MARILYN
                        I didn’t expect it to be. It’s nice 
                        not running around and hiding, but 
                        we never have any time.

                                 BOB
                        These trips -- 

                                 MARILYN
                        It’s still work for you, and that 
                        always comes first. 

                                 BOB
                        I never led you on.

                                 MARILYN
                        And I didn’t lead you on. You’re 
                        kidding yourself if you think I 
                        want to be the woman who broke up 
                        Bob Hope’s marriage.

                                 BOB
                        What?

                                 MARILYN
                        I don’t want you to leave anyone. I 
                        just don’t want to be left behind 
                        when you’re with me.

           Bob pulls her close.

           At Wonsan Harbor, combat loaded battleships with thousands of 
           sailors and marines wait at see.  Plumes of black smoke rise 
           from a cruiser. Then an EXPLOSION, as it hits more mines.

                                 MORT (O.S.)
                        That did some damage.

           ANGLE - THE WRITERS

           trying to get a glimpse of the action below. Bob and Marilyn 
           work their way down the aisle, to the rest of the company.

                                 LARRY
                        Why are they on the ships?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        They’ve got mine sweepers. They 
                        haven’t landed yet.  

           As they watch, more explosions go up as mines are detonated.

           EXT. WONSAN AIRFIELD - DAY

           The C-54s carrying Hope’s troupe land at the airport and taxi 
           around toward the airfield’s small terminal and hangar. The 
           doors pop open on the planes and the ladders drop as everyone 
           gets out and stands on the tarmac – it’s deserted.

           At the opposite end of the field is the terminal.  A plume of 
           black smoke comes up from behind it.  The village as seen in 
           the distance, is on fire.

           The late October wind is chilly and sharp as everyone buttons 
           up their jackets and heads for the hangar.

                        We beat the marines.  Hilarious.  
                        There’s a joke in that.

                        Yeah, on us. ‘Cause if the marines 
                        aren’t holding Wonsan, who is?

                        Oh God.

           The troupe has made it far enough now where they can see 
           clearly what’s on the tarmac near the hangar.

           On the side of the landing strip are dead bodies, a shot to 
           death Korean family.  They haven’t been buried yet:  Men, 
           women, children.

           Beyond the bodies are all their belongings: dumped out 
           suitcases, broken toys, a bird in a bird cage that’s still 
           alive, and a dog leashed to a suitcase, barking at the plane.

           A wedding dresses, half stuck out of a suitcase, flaps like a 
           flag in the chilly wind.

           There’s stunned silence as they get a look at the bodies.

           speechless, struggling to say ANYTHING.

           Bob was overheard. He sees how worried people are.

           Bob starts walking and they follow him. Except Larry, who 
           watches Krupa. Krupa pulls his pistol and takes the safety 
           off. The flight crew pull pistols, head for the terminal.

           planes landing and taking off. WE SEE desks, a waiting area, 
           a luggage pick-up. 

                                 KRUPA
                        Prescott, let’s go.

           Larry watches as Prescott, who hadn’t thought of it, now 
           joins Krupa’s flight crew, gun drawn. 

           EXT. WONSAN AIRFIELD TERMINAL

           Krupa takes one side of the front door and his men the other.  
           WE HEAR a DOOR INSIDE the terminal SLAM SHUT. Krupa steps 
           forward, gesturing that he’ll go in first.

           INT. WONSAN TERMINAL

           Prescott kicks in the door.  Krupa goes in like a cop, but 
           there’s no one inside. WE HEAR A NOISE from the back of the 
           room, like someone making an effort to move something heavy.

           ANGLE - LARRY’S POV

           Through the big windows, Larry can see what happens next. On 
           Krupa’s signal, the men cover Krupa like cops about to enter 
           a house with a gunman inside.

           INT. WONSAN TERMINAL

           The main luggage area is deserted and has clearly been 
           ransacked. WE HEAR MOVEMENT from the back again. The terminal 
           main waiting room consists of long benches, a chalk board 
           with Korean characters and arrival/departure times on it, and 
           one dead civilian airport worker behind the counter.  

           Krupa and his men slowly enter.  One of Krupa’s men, quite 
           nervous, steps too close to the window, and Krupa quickly 
           moves to pull him back.  

           As Krupa does so, his leg hits a METAL FOLDING CHAIR that 
           bangs on the floor and ECHOES LOUDLY in the big empty space. 
           They freeze. The noise is behind the ticketing desk. 

           EXT. WONSAN AIRFIELD

           Larry looks toward the terminal. WE SEE Krupa and the others 
           spread out around the ticketing counter. Then, past the 
           terminal, Larry SEES DUST coming up on the road.  
                               (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                              (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)           In the hangar, Chet notices Larry still out there.

                                 CHET
                        Larry, get over here!

                                 LARRY
                        There’s somebody coming!

           ANGLE - MORT, CHET, AND BOB

           They see the dust coming up the road now.

                                 MORT
                        Trucks.  From the west. Not the 
                        marines, the harbor’s east.  

                                 BOB
                        Who is it?

                                 MORT
                        I can’t see.

           ANGLE - LARRY

           He looks in the terminal. Krupa’s men are all in position.

           ANGLE - LARRY’S POV

           Krupa leads the men to the back room, first again.  Krupa 
           holds up THREE fingers, counting off: 1-2-3.  

           INT. WONSAN TERMINAL

           Krupa throws himself against the wall, ready to shoot anyone 
           or anything behind the counter.

           Krupa edges down one wall, gun up. The others walk alongside 
           the counter, guns out.

           Krupa sets up to go through the door first.  His two guys get 
           ready to kick it open when Krupa notices the cabinets below 
           the counter. There’s a shoelace caught in one of the doors.

           Krupa signals the men to FREEZE, points to the locker.  One 
           more step and his guys would be in front of it. Krupa signals 
           a three count again: 1-2-3.

           The men yank open the door. Krupa shouts in Korean: 
                                                          (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)

                        Don’t move! Halt!

           Inside, a skinny Korean boy, scared to death, pops up above 
           the counter in a fedora and suit way too big for him. WE HEAR 
           BOOM! A bullet smashes the wall inches over the kid’s head.

           The pilot holds Prescott’s gun arm in the air, by the wrist. 
           The gun smokes. The pilot stopped him just in time.

                                 KID
                        Don’t shoot! No communist! I like 
                        Harry Truman! I’m not Chinese!

           EXT. WONSAN AIRFIELD

           Larry exhales at what he’s watching inside the terminal.  WE 
           HEAR the RUMBLE of HEAVY ARMORED VEHICLES.

           INT. WONSAN TERMINAL

           Krupa and the guys relax, when they HEAR the RUMBLE.

                                 KRUPA
                        Shit.

           They look out the window to see the column of trucks.

           INT. WONSAN AIRFIELD

           Krupa and his men exit the terminal to see the big trucks.

                                 KRUPA
                        About time. It’s the army. X Corps.

           ANGLE - AMERICAN CONVOY

           X Corps’ army trucks roll into the airport. Krupa waves the 
           all clear to the hangar.

           EXT. PLANE

           Bob’s shaky troupe exits the hangar, chattery and nervous.  
           The soldiers are all looking at Bob. General Almond, sharp-
           jawed, all high energy aggression, gets out, in a clean 
           pressed, decorated uniform.
                                     (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                           (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                            (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                 ALMOND
                        Bob! Where’s the 1st Marines?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Over there, sir.

           Indeed, rolling in from the East are three jeeps of 1st 
           Marines. The first to get there are the officers, and LT. 
           GENERAL LEWIS PULLER, 50s. He does not look happy. The marine 
           generals dress like soldiers, compared to Almond in his clean 
           pressed uniform.

                                 ALMOND
                        Ha! Bob Hope beats the marines to 
                        the beaches. Great headline!

                                 BOB
                        The marines are welcome at all my 
                        landings. 

           Everyone finds this funny except the marines. Puller is 
           contained fury.  

                                 PULLER
                        We been on boats three weeks 
                        clearing two-thousand mines. Mines 
                        Tokyo and X Corps never mentioned. 

           Almond waves an aide over and a photographer.

                                 MARILYN
                        Two thousand?

                                 PULLER
                        Nine men killed clearing them. 
                        Mines I seriously doubt the North 
                        Koreans laid on their own -- it had 
                        to have been Russian or Chinese 
                        advisors.

                                 ALMOND
                           (cuts him off, re Bob)
                        Let’s not go over excuses.

                                 PULLER
                        Excuses? Yours or mine?

                                 ALMOND
                           (to Bob and Marilyn)
                        Wonsan’s complicated. It’s not as 
                        simple as Inchon.

                        While we waited three weeks the 
                        North Koreans escaped above the 
                        border.

                                 ALMOND
                        Yah, running scared. It’s why we’re 
                        going so far north. To finish them 
                        off.

                                 PULLER
                        Or they’re baiting us north to thin 
                        out our lines.  

                                 ALMOND
                        They don’t think that far ahead. 

                                 PULLER
                        They thought out those mines pretty 
                        well.

           Puller stops, speechless, as two GIs in white waiter jackets 
           come up to the general, like they walked out of Sardi’s.

                                 WAITER
                        How many for lunch, general?

                                 ALMOND
                        Bob, Marilyn, Puller, join me. We 
                        have roast beef today.

                                 BOB
                        I can’t. I’m visiting the Missouri 
                        out there. Wounded men.

                                 PULLER
                        I’m still seasick.

           Puller walks off, cursing under his breath. Krupa steps up to 
           the X Corps command with the kid.  

                                 ALMOND
                        What’s this, captain?

                                 KRUPA
                        Found him inside. There’s a family 
                        of non-coms on the tarmac.

                        Yes, sir.  He will.

           The Sergeant tosses the kid a Hershey bar, who devours it.

                        Says the Chinese are coming.

                                 ALMOND
                        Chinese?  You mean North Koreans. 
                        Maybe Russians.

                                 KRUPA
                        He said Chinese, sir.

                        For God’s sake, I hardly take him 
                        to be a credible source of military 
                        intelligence.  You’re probably just 
                        impressed by his suit.

           Almond’s aides and staff crack up at Almond’s joke.  Krupa 
           takes it, because he has to take it.  The sergeant takes the 
           kid and the brass walk off with Bob as he signs autographs.

           Larry, Fred, Mort, and Chet meet up with Krupa.

           Larry wanders among GIs with his guide. Larry starts asking 
           the usual questions, which don’t make sense now:

                                 LARRY
                        So, where do you guys go for a

                        that kind of a war.

           WE HEAR a HONKING horn as a jeep pulls up to Larry.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           In a jeep, Bob and Marilyn sit in back and Larry up front.  
           They roll past refugees on the side of the road who shout at 
           the jeep, hoping for food, water, any help.

           Up ahead, GIs divert refugees off the road onto a large rocky 
           field. The jeep follows goes onto the field. Larry tries to 
           write as the jeep bounces off rocks. They shout to talk.

                        Russians mined the road. We’d get 
                        our asses blown off. Unless you 
                        think that’s funny.

           Larry puts the notebook away to watch the countryside and 
           refugees.  They carry everything they own on their backs.

           The jeep finally gets back on a real road as they enter 
           Wonsan harbor, a landing base with thousands of marines from 
           ships now arriving.  The jeep takes them down to the dock. 

           A helicopter waits for them, the kind seen every week in the 
           opening credits of MASH. Under the big, spinning propeller, 
           the pilot indicates there is only room for Bob and Marilyn in 
           the helicopter.  Larry has to wait. They get inside and it 
           takes off, heading out to sea to the battleship USS Missouri.

           ANGLE - LARRY

           Larry is waved onto a PT boat and taken out to sea with some 
           GIs. Theirs is the only boat heading out. All the others head 
           to shore, full of men younger than Larry.

                        Welcome aboard!  You are now on the 
                        USS Missouri, the very same ship on 
                        which General MacArthur personally 
                        accepted the complete surrender of 
                        the empire of Japan, ending 
                        hostilities in the Pacific. 

           Larry heads for the deck where the wounded arrive. It’s a 
           scene familiar to M*A*S*H fans. 1950s medi-copters land, 
           carrying hurt sailors on sideboards from smoldering ships in 
           the distance. Doctors rush in, crouching low, examining them. 
           Larry is transfixed as doctors make life or death calls. Some 
           men are taken downstairs. Others get last rites. A young 
           CORPSMEN runs out to the medical teams.

                                 CORPSMEN
                        Incoming!

           A doctor bumps into Larry as he runs alongside a stretcher 
           carrying a wounded woman.  Two doctors run past, shouting:

                                 DOCTOR
                        What the hell happened?

                                 DOCTOR #2
                        More mines.

           Doctor #2 points to a ship further out.  Black smoke billows 
           from it as another medi-copter hovers above.

                                 CORPSMAN
                           (to Larry)
                        Who are you?

                                 LARRY
                        The writer!

                                 CORPSMAN
                        What?

                                 LARRY
                        I write jokes!

                                 CORPSMAN
                        You’re in the way!

           A SAILOR grabs Larry’s sleeve and pulls him toward a doorway.

SICK BAY 

           The Sailor escorts Larry down the steps to the sick bay. 
           Larry overhears two wounded marines, bandages on their heads. 

                                 SAILOR
                        Wait here, please. I’ll see if you 
                        can come in yet.

           The Sailor ducks into the sick bay, leaving Larry.

                                 MARINE PRIVATE #1
                        Don’t know what happened.  I just 
                        woke up here. FUBAR.

           The marines see Larry’s confused look.

                                 MARINE PRIVATE #2
                        FUBAR. Fucked up beyond all reason.

           The Sailor waves Larry inside.

           LARRY’S POV

           The sick bay is a long rectangular room lined with beds for 
           wounded men, followed by a second ward after that.  

           Bob and Marilyn stand at the door for the second ward. Larry 
           heads for them as they confer with a Navy doctor, then enter 
           the next ward. Larry hurries to catch up.

           INT. SICK BAY

           Larry follows Bob and Marilyn into the next sick bay, a room 
           similar to the one they are leaving.

                                 BOB
                        Ok, you boys know the drill about 
                        getting a Bob Hope autograph.

                                 MARILYN
                        Yeah, sorry fellas, it’s orders, 
                        you have to take one.

           Larry watches from the door, standing back while Bob works.  
           Bob and Marilyn stop at the first bed, a 19-year-old marine 
           whose arms are completely in casts.

                                 BOB
                        I feel a song coming on.

           LARRY’S POV

           Larry looks down the line of kids. The wounds are horrible:  
           one marine has blackened skin, burns all over his chest.  
           Others are bandaged around their hands, in spots over their 
           chests and torso covering bullet wounds, and some are simply 
           unconscious.

           ANGLE - BOB AND MARILYN

           They move on to a marine in the next bed, wrapped up to the 
           chest in a blanket, lots of drip and plasma tubes.  Bob looks 
           down, and the boy has no legs, which catches Bob by surprise.  
           Bob chokes up a little, as does Marilyn. Larry has come up 
           closet to Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Ski nose? A wise guy. Who came 
                        through here first, Bing Crosby?

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2
                        If he’s selling Chinese mines, he 
                        did.

                                 BOB
                        Chinese mines ... 
                           (sees Larry)
                        Hey, where you from?

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2 
                        Kentucky. Going back to racing when 
                        I get back.  I’m a jockey. 

           Bob chokes up, looking where the kid’s legs used to be. The 
           soldiers watch as Bob’s eyes tear up slightly and Marilyn 
           taps him on the soldier, a signal that she’ll take over.

                                 MARILYN
                        Want to hear a song?

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2
                        “We’ll Meet Again.”

           Marilyn sits down and sings “We’ll Meet Again” to him at his 
           bedside. It softly fills the ward, as his eyes close and he 
           listens, clearly drifting off, unconscious.

           Bob heads quickly down to the end of the hall to hide his 
           tears and disappears into a small room.

           Larry follows him, past Marilyn, her song continuing.  

           Larry finds Bob in what hospitals call a “crying room,” where 
           you basically let out all the emotion that builds up in wards 
           like these, but out of sight of the patients.

           Larry sees Bob in the room, tears in his eyes, allowing 
           himself to lose it.  Bob spots Larry in the doorway.

                                 BOB
                        What?  Can’t I get one goddamn 
                        minute to myself?  

           Larry backs off, giving Bob some privacy, as Bob loses it.  
           The doctor comes up to the door.

                        Excuse me, is Mr. Hope in there?

                                 LARRY
                        Yes, please give him a minute.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Who are you?

                                 LARRY
                        One of Bob’s writers.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Excuse me, kid.

           The doctor walks past Larry, ignoring him.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. Hope, that marine back there 
                        missing his -- from Kentucky. He’s 
                        awake.  I don’t know how long I’ll 
                        have him ...

                                 BOB
                        Awake?

                                 DOCTOR
                        At all.

           Bob pulls himself together, wiping tears from his eyes.  He 
           steels himself, and from the time it takes him to get up and 
           walk from one end of the crying room to the other, he’s once 
           again – Bob Hope, comedian.

           INT. SICK BAY

           Bob enters, as Marilyn ends the song.

                                 BOB
                        Ok, fellas, whose got the dice?  
                        You know what the Navy is -- the 
                        original floating craps game.

           The guys laugh but no one gets up, not that they can.

                                 BOB
                        Ok, I’ll make house calls.

           Bob goes to the kid from Kentucky, and Larry is within ear 
           shot of their conversation.

                        Hey kid, you fell asleep during my 
                        first set.  

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2 
                        Never happened to you before?

                                 BOB
                        I see the marines are now trained 
                        in sarcasm. Kentucky, huh?  Where?

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2
                        Louisville.

                                 BOB
                        Ah, the Royale. I played it in 
                        vaudeville. On Benson and ...

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2
                        Third. It’s a movie house now. I 
                        saw Road to Morocco there with my 
                        dad.

                                 BOB
                        Jockey, huh? You know, last week at 
                        Santa Anita, I ran a horse.

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2
                        Yeah?

                                 BOB
                        I won’t say he was old, but out of 
                        the gate he tripped over his 
                        hearing aid.

           The kid cracks up.  Larry watches as Bob times it perfectly, 
           silently saying the follow-up as Bob says it:

                                 BOB
                        The bet was win, place, or live.

                                 WOUNDED MAN #2
                        Mr. Hope, would you mind signing my 
                        cast before you go?

           Bob looks down:  he already did sign it. The kid fades again.

           The kid slips away, and the doctor rushes in with a nurse.  
           The kid isn’t just falling asleep.  Bob backs up. Marilyn 
           watches stoically, holding it in -- she’s been here before, 
           too.

           boy.  They can’t. Bob backs away to the crying room, gestures 
           for Larry and Marilyn to follow.

           INT. CRYING ROOM

           Bob and Marilyn sit down on folding chairs, exhausted.  Larry 
           watches them get a second wind.

                                 BOB
                        Quit staring at me.

                                 LARRY
                        Bob, if you need a minute ...

                                 BOB
                        I already had one. Do you?
                           (to Marilyn)
                        They told me they took Wonsan.  How 
                        could they not know that?  How? And 
                        those bodies on the field ... they 
                        weren’t dead but a few hours.  We 
                        walked right into it.

                                 LARRY
                           (checks his notebook)
                        GIs call it “FUBAR.” It means --

                                 MARILYN
                        We know what it means.

           Just then, WE HEAR a loud voice in the sick ward.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Excuse me, Mr. Hope?

           Prescott barges into the crying room.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        General Almond asked that I brief 
                        you – and Miss Maxwell, of course.

                                 BOB
                        Brief us?  He sending us on a 
                        mission?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Ha! Yes, sir. He wants you to have 
                        a positive perspective of the 
                        Wonsan landing, as confusing as it 
                        must have looked to civilians.

                        Sure, go ahead, Lieutenant.

                                 PRESCOTT
                           (like a press conference)
                        The 1st marines have landed safely 
                        and are now moving on to clean up 
                        North Korean stragglers on the run.  
                        General Almond wants you to know 
                        everything is back to normal and 
                        communist forces are expected to 
                        surrender within days.

                                 MARILYN
                        That’s great.  

                                 PRESCOTT
                        General Almond moved the marines 
                        out in hot pursuit, double-time. 

                                 BOB
                        Wait, the 1st Marines are why I 
                        came out here. Now they’re gone?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yes, well, in all the confus -- uh, 
                        the landing, the North Koreans are 
                        farther north than first thought.
                           (re the wounded)
                        But of course, there’s some of the 
                        mighty 1st here on-board.

                                 BOB
                        I understand. Glad it’s going our 
                        way.

                                 MARILYN
                        Yes, thank God.

           Prescott exits. Larry looks at Bob: Well?

                                 LARRY
                           (re his notebook)
                        You don’t believe that guy?

           Bob eyes Larry, pointedly not answering him. The sick bay 
           Doctor sticks his head in the door.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mr. Hope, the second ward is open.

           The Doctor exits. Bob hops up to his feet, so does Marilyn.  
           Bob tosses Larry back his notebook.

                        Doesn’t matter what I think. No 
                        marines. No show.

           Bob and Marilyn exit. Larry sits, angry. 

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Ok, you boys know the drill about 
                        getting a Bob Hope autograph.

                                 MARILYN (O.S.)
                        Yeah, sorry fellas, it’s orders. 
                        You gotta take one.

           Larry pockets his notebook and follows Bob and Marilyn.

           EXT. PLANE - DAY

           Bob’s plane is warming up on the runway. Bob stands on the 
           doorway, waving to a crowd of marines.

                                 BOB
                        Next landing fellas, I’ll bring the 
                        beer!

           Bob lingers a second, waving to them.  He goes inside, but 
           the marines stay out there, waiting for another glimpse of 
           Bob. It starts to rain.

           INT. PLANE

           Larry, Fred, Chet, and Mort sit together.  Bob walks up as 
           the writers look out the window. 

                                 MORT
                        First marines.  Headed North.

           WRITERS POV

           WE SEE the 1st Marine column, rolling away, heading out of 
           the airport area, off into the North.

           BOB’S POV

           WE SEE the jokes fly by as he flips thru the pages. Names pop 
           out to us:  MacArthur;  Mao;  Truman;  Kim Il Jong;  China;  
           Red Army;  Stalin. WE HEAR Bob whistling “Fancy Pants.”

                        They only sell plain candy bars at 
                        the PX because GIs think General

           Bob crumples the page and tosses it at Mort.  Bob turns his 
           attention to Chet, who looks sullen.

                        fun of it, right? 

                                 JIMMY
                        I dunno. Radioman told me back home 
                        the AP is reporting Bob beat the 
                        marines to Wonsan. We made news.

                                 MORT
                        So it’s no secret. What’s the 
                        difference? 

                                 CHET
                        The difference is this is a war and 
                        these guys are in the middle of it.
                        Whose side are you on?

                                 MORT
                        Same side I fought for five years 
                        ago. Go to hell. 

                                 CHET
                        So one battle goes screwy. We’re 
                        winning. Why bring the guys down? 

                                 LARRY
                        They are down. They --

                                 FRED
                           (like shushing a kid)
                        Larry, please?
                           (to Bob)
                        Just do the Marilyn in a Christmas 
                        stocking jokes. Just be funny.

                                 LARRY
                           (re his notebook)
                        What happened to if the guys think 
                        it Bob says it?  If we don’t care 
                        what the guys think, Fred’s right.

                                 BOB
                        Who says I don’t care what they 
                        think? 

           Bob leans forward, challenging Larry. Larry doesn’t back 
           down. He shrugs, like, “whatever.”

                                 LARRY
                        Just do the Christmas jokes.

Chet, Fred, and Mort all ad-
           lib arguing their points to Bob, as Jimmy tries to quiet 
           them. Larry says nothing, just waiting for Bob’s decision. 
           Bob gives up on all of them. Annoyed, he gathers up the 
           notebook pages, avoiding Larry’s look. The guys only get 
           quiet when they see Bob get up and leave.

           ANGLE - BOB

           Bob heads up to the front of the plane. There’s a seat next 
           to Marilyn. Their eyes meet. Then she sees the jokes in his 
           hands and she looks away, chilly.

           Bob turns, spots a seat at the back of the plane, passing 
           Prescott. He gives Bob a big smile and a thumbs up.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Pyongyang an hour away, Mr. Hope.  

                                 BOB
                        Yep.

           Bob finally finds a spot way in the back of the plane.  He 
           sits at the window. Then Bob sees something on the tarmac 
           that stops him, makes him smile.  

           BOB’S POV - THE 1ST MARINES

           It’s a downpour now as rain drenches the young marines still 
           out on the tarmac, soaked, chilly. They’ve spotted him in the 
           window.  They wave and take pictures.  

           BOB SEES a jeep pulls up to the marines and a SERGEANT lays 
           into the kids, really chewing them out. They run in the rain 
           for their trucks, to roll out. Their truck joins the convoys, 
           becoming part of the bigger roll out, and disappears North.  

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Bob watches them as the rain spatters the window. They roll 
           for take-off. Bob rests his head against the window, and 
           falls asleep.

           INSERT MAP ANIMATION

           SUPER: “Thursday, October 26th, 1950. Pyongyang.” Bob’s 
           planes fly back West, from Wonsan to Pyonyang, all in the 
           North, above the 38th parallel.

PLANE

           Bob has fallen asleep, the jokes still in his hands, pretty 
           much untouched.  Jimmy taps Bob, waking him up.

           EXT. PLANE - DAY

           Bob’s planes sit on the runway as his troupe deplanes and 
           gets into two busses.  

           A jeep waits for Bob and Marilyn with GENERAL JOHNNIE WALKER, 
           61, greeting them. Walker is a short, bulldog. He wears 
           sunglasses, a silver helmet, a pearl-handled revolver. A 
           flashing red siren with three big stars is affixed to his 
           jeep.

           The writers come-up just behind Bob with Prescott who 
           instantly salutes Walker, who barely notices him.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Mr. Hope, Miss Maxwell, allow me to 
                        introduce General Johnnie Walker, 
                        Eighth Army.

                                 BOB
                           (loud, for the writers)
                        Marilyn, allow me to introduce you 
                        to General Johnnie Walker.

           On hearing the name, all four writers jot down this instant 
           keeper. 

                                 WALKER
                        Loved Lost in a Harem. 

                                 MARILYN
                        Thank you, general.

           Bob jumps in the back seat of the jeep and Walker gallantly 
           helps Marilyn up the step, then hops into his seat.

                                 WALKER
                        Ok!  Roll!

           INT. WALKER’S JEEP

           Walker’s driver shoots thru the city at about sixty miles and 
           hour, showing no fear, while Bob and Marilyn just try not to 
           fall out onto the street.

           soldiers on the street, as if he were leading a parade. The 
           “streets” are dirt roads and the buildings are charred black 
           rubble.

                                 WALKER
                        Commies kept it nice, eh?  I don’t 
                        think they’re getting their deposit 
                        back. This is downtown Pyongyang.  
                        Let me know if you want to do some 
                        window shopping, Miss Maxwell!  
                        Yah, I’m kidding, of course. We’re 
                        headed out to Pyongyang University 
                        where you can set up for your show.  
                        Take it easy on me up there, Bob.  
                        I don’t want to have to shoot you.  
                        HAH!  I’m kidding, of course.  

                                 BOB
                        Was there much fighting to take the 
                        city?

                                 WALKER (CONT’D)
                        Hah! We hauled butt thinking 
                        there’d be a fight but only got 
                        into some friendly fire. Nobody got 
                        hurt, but by the time we sorted it 
                        out, the South Koreans got into the 
                        city first.  Can you believe that? 
                        Hey, but you beat the marines to 
                        Wonsan. It’s that kind of a war.

                                 BOB
                        General, what’s going on?  What 
                        happened at Wonsan? Or Unsan? Are 
                        the Chinese in it? 

                                 WALKER
                        Yah, yah, you heard about the dust-
                        up at Unsan last night? 
                           (Bob and Marilyn nod)
                        Ok, unofficially, some Chinese are 
                        here. Is it a problem? It’s the 
                        country next door. Lots of Mexicans 
                        in Texas, right? They a problem? 
                           (Bob and Marilyn shrug 
                            like, “guess not”)
                        Right. So if Tokyo says home by 
                        Christmas, we’re home by Christmas. 
                        Yah, well, you got jokes to tell, I 
                        got a war to run. Wonderful meeting 
                        you both. See you tonight.

           the trucks with Bob’s cast and crew arrive. Bob can see 
           across the quad, a growing group of his GI fans. Prescott 
           heads over to Bob and Marilyn.  Bob yawns.

                                 MARILYN
                        You need some rest.

           Bob shrugs, re the GI fans: “what can I do?”

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Mr. Saphier says he’ll get your 
                        show set up on the football field.  
                        We have several hospital visits 
                        planned.

                                 BOB
                        Sure.  I’m ready to go.  Marilyn?

                                 MARILYN
                        Fifteen minutes.  Gotta girly up.

           Mort gets into the staff car with Marilyn and Bob.  The car 
           leaves a cloud of dust behind them. Chet looks to Larry.

                                 CHET
                        That’s not good. You don’t want to 
                        be on probation, man. Bob’s always 
                        looking at you. You never think 
                        your job’s safe. Fred’s always 
                        needling you.

                                 LARRY
                        That’s what it’s like now. 

           EXT. PYONGYANG STREETS - DAY

           Krupa and Larry walk down the street, taking in the rubble. 
           Larry shivers, only wearing an LA-friendly sport coat.

                        Back home they think there’s a 
                        commie under everybody’s bed and 
                        out here they can’t find one.

           They find themselves outside the Russian embassy where three 
           GIs hang out in the courtyard. They have a bonfire going 
           (using busted up furniture) and liberated bottles of vodka. 
           Krupa and Larry come up to the fire to warms their hands. In 
           a bureau the soldiers use for wood are a pile of clothes.

                        Yeah? You need a jacket? Trust me, 
                        it’s getting cold. No one’s got 
                        winter gear. Who thought we’d be 
                        this far North in October?

           One of the GIs points to a looted Russian commissar’s long 
           coat and big fur hat.  

                                 LARRY
                        Sure, thanks.

                        Good. Cause we need some backstage 
                        passes.

           The GIs wait on Larry, who nods.

                        -- and a bottle. Comrade.

           The GIs throw Krupa a bottle and a grateful Larry his Russian 
           long coat and fur hat.

           ANGLE - ARMY STAFF CAR

           Prescott sits up front with a driver. Bob, Marilyn, and Mort 
           sit in back. Bob waves to GIs who recognize him. Where there 
           isn’t rubble, buildings have Communist murals on them. At an 
           intersection, they see one of Joseph Stalin and Kim Il Jong 
           surrounded by angelic children who look up at them as gods. 
           Passing GIs flick cigarette butts and smash bottles on it.

           (cid:13)           The car passes a girls school. The courtyard houses North 
           Korean POWs. Rows of them sit Indian-style, hands on heads. 
           Republic of Korea soldiers guard them, not American GIs. 
           Three NK officers hang by the neck, swinging in the wind, as 
           examples to the rest.

           Bob’s car heads through a levelled area completely charred 
           black – fields and hills recently wiped out by fire. Remains 
           of bodies, barely recognizable, litter the hills and fields.  

           ANGLE - BOB, MARILYN, AND MORT

           Bob leans forward to Prescott.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        What the hell happened?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Napalm. A chemical fire we drop 
                        that incinerates enemy territory.  

           Bob, Marilyn, and Mort take in the black fields, which 
           stretch to the horizon. 

           ANGLE - PRESCOTT’S CAR

           The car drives into downtown Pyonyang near a still standing 
           three story building. Bob sleeps, faced pressed against the 
           car door. When the car jerks to a stop, he wakes up.

                                 PRESCOTT 
                        Mr. Hope, I’ll go in and let them 
                        know you’re here.  Be right back.

           Prescott gets out of the car and heads into the building.  
           Bob, Marilyn, and Mort sit back, beat. Nobody talks, they’re 
           all exhausted, half asleep.  

           Mort nudges Bob. Mort nods to a street corner where a group 
           of GIs have spotted Bob and Marilyn. The crowd is gradually 
           growing, as they try to get a glimpse of him. Beat, Bob pulls 
           himself up and leans out the window.

                                 BOB
                        Hey, I’m playing through to the 
                        18th hole. Pyongyang’s the worst

           In the chill air, Bob signs autographs, posing for pictures, 
           hanging out. Mort listens, takes notes, takes photos.

                                 GI
                        Man, we were racing to get here 
                        first. Night before we did the 5th 
                        and 7th Cavalries were blowing the 
                        shit out each other. “Friendly 
                        fire.” By the time we got here the 
                        Russians were long gone.

                                 MORT
                        Wiped out, huh?

                        our POWs, too. They know we’ll come 
                        North for’m.
                           (to Bob)
                        The shit they did here. We found a

                        full of people.

                        grapefruit juice per day cause our

                           (re something behind Bob)
                        I want those in a blanket.

           WE HEAR wolf whistles. Marilyn has emerged from the car in a 
           tight sweater.

           INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

           Bob, Marilyn, and Mort follow Prescott into an office 
           building converted into a hospital. At the top of the stairs, 
           doctors and nurses wait for them.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This ward is all men flown down 
                        from the Chinese invasion at Unsan.

                                 BOB
                        Invasion?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes. We’ve got three floors just 
                        like this.

           The doctor opens the door. It’s an entire floor of severely 
           wounded American and South Korean soldiers. The lines of beds 
           stretch across the entire building, with few aisles. They’re 
           all in bad shape.  Bob takes a step forward, taking in all 
           these hurt men.

                                 BOB

PYONGYANG FOOTBALL FIELD

           The stage is finished and Les Brown’s band sets up their 
           music and tuning up. The front rows have folding chairs, but 
           for the most part, the soldiers gathering out front sit on 
           the ground, many trying to keep warm in the increasingly 
           chilly air.

           From the stage, Fred spots Larry and Krupa and the three 7th 
           Cav GIs who gave Larry the coat.

           The writers gather around a table with Bob, punching up a 
           sketch. Larry enters, looped, in his commissar's outfit.

                        Ka-ching.  That works.

           Bob and Larry lock eyes.  Both know Larry meant it.  Mort and 
           Fred see it, too.  Chet’s oblivious to the looks as he jots 
           it down.  Bob doesn’t give in to Larry.

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, it does.

           Bob nods to Chet, who writes it down. Bob exits with Jimmy, 
           who shoots a look back at Larry like “what’s your problem?”

                                 MORT
                        You trying to get fired?

                                 FRED
                        If I can help in any way ...

                                 LARRY
                        There’s worse things than being 
                        fired.

                                 MORT
                        In show business?

           EXT. BACKSTAGE

           Hope rushes to find Marilyn with Jimmy in tow.  They pass the 
           7th CAV GIs we met at the Russian Embassy, now backstage, 
           eyeing Marilyn and scarfing craft service food with their 
           vodka.

           and crew.  Jimmy pulls one on as he talks to Bob, who hasn’t 
           changed his icy look.

                                 JIMMY
                        Larry’s a kid, he lost his temper.

                                 BOB
                        He’s a writer.  He’ll get over it. 

           Prescott waits for Bob backstage. Bob stays icy.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Mr. Hope? Could I take a look at 
                        the script before the show.

                                 JIMMY
                        The script?

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Yes. I’d like to report back to 
                        General Almond the tone of the 
                        show.

                                 BOB
                        Sure.  Jimmy, give him the run 
                        through, will ya?

                                 JIMMY
                        Right away.  

           Jimmy hands the Prescott his own copy.  A GI shyly comes up. 
           For the SHY GI, Bob warms up.

                                 SHY GI
                        Uh Mr. Hope?  My brother and me are 
                        from Akron, he’s a huge fan --

                                 BOB
                        Ohio boys?  I’m from Cleveland.

                                 PRESCOTT
                           (looks up)
                        I thought you were born in England.

                                 BOB
                           (icy)
                        Yeah. But I’m from Cleveland. 
                           (to the Shy GI)
                        I came over when I was three. It 
                        was that or marry the girl.
                           (as the Shy GI laughs)
                        Jimmy, an 8x10 for ...?

                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)                                   (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)           Jimmy has one ready and hands it to Bob with a pen.

                                 SHY GI
                        Willie.

                                 BOB
                           (as Bob signs)
                        Willie boy.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        No, he said “Willie.”

           Everyone looks at Prescott for a second as if to say “we 
           know.” The Shy GI leaves as Prescott scans the script.

                                 BOB
                        Lemme know if you have any good 
                        jokes.

           Prescott sits down in the background to read the through the 
           scripts.  WE HEAR the band warm up with “Buttons and Bows.” 
           Bob eyes Prescott, whistling along with the band. 

           ANGLE - BOB

           stepping away from Prescott. Bob peaks thru the curtains. 

           ANGLE - BOB’S POV

           Hospital staff seat wounded men in the front rows, in wheel 
           chairs, on stretchers, and those that are mobile in folding 
           chairs. It obviously pains many to move. As the sun goes 
           down, it’s C-O-L-D.

           Out back, soldiers pour into the football stadium.

           ANGLE - BOB

           Bob pauses, moved by the sight of all them. Prescott comes up 
           to him.  Bob is oblivious, in his own space for the moment.

                                 BOB
                        Wow, look at’m come. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Mr. Hope, there’s no monologue.  
                        This script starts on the second 
                        sketch.

           Bob pats his pocket, wishing Prescott would go away.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        May I see it?

                                 BOB
                        No, you kidding? Milton Berle could 
                        be right around the corner.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Sir, I seriously doubt Milton Berle 
                        would come all the way to Korea 
                        steal a joke.

                                 BOB
                        Oh, you don’t know Miltie. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Mr. Hope. I’m not kidding. 

                                 BOB
                        Me, neither. No. 

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Sir, we know the questions your 
                        writers are asking. You act like 
                        men gossiping in war is news. We 
                        all know what they’re saying. I can 
                        not allow you to undermine the war 
                        effort.

                                 BOB
                        Me undermine it? Me?  
                           (re the audience)
                        You think I’d do that to these 
                        guys?  

                                 PRESCOTT
                        Criticizing General MacArthur at a 
                        moment like this is un-American.

                                 BOB
                        Get outta here. I don’t need 
                        patriotism lectures from you.

                                 PRESCOTT
                        I can call my superior officers.

                                 BOB
                        And I can call theirs. What time is 
                        it in DC, Jimmy?

           Prescott backs down, walking off in a huff.

                        Would you really call Truman?

                        Not if I want to get back into the 
                        USA I wouldn’t.

           Bob shakes his head and walks off. He gets to his dressing 
           room where a Gomer Pile-like GI awaits him, standing guard.

                                 GOMER
                        Sir, I’ve been asked to assist you

                        Yes, sir.  

           Bob takes the notebook jokes out of his jacket.

                        Yes, sir.

           Bob, closes the door, sits down on a metal folding chair.  He 
           lays out the notebook pages, rereading them. Calmly, Bob 
           takes out a black marker and starts crossing out jokes.

           EXT. PYONGYANG UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL FIELD

           Larry, Krupa, Mort, and Chet walk out from the stage door. 
           They see thousands of troops waiting. Larry now wears an army 
           parka, like the other guys.

           The Les Brown orchestra strikes up Bob’s jaunty theme music 
           from “Fancy Pants.”

           INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Bob is freezing while Jimmy tries to get a US parka on him.

                                 JIMMY
                        You’ll get pneumonia.

                                 BOB
                        Will you quit? I’ll go out in my 
                        suit even if I freeze my ass off.  
                           (re parka)
                        That thing’s warm but it’s not ... 
                        funny.

           Just then, Bob’s eye catches something in the room the 
           writers were using: Larry’s discarded Russian fur hat and 
           long coat. WE HEAR:

                                 PA SYSTEM
                        Ladies and gentlemen, greetings 
                        from liberated Pyongyang!

           EXT. PYONGYANG UNIVERSITY FIELD

           The soldiers give themselves an extended CHEER.

                                 PA SYSTEM 
                        And now, please welcome the mayor 
                        of Pyonyang, Party Chairman, Bob 
                        Hope!

           Bob walks out in the Russian fur hat, long coat, and his nine 
           iron.  The soldiers are up on their feet, with something we 
           haven’t seen on many faces in Pyongyang – excitement, fun.

           BOB’S POV

           Of the wounded in the front row, applauding as best they can, 
           actually looking happy.

           ANGLE - PRESCOTT

           A skeptical look on his face, as he watches the show, arms 
           crossed, with GENERAL WALKER and other officers.

                        Yah. I see General MacArthur’s 
                        intel is as good as ever.

           ANGLE - LARRY AND KRUPA

           Along with Chet, Fred, and Mort. Larry looks just as 
           skeptical as the Prescott.

           who soaks up the applause, alpha-celeb that he is, with a 
           comical look of “for me?” on his face.  And then, at the 
           perfect moment ...

                        didn’t you hear you’re getting a 
                        change of enemy?

           There’s a pause, a Did He Really Say That Pause, and we hear 
           a “ooooooohhhhhh” rising from the troops, since they knew 
           exactly what it meant.

           ANGLE - WRITERS AND KRUPA

           The writers look confused as Krupa laughs. Larry smiles.

                           (to the marines)
                        Things really move around here. I 
                        took a cab over from the Pyonyang 
                        Hotel.  I paid the driver in US 
                        dollars, he spoke Russian, and I 
                        got my change back in Chinese yuan.  
                        At the Pyonyang the towels say 
                        “His, Hers, and Whose Sorry Now?”  
                           (waits out the laugh)
                        Seriously, I love it here with 
                        General Johnnie Walker in charge.  
                        He fits right in. Last week Johnnie 
                        Walker Black, this week Johnnie 
                        Walker Red. Sorry about that last 
                        one. In Pyongyang, the bombs just 
                        keep coming. But isn’t North Korea 
                        lovely this time of year?

           The GIs BOO loud and LONG. Bob looks surprised again:

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        No, you know what North Korea is. 
                        It’s Siberia with Chinese take-out.  

           There’s a pause as the troops can’t believe he said it, then 
           a big laugh.

           ANGLE - LARRY

           Fred, Chet, Larry, and Mort, all laughing, as a HUGE LAUGH 
           erupts from the troops. Mort marvels at it:

                                 MORT
                        He’s taking MacArthur apart and 
                        didn’t even say his name.

           ANGLE - BOB  

           Soaking up the greatness.

                        You know, we’re so close to the 
                        front I sent my laundry out and it 
                        came back with fortune cookie in 
                        it.  

           Bob looks at Larry, Chet, Fred, and Mort all watching the 
           show.  He makes the sign he made to them when he won the $100 
           from each of them.  He’s made his point.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I told my driver to take me where 
                        the action is around here.  He took 
                        me to General Walker’s tent.

           As Bob slips into the jokes we’ve already heard, WE CUT TO:

           EXT. PYONGYANG AIRFIELD

           Bob’s planes are ready to go on the runway.  The musicians 
           and tech crew board the planes behind them.  

           Bob and Marilyn sign autographs.  Troops on the tarmac 
           noticeably shiver, as they’re still in their summer uniforms.  
           Bob’s cast and crew all wear winter parkas and snow hats – 
           Bob still wears his Russian outfit.

           they shout to him:

           ANGLE - BOB

           The propellers on their C-54s crank up. Bob stays for every 
           last autograph and snapshot. One guy keeps coming back for 
           another and another, just excited to be near Bob Hope.

                                 BOB

           Bob signs it as the guy gets out of the way for another 
           soldier.  Larry comes up to Bob.

                                 LARRY
                        You changed your mind.

           The autograph hound is back and Bob starts signing.

                        I’ll do better.

           Bob takes his parka off and throws it to the soldier. 
           Following his example, Bob’s cast and crew take their parkas 
           and hats off and toss them to the shivering GIs, filling the 
           air them.

           ANGLE - THE WRITERS

           In their parkas as Jimmy nudges them to throw their parkas. 
           Finally they do, glaring at Bob. Bob and the writers wave 
           good-bye to the GIs on the tarmac. Bob stops to sign the 
           autograph hound’s parka, before jumping on the stairway to 
           the plane.

           The writers greet Bob, smiling with clenched, chattering 
           teeth.  Bob alone seems unaffected by the cold.

                                 MORT
                        Very generous, Bob. The guys need 
                        those parkas.  They’re freezing.

           (cid:13)           With that, Bob skips up the stairs, the writers knowing 
           exactly what he meant and follow him inside, with a little 
           less spring in their step.

           INT. PLANE

           Marilyn sits at her window seat in the front row, waving to 
           GIs.  Larry sits next to her.  Larry spots Bob coming down 
           the aisle and starts to get up.  Marilyn sees Bob, too.  She 
           grabs Larry’s hand for him to stay.  At the same time, Bob 
           puts a hand on Larry’s shoulder for him to sit.  Larry gets 
           it, and sits back, as Bob heads to the back of the plane. Bob 
           looks back at Marilyn for a second, then gives up.  He turns 
           to face Chet and Fred.

           the last to enter the plane. He watches the troops in the 
           distance, marching off in columns, headed North. He waves to 
           the last on the tarmac, who definitely want to go home with 
           them.  Mort finds it hard to hold back a tear.  Finally, he 
           enters the plane, and the door closes behind him, taxiing 
           down the runway, building towards it’s take-off. GIs remain 
           on the field, until Bob’s planes are completely out of sight.

           INT. NBC STUDIOS HOLLYWOOD (1950)

           Larry walks down the halls of Bob’s NBC offices with a big 
           box full of beer, salami, and ‘50s mens magazines. Larry 
           walks past Bob’s secretaries.

                                 SECRETARY
                           (eyeing a copy of KNAVE)
                        Another big Friday night, Larry?

                                 LARRY
                        Hilarious, ladies. This happens to 
                        be going to Captain Krupa. Have you 
                        heard where he’s stationed yet?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Not yet. Bob needs you in editing.

           Larry takes his box and heads down to editing. As he walks 
           down the hall, WE HEAR Larry's Captain Krupa sketch playing, 
           and the big laughs it got in Seoul.

Standing over 
           them is Chuck, the sponsor censor/rep.  They look grim.

                        Cut it.  Just cut it, and pick it 
                        up after with the Western sketch.

                        What?  You’re cutting my stuff?  
                        Play it back, it got laughs.

                                 BOB
                        We know it did Larry.

                                 LARRY
                        Why are we cutting funny? We never 
                        cut funny.

                        What am I supposed to tell Krupa?  
                        His family knows he’ll be on the 
                        show.

                        Larry.  John Krupa’s dead.

                                 LARRY
                        What?

                                 BOB
                        I know he was a friend.  But he’s 
                        dead.  He was shot down over North 
                        Korea. The fighting’s gotten bad.

                                 LARRY
                        I know.

           Larry sits down, the care package in his lap.

                                 BOB
                        There’s no way we can play the 
                        sketch.  His family -- 

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah. Wouldn’t be right.

                                 BOB
                        It’s a war, Lar.  It’s what 
                        happens.  People get hurt.

           The cast and crew are ready in the operating room.  Gary 
           Burghoff waits for them, looking impatient again.  The 45-
           year-old Larry stands next to the camera.

           From Larry’s jacket pocket he takes out the final script 
           page, folded long, in half, and hands it to Burghoff. WE SEE 
           Burghoff’s face as he absorbs what he’s about to say.
