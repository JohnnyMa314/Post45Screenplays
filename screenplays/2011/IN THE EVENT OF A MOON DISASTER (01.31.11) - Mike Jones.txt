               President in the event of mishaps on Apollo 11... like what 
               to do for the widows."

           INT/EXT. APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDER -- MOON.

           BLOOD DRIPS SLOWLY down the inside of an ASTRONAUT'S 
           faceplate, completely obscuring his face.  He's motionless.

           WE PULL BACK -- to ALARMS and RADIO STATIC.  The lunar 
           lander's instrument panel covered in flashing red and white.   

           The vessel is on its side, the bright moonscape beyond the 
           canted windows.  

           BACK MORE -- to another astronaut, NEIL ARMSTRONG (37), 
           struggling out of his harness.  

           Once free, Armstrong goes to his colleague, shaking him:  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Aldrin!  ALDRIN!  

           BACK MORE UNTIL WE ARE --

           OUTSIDE, ON THE LUNAR SURFACE.  

           Stark silence.

           BACK MORE -- a white stream of crystallized gas shoots from 
           the Eagle's ascent engine, impaled by a broken lander. 

           The brilliant lunar landscape is blanketed in white light.  

           Dust from a crash settles slowly in the moon's near-zero 
           gravity.  The black vacuum of space beyond. 

           BACK MORE -- to the EARTH in eerie repose, gazing on the 
           crash like a passive blue eye.

                                                                 BLACK:

                        Whoever it is will be bigger than 
                        Lindbergh.  He'll be a legend, an 
                        instant American hero. 

                                                               FADE IN:
           INT. WADE STEWART'S OFFICE.

           Two GLOSSY PUBLICITY PHOTOS on a desk:  Astronauts Neil 
           Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.  Both posed in flight suits behind 
           American flags, smiling.

           Four NASA directors look down at them, drinking coffee and 
           smoking:

           KYLE MCCARDELL (42), NASA Flight Director, eagerly making his 
           point to --

           WADE STEWART (45), the piss-and-vinegar head of NASA.

           Behind them -- WES GARRETT (40), NASA Publicity Director and 
           TAYLOR EMBREE (36), NASA Deputy Administrator.

                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        The problem is... Buzz wants it too 
                        much.

                                 WADE
                        What's wrong with that?  Hell, I 
                        want it too much but I ain't going.

           Kyle leans forward.

                                 KYLE
                        But Buzz wants it for himself, is 
                        my feeling.  Not for the country.  

           Wade soaks this in. 

                                 WADE
                        Wes, what do you think?

                                 WES
                        The first man to step on the moon 
                        will be the face of the Apollo 
                        program and NASA for all time.  
                        He's gotta be predictable.  I can 
                        build a publicity strategy much 
                        more easily around that.

           Wade nods, considering, changing his mind.

                                 WADE
                        So it's Armstrong.
                             (sighs)
                        A civilian.  I'll hear it from 
                        military.

                                 TAYLOR
                             (joking)
                        Mike is Army.  Send him.  Leave the 
                        other two in the orbiter.
           They chuckle as we see another picture on the desk, separated 
           from Aldrin and Armstrong.  MICHAEL COLLINS, posed exactly 
           the same way as his colleagues.  Yet there's something 
           distant in his eyes.

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        The guy's a fucking taxi driver.  
                        Easiest part of the job.

           INT. ASTRONAUT BRIEFING ROOM.

           TWO HANDS under a table ball up a napkin nervously. MICHAEL 
           COLLINS (36) looks blank-eyed at a mile-long checklist.  

                                 NEIL (O.S.)
                        Mike.

           Mike looks up to see Neil Armstrong holding out a pen at the 
           other end of the table.  The room is buzzing with people -- 
           ASSISTANTS, TECHNICIANS, MANAGERS, etc.  

           Next to Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin has finished signing something 
           and is walking away.  Mike walks over, looks down at his 
           publicity photo, cropped in a commemorative postal stamp 
           template.  SEVERAL POSTAL REPRESENTATIVES position them for 
           Mike.  

           There are three separate templates.

                                 COLLINS
                        Why three?

                                 POSTAL REP
                        One is for us, one is to take up 
                        with you and another is a 
                        remembrance... for your wife and 
                        family.

                                 COLLINS
                        A remembrance?  For our funeral?

           The postal rep's awkward silence confirms this.  Collins 
           doesn't sign the third one, tossing the pen back to the 
           postal rep and going back to his checklist.

                                 COLLINS (contâ€™d)
                        She won't want it.

           INT. COLLINS HOUSE.

           MELISSA COLLINS paces in front of her TV as a BABY CRIES in 
           another room.  
           On the mantle are pictures of Melissa with her husband, 
           Michael Collins, all over the world, always in each other's 
           arms.  

           Front and center is a large photo of Collins, Armstrong and 
           Aldrin posing behind the NASA logo.  She pulls a few family 
           photos in front of it, blocking it.

                                 CBS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        "With only days to go before the 
                        Apollo 11 liftoff, all eyes are on 
                        the Kennedy Space Center..."

           Finally, the baby's cries get louder.  Melissa, stressed, 
           walks to get the child.

           INT. LIBRARY. DAY

           A sign on an easel reads:  

           LONGVIEW WOMEN'S GROUP WELCOMES: Linda Aldrin, wife of Apollo 
           Astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

           LINDA ALDRIN, confident and smart, stands next to a screen, a 
           slide projector remote control in her hand.  A pointer in the 
           other.  On the screen is an illustration of Apollo's course 
           to the moon.

           In the audience are 30 WOMEN.  Some drinking coffee or taking 
           pictures as she takes questions.  

                                 WOMAN
                        What concerns you the most about 
                        the mission?

                                 LINDA
                             (smiles politely)
                        That they'll run out of coffee.  
                        The man can't put his pants on 
                        without it.

           The ladies laugh politely.

           EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE.

           ALICE ARMSTRONG opens the door to her house.  Outside, a 
           large camp of REPORTERS mill about.  One REPORTER notices her 
           as:

           RICKY, 6, comes up the sidewalk holding a donut.  She sweeps 
           him inside angrily.

                                 ALICE
                        Ricky, that's your third donut!
                                 REPORTER
                        Mrs. Armstrong!  A word please--?

                                 ALICE
                        No!  And for the love of god stop 
                        giving him donuts.  Please!

           INT. SUIT ROOM.

           Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin strip in front of a team of 
           SUIT TECHNICIANS, all dressed in white and wearing hair nets.  
           Each astronaut is handed a diaper, condom, tube, and waist-
           mounted collection bag.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Bio-sensors are glued to each man's chest.

                                                                CUT TO:

           It takes several technicians to help each man into the space 
           suit.  A lot of cramming, shifting, and groaning.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           The three astronauts, now in full gear, rest in lazy-boy 
           recliners.  They can't nap -- all have their eyes wide, 
           staring off, their minds alive and tense.

           EXT. NASA GRANDSTAND. DAY.

           Linda makes her way through the crowded bleachers to her 
           seat.  In the distance stands the Saturn V rocket.  Taking a 
           seat, she looks behind her to see Alice holding her son's 
           hand.  Elsewhere, Melissa sits with her fussy baby, trying to 
           settle it.

           INT. ELEVATOR.

           The three astronauts stand motionless as the tower elevator 
           lifts them slowly up the side of the Saturn V rocket, caked 
           in thick slabs of steaming ice.  

           The elevator reaches the top and each step out with their 
           respective assistant, walking toward the open hatch where 
           several other TECHNICIANS wait.  Armstrong is last as he 
           watches Mike and Aldrin squeeze into the rocket.  

           Armstrong looks into the horizon -- barren for about a mile, 
           then throngs of PEOPLE for as far as he can see.  
           Wade comes from behind him as Armstrong looks at the press 
           tents, campers, bonfires, and viewing stages sponsored by 
           every sort of American corporation.   

                                 WADE
                        The whole world is watching this.  
                        Even the unfriendly parts. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL -- KOROLEV, RUSSIA.

           A windowless building in the industrial city of Korolev, 
           cradle of Soviet space exploration.

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           The corresponding video image plays out on a giant screen in 
           Russia's version of Mission Control.  A photo of the first 
           man in space, Yuri Gagarin, hangs on the wall.

           The room, full of desks and controls, is only half full of 
           RUSSIAN TECHNICIANS, mingling in groups, pointing and 
           commenting on the U.S. rocket's features.  Some snicker.

           A couple of TECHNICIANS roll out an iced bucket of champagne.

                                 TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
                             (in Russian)
                        What's that for?

                                 TECHNICIAN (cont'd)
                             (in Russian)
                        When their little toy explodes! HA!

           The room erupts in LAUGHTER, some of it nervous.

           One technician doesn't laugh -- LUKA TARASOV (54) sits 
           smoking, eyes bloodshot, watching the screen, studying it 
           intensely.  He pulls out a flask, tosses the cold coffee in 
           his mug into the trashcan, and fills it with alcohol.

           GREGORI, his friend, steps in his line of sight.

                                 GREGORI
                        You should go home, Luka.

                                 LUKA
                        Get out of the way, Gregori.

           Gregori walks away.  Luka remains staring at the rocket, 
           troubled and far away, drinking. The superimposed countdown 
           on the screen hits 2 minutes.
           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           Kyle McCardell stands arms folded behind his console, looking 
           over a room full of CONTROLLERS and TECHNICIANS, each wearing 
           short sleeves and a black tie.  He speaks into his headset.

                                 KYLE
                        Controllers, I need your final go, 
                        no-go for launch. Retro?

                        Go.

                        Go.

                                 KYLE
                        CapCom?

           We remain on BRUCE POPE, 38, the direct radio link to the 
           astronauts.  Fittingly, Pope is a jolly Texan with a twangy, 
           smooth-as-silk voice.

                                 POPE
                        I'm a go, Flight.

           EXT. SATURN V ROCKET.

           The enormous Saturn V rocket drips with steam during the 
           final countdown:

                                 LAUNCH CONTROLLER (O.S.)
                        Four... three... two... one. 

           White clouds of smoke billow from Apollo's engines as the gas 
           is ignited, erasing the cloud in a giant ball of fire. Apollo 
           lifts slowly off the lander as:

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           The three astronauts are pressed into their seats, shaking 
           violently.

           EXT. VEIWING STAGES.

           Cameras slowly lift upward to catch the flight as other 
           people shield their eyes and strain to watch as Apollo begins 
           to disappear behind a streaking white and orange cloud.
           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           The room is quiet as the technicians watch the liftoff, until 
           someone blurts out:

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        KABOOM! HA HA!

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           Collins, Armstrong, and Aldrin each have their faces frozen 
           under the force of 4.5 Gs, their eyeballs pressed back into 
           their heads.  Suddenly the first-stage rocket separates.  

           EXT. APOLLO - CONTINUOUS

           The vessel is overcome by a giant fireball as the first stage 
           falls away, then shoots through it as the second stage fires.  
           The vessel pushes through the final bit of blue atmosphere 
           and into the blackness of space.  

           The launch needle is jettisoned, revealing its windows.

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE - CONTINUOUS

           White sunlight streams into the cabin.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We've got skirt sep.

           The vessel slows, entering 0-g.  In front of the astronauts 
           float a myriad of different items lost during the vessel's 
           construction -- bolts, nuts, washers, etc.  

           Armstrong unbuckles first, followed by Mike and Aldrin.  

                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        Apollo you are go for orbit.

           EXT. APOLLO

           In orbit at 300 miles per second, the vessel witnesses rapid 
           day and night as the sun flies around them -- "reds, golds, 
           blinding whites as fast as the snuff of a candle."

                                 COLLINS (O.S.)
                        Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INSIDE THE COMMAND MODULE, they look out the windows.  
                                 COLLINS (cont'd)
                        Goddamn that's pretty. Where's the 
                        Hasselblad?

           He drifts away to hunt for the camera. While Aldrin drifts to 
           the opposite window to look at the moon.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Have you thought at all about what 
                        it'll feel like?  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Emotionally?  I don't think about 
                        it.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Why not?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        My feelings aren't a part of this 
                        mission, now.  Shouldn't be a part 
                        of yours, either.

           Mike drifts back to the window with the camera, points the 
           lens just in time to watch the sun disappear behind the earth 
           again.  The blackness is overwhelming.

                                 COLLINS
                        Damn.

           Aldrin pats his shoulder and drifts away, leaving Mike to 
           look out the window -- white light rims the distant horizon, 
           there is nothing but deep black surrounding them.  

           INT. LIBRARY MEETING ROOM. DAY.

           Linda Aldrin is doing another presentation at a different 
           library.  Behind the audience, a few JOURNALISTS and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS snap photos.

           The slide on the screen is the same illustration of Apollo's 
           course to the moon, with the Command Module (CM) now 
           connected to the Lunar Module (LM) in mid-flight.

                                 LINDA
                        After Buzz and Neil finish their 
                        final surface experiments, they 
                        will ascend back into lunar orbit 
                        and re-connect with Mike Collins.

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Doesn't it worry you at all?

           Again, Linda smiles politely at the question -- one she's 
           answered countless times.
                                 LINDA
                        I'm most worried they'll run out of 
                        coffee.  Buzz can't hardly back out 
                        of the driveway without it.  

           As before, the ladies LAUGH except for one -- Alice 
           Armstrong.

                                 LINDA (cont'd)
                        Thank you.  

           The women APPLAUD.  Alice Armstrong approaches Linda as she 
           gets her things together.  

                                 ALICE
                             (smiling)
                        You're like me... can't sit home 
                        all day.

           Linda smiles.

           INT. RESTAURANT.

           Alice and Linda sit in front of half empty glasses of wine.

                                 ALICE
                        They bring donuts for Ricky.  He 
                        doesn't know any better so he just 
                        talks and talks.  The next day it's 
                        in the paper.  

                                 LINDA
                        Keep your sprinklers on.  All day.  
                        Your yard will be a mud pit like 
                        mine but it keeps the parasites on 
                        the street. 

                                 ALICE
                        Nice idea!

           They LAUGH. 

                                 LINDA
                        Why didn't we do this a long time 
                        ago, Alice?

                                 ALICE
                        Well, Neil will never say it but he 
                        was pretty angry by all that 
                        jockeying to be the first man.

                                 LINDA
                        Yes...
                                 ALICE
                        Can I ask you something then?  

           Linda sips the wine, nods her head.

                                 ALICE (cont'd)
                        Why did Buzz's dad write all those 
                        letters after they picked Neil?

                                 LINDA
                        Your dad ever come to your defense 
                        on something?

                                 ALICE
                        Yes.

                                 LINDA
                        Now imagine that, but with a 
                        retired Congressman who is just 
                        angling to get into it with 
                        someone.  Anyone.

           Alice LAUGHS.

                                 LINDA (cont'd)
                        And those letters to NASA... well, 
                        it just tore Buzz up.  Because what 
                        could he do?
                             (beat)
                        Now, I will say Buzz does have his 
                        issues with Neil.  But Buzz's 
                        fights are his own.  They're not 
                        mine.

           Alice smiles at this.  She lifts her glass in a toast.

                                 ALICE
                        Hey, I got an idea.  Let's go see 
                        Melissa Collins.

                                 LINDA
                        Oh she's gonna piss her pants when 
                        she sees us together.

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           As Mike cleans the 0-g latrine he looks through the CM into 
           the Lunar Module, watching Aldrin and Armstrong plan for the 
           descent.  He feels a bit left out.

           IN THE LUNAR MODULE, Armstrong and Aldrin are looking over a 
           series of lunar maps.  Armstrong points.
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        What's this?  The flight plan has 
                        us on two orbits before touchdown.  
                        Where'd this third orbit come from? 

                                 ALDRIN
                        So the computer can re-acquire the 
                        landing coordinates.  We've 
                        rehearsed it countless times in the 
                        sims...

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        And it wastes fuel every time.

                                 ALDRIN
                        We have the okay from Flight.  Kyle 
                        feels--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Wait, you talked with Kyle about 
                        this and not me?  
                             (yelling into the CM)
                        Mike!

                                 COLLINS
                        Yeah.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Did you know about a third orbit?

                                 COLLINS
                        We talked about it last week, 
                        didn't we?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (angry)
                        No, we didn't.

                                 ALDRIN
                        We only have one shot at the 
                        descent, Neil. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (shakes his head)
                        And I'm not doing it on an empty 
                        tank.  There's no reason to burn 
                        fuel for a third orbit.  Two 
                        orbits, then touch down.

           Armstrong floats away.  Conversation over.  Aldrin flings his 
           pen away, frustrated.  
           EXT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           The CM fires into lunar orbit, heading for the dark side of 
           the moon, careening away from the sun and earth and then 
           disappearing.  

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           Kyle, watching the monitors, barks to his controllers.

           Pope hits a stopwatch.  The entire control room is silent, 
           punctuating the ticking of the watch.

           INT. COLLINS HOUSE.

           Melissa, Linda and Alice watch the televised coverage of the 
           moon, drinking wine.

                                 MELISSA
                        Were either of you able to get life 
                        insurance for Neil or Buzz?

           Linda and Alice scoff.

                                 LINDA
                        After they said no, the rep asked 
                        if I could get an autograph for 
                        him.  I told him sure, on an 
                        insurance policy.

           Linda and Alice laugh.  Melissa doesn't.

                                 MELISSA
                        Mike has to come home.  I told him 
                        if something happened on the moon 
                        he needed to shoot back here.  

           Melissa wipes tears away as she looks at Linda and Alice.  
           Both fall silent, sad.
                                 MELISSA (cont'd)
                        Sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.

                                 ALICE
                        It's okay, honey.

           But Linda watches intently as Melissa says:

                                 MELISSA
                        Those vultures in my driveway ask 
                        me every day whether Mike would 
                        leave his friends on the moon.

                                 LINDA
                        What do you say?

                                 MELISSA
                        Wes told me to smile and laugh at 
                        the question.  
                             (beat, near tears)
                        How am I supposed to do that when I 
                        think about it all the time?
                             (beat)
                        The problem is... Mike thinks about 
                        things too much.  He imagines 
                        things and then convinces himself 
                        that they're real.  It's cute 
                        sometimes.  
                             (beat)
                        But not now.  

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           Collins and Aldrin gaze out the window as they pass into the 
           back side of the moon.  

           The lunar surface changes from the common pockmarked image to 
           DEEPLY SCARRED AND TREACHEROUS. This is the horrific, hidden 
           face of the moon.  The pulverized surface gives evidence of a 
           billion-plus years of constant assault -- a sight never seen 
           from earth.

           The sight affects Collins deeply.

                                 COLLINS
                        Christ.  Looks like hell. 

                                 ALDRIN
                        This is the side that gets the 
                        worst of it.

                                 COLLINS
                        Yeah, but think about it.  It used 
                        to be a part of the earth.
                                 ALDRIN
                        Well, that's a theory--

                                 COLLINS
                             (interrupting)
                        And theory says this piece of the 
                        earth was ejected into our orbit.  
                        So it sits out here and accepts the 
                        abuse of space and we don't.

                                 ALDRIN 
                        Where are you going here?

                        Do... do you think we're really 
                        welcome here?

           Aldrin cocks an eye at Mike, at a loss.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Mike, you gotta keep it together.  
                        You're our ride home.

                                 COLLINS
                        I'm fine.  I'm... just...

           Mike grabs a clipboard and goes back to his tasks.  Aldrin 
           looks intently at him.

                                 COLLINS (cont'd)
                        Really.  I'm fine.  

           Aldrin floats away.  Collins looks back at the moon.  As he 
           watches --

           -- the cratered, lunar surface bubbles and coalesces into a 
           FIELD OF SKULLS, their mouths frozen as if caught screaming 
           into deep space. 

           Collins shuts his eyes and shakes away the vision.  Looking 
           back, the skulls are gone.

           Pope stares at his stopwatch.  Forty-eight minutes have gone 
           by as he says over and over:

           A visible relief floods the room as shoulders relax and

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           Collins helps Armstrong and Aldrin, suited in their exterior 
           helmets and thick white suits, brace into their standing 
           positions in the Lunar Module (LM).  Armstrong runs through a 
           checklist in front of two thruster controls. Aldrin makes 
           some calculations into the computer.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Neil, look at this.  A third orbit 
                        would eat up only 18% of fuel--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Not saying no again.  

                                 ALDRIN
                        I know what to do.  I can do it.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You aren't the commander.  I mean, 
                        that gets to the heart of it, 
                        right?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Meaning what?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I know how hard you lobbied to lead 
                        this mission.  Your father even 
                        sent me a letter, for Christ's 
                        sake.  And when he didn't get what 
                        he wanted, he started questioning 
                        my integrity as commander.
                             (beat)
                        So did you, I hear.

           Aldrin, caught, looks long at Armstrong.

                                 ALDRIN
                        My issue was that you stick too 
                        close to a script.  NASA brass may 
                        love that, but in a clutch I 
                        wondered if you would go off-script 
                        in order to save the mission.  Or 
                        whether it'd be too late.  
                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        That's why I'd like a third orbit.
                             (beat)
                        So yes.  I made my concerns clear.  
                        You would have done the same.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (angry)
                        I would have done it to your face!  
                        You went behind mine!

                        Guys!

           They look behind them.  Collins has been there the whole 
           time.

                                 COLLINS (cont'd)
                        You're about to land on the moon. 

           He stares at them, both now silent.  Collins closes the door. 

           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           As the lunar module detaches from the CM, a POP of white mist 
           shoots from between the two vehicles.  

           INSIDE -- Armstrong turns to the sound, curious.  Aldrin 
           watches as the computer blinks off momentarily, scrambles, 
           then comes back on.

           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           The LM falls quickly toward the surface.  Craters, mountains, 
           and boulders become larger, more defined.  Shadows grow.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.  

           Armstrong and Aldrin stand at their positions.  Aldrin reads 
           from the instrument panel as Armstrong works the thrusters.

           A KLAXON SOUND and red warning light diverts their attention 
           to a digital alarm number reading 1202.

           Over Pope's shoulder, Kyle points to a young MIT grad, IRA

           Someone grabs the champagne and pops it open.

           A few stay seated, shocked, including Luka.  He stares at the 
           screen.  

           Someone brings out a model of the U.S. lunar lander and flies 
           it haphazardly around the room as the others laugh.  He's 
           about to crash it into the ground when --

           -- Luka bolts from his desk, grabs the technician's arm and 
           takes the model. He walks away to another room and closes  
           the door.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Armstrong and Aldrin are hunched over their controls, 
           motionless as Pope frantically calls to them:

                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        Houston to Eagle!  Come on, guys!  

           WE PICK UP THE FIRST SCENE AS --

           Armstrong moves first, slowly.  Unstrapping himself.  He 
           quickly goes to Aldrin, unstrapping him and turning him over.  
           The interior of Aldrin's face-plate is coated in blood, 
           obscuring his face.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Aldrin!  ALDRIN!

           He shakes him.  Aldrin reacts, wakes, starts to panic, 
           grabbing at the helmet.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Wait!  We have to pressurize!
           He takes Aldrin's gloved hand into his own, holding it.  It 
           seems to calm Aldrin as Armstrong flips several switches.  
           The cabin pressurizes quickly as Armstrong gazes at the 
           instrument readings.  

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        I have cabin pressurization!

                             (to Pope)
                        Get them on the radio! 

           Pope and Collins talk over each other frantically:

                          DUKE
                                                        COLLINS

           Eagle!?  Do you read us!?

                             (to Pope)
                        Shut him up!

                                 POPE
                        Columbia, maintain radio silence!   
                        Eagle!?  Come in, Eagle!  Over!

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Ignoring Houston, Armstrong rips off his gloves and helmet, 
           takes a cautious, stressful breath in, realizes it's fine, 
           then takes off Aldrin's helmet.

           Aldrin's face is a bloody mess from a broken nose and large 
           gash on his forehead.  

           Armstrong grabs at some towels as Aldrin takes off his 
           gloves. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Hey!  Hey.  You alright?  Buzz!?  

           Dazed, Aldrin nods.

                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        Houston to Eagle...

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (into headset)
                        Houston, Tranquility Base here.  
                        Eagle has crashed on the lunar 
                        surface.
           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           The news shocks the controllers.

                                 ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        We are lying on our aft side.  Hull 
                        has not been breached.  Pressure is 
                        steady.  We... we have separated 
                        from the descent engine, it seems.

                                 KYLE
                        How are they?

                                 POPE
                        Eagle, are you both okay?

                                 ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        Buzz got the worst of it.  Looks 
                        like he has a broken nose.  There's 
                        an open wound on his head.  
                             (beat)
                        He is... indicating that his arm is 
                        broken.

                                 POPE
                        Can he talk?

                                 ALDRIN (O.S.)
                        I can.  I'll be alright.

                                 KYLE
                        We need a full damage report on the 
                        LM right away.  As best as they can 
                        get it without stepping outside.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL -- BOARD ROOM.

           Wade Stewart steps into the busy Mission Control board room.  

           On a DRY-ERASE BOARD, a list of options stretch down -- all 
           have been crossed out.

           Kyle, Pope and Taylor Embree are pouring over schematics of 
           the Lunar Module with a horde of technicians looking over 
           their shoulders, adding comments, interrupting each other.  

                                 WADE
                        Hey.  HEY!  Everyone out of here 
                        but Kyle, Taylor and Pope.  Go. 

           It's met with INSTANT PROTEST before Kyle puts up his hand.

                                 KYLE
                        They want to be here, Wade.  We've 
                        been working on this hours--
                                 WADE
                        I want them all out of here!

           He pulls open the door as technicians, glaring at Wade, start 
           to file out.  He slams the door closed.

           Kyle and Pope stare at him, saying nothing.

                                 WADE (cont'd)
                        Now... where are we at?

           Kyle takes a breath and glides a finger over the LM's 
           schematic.

                                 KYLE
                        Neil says the LM landed on its aft 
                        side and separated from the descent 
                        engine.  As best we can tell they 
                        are 5 miles from the designated 
                        landing site...  

           KYLE CONTINUES TO EXPLAIN AS WE CUT TO:

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           AT THE SAME MOMENT, Luka looks at the tape of the crash, 
           pausing it just as the camera hits the lunar surface.

           He goes to the model of the LM, turning it over slowly on the 
           table to simulate the crash, studying which pieces hit 
           ground, as Kyle narrates:

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        The aft landing gear buckled.

           Luka snaps off one of the model's landing gears.

                                 KYLE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        The rendezvous radar was destroyed.  
                        Ascent guidance system is offline.  

           Luka snaps off the rendezvous radar dish.

                                 KYLE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        But the real damage is where the 
                        landing gear went after it broke.

           Luka follows where the buckled landing gear could have been 
           driven, seeing it goes right into the bottom portion of the 
           lunar module.
                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        It went into the oxidizer. 
                        Unfortunately, dinitrogen tetroxide 
                        is one of the most corrosive 
                        substances around so the leak 
                        turned into a gaping hole in a 
                        matter of minutes, we think. 

           Luka inspects closely the place that Pope describes, but it's 
           featureless.  He picks up a phone and dials.

                                 LUKA
                             (into phone)
                        Nikolai.  It's Luka.
                             (beat)
                        Yes, I saw it.  
                             (beat)
                        Well, I'm celebrating in my own 
                        way.

           He looks closely at the LM model.

                                 LUKA (contâ€™d)
                        Listen, I need to know more about 
                        this American-made piece of shit.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL -- BOARD ROOM.

           Back inside the board room, Wade shakes his head at the 
           schematics.

                                 WADE
                        So there's no oxidizer left?  What 
                        about in the lander?

                                 KYLE
                        Also gone, used up in the descent.

                                 WADE
                        And the Aerozine tanks?

                                 POPE
                        They're stable.

                                 WADE
                        But without the oxidizer they can't 
                        power the ascent engine.

                                 POPE
                        That's right.

           Beat.

                                 WADE
                        How long do they have?
                                 KYLE
                        If they do nothing, two or three 
                        days until the O2 is tapped.

           Wade sighs deeply.

                                 WADE
                        There are no work-arounds for a 
                        failed ascent engine, am I right?  
                        We got them for most every 
                        situation but this.  It's one shot 
                        and one shot only--

                                 KYLE
                        Wade--

                                 WADE
                             (interrupting)
                        Yes or no, Kyle.

                                 KYLE
                        I refuse--

                                 TAYLOR
                        That's correct.

           Kyle looks at Taylor harshly.

                                 TAYLOR (cont'd)
                        Come on, Kyle.  You know as well as 
                        I do that we've had a big fail rate 
                        on the ascent engines.  And every 
                        failure is permanent.  

           Kyle is about to argue when Wade interrupts:

                                 WADE
                        Okay, okay... Let's have the room 
                        work it.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           SUBTITLE:  Four hours later.

           A somber, darker air has set into the busy Mission Control 
           room.  By the looks on the controllers' faces it's not going 
           well.

           Kyle walks the room as controllers and technicians pour over 
           computers and schematics.  Wade paces in the back while 
           Taylor works the phones.

           Kyle stops at a desk of controllers.
                                 KYLE
                        What do you got?

                                 CONTROLLER
                        If Columbia can descend to 50,000 
                        feet, Eagle would only need 1000 
                        pounds of thrust to meet.

                                 KYLE
                             (into the headset)
                        Mike, you got that?

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           Mike works the computer.

                                 COLLINS
                        I got it.  What about guidance?

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           Kyle steers over to another set of controllers, led by GREG 
           (early 30s), young and easily stressed.

                                 KYLE
                        Guidance!?

                                 GREG
                        With the LM's system offline, it'll 
                        be all on Columbia's shoulders.  If 
                        Mike has to stray off course to 
                        catch the LM, he will burn out of 
                        fuel in 4 minutes.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Armstrong and Aldrin hover over charts.

                                 ALDRIN
                        But he can pitch into Area 2 and 
                        reacquire us at 32.852, correct?

                                 GREG (O.S.)
                             (flustered)
                        Uh... Are...Are you asking me?

                                 ALDRIN
                        I'm asking whoever can give me a 
                        fucking answer!
           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           Greg looks lost, dives back into his computer as Kyle lets 
           him have it.

                                 KYLE
                        Greg, get your head in this.
                             (turns to another team)
                        Life support!?

           Across the room, another team stands.

                                 TECHNICIAN

                        Okay, finally some good news.  
                             (turning to another)
                        Propulsion?

           This team in the far corner stays seated.  They've heard him 
           but seem afraid to answer.  Their leader, TED (40s), is 
           particularly stressed.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Tell me you have an option.

           The technicians, sweating and shirts unbuttoned, stressed, 
           can't answer.  Wade watches Ted closely.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Ted?  Any option.  

                                 TED
                             (explodes)
                        They have no oxidizer!  What can I 
                        do!?  I can't make oxidizer just 
                        appear on the fucking moon!

           Ted angrily clears off the console with a sweep of his hand.  
           The whole room goes silent.

                                 KYLE
                             (softly)
                        Pick it up.  

                                 TED
                        Kyle--

                                 KYLE
                             (interrupting)
                        Get back on it, Ted.
           Kyle walks away, noticing Wade is making his way to the door.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Wade!?  What are you doing?

                                 WADE
                        It's been four hours now.  I have 
                        to brief the president.  
                             (beat)
                        You know what to do.

                                 POPE
                        It's not time to pull the plug, 
                        Wade!  Not now!

                                 WADE
                             (angry)
                        Lucky for you it's not your call, 
                        Pope!

           Wade slams the door behind him.  

                                 ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        Pope?  What's going on?

           Pope looks at Kyle, lost.

                                 KYLE
                        I'll talk to him.

           He patches his headset into the console, taking a long time 
           to finally speak.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Neil... Wade is briefing the 
                        president.  He... he is moving 
                        forward on the moon disaster 
                        contingency.

           Across the room, controllers open their thick Mission 
           Guidelines binders to a particular section. 

           WE FOCUS ON ONE -- the binder is opened to a section titled: 
           MOON DISASTER SEQUENCE.

           Pope doesn't touch his binder.  Neither does Kyle.  

           INT. WADE STEWART'S OFFICE.

           The phone pressed to his ear and a hand pressed to his 
           temples, Wade is delivering the bad news into the phone.
                                 WADE
                        And without that chemical reaction 
                        there is no way to shoot the LM 
                        back into lunar orbit.
                             (beat)
                        No, the orbiter has no way to land 
                        on the surface.  The only choice 
                        Collins has is to come back home.
                             (beat)
                        Yes, Mr. President.  There's no 
                        question he'll come back.  His 
                        mission guidelines are clear.

           INT. COLLINS HOUSE.

           Wes Garrett sits on an coffee table in front of Linda and 
           Alice, who hold hands.  Melissa paces behind them nervously.  
           Several other NASA EXECS stand behind Wes.

                                 WES
                        Can I talk to you each... 
                        privately?

           Linda looks to Alice, who grips her hands like a vice, barely 
           keeping it together.

                                 LINDA
                        No.

                                 WES
                        Okay.
                             (beat)
                        Linda.  Alice.  Your husbands 
                        cannot be recovered from the lunar 
                        surface.

           Alice leans down, in tears.  Linda stares straight ahead, 
           thinking.

                        Melissa, Mike is coming back once 
                        he completes another orbit--

                                 ALICE
                        Are they dead?

                                 WES
                        I don't know.

                                 LINDA
                             (interrupting)
                        What does the lunar module's life 
                        support indicator say?
                                 WES
                        Like I said--

                                 LINDA
                             (interrupting)
                        You do know.  Mission Control can 
                        read everything inside the CM and 
                        LM.  So what does the LM say?

                                 WES
                        Even if life support is stable, 
                        they can't be recovered.

                                 LINDA
                        Say that again and I'll push your 
                        fucking teeth in!  ARE THEY ALIVE!?

                                 WES
                        Linda, you know as well as I do 
                        what's happening now.  According to 
                        mission guidelines, they will turn 
                        off the life support systems in the 
                        event that they can't be...
                             (eyes her carefully)
                        Recovered.

           Linda drains, knowing it's true.

                                 WES (cont'd)
                        I understand how overwhelming this 
                        is.  We have counselors for you 
                        after we notify the press.  That 
                        will happen in 30 minutes.  
                             (looking at his watch)
                        Now I think the president will be 
                        calling you any minute now...

           Linda closes her eyes, shutting him out.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE.

           A television camera and CREW along with the President's 
           CABINET MEMBERS stare as PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON looks over a 
           typewritten speech at his desk.  

           On the top of the page, we see the words: "IN THE EVENT OF A 
           MOON DISASTER" from speech-writer William Safire.

           Television lights bake the room.  The President's anxious 
           CHIEF OF STAFF stands next to the camera, looking at the 
           monitor.

           The President takes a deep breath, then nods.  A RED LIGHT 
           above the camera turns on.
           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           In one corner, a TV interrupts its programming to show a view 
           of the Oval Office.  

           The President sits behind the desk, holding the speech.

           Every controller freezes in place to watch.

                                 PRESIDENT
                        My fellow Americans...
                             (beat)
                        Fate has ordained that the men who 
                        went to the moon to explore in 
                        peace will stay on the moon to rest 
                        in peace.

           Pope has to sit down, burying his head in his hands.  Kyle 
           stares angrily at the TV, thinking a mile-a-minute.

                                 PRESIDENT (cont'd)
                        These brave men, Neil Armstrong and 
                        Buzz Aldrin, know that there is no 
                        hope for their recovery. But they 
                        also know that there is hope for 
                        mankind in their sacrifice.

           Armstrong and Aldrin, heads down, listen through their

                        These two men are laying down their 
                        lives in mankind's most noble goal: 
                        the search for truth and 
                        understanding.

           EXT. COLLINS HOUSEHOLD.

           Hordes of PRESS with cameras, tape recorders and notebooks 
           begin to rush toward Melissa Collins' house as several 
           GOVERNMENT MEN carrying briefcases step up to the front door, 
           letting themselves in.

                                 PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                        In their exploration, they stirred 
                        the people of the world to feel as 
                        one; in their sacrifice, they bind 
                        more tightly the brotherhood of 
                        man.

           A row of POLICE MEN stop the press onslaught as Wes holds out 
           his hands to calm them.

                                 PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                        In ancient days, men looked at the 
                        stars and saw their heroes in the 
                        constellations.

           Technicians stare at the screen in shock and disbelief.

                                 PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                        In modern times, we do much the 
                        same, but our heroes are epic men 
                        of flesh and blood.

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           The champagne party has stopped dead as Russian technicians 
           put their glasses down to listen to someone standing next to 
           the TV, translating the president's words.

                                 PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                        Others will follow, and surely find 
                        their way home. Man's search will 
                        not be denied. But these men were 
                        the first, and they will remain the 
                        foremost in our hearts.

                        at the moon in the nights to come 
                        will know that there is some corner

                        I got about a minute before I'm out 
                        of contact.  What can I do?

                                 ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        If we can't launch off this rock, 
                        then there's nothing you can do.

                                 COLLINS
                        Think you'll still be here when I 
                        swing back?

           Long beat.

                                 ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        I... I don't know, Mike. 

           The shadow of the moon rushes toward the command module.  
           Collins tries to get a words out.

                                 COLLINS
                        I'll... I'll try you again...

           The module is consumed in black.

           INT. CBS NEWSROOM.

           The CBS Anchor talks to GIL MCDONOUGH, the science 
           correspondent.  Gil holds models of the Command Module and 
           Lunar Module.

                                 GIL
                        One theory is the small space 
                        within the docking mechanism wasn't 
                        pressurized.  So when the locks 
                        were released, a pop of air pushed 
                        the LM away at a faster rate of 
                        speed. 

           Using the models, Gil glides the LM away from an X on the 
           table.
                                 GIL (cont'd)
                        As they reached the surface, the 
                        error had grown exponentially until 
                        they were way off course. We don't 
                        yet know why their on-board 
                        computer couldn't reacquire, unless 
                        it went down.  If it did, these two 
                        errors created the perfect set of 
                        circumstances for this disaster.

                        And NASA says they probably 
                        perished during impact.  But if 
                        they didn't?

                                 GIL
                        If the ascent engine is destroyed, 
                        there is no hope.  In that event, 
                        Armstrong and Aldrin will shut off 
                        the life support system and pass 
                        away peacefully.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           The two main components of the wrecked lander lay among 
           smaller pieces scattered on the moon's surface.  The light of 
           the unfiltered sun covers it all in white.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INSIDE, Armstrong puts his hand on a lever.  

                                 ALDRIN
                        How long will we have?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        About twenty minutes.  You should 
                        just... try to breathe normally.

                                 ALDRIN
                        I think I stopped breathing 
                        normally three days ago.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (into headset)
                        Houston.  Columbia.  We are cutting 
                        life support now.

           He pulls the lever.  A machine somewhere within the LM winds 
           down and stops, leaving a deathly silence.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           CLOSE on an console indicator reading LM LIFE SUPPORT.  It 
           goes from green to red.  The controller turns to Kyle.  Wade 
           and Taylor stand behind him.

                                 CONTROLLER
                        I have life support shut-off.

           Kyle says nothing, steaming.  Wade pats him on the back and 
           leaves.  Taylor, after a beat, follows him.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Silence.  Armstrong looks up at Aldrin.

                                 ARMSTRONG 
                        I'm sorry, Buzz.

                                 ALDRIN
                        It's not your fault.  There's 
                        nothing we could have done.  A 
                        third orbit wouldn't have helped 
                        with a failed computer.

           Long beat.  Aldrin pulls out a photo of himself and Linda, 
           smirks at it.

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        She's pissed.  I just know it.  I 
                        almost feel pity for whoever gets 
                        ripped a new one by her.  

           He sees Armstrong just looking at the ground.

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                             (re: the photo)
                        Where's yours?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Rather not look at it.

           Aldrin notices a tear that Armstrong wipes away quickly.

                                 ALDRIN 
                        You okay?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        It's just... why wouldn't they let 
                        us talk to them, for christ's sake?

                                 ALDRIN
                        It's easier if we die quickly.
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Easier on our wives?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Easier on the world, probably.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I would have liked to talk to them.  
                        To her...  To my boy...

           Another tear falls, this time Armstrong lets it.  In the near-
           zero gravity it floats slowly down.  It shocks Aldrin.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Hey.  Look at me.

           Armstrong looks at him.  

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        You feeling okay about this?

           Armstrong says nothing, doesn't have to.

                                 ALDRIN (contâ€™d)
                        Look... mission guidelines brought 
                        us here.  And now mission 
                        guidelines will tell us how to die?  
                        What do you think about that?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I gotta say... you know... I don't 
                        like it.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Neither do I.  So... so how about 
                        this.  They've already decided 
                        we're dead.  But... how about we 
                        decide how we're going to die?

           Armstrong looks at him.  This is making sense.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        What are you thinking?

                                 ALDRIN
                        We got enough water and food for 
                        three days.  Don't know about the 
                        O2--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I was thinking about that.  Between 
                        the LM's scrubber and the suits I 
                        think we can last a week.
                                 ALDRIN
                        We can rig the solar cells from the 
                        relay experiment to recharge the 
                        batteries.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        That's true.

                                 ALDRIN
                        So... we have options, Neil.  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        What about your arm?

                                 ALDRIN
                        This suit might as well be a full 
                        body cast.

           Armstrong considers, smiles.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You know, they tested an edible 
                        skin for this thing (re: the LM)?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Is that right?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Tasted so bad they thought death 
                        would be better.

           The astronauts LAUGH -- the first time in a long while.

                                 ALDRIN
                        And I was thinking about something 
                        else... we're gonna kill each other 
                        if we stay cooped up in this can.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Probably.

                                 ALDRIN
                        So... how about we go for a walk?
                             (beat)
                        What's stopping us?

           Armstrong thinks on this, smiles, flips the lever back up.  
           The machine winds back into action.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (into headset)
                        Eagle to Houston.
           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           CLOSE on the life support indicator as it goes back to green.

                                 CONTROLLER
                        I have life support back online!

                                 ARMSTRONG (O.S.)
                        Eagle to Houston, do you copy?

           Pope looks at Kyle.

                                 POPE
                        What do we do?

                                 KYLE
                        Answer him.

                                 POPE
                             (into headset)
                        Go ahead, Eagle.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We're going to step outside.

                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        Uh... stand by...

           Armstrong smiles at Aldrin, who coyly smiles back.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Ten bucks it'll be a no.

                                 ALDRIN
                        That's a sucker bet.

           They burst out laughing just as:

                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        Houston to Eagle.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Go ahead.

                                 POPE (O.S.)
                        Uh... negative on the excursion.  
                        Flight says you are to remain--

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (interrupting)
                        Houston, we're not asking 
                        permission.  Just wanted to let you 
                        know where we'll be.
                                 ALDRIN
                        We've also decided to stretch the 
                        survival capabilities of the LM in 
                        order to explore the lunar surface. 
                        We'll be reporting our findings... 
                        if anyone is listening.

           INT. WADE STEWART'S OFFICE.

           Wade Stewart is pacing with the phone to his ear, listening. 
           Taylor looks on, concerned.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF (O.S.)
                        If there's no way of them getting 
                        off the moon, I see no reason for 
                        the president to re-address this.

                                 WADE
                        But the situation has changed.  
                        They want to proceed with the lunar 
                        walk--

           INT. OVAL OFFICE.

           The Chief of Staff turns away from the President as he meets 
           with advisors in the background.

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        They believe they can gather some 
                        valuable information--

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                             (interrupting)
                        No, they aren't proceeding with the 
                        lunar walk.  Because they're dead.  
                        That's what you told us, Mr. 
                        Stewart.  You said they're as good 
                        as dead.

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        What I said is--

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF
                        So now you want the world to watch 
                        them die?

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        There are other options--

                             (interrupting, harshly)
                        They are dead, Mr. Stewart.  
                                 CHIEF OF STAFF  (cont'd)
                        And the President has already read 
                        the contingency speech to the world

           INT. WADE STEWART'S OFFICE.

           Back in his office, Wade has gone white.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF (O.S.)
                        Do you see where this is going now?  

           Long beat.

                                 WADE
                        I... I do.

                                 CHIEF OF STAFF (O.S.)
                        Good.  Then take care of it.

           Wade hangs up the phone, stares at Taylor.  Suddenly, a wave 
           of anger overcomes him and he rushes from around his desk.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           Wade throws open the door, heading right to Kyle.

                                 WADE
                        Who the fuck gave the okay to

                        Pull him back.

                             (into mic)
                        Houston to Eagle...

           But Pope can't do it.  He shuts off the mic and turns to Wade 
           angrily.

                                 POPE (cont'd)
                        Hold up, here.  I don't get it.  
                        Why can't they do the lunar walk?

                                 KYLE 
                             (to Wade)
                        If they can get out of the LM they 
                        could relay some useful data for 
                        the next Apollo.
                                 WADE
                        If you think there is an Apollo 
                        program after this, you're deluded, 
                        Kyle.
                             (beat)
                        And the president doesn't want us, 
                        or the Russians, watching two men 
                        die on the moon.  It'll rank as the 
                        greatest snuff film of all time, 
                        negating any scientific advantage 
                        we gleam from that rock.

                                 KYLE
                             (confused)
                        So wait... We're having those guys 
                        kill themselves in the name of 
                        national security?

                                 WADE
                        Kyle, I wholeheartedly agree with 
                        the president on this.

                                 KYLE
                             (shocked)
                        You do!?

                                 WADE
                        Yes.

           Kyle eyes him, noting the distinct change in Wade.

                                 KYLE
                        Look, we've already cut the video 
                        and audio feed to the press, Wade.  
                        We can keep it all internal--

           Frustrated, Wade steps up to the CapCom, yanks the headset 
           off of Pope, and puts it on.

                                 WADE
                        Hey... Neil?  It's Wade.

           Long beat.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER - CONTINUOUS

           Armstrong and Aldrin both look up.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Uh oh.  Dad's on the phone.

           Armstrong smiles as he starts pulling out the EVA suits.
                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        I know you can hear me, fellas.  
                        Look, I... uh... I can appreciate 
                        your effort.  But... I want to 
                        speak to the spirit of the mission, 
                        here.  Particularly to you, Neil.  

           Armstrong stops what he's doing to listen.

                                 WADE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        As commander, you understand the 
                        need for clear mission procedures 
                        when things go wrong.  As difficult 
                        as they are, there is a higher 
                        reason for these procedures.  There 
                        is a discipline in them.  It is 
                        born of that same discipline that 
                        got us into space in the first 
                        place.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           Wade lifts his eyes, speaking now to the entire control room 
           now.

                                 WADE
                        It is discipline that sets us aside 
                        from the animals.  It is god's 
                        great gift to us.  To go against 
                        this discipline is to embrace chaos 
                        and to give in to the 
                        uncontrollable.  And that is not 
                        what NASA is about.  Not while I'm 
                        running it.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER - CONTINUOUS

           Armstrong and Aldrin, heads down, take this in.

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        You are great men.  Your 
                        accomplishments will be remembered 
                        forever.  And cemented in history 
                        by your sacrifice. 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           Wade is having a hard time with this, but swallows it down.

                                 WADE
                        As per mission guidelines, Mission 
                        Control is now ending communication 
                        with you.  We wish you god speed.
           He yanks off his headset, depressed the radio button to off, 
           and walks away, wiping his eyes.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Aldrin and Armstrong remain heads down, like two scolded 
           children.  It hits Armstrong hard as he looks out to the 
           lunar surface. 

           Suddenly, a helmet nudges him -- pushed to him by Aldrin.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Dad's never been any fun.

           INT. KGB BUILDING.

           A SECRETARY brings Luka to an office where NIKOLAI, a sturdy, 
           rotund Russian of 46, comes quickly around his desk.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Luka Tarasov in a KGB Building!  
                        What a day this turned out to be.

                                 LUKA
                        The day's not over, Nikolai.  

           He sits heavily. 

                                 LUKA (cont'd)
                        My sister tells me that she doesn't 
                        approve of you drinking at work.

           Luka cocks an eyebrow at him.  Nikolai smiles and brings out 
           a bottle and two coffee mugs, filling them liberally.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        So what's the interest in the 
                        American's ship?

                                 LUKA
                        Curiosity.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Are you sure it's just that?

                                 LUKA
                        I'm never sure about anything.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        You know, Soyuz 4 wasn't your 
                        fault, Luka.  

           Luka doesn't reply.  He downs his drink.
                                 LUKA
                        What can you tell me about the 
                        lander?

                                 VIKTOR (O.S.)
                        What lander?

           Luka turns to VIKTOR ANDREEV, glaring at him from the 
           doorway.

                                 NIKOLAI
                             (nervous)
                        Luka, Viktor Andreev is head of 
                        operations--

                                 LUKA
                        Yes, I know Viktor.

           The two regard each other steely.  Some history is between 
           them, much of it not good.

                                 VIKTOR
                        Feeling good about today, Luka?

                                 LUKA
                        Why?

                                 VIKTOR
                        Evens the playing field, no?

           Luka shrugs.

                                 VIKTOR (cont'd)
                        Yet here you are, looking for what?

                                 LUKA
                        I want to see what you have on the 
                        American lander.  

                                 VIKTOR
                        Why?

           Beat, as Luka reads the situation.

                                 LUKA
                        You know me, Viktor.  I'm an 
                        engineer.  I want to see if they 
                        could have made it, or whether my 
                        celebration is premature.

           He toasts the mug of vodka to Viktor.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Okay if I take him downstairs, 
                        Viktor?
           Viktor thinks on it, only mildly trusting Luka.

                                 VIKTOR
                        You'll tell me what you discover 
                        afterwards, yes?
                             (to Nikolai)
                        Let him see the pictures, too.

           INT. KGB BUILDING - SUB BASEMENT.

           Nikolai drops a box onto a table.  Luka opens it and starts 
           pulling out documents, finding photos of the lunar module 
           schematics -- the same ones we saw in the Mission Control 
           Board room.

                                 LUKA
                        Why weren't these shared with us?

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Like their landing coordinates, a 
                        lot of fingers were cut off to get 
                        these.  Viktor wasn't about to let 
                        a bunch of scientists leak them.

           Nikolai watches him, concerned.

                                 NIKOLAI (contâ€™d)
                        Luka, what are you really doing 
                        here?  This is all politics, now.  
                        You've never cared for politics.

                                 LUKA
                        Oh, I care about politics, Nikolai.  
                        Very much.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Since when?

                                 LUKA
                        Well... I remember that American 
                        president standing in front of the 
                        United Nations.  Six years ago.  He 
                        offered a joint voyage to the moon.  
                        A Russian/United States mission.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Luka--

                                 LUKA
                        Think of that, Nikolai!  Think what 
                        that would have done!  And 
                        Krushchev was willing!  Can you 
                        imagine what a different world we'd 
                        be living in now?  
           Nikolai is silent.

                                 LUKA (cont'd)
                        Two months later that American 
                        president was assassinated.  He 
                        became a martyr for their own lunar 
                        mission, and a reason for our hasty 
                        one.  Science became a race.  And 
                        we lost.  

           Nikolai watches Luka study the schematics as it dawns on him:

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Wait... You want to save them?  You 
                        want to save the Americans?

           Luka doesn't answer as he looks deeply at the schematics, 
           following where the collapsed landing gear could have entered 
           the LM -- right into a tank labeled "oxidizer."

           Luka's eyes widen.

                                 LUKA
                             (to himself)
                        It's not a mechanical engine. 
                             (beat)
                        It's a chemical one.

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Luka--!

           Luka glides his finger to another tank labeled "Aerozine."  
           Both tanks are joined by a pipe, leading to the engine 
           funnel.

                                 LUKA
                        These two chemicals mix to cause a 
                        directed, consistent explosion.  
                        Control the explosion and you can 
                        control the thrust.  The hard part 
                        is designing a valve...

           Luka eyes the design closely, tracing the mechanics with an 
           index finger.

                                 LUKA (contâ€™d)
                        Impressive.   

                                 NIKOLAI
                        Luka, stop this!  This will get you 
                        killed.

           Luka turns on his heel and walks quickly out.

                             (interrupting)
                        Chances are it's not even the right 
                        oxidizer.

                                 LUKA
                        I'm willing to take that chance.

                                 GREGORI
                        But Luka--

                                 LUKA
                        Even if it's not, they only need 
                        about 1600 kilos of thrust to get 
                        into lunar orbit.  The docking will 
                        be tricky since I think their 
                        ascent radar was destroyed, too--

                                 GREGORI
                             (interrupting)
                        Let me get this straight. In the 
                        best situation, the Americans are 
                        able to walk many kilometers, 
                        retrieve the tank, and drag it back 
                        to their ship.  And even if they 
                        ascend, re-join with their orbiter 
                        and come home...
                             (beat)
                        Even if all that happens, we still 
                        get shot.
                             (beat)
                        If you lead them to Soyus 4, Luka, 
                        this country will erase us.

                        The man who built their Saturn 
                        rockets also built missiles for the 
                        Nazis.  The same ones that rained 
                        down on London.  He got a second 
                        chance when he surrendered to the

           Long beat as Gregori battles with this, finally nodding.

                                 GREGORI
                        What do we do first?

                        Switch from champagne to vodka.

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL -- MEETING ROOM.

           A case of vodka is placed on the table as the Russian 
           technicians file in with their empty champagne glasses, 
           laughing.

                                 LUKA
                        Gentlemen, please. Let me have a 
                        moment.

           They all quiet down as Luka goes around the room, pouring 
           glasses.  The Russian controllers are impressed.

                                 LUKA (contâ€™d)
                        As you know, I haven't been myself 
                        lately.  And I want to thank you 
                        for your patience.  I've taken our 
                        failures to heart.  I've taken 
                        them... personally.  And I've let 
                        it show in my work with you.  So 
                        let me say I'm sorry by filling 
                        your glasses with some of the best 
                        northern Russian vodka that money 
                        can buy.  

           He pours a glass for himself and lifts it in a toast.

                                 LUKA (contâ€™d)
                        Lift your glasses, controllers.  
                        Here's to our Soviet Union!  May 
                        she remain forever victorious in 
                        this endless fucking war! HA!

           The controllers, not seeing the joke, laugh nervously.  Luka 
           watches as they all drink and start talking with one another.  
           When the moment is right, he steps out of the room, closes 
           the door --

           -- and locks the controllers in.

           He tosses the keys to Gregori, who begins locking other doors 
           before going a main power console and activating several 
           large switches.  

           Computers begin to power up.  The large tracking screen turns 
           on.
           Gregori goes to the communications console and puts on a 
           headset.  Luka sits next to him.

                                 GREGORI
                        How long do you think we have?

           Luka shrugs, glancing at the locked room of technicians.  No 
           one yet realizes they've been locked inside.

           INT. KGB BUILDING

           Viktor stops by Nikolai's office, confused.

                                 VIKTOR
                        Where's Luka?

                                 NIKOLAI
                        He had to go.  He... asked me to 
                        send his regrets to you--

                                 VIKTOR
                             (interrupting)
                        What was more urgent than talking 
                        to me?

           Nikolai has no answer, says nothing.

                                 VIKTOR (cont'd)
                        Nikolai, why was he here?

           Nikolai looks down.

                                 VIKTOR (cont'd)
                        Nikolai!  Why was he here!?

                                 NIKOLAI
                        I think he wants to end the war.

           Viktor stares at him, confused.  He steps away and starts 
           running as it sinks in.  He yells to his secretary:

                                 VIKTOR
                        Get every man to the flight control 
                        building.  And call the police!

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           Gregori and Luka are busy at the communications console.

                                 GREGORI
                        After we open communications we'll 
                        have the police at the doors in 
                        probably 30 minutes.
                                 LUKA
                        Gregori, you should go. This was my 
                        decision.

                                 GREGORI
                             (shakes his head)
                        You were right, Luka.  I'm not 
                        building warheads again.

            Gregori flips a switch.

                                 LUKA 
                        Who do you think will pick it up?

                                 GREGORI 
                        The Americans have a station in 
                        Turkey.  They picked up everything 
                        during the Soyuz 1 crash.  After 
                        that we turned off transponder 3.  
                        Let's turn it back on.

           Gregori makes a few adjustments, checks the connection, then 
           nods.

                                 GREGORI (cont'd)
                        How should we start?

                                 LUKA
                        Start reciting the coordinates. 
                        Over and over again with a delay 
                        between each transmission in case 
                        we get a response.  

           Gregori looks on a map of the moon next to him.

                                 GREGORI
                        What are the coordinates?

                                 LUKA
                        It's .8432 degrees North, 25.482 
                        degrees East.

           Luka knows them by heart.  Gregori looks at him, nods.

                        What do the Americans say?  To end 
                        it?

                                 LUKA
                        Uh...  Over?
                                 GREGORI
                        Yes.  Over.

           They wait.  No response.

           Luka takes a deep breath, leans back in the chair.  He looks 
           to the locked room of technicians.  A couple have their eyes 
           pressed to the glass as another keeps trying the door.  Luka 
           sees it's attracting the attention of the others.  

           They don't have much time.

           EXT. NATO COMMUNICATIONS SUB-STATION -- TURKEY.  

           A lone communications tower sits on a tall hill in northern 
           Turkey.

           INSIDE -- a TURKISH COMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTOR sits feet up 
           at desk wearing headphones, drinking tea.  Hearing something, 
           he sits upright.  Confused, he grabs a paper and pencil and 
           writes down the coordinates.

                                 TURKISH INTERCEPTOR
                             (in Turkish, subtitled)
                        Ali!  

           His colleague, ALI, strides over, grabs another headset, and 
           starts listening.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Finished with putting on their EVA suits, Armstrong and 
           Aldrin check each other for rips, then check the pressure 
           gages.  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You're good.

                                 ALDRIN
                        All right.  Let me check your mix.

           He bends down to look at a readout on Armstrong's chest, 
           nudging his broken arm against the console.  He shudders in 
           pain.

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        Shit!
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You sure you're gonna be able to do 
                        this?

                                 ALDRIN
                        No.  Look, this isn't a good idea.  
                        I'm just gonna slow you down.

           Armstrong considers, then shakes his head.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        No, we're getting you out.  

           He looks up at the hatch -- just above them. 

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        First I gotta get me out.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Here.  Grab hold of the lock and 
                        stand on my shoulders.  

           In 1/6 gravity, Armstrong pulls himself up as Aldrin gets 
           under him, wincing all the way.  Battling with the bulky 
           suit, he opens the hatch and looks up at the black space 
           outside, dotted with millions of stars.

                                                                CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE, Armstrong grabs hold of both sides and pulls himself 
           up through the hatch, gets a knee on the ledge and stands.

           The landscape is stunning.  Millions of stars hanging in the 
           blackest of black above a smoky, desolate landscape.  
           Armstrong takes it in, awestruck, frozen.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Wow.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Lying on his stomach, Armstrong reaches for the modular 
           equipment stowage assembly and releases the latch.  Inside is 
           every tool they need for the outside -- and a TV camera.  As 
           soon as the latch is opened, the "live" light goes red.  

           Oblivious, Armstrong grabs a rope.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           A COMMUNICATIONS CONTROLLER at a desk speaks into his

                        .8432 degrees North, 25.482 degrees 
                        East.  Right.  And where did this 
                        originate from?  

                                 TECHNICIAN (O.S.)
                        We got picture!

           Suddenly, the other controllers in the room GASP.  He stands, 
           seeing a televised image on the big board of Armstrong 
           grabbing a rope.  When he pulls out of frame, the first 
           images from the surface of the lunar landscape cause everyone 
           to CHEER.

                                 CONTROLLER 
                        Tell Armstrong we see him!

           Pope grabs the headphones, forgetting the situation 
           momentarily.  He looks at Kyle, whose sudden enthusiasm fades 
           quickly to disappointment.  Pope puts the headset down.

           The Com Controller approaches Kyle, handing him the paper 
           with the coordinates.  Kyle walks back over to the 
           controller's desk.

           But the noise of angry controllers yelling at Pope is 
           overwhelming.

                        Quiet!

           The room silences at this burst of anger.  Kyle leans into 
           the Com Controller privately, gravely.

           INT. NASA -- MEDIA PARKING LOT. DAY.

           We follow a thick cable running into an NBC TV affiliate van.  
           Suddenly the van door slams open as a REPORTER bolts out.  

           Inside, several TVs show the first images from the moon.

           INT. CBS NEWSROOM.

           NEWS ROOM EMPLOYEES are on their feet at the TV images.  A 
           CBS NEWS ANCHOR quickly sits at the set as a CAMERAMAN gives 
           him the signal.

                                 CBS ANCHOR
                        We are interrupting programming to 
                        report on a startling development 
                        from NASA.  We are receiving what 
                        appear to be live images from the 
                        moon...

           MONTAGE -- THE WORLD WATCHES. 

           All over the world, PEOPLE stop what they're doing to watch a 
           TV, transfixed at the images.  

           INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE.

           Alice is being counseled by several government reps while her 
           SISTER comforts her.

           Ricky, eating another donut, points to the TV he's in front 
           of.

                        Dad!  

           Alice looks up, shocked.  She runs to the TV.  

           INT. NASA PRESS ROOM.

           A clueless Wes Garrett is surrounded by screaming REPORTERS.

           INT. OUTSIDE WADE STEWART'S OFFICE.

           Wade runs out the door.  EMPLOYEES are gathering just outside 
           his office.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Wade, is it true?  Are they 
                        outside!?

           Furious, Wade doesn't answer, running at full gallop down the 
           hall.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           Wade bursts into the room, pointing at Kyle.

                                 WADE
                        Cut that goddamn feed!

                                 KYLE
                        I won't.

           Wade turns to the Com Controller.

                                 WADE
                        You do it.

           The Com Controller does nothing. 

                                 KYLE
                        As Flight Director I have sole 
                        authority over this room.  And this 
                        room is here to help those guys.

           Wade grabs a thick binder from a controller's desk.  It's 
           reads in bold letters APOLLO MISSION GUIDELINES.  

                                 WADE
                        This room is here for this.  A 
                        failed ascent engine is an 
                        unrecoverable event.  The decision 
                        was made.  The President has sealed 
                        it.

                                 POPE
                        We get procedure, Wade.  Problem is 
                        they don't want to commit suicide 
                        just yet. 
           Wade looks around the room.  Every technician stares at him 
           with deep disdain, united.  Wade steps over to a red phone, 
           picks it up.

                                 WADE
                             (into the phone)
                        Security--

           A hand grabs the phone away, hanging it up.  It's Pope.

           Two other technicians come around behind Wade.

                                 WADE (cont'd)
                        They are my friends, too, Pope.  
                        But this is what they signed up 
                        for.  

           He makes a move for the phone.  Pope grabs it off the table 
           and yanks the cord from the floor.  

           Wade decks him and makes a run for the door but doesn't get 
           far as the two technicians tackle him, using the phone line 
           to hog-tie him.

                                 WADE (cont'd)
                        Let me the fuck go! Right now!!

           The technicians look to Kyle.  He's like a deer in 
           headlights, stunned at what he started.  Finally he's able to 
           snap out of it.

                                 KYLE
                        Gag him.  And put him in the 
                        closet.

           The technicians smile and do it.  The room is deathly silent 
           as Kyle looks out into the team of technicians.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Anyone want to leave, they can.  
                        But do it now.  Because we're 
                        barring the doors.

           A handful of technicians take off their headsets and walk 
           quickly, shamefully toward the door.  One stops to talk to 
           Kyle.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Kyle... I...

                                 KYLE
                        It's okay, Dan.

           Head down, he leaves.  The door is closed.  Two others push a 
           heavy desk in front of it while Wade is locked inside a 
           closet.
           Kyle looks at everyone.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        This is my room now.  And we are 
                        here for them.  Any mission 
                        guideline that goes against that is 
                        to be ignored.  Nothing and no one 
                        goes in or out of this room until 
                        we are done.  Understood?

           The controllers nod, smiling, eager. Kyle puts on a headset.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Neil?  Come in, Neil.  It's... 
                        Kyle.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER - CONTINUOUS

           INSIDE THE LANDER, Aldrin is tying the rope to his waist as 
           Armstrong holds the other end.  Armstrong hits the button on 
           his communicator.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Uh... Houston, I thought we were 
                        done communicating.

                                 KYLE (V.O.)
                        We're back.  Some of us.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Who's we?

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        You got me and Pope and a bunch of 
                        other guys.  We'll have all 
                        departments covered in some way.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        And Wade?

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        Not a part of it.
                             (beat)
                        You should know your TV is live to 
                        the world now.  Try to look pretty, 
                        alright?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Just gonna get Aldrin up here.

           With his one good arm, Aldrin grabs the lock and hoists 
           himself up as Armstrong assists by pulling the rope.
           MONTAGE -- THE WORLD WATCHES.

           Across the world, more crowds gather under TVs to watch as 
           both astronauts stand on top of the fallen Lunar Module.

           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Armstrong and Aldrin gaze at the landscape.

                                 ALDRIN
                        My god. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        It's something, isn't it?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Magnificent desolation.

           The lunar surface holds infinite shades of gray -- the most 
           complex Ansel Adams photograph ever.  The landscape is lit by 
           two swirling light sources -- the white klieg-light 
           brightness of the sun and the blue-white of the earth.

           The horizon seems just in front of them -- where the lunar 
           landscape meets the blackness of space.

           Armstrong takes hold of the rope, bracing it around his waist 
           as Aldrin climbs down the fallen lander using his one good 
           arm.  He finally gets to the landing gear -- the upper 
           portion hovers 2 feet from the surface while the bottom is 
           bent and shoved into the lander.  Aldrin peers at it.

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        Yeah, it looks like the upper part 
                        of the landing gear has entered the 
                        ascent engine area.  I can't see 
                        any details until we step off. 

           He looks up at Armstrong.

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        Should we?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Yeah, we should probably detail the 
                        damage--

                                 ALDRIN
                        No, Neil.  Should we step off the 
                        lander and... onto the moon?

           Armstrong looks at him, blankly.
                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        You still got your head stuck in 
                        checklists, don't you?

           Armstrong smirks and goes back to the modular compartment, 
           pulling out the bulky video camera and tether.  He positions 
           it pointing down to Aldrin.

           He makes his way down to Aldrin slowly, standing next to him 
           on the buckled landing gear.  They look at each other, each 
           understanding the moment is immense.  

                                 ARMSTRONG 
                             (nervous)
                        We should say something, right?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Yeah, probably.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        What?

                                 ALDRIN
                        I... don't know.  It wasn't me that 
                        was going out first... so... I 
                        didn't think about it. 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Well, we're stepping together.

                                 ALDRIN
                             (smiles)
                        Did... Did you have something 
                        prepared?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Well... It's pretty short. 

                                 ALDRIN
                        Okay.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        If you wanna add anything to it--

                                 ALDRIN
                        Neil, just say it.  What is it?

           Armstrong looks at the surface.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        This is.. one small step for a man.  
                        One giant leap for mankind.

           He looks at Aldrin, who's impressed.  
           They both extend a foot and drop down, each pillowing onto 
           the lunar surface at the same time.  A perfect semi-circle of 
           ultra-fine dust puffs upward and falls in a perfect arc.  

           They are the first men on the moon.

           MONTAGE -- THE WORLD CELEBRATES.

           In HOMES, BUSINESSES, and STREET CORNERS -- PEOPLE all over 
           the world CHEER WILDLY and hug in front of TV images of 
           Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           Luka and Gregori watch the TV in amazement.  Behind them, the 
           locked-in Russian Controllers also watch.

           Gregori looks at his console, seeing a blinking light.  He 
           puts on his headset.

                                 GREGORI
                        USSR Mission Control, over.  

                                 ALI (O.S.)

                        Please state the purpose of these 
                        coordinates.

           Luka grabs the headset excitedly from Gregori.

                                 LUKA
                        I am Luka Tarasoz, space flight 
                        director for the Soviet Union.  I 
                        need to speak urgently with NASA 
                        Flight.

                                 ALI (O.S.)
                        Those direct communications are 
                        against protocol.

                        It is of life and death.  Tell

                        some oxidizer. 

                                 ALI (O.S.)
                        Some what?

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           The Com looks at Kyle, confused.
                                 COM CONTROLLER

                        Probably a failed probe of some 
                        sort. The Russians never advertise

                        enough water.

                        They will need a small, hard tool.  
                        Like a hammer or a crowbar.  And 
                        they will need to moderate their

                        very next it could be equal to 
                        earth's pull.  A 10 kilo helmet 
                        will suddenly weigh 60 kilos.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        Wes!  Is this a NASA sanctioned 
                        press conference?

                                 JOURNALIST 2
                        What's this all about, Wes--?

                                 WES
                        In due time, gentlemen!

           He let's himself in and closes the door hard.

           INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE.

           Linda is on the phone in the hallway.  Wes and his NASA 
           people enter in the background, met by Alice and her 
           assembled FAMILY MEMBERS.

                                 LINDA
                             (pleading)
                        Melissa, Alice and I know they 
                        wouldn't be doing this if they 
                        weren't up to something.  

                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                        What are they doing, though?

                                 LINDA
                        I don't know--
                                 MELISSA (O.S.)
                             (interrupting)
                        Michael can't stay in orbit waiting 
                        for them to figure it out.

                                 LINDA
                        He has some time--

           INT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Melissa, on the phone, erupts angrily.

                                 MELISSA
                        He's got some time!?  What about my 
                        time!?  I can't get back what I've 
                        lost to the space program.  Now the 
                        moon is going to take all the time 
                        I have left with him.

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Melissa--

                                 MELISSA
                        What you're really saying to me, 
                        Linda, is that Buzz and Neil are 
                        willing to kill Michael for some 
                        remote chance of saving themselves.  
                        Am I right?

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Please listen, Melissa.  Neil and 
                        Buzz would never order Mike to 
                        stay.  

                                 MELISSA
                        Wake up, Linda.  They don't have to 
                        order him.  All they need to do is 
                        tell him there's a chance and his 
                        guilty conscience will start 
                        working overtime.  They know that.
                             (beat)
                        No!  I got my promise.  And Mike's 
                        never broken a promise to me 
                        before.  

           Linda doesn't know what to say.

                                 MELISSA (cont'd)
                        My answer to you is hell no.  I 
                        won't be standing by you on this.  
                        He's coming back.  You'll see!

           She hangs up.
           INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE.

           Wes sits on the edge of the coffee table talking to Alice and 
           Linda.

                                 ALICE
                        But why can't we just try to talk 
                        to them?

                                 WES
                        I'll look into it.

                                 LINDA
                        I want to talk to Wade, too.

                                 WES
                        I haven't been able to reach him 
                        all day so if you get him, tell him 
                        to call me, alright?

           He smiles at the little joke.  Alice and Linda don't.

                                 WES (cont'd)
                        Ladies, I need your help in guiding 
                        the American people through this.  
                        But now is not the time for this 
                        press conference.  

                                 LINDA
                        Bullshit.

                                 WES
                             (lets it slide)
                        So... since you're intent on doing 
                        it, we've written up a few points 
                        we want you to consider.  And also 
                        a few things that you should avoid.

           He passes them a sheet of paper.  A list of bullet-pointed 
           items stretch down it.  Alice and Linda read them.

                                 LINDA
                             (reading)
                        There is no hope for their 
                        recovery!?

           Wes leans forward.

                                 WES
                        Nothing has changed, Linda.  They 
                        may be walking on the moon but the 
                        fact remains we still can't get 
                        them off.
                                 LINDA
                        We just watched them get a bunch of 
                        tools and hop away.  Where are they 
                        going?

                                 WES
                        I'm not in Mission Control, so I 
                        don't know--

                                 ALICE
                             (interrupting)
                        Neil wouldn't break protocol if he 
                        didn't have to.  Why is he now?

           Wes, for once, is at a momentary loss for words.

                                 LINDA
                        She's right, Wes.  Where the fuck 
                        are they going in such a hurry?

                                 WES 
                        I will get answers for you.  But I 
                        can't do anything if you separate 
                        yourselves from our process.  If 
                        you go out alone on this, you will 
                        remain alone.

           Wes lets this sink in, then points to the talking-points.

                                 WES (contâ€™d)
                        So let's tell those journalists how 
                        you are holding strong through this 
                        international tragedy.

           EXT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE.

           Linda stands behind the podium.  Alice stands behind her 
           along with her family members.

           In front of a cluster of microphones, Linda looks at Wes's 
           talking-points --

           -- then crumbles it into a ball.

           She looks out over the sea of REPORTERS.  

                                 LINDA
                        In light of the events, both Alice 
                        and I believe our husbands... are 
                        trying to get off the moon.  We 
                        don't know their plan or their 
                        progress.  And NASA won't allow us 
                        to speak with them.  Therefore, we 
                        call on NASA to do all in their 
                        power to help our husbands.  
           The assembled press ERUPT with questions.  

           INT. COLLINS HOUSE.

           Melissa watches Linda's statement on the TV angrily.  Linda 
           yells over the commotion. 

                                 LINDA 
                             (from TV)
                        These men have risked all they have 
                        for the space program.  And they 
                        are owed the very same commitment, 
                        if not more.  Anything less will 
                        forever tarnish this great nation.
                             (beat)
                        We will not be taking any 
                        questions.

           The camera LIFTS off the tripod and runs with other 
           journalists --

           -- catching Wes and the NASA reps walking quickly off to 
           their cars and driving away without comment.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE.

           Armstrong, intent on his progress, kangaroo jumps into the 
           barren moonscape.  He stops to look behind him.  Aldrin is a 
           few yards back.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        How're you doing?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Don't ask.  It's a waste of time.  
                        I'll tell you if I need help, 
                        alright?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Roger.

           He goes back to his path, stopping to check the map 
           occasionally and checking on Aldrin.  Every time he does, 
           Aldrin is a little further behind him.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        I'm not asking!

                                 ALDRIN
                        Yes you are! 
           Armstrong smiles, jumping forward.  Suddenly one jump seems 
           to pull him down forcibly.  He loses his footing and falls 
           face first, using his hands to stop his helmet from 
           shattering on a rock.  The lunar dust in front of his face is 
           more flat and dense.  He has trouble lifting his arm.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Buzz!  I'm in a mascon!

           He tries to get up, but the gravitation force is too hard.  
           Something CRACKS on his EVA suit.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                             (straining)
                        Damn...!  

           Struggling through the full weight of the suit, Armstrong 
           grabs a handful of dust, scraping it from the hard surface.  
           He throws it forward, watching it closely --

           -- the dust within the invisible mascon falls to the ground 
           quickly, but the furthest particles stop their descent and 
           float to the ground.  The effect creates a eerily wall of 
           floating dust about four feet in front of him -- the now-
           visible border of the mascon.  

           Armstrong pulls himself toward it, struggling hard.  Once out 
           of the gravitational pit, he pulls himself to his feet.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Aldrin, there's a pretty intense 
                        mascon here.

           But he doesn't see Aldrin.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Buzz!  Buzz, come in!

           He starts jumping back, careful to watch his footing in the 
           mascon.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Buzz!

           He finds Aldrin by almost stepping on him.  Aldrin is covered 
           in dust, effectively camouflaging him.  He's been struggling 
           to get up with only one arm.  Armstrong lifts him upright.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                             (furious)
                        Why didn't you call!?  

           He sees Aldrin mouthing words inside his helmet.  His radio 
           is broken.
                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Shit, the radio is broken?

           Aldrin'S POV --

                                 ALDRIN
                        I can't hear you!

           Armstrong'S POV -- He watches Aldrin mouth the words above.

           They both stop talking.  Trying to think what to do.  
           Armstrong checks the connections as best he can, but it's no 
           use.  Aldrin motions his hand forward, mouthing the words:

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        Keep going!  Keep going!

           Armstrong takes off the rope and gives an end to Aldrin, 
           tries to gesture his words while saying:

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We need to keep together!  

           Aldrin gets it, ties the rope around his waist as Armstrong 
           does the same.

           Aldrin looks at his colleague, then at himself.  The dust 
           causes them to blend into the landscape -- Armstrong's once 
           white suit now deathly gray.

                                 ALDRIN
                        The moon is taking us.

           Armstrong doesn't understand. Aldrin shakes his head as if to 
           say "forget it."

           EXT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           CARS screech to a stop out the windowless building of Russian 
           Mission Control.  Viktor, other KGB agents and POLICE stream 
           out of their cars.  He tries the door.  Locked.  He motions 
           over a team wielding a battering ram.

           INT. LUNAR SURFACE.

           The earth now low on the horizon, Armstrong struggles deeper 
           into the moon.  Out of breath, he sucks at the straw next to 
           his face -- empty.  He looks behind him.  The rope is 
           stretched to its furthest point.  Aldrin lurches slowly 
           forward.

           Exhausted, Armstrong leans slowly against a huge boulder, 
           waits for Aldrin to get closer.
           When he does, Armstrong sees Aldrin's face-plate is coated in 
           dust.  He wipes it off with a dusty hand, revealing his 
           colleague is in bad sorts -- exhausted and also out of water.  
           The wound on his head has started bleeding again into his 
           eyes.  Aldrin tries to wipe it away on the side of his 
           helmet.  He mouths the words:

                                 ALDRIN
                        Where?

           Armstrong lifts the map, pointing and motioning.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        100 yards.

           He rises and walks slowly around the boulder.  Aldrin 
           remains, still catching his breath until he feels a pull on 
           the rope.  Looking up he sees Armstrong yanking it, motioning 
           for Aldrin to come.

           As Aldrin comes we see what he sees -- 

           -- a strange LUNAR LANDER with the distinctive "CCCP" 
           emblazoned on its side.  

           All of the lander's visible landing pads have buckled from a 
           hard fall, its lower portion crumpled into the surface.  

           As Armstrong approaches, he sees one of its three crushed 
           landing pads juts out dangerously into a GIANT CRATER -- 
           larger than the Grand Canyon.  The lander teeters on it 
           dangerously.

           Armstrong looks down into the crater -- impossibly deep and 
           jagged.  He feels a tug on his rope.

           Coming to Aldrin, he sees his colleague is in a state of 
           shock, staring at the lander, at a hatch 5 feet off the 
           ground.  Armstrong looks to where Aldrin points -- 

           -- just below the hatch is a ladder.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        My god.

           Armstrong takes the hammer and climbs up.  At a panel to the 
           right of the latch, he shoves the claw-end into a seam and 
           works to pop off the cover.  Inside is a handle with Russian 
           text written below it.  He pulls it.  

           Lunar dust puffs out as pressurized air escapes.  Armstrong 
           gets the hammer into the door and pries it open until he can 
           get a hand in between it.  As he pulls it open fully --

           -- the body of a COSMONAUT FALLS OUT, toward him.  
           Horrified, Armstrong moves out of the way as the body slowly 
           falls to the ground next to Aldrin.  

           Aldrin bends down to the man, face obscured by the tinted 
           helmet.  

           His name-plate reads PASHA.

           Still huddled over the speaker, Kyle's eyes go wide as he 
           looks at the notes.

           Suddenly a loud RAMMING sound followed by a sharp crack comes 
           from the speaker.

           Luka and Gregori watch as police stream into the room.  They 
           rush toward Luka and Gregori. 

           Gregori grabs a chair and starts swinging, connecting with a 
           policeman.  A SHOT rings out and he's hit in the chest --  

           -- from a gun held by Viktor.

           EXT. SOYUZ 4.

           Armstrong and Aldrin kneel down to the lifeless body of 
           Danilo Pasha.  They look at each other, each understanding 
           the moment: "This could be us."  

           INT. SOYUZ 4.

           Armstrong steps inside the damaged lander.  The rope tied to 
           his waist, the other end still tied to Aldrin on the surface.  

           Inside, a second RUSSIAN COSMONAUT is hunched over the 
           control, lifeless.  Armstrong takes a cautious step forward. 

           The lander moves --

           EXT. SOYUZ 4 - CONTINUOUS

           Aldrin watches the lander tilt dangerously toward the crater.  
           He quickly runs.

           INT. SOYUZ 4.

           Cautiously walking forward, Armstrong finds a particular 
           panel on the lander's floor.  He takes out a screw driver, 
           unscrews it to reveal the lander's ascent engine.  He finds a 
           large tank of oxidizer connected to a series of pipes.  He 
           caps off the tank and applies the block cutters to the pipe 
           leading into it, cutting it.  

           The lander moves, gains momentum.  Armstrong tugs at the 
           tank, trying to free it.  But it's difficult to maneuver out.

           EXT. SOYUZ 4 - CONTINUOUS

           Aldrin painfully ties the rope to a boulder, wincing through 
           the lightning shooting through his broken arm.

           INT. SOYUZ 4 - CONTINUOUS

           The entire lander continues to tilt into the crater.  
           Desperate, Armstrong unties the rope and loops it quickly 
           around the tank, using the rope's leverage for one more tug.  

           The tank pops free from the compartment just as --
           EXT. SOYUZ 4 - CONTINUOUS

           The lander falls slowly into the crater.  Aldrin watches as 
           Armstrong flies out of the hatch at the last moment, hitting 
           the ground as the Russian lander disappears behind him. The 
           rope goes taunt.

           Aldrin helps him up and they both pull the rope up.  On the 
           end -- the oxidizer tank.

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSION CONTROL.

           Viktor picks up the headset as, behind him, Russian 
           controllers are let out of the locked room.  They are shocked 
           to see the bodies Luka and Gregori.

           From the headset, WE HEAR Kyle:

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        Luka!  Luka, come in!!

           Viktor yanks the headset from the console.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LUNAR SURFACE.

           Aldrin and Armstrong, the rope tied to their waists, follow 
           their footsteps back, dragging the tank behind them, 
           traveling at a quarter of their original speed.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER -- Gasping, Armstrong struggles to push his feet 
           forward.  He stops, looks behind him.  Aldrin is ten yards 
           back, moving imperceptibly.  Behind him, the tank leaves a 
           long trail of drag.

           Armstrong goes back to his walk.  But after a few steps, the 
           rope around his waist goes taunt, pulling him back.  He turns 
           quickly, bracing his feet, looking to where he last saw 
           Aldrin.  

           Aldrin is gone -- as if he has fallen behind the horizon.  

           The rope pulls the tank toward Aldrin's last position. 

           Armstrong watches as it, too, disappears, falling over the 
           side of something, as if vanishing over the horizon.

           Anticipating what's coming, Armstrong dives on the ground, 
           grabbing at whatever he can as the slack rope tightens 
           quickly.  It pulls him across the surface.  
           Armstrong claws for some traction.  His feet finally hit a 
           boulder, stopping him.

           He carefully ties the rope to the boulder, rises and jumps 
           quickly to where Aldrin and the tank disappeared.  He almost 
           falls into what swallowed them -- A DEEP FISSURE.

           Aldrin hangs upside down, unmoving.  The tank is gone.

           Armstrong tries to pull the rope, but he's too exhausted.  
           Instead, he loops it around the boulder and pulls, using the 
           rock as a pulley.  He makes slow progress, walking toward the 
           fissure as he pulls.  Finally he sees Aldrin's hand appear at 
           the edge.  Aldrin struggles to grab at the rim with one hand 
           as Armstrong uses everything he has for the last pull. 

           Finally, Aldrin struggles onto the surface, pulling up with 
           his broken arm --

           -- the oxidizer tank.

           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           With the fallen U.S. lunar lander looming in the foreground, 
           we see two white specks making slow progress toward it.

           CLOSER -- Armstrong drags Aldrin behind him, the other arm 
           dragging the oxidizer.  His lips are cracked and eyes 
           bloodshot as he struggles against his failing body.  Every 
           painful step is a marathon. He stops to rest.

           He feels Aldrin struggle to get out of his grasp.  He looks 
           into the astronauts faceplate.  Aldrin, lips also cracked and 
           discolored, mouths the words:

                                 ALDRIN
                        Drop... me... 

           But Armstrong pulls him back up, determined.  He keeps going. 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           An empty headset sits on a console as MILITARY POLICE course 
           through the room.  

           Bruce Pope, Kyle McCardell, and a few other controllers are 
           handcuffed, facedown on the floor.  Some are being carried 
           away.  Other controllers remain at their stations, hands on 
           their heads.

                        Mike!  Come in!

           He takes off his headset, pointing to another controller at a 
           desk
                                 WADE (cont'd)
                        You.  Sit here.  Keep trying him.  
                        Get that asshole back here.  

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE - CONTINUOUS

           Collins listens to Mission Control call for him over and 
           over.  He stares at the ignition switch as Columbia again 
           goes to the dark side of the moon, covering the ship in 
           blackness.  

           The radio goes to STATIC.

           Collins doesn't make a move to turn it off.  He looks out the 
           window at the last moment of light -- the white horizon of 
           the moon fades to black.  He puts his head in his hands, 
           tormented. 

           INT. NASA PRESS ROOM.

           Wes addresses the PRESS POOL, who are frantic to get their 
           mics in position.

                                 WES
                        We have exhausted every option.  
                        And it is my burden to report that 
                        Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin 
                        cannot be retrieved from the moon.

           Reporters ERUPT WITH QUESTIONS.

                                 REPORTER
                        How can you explain the video 
                        images?

                                 WES
                        They survived the impact and went 
                        outside the lunar lander to inspect 
                        the damage.  We have only limited 
                        contact with them.

           The reporters again erupt.

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Has Collins fired back toward 
                        earth?

                                 WES
                        Yes.  Yes he has.

           INT. ARMSTRONG HOUSE.

           Alice and Linda watch the TV of Wes's announcement.
           The phone rings off the wall in the background.

                                 ALICE
                        You think that's true?  That... 
                        that can't be true, right?

                                 LINDA
                        I don't know.  I can't believe 
                        anything he says any more.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Armstrong heaves Aldrin into the LM.  Aldrin drops motionless 
           to the bottom.  Armstrong struggles in, closes the latch, and 
           goes to the console, pressing buttons to pressurize the 
           cabin.

           As he looks at the gauges, waiting for the dial to crawl into 
           the green zone, he almost closes his eyes.  He darts them 
           back open, forcing himself to stay conscious.  As soon as the 
           dial hits green, he laboriously takes off his helmet and 
           gloves, grabs a packet of water and drinks, long.  He takes 
           off Aldrin's helmet, forcing the straw into his mouth and 
           squeezes.  

           The water falls out of Aldrin's mouth.  Armstrong shakes him.  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Come on, Buzz!  Drink!  You can 
                        sleep after you drink!

           Aldrin's eyes flutter and he finally drinks.

           Armstrong lies him down, then patches his mic into the 
           console.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Tranquility Base to Houston.  Over. 

           Static.

                        Houston, this is Tranquility Base.  
                        Over.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           The controller who has taken over Pope's desk looks at Wade.  
           Wade shakes his head.  The controller remains silent.
           INT. LUNAR LANDER - CONTINUOUS

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Pope.  Kyle.  Anyone there?

           He switches channels.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Collins.  It's Neil.  Come in.  
                        Over.

           Again, static.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Eagle to Columbia.  Over.

                                 ALDRIN
                             (weakly)
                        He's on the other side, now.  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Hey.  How are you feeling?

                                 ALDRIN
                        How do I look?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Like hell.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Yeah that's about how I feel.

           They both drink, soaking in the rest. 

           After a long beat, Aldrin starts chuckling.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        What?

                                 ALDRIN
                             (weakly)
                        You ever do this elementary school 
                        experiment?  Where you had to 
                        figure out a way to protect a raw 
                        egg from a one-story fall?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Yeah.  I wrapped mine in straw.  
                        Didn't work.

                                 ALDRIN
                        I was just thinking... that's all 
                        this is.  Billions of dollars in 
                        expensive bubble wrap to protect a 
                        couple of raw eggs.  Didn't work.
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We're not dead yet.
                             (beat)
                        So what did you do?

                                 ALDRIN
                        What?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        How did you protect your egg?

                                 ALDRIN
                        I strapped it to a baby doll.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        That work?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Of course.  Who's gonna throw a 
                        baby off the roof?

           Armstrong bursts out LAUGHING.  So does Aldrin.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Why is it we never hung out more 
                        before this?

                                 ALDRIN
                        Because you're a dick.

           Armstrong doesn't laugh, just looks down, accepting it.

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        Hey... that was a joke.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        No, it wasn't.  But you're right.  
                        I've been very tunnel-visioned 
                        about this mission.  I let the 
                        guidelines make all the decisions.

                                 ALDRIN
                        Neil, you're the best commander 
                        they've got.  There's a reason they 
                        picked you.  

           Aldrin COUGH, deeply and sickly.  

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We gotta get you off this rock.  
                        You still got some strength in you?

           Aldrin nods.
           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Outside the LM, Armstrong puts both hands against the side, 
           then tugs at the rope.

           INSIDE THE LM, Aldrin leans against the far wall.  The rope 
           attached to him trails out of the open hatch.  He starts 
           rocking the lander back and forth while --

           OUTSIDE, Armstrong starts pushing it back and forth.  The 
           lander gains momentum until it finally rolls slightly away 
           from the descent engine.  The collapsed landing gear pulls 
           out.

           INSIDE, Aldrin falls.  A window cracks on a rock.  

           OUTSIDE, once away from the descent portion, the lander falls 
           right side up. 

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           With the cracked window behind them, Armstrong and Aldrin -- 
           still in their moon suits -- work to connect the Soviet 
           oxidizer tank to the descent engine.  It is hard to do with 
           the limited movement of the thick gloves.

           Aldrin taps Armstrong, pointing to the gloves and shaking his 
           head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Armstrong and Aldrin try to plug the cracked window with a 
           piece of the floor.  They then spread an extra space suit 
           over it.  Armstrong holds it in place as Aldrin flips the 
           valve to pressurize.  They both watch the window as the hard 
           vacuum of space begins to lengthens the cracks.  Armstrong 
           bunches the suit around it.  When he thinks he has it 
           plugged, he removes his arm.  

           Armstrong quickly looks at the gage.  It crawls into the 
           green.  The moment it does, he yanks off his suit and grabs 
           at the console radio.

           They hear small pieces of the window breaking off, putting 
           stress on the suit and floor paneling.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Eagle to Columbia. Over.

           No response.

                                 ARMSTRONG (cont'd)
                        Collins.  Collins!
                                 COLLINS (O.S.)
                        Neil!

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        I don't have much time so listen.  
                        The module hull has been breached, 
                        our suit radios are broken.  This 
                        is the only shot we have to talk.  
                        I don't think the plug will hold 
                        very long.  Do you copy?

                                 COLLINS (O.S.)
                        I copy!

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We have the tank of oxidizer.  I 
                        will try connecting it now.  Buzz 
                        calculates that you will pass over 
                        our rendezvous point in 
                        approximately 20 minutes, correct?

                                 COLLINS (O.S.)
                        Yes!  Yes, I will.

           Aldrin sets the console timer for 20 minutes.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Look for us.  We won't be able to 
                        communicate.

                                 COLLINS (O.S.)
                        I will!

           The floor paneling in the window begins to crack, creating a 
           small seam.  Aldrin quickly plugs it again.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        And Mike, if you don't rendezvous 
                        with us, you are to go back.  

                                 COLLINS (O.S.)
                        If you ascend, I will find you.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        If you don't, go home.  That is an 
                        order.  Understand?

           Another crack, bigger this time, forms in the plug.

           Armstrong is frantically trying to connect the tank as Aldrin 
           does all he can to plug leaks.  But they keep coming.  Aldrin 
           looks at the pressurization gage.  It's tilting into red.

           He screams through his helmet.
                                 ALDRIN
                        Neil!

           Neil's hands begin to SWELL AND GROW RED as he works, making 
           it harder.  He finally finishes and dives into his EVA suit 
           with Aldrin's help just as --

           -- the covered window EXPLODES outward, buckling the paneling 
           and shooting the space suit across the surface.  The escaping 
           air instantly crystallizes.

           The violent pressurization draws both astronauts across the 
           module toward the window.  Aldrin slams into Armstrong.  
           Armstrong's backpack catches on a switch, breaking it off.

           Armstrong's body is jammed into the window.  Aldrin sees him 
           screaming.

           Clawing his way to the controls, Aldrin finally gets to the 
           pressurization lever and pulls it.  The stress on Armstrong 
           lessens and Aldrin quickly pulls him back inside.  

           Aldrin looks into Armstrong's facemask, mouthing:

                                 ALDRIN (cont'd)
                        Okay?

           Armstrong, though in pain, nods his head and mouths.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        How long!?

                                 ALDRIN
                             (showing hands)
                        5 minutes!

           They take their standing positions, quickly strapping 
           themselves in.  They make final preparations into the 
           computer.  Aldrin reaches for the ignition switch -- 

           -- it's broken, pulled off by Armstrong's pack.

           The both look at each other, hope draining.  Armstrong 
           struggles to think of an option.  

           Aldrin's eyes fall on something on the console -- the ball 
           point pen resting between two switches.  He quickly grabs it, 
           yanks out the ink cartridge painfully, and jams it into 
           broken switch.  He tugs at Armstrong, motioning him to hold 
           on.  Armstrong does as Aldrin pushes the pen into the switch 
           with everything he's got.

           The ascent engine IGNITES, throwing the astronauts back.

           OUTSIDE, the LM shoots into space as if yanked by a string.
           INSIDE, the pipe to the Russian tank begins to crack.  The 
           corrosive oxidizer shoots into the cabin.  The ascent engine 
           dies down.

           Aldrin unlatches himself quickly and goes to the leak.  
           Armstrong tries to stop him. 

           Aldrin grabs the leak, gripping the pipe with his gloves, 
           stemming the flow.  Its corrosive oxidizer begins to eat them 
           away.  He quickly grabs at anything he can use to patch it, 
           trying to save his hands.  

           Armstrong stays intent on the controls, compensating with the 
           thrusters as the vehicle drifts.

           OUTSIDE, the LM continues to climb, struggling out of the 
           moon's gravitation pull.  The lunar surface shrinks behind 
           it.

           Finally the oxidizer empties.  The LM continues to silently 
           rise.

           INSIDE, Aldrin gets back into position, looking at the clock--  

           -- it's 10 minutes past.  He looks at Armstrong, frustrated 
           and lost.  They missed their window.

           They look out the windows, searching for Columbia.  It's 
           nowhere to be seen.

           Armstrong reaches over, grips Aldrin's shoulder.  Aldrin 
           smiles, nods.  They both stare out the windows, at the 
           thousands of stars now unobstructed by glass.  One star seems 
           to move quickly, growing bigger.  It starts to take shape. 
           Armstrong squints at it, fixated, until the outlines of 
           Columbia can be seen.  Armstrong reacts:

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        MIKE!  YEAH!  WHOOOOH!    

           He yanks at Aldrin, pointing out Columbia.  They both start 
           joyously hollering, though neither can hear each other.

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           Sweating buckets, Collins steers the Command Module straight 
           to the LM.

           EXT. LUNAR LANDER.

           With Columbia now 200 yards away, the LM spot-fires its 
           thrusters to align.
           INSIDE THE LM -- Armstrong stays intent on driving as Aldrin 
           grabs anything he can to plug the window.

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE.

           Using the view-finder, Collins docks with the LM and quickly 
           goes to the hatch.  He hears a sharp, continuous BANGING, 
           stopping himself from unbolting the door.  It's Morse Code.

                                 COLLINS
                        W. A. I. T.

           He puts his hands on the lock and waits, at the ready.

           INT. LUNAR LANDER.

           Armstrong frantically stuffs the hole as Aldrin keeps sending 
           the Morse Code by hammering it out on the door.  He finally 
           stops when he sees the latch is not opening.  

           In zero-gravity, Armstrong finds it difficult to keep 
           everything in one place.  Finally satisfied he flips the 
           pressurization lever.  The random items swirling around the 
           broken window immediately jam into it.  Armstrong puts more 
           items on top -- tools, extra boots, gloves, anything.

           The pressurization gage creeps into the green zone.

           Armstrong pushes quickly over to Aldrin, giving him the go-
           ahead.  Aldrin wraps on the door: GO, GO, GO...

           INT. COLUMBIA COMMAND MODULE - CONTINUOUS

           Collins reads it, takes a breath, and unlocks the hatch.  It 
           immediately flies open into the LM.  

           The pressurized air of Columbia fills the LM.  The items 
           pressed against the window begin to strain outward like a 
           weak dam.

           Armstrong pushes Aldrin with all he's got, fighting the 
           growing current.  

           The window behind them immediately starts to cave outward.

           Collins grabs Aldrin's outstretched hand and pulls him in, 
           struggling.  Then they both grab Armstrong by his feet.

           The window bows outward more.  Outside, items are launched 
           into space as small holes grow into big ones.

           Aldrin and Collins brace themselves and pull at Armstrong's 
           legs. 
           Armstrong tries to help with one hand, as the other holds the 
           door.  Finally they are able to pull him inside, as he closes 
           the door behind him.  Locking it, just as --

           -- the window plug EXPLODES OUTWARD.  

           Collins erupts:

                                 COLLINS
                        YEAH!  YEAH!

           He rips at his friends' helmets, yanking them off.  When he 
           sees Aldrin, he grabs him by the ears and kisses his 
           forehead.  He does the same with Armstrong.  They hug 
           joyously, laughing and spinning around the cabin.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL.

           The CAPCOM controller sits at his desk, bored with repeating 
           over and over:

           A BUZZ rifles through the controllers.  Some stand.  All eyes 
           are on Wade.  His are wide in disbelief.

           An UPROARIOUS YELL bursts from the controllers as they toss 
           papers in the air and hug.

                        to talk to their families ASAP. 

           The celebration inside Mission Control continues as Wade 
           tries to get his bearings.

                                 COLLINS (cont'd)
                        But before that... the commander 
                        would like to speak to you, Wade.

           Wade goes white.  Everyone turns to look at him as:

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Wade, this is Neil, over.

                        when you're safely back--

           A controller stands, reading from the opened Mission 
           Guidelines binder.

                                 CONTROLLER
                        The Apollo Mission Commander may

                        If the Commander believes the 
                        mission is in conflict.

           Another controller next to him stands.  Then they all do, 
           standing and staring at Wade with deep resentment.  

           Wade swallows hard, takes off the headset, and walks out the 
           door.

           EXT. MISSION CONTROL.

           A van waits for the chain-link fence to open as REPORTERS and 
           CAMERAMEN scurry around it.  The van drives into the compound 
           stopping in front of the windowless mission control building.  

           Kyle, Pope, and the other arrested controllers quickly run 
           into the building. 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

           As Kyle and the others run into the room, the controllers 
           APPLAUD WILDLY.  But Kyle won't have it:

                                 KYLE
                        Get back to work!  Where are we?  I 
                        want a go/no go from all 
                        departments!  Right now!
           As the controllers answer Kyle one by one, Bruce Pope sits 
           quickly at the Com station, speaking into the headset even 
           before he puts it on.

                                 POPE
                             (smiling)

                        brought back somethin' for me?

           EXT. EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

           Four-hundred miles above the earth, the re-entry capsule 
           separates from the propulsion system and begins descending 
           into earth's atmosphere.

           INT. NASA -- HALLWAY.

           With their wives next to them, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins 
           walk down a long hallway.  Aldrin has his arm in a sling and 
           walks with a severe limp.  

           At the end they see Kyle, Pope, and the team of controllers 
           standing outside a PACKED PRESS ROOM.

           Armstrong brightens when he sees them, starts laughing, then 
           starts walking quickly over to them.  The walk turns into a 
           jog.  Aldrin and Collins follow.

           The wives are left to themselves.  Linda and Alice look at 
           each other and smile, hug.  Linda glances behind them -- at 
           Melissa carrying her baby.  She keeps to herself. 

           At the end of the hallway, Armstrong's handshake with Kyle 
           turns into a tearful hug.

                                 KYLE
                        You ready for this?

           Armstrong shrugs, lifting up Wes's "talking points."

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        They sure make it easy to lie, 
                        don't they?

                                 KYLE
                        Do they?

           Armstrong looks at him gravely as Wes breaks through the 
           reunion to grab Armstrong.

                                 WES
                        They're ready for you.

           INT. NASA -- PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins step into the press room, 
           packed with eager REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN.  

           Flashbulbs bake the room in white light.  

           Armstrong steps up to the podium covered in microphones.  He 
           looks at the piece of paper.  
           He steals a look to Aldrin and Collins.  Against the wall he 
           spots Kyle, Pope and the team of controllers.  

           Armstrong crumples the paper in his hand, and looks up at the 
           press.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        We got a lot to talk about.

           Suddenly, Wes looks uncomfortable.

           END.
