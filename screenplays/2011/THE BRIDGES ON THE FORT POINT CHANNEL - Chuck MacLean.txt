           EXT. BUNKER HILL - CHARLESTOWN, MASS - 1974 - NIGHT 

           TOP OF THE HILL

           A huge, granite monolith, like a mini Washington monument, 
           stands in rarified light on top of a manicured hill - a 
           tribute to the day we took America back, an ever present 
           reminder of the city’s past.   

           BOTTOM OF THE HILL. 

           The city’s present. Abandoned shipyards. Government housing. 
           The Bunker Hill projects in full black out - someone’s 
           knocked out the power and smashed in all the street lights. 

           PROJECT COURTYARD

           The place is reverentially quiet, the only sound the tinny 
           ring of a distant T.V. and the CRACKLING of...

           TWO BURNING EFFIGIES hanging from the court’s lone tree. One 
           of a JUDGE, the other a man in a cheap SUIT. Signs around 
           their necks read, “BUS GARRITY,” and “FUCK KENNEDY.”  

           A POLICE SIREN squelches. Four MOTORCYCLE COPS ride into the 
           courtyard. Behind them marches a line of armored RIOT POLICE, 
           Boston’s Tactical Police Force (TPF). 

           The Lead Motorcycle Cop SURVEYS the court. It looks empty. 

           REVEAL: Three teenagers laying in wait on a nearby rooftop. 

                                 LEAD COP
                             (Into MIC)
                        You got 30 seconds. Repeat: you got 
                        30 seconds to come outta there, or 
                        you better bet ya balls we’re 
                        coming in. 

           No response. He signals the TPF forward. But the SOUND of 
           RUNNING FEET suddenly draws his attention UP. 

           A YOUNG KID (11) sprints to the edge of the project roof and 
           flings a 10-SPEED BIKE over the side. It freezes mid-air.

           INSERT: BOSTON, 1975. 

           Streisand’s “The Way We Were” starts to play. 

           The bike comes back alive and SMASHES into the line of TPF. 

           THE “BUSING” MONTAGE:
           EXT. GOVERNMENT CENTER - DAY

           BUSING RALLY at City Hall. Picket signs float through the 
           crowd. “Bus Garrity,” “Stop Busing,” “Hell No We Won’t Go.”

           EXT. BUNKER HILL HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT

           The TPF sprints up stair wells. Chases kids down hallways, 
           and onto the rooftops. The kids flea from roof to roof.

           EXT. SOUTHIE HIGH - DAY

           A YELLOW BUS full of BLACK KIDS drives up the Heights towards 
           the old HIGH SCHOOL and a crowd of waiting WHITE PARENTS. 

           INT. ROXBURY HIGH - DAY

           Gangs of WHITES and BLACKS fight it out in the halls. Hard. 
           Violent. It’s complete pandemonium. Teachers sit back and 
           wait for their chance to intervene like hockey referees.

           INT. BAR - COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           JOHN CALLEARY (17) - tall, hard; a man at 17 - is seated at 
           the bar, looking over a packed-in crowd of his friends and 
           neighbors. They’re all dressed in their Sunday bests. 
           JIMMY MULLINS (26), and John’s uncle, LUKE O’FARRELL (25) - 
           well-built, blonde, handsome - are seated on his left.  
           Luke’s holding a baby wrapped in a CHRISTENING GOWN.

                                 JIMMY MULLINS 
                        ...it’s an easy job, brothah. Your 
                        cousin’s got the fence all lined up 
                        in Eastie, we know the teamster in 
                        the truck. It’s easy money, bro. 

                                 LUKE 
                        Mull, what are you doing to me 
                        here, guy? I got a kid...

           ACROSS THE BAR

           John spots THERESA AMREHEIN (20) - a slender, but PERKY red-
           head - sitting alone at a table. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS 
                        Look, it’s a lot of money for three 
                        hours work, bro. That’s all I’m 
                        saying-- 

           Theresa spots John, too. There’s a warm smile of recognition. 

                                 LUKE 
                        -Yeah, I got a job, Jimmy. Don’t 
                        worry about it. 

           John guides Theresa’s eyes towards a set of BACK STAIRS. She 
           shakes her head, coyly. He mouths a pleading “come on.”

                                 JIMMY MULLINS 
                        All right, suit yourself then. I 
                        just don’t want you to think you 
                        were being forgotten, okay? 

           Theresa sighs dramatically, a lascivious grin on her face. 
           She slides out of her chair. 

                                 LUKE 
                             (Laughing)
                        Thank you. Believe me, I appreciate 
                        it, you stupid fuck.

           John stands up to follow her. Luke shoves him back down. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Where you goin, troublemaker?

           John shrugs. Nowhere now. Luke hands him the baby, and 
           reaches over the bar. He pulls out a bottle of JACK. 
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Good. You can watch the kid for me 
                        then. Be good practice for ya. 

           Luke glances towards Theresa and gives John a smile. He knows 
           he’s fucking up the kid’s plans. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Behave now. 

           Luke and Jimmy walk off, laughing. 

           John looks over to Theresa. What can I do? She GRINS. 

           Suddenly JACKIE CALLEARY (14) - short, skinny, the baby of 
           the family - runs by chasing another KID (12).

                                 JOHN
                        Hey Jack--

           Jackie turns around. John just about throws the baby at him. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Go give him to Aunty, will ya?

           And John launches off his stool towards Theresa. 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           The STIVETTI BROTHERS - SABATINO (30), big, fat and happy; 
           and his brother, MARIO (31), rail-thin and mean - walk in. 
           All of a sudden, the heretofore crowded Christening party 
           thins before them. No one waves. No one says “hello.” They 
           just know to move out of their way. 

           ‘Cause there’s a look about the brothers. It says that in a 
           neighborhood full of half-legitimate men these are killers.

           They stroll unimpeded over to the HEAD TABLE, where... 

           AUNTY JOANIE (24) - a pretty brunette, showing none of her 
           guests’ qualms - jumps up and hugs both of them. They each 
           hand her a big, thick ENVELOPE. 

           She gives them both the ubiquitous, “you shouldn’t have” 
           look, and a kiss on each cheek. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Congratulations, gore-jess. Where’s

                        yours?
           IN THE CROWD

           Jackie works his way through the party with the Baby, but 
           seeing Joanie’s busy, veers towards his MOTHER’s table. 

           MA (40 going on 60) is a miserable-looking, leather-faced 
           drunk sucking down club sodas like G&Ts. But her face lights 
           when Jackie hands her the Kid.

                                 MA
                        Oh will you look at this frighan 
                        kid? Jesus Christ, he’s beautiful.
                             (Turning to Jackie)
                        You know, you used to look like 
                        that. You seen your brother around 
                        lately?

           She pulls a pack of Marlboro 100s out of her purse. 

                                 JACKIE

                        No. Why would I know where he is?

           Ma gives him a suspicious look, like she knows better. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                             (Smiling under the look)

                        I told ya - I don’t know.

           She nods slowly, assuming something’s been put over on her. 

                                 MA
                        Ga’head then. Get out of here.

                        Think you can get me some?

           Bobby shrugs, “why not?” 

           Suddenly, SIRENS EXPLODE in the distance. Bobby’s eyes POP 
           open. Terrified, he flicks the grass into the lot, and the 
           three of them trip over each other heading for the back door. 

           EXT. COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Luke straddles the Stranger in the street, pounding his face. 

           Two SQUAD CARS pull up. Four COPS jump out. 

           Jimmy Mullins and a few other GUESTS manage to pull Luke off 
           and up onto the sidewalk. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                             (to Luke)
                        Hold it in for a second, buddy, all 
                        right? Just calm down for two 
                        seconds... 

           He can barely hold Luke back. Something’s clicked off in 
           Luke’s head - his eyes are wild and he’s muttering to 
           himself. 
           A UNIFORMED SERGEANT (35) walks up as the three other cops 
           attend to the Stranger laying in the street.

                                 SERGEANT
                        What’sya name, tough guy?

                                 LUKE
                        Corporal O’Farrell. 3rd FORECON. 
                        Sergeant.  

           The Sergeant gives Luke a curious look.

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        He’s been home awhile. I think the 
                        Jack Daniels just brings it out of 
                        him, you know?

           The Sarge nods slowly, understanding. He points to himself.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Air-Cav. I get that shit with 
                        Kahlua. Ya believe that? 

           INT. COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby runs in through the back door and finds Jackie at the 
           bar talking to FINN the Bartender (37) - a fat, balding man 
           squeezed uncomfortably into a wool suit. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Where’s John?

                                 JACKIE
                        The fuck should I know?

                                 BOBBY
                        Fuck...

                                 JACKIE
                        What is it?

           Bobby waves him off. Be quiet. 

                                 BOBBY
                             (Searching the crowd )
                        Where’s that Amrhein broad?

           EXT. COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Sergeant takes off his SUNGLASSES. 
                                 SERGEANT
                             (to Jimmy)
                        What set him off?

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        It’s his kid’s Christening. 
                        Douchebag over there said something 
                        about the mother. 

           Sergeant groans, as if he understands that some unspoken 
           ethic has been violated. 

                                 SERGEANT
                        Ah, well just get him inside then. 
                        I’ll walk, so long as you don’t 
                        make me come back down here. Okay?

           Mullins nods. The Sergeant turns back to his car. 

                                 SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                             (Over his shoulder)
                        But if you can hear me in there, 
                        Corporal...congratulations.   

           The Sergeant passes the Stranger, who’s leaning on a cruiser, 
           clutching his bloody nose. 

                                 THE STRANGER
                             (Calling after Sergeant)
                        What, ya ain’t even gonna take him 
                        in?

                                 SERGEANT
                             (Shrugging)
                        Christening’s a sacrament. You 
                        shouldn’t have done what you did. 

           The Stranger groans, wiping blood off his face. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           John’s railing Theresa up against the sink. She’s moaning, 
           digging her nails into his neck. 

                                 THERESA
                        Oh fuck...oh fuck me...Jesus!

           John looks up at himself in the mirror. He sees MISERY LIGHTS 
           behind him in the reflection of the bathroom window. He 
           ignores them, and turns back to Theresa when--

           The door’s thrown open. Jackie. Bobby over his shoulder. 
                                 JACKIE 
                        Holy shit!

           The girl SCREAMS. Bobby LAUGHS. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me, Bobby, you see her tits?

           Bobby drags Jackie out of the room as John awkwardly tries to 
           zipper up and chase after them simultaneously. 

           EXT. BACK LOT - COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A growing crowd watches Jimmy Mullins and ROCCO (25) try to 
           keep Luke from going around the side of the bar. 

                                 ROCCO 
                        Luke, come on. Take it easy. 

           Rocco holds his hands out and takes a step towards Luke.

                                 ROCCO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just go back inside. 

           He takes another cautious step forward and Luke PUNCHES HIM 
           out. The crowd groans. Nobody wants to go near him now.  Luke 
           paces off in the other direction, muttering to himself. 

           John comes up in a hurry. He’s bigger than every man there.  

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                             (Just seeing him)
                        Oh, glad you could make it. Hope we 
                        weren’t interrupting. 

                                 JOHNNY CALLEARY
                        Oh, you were. But don’t worry about 
                        it. What’s going on?

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Vietnam. 

                                 JOHNNY CALLEARY
                             (Smiling)
                        Thought that one was over?

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Ya gonna try and be funny right 
                        now?

           Luke turns back around. Bobby steps out of the crowd. 
                                 BOBBY
                        Uncle Luke, everything’s cool, man. 
                        Let’s just go home.

           Johnny shoots Bobby a look. What the fuck are you doing?

                                 LUKE
                             (to Bobby)
                        Who the fuck are you? Huh? Where 
                        you from?

           Luke storms towards Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s me - it’s Bobby. Uncle Luke!

           Luke keeps coming, and realizing none of the adults will step 
           in, John reluctantly throws himself in Luke’s path. 

                                 JOHN
                        Luke, what are you doing?

           Luke pauses, stares at John. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Huh? You hear me in there? What the 
                        fuck are you doing?

                                 LUKE
                        Quinn, what are you doing here?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not Quinn, buddy. It’s John. 
                        Your nephew. Your kid’s godfather.

           John puts a gentle hand on Luke’s shoulder, tries to lock 
           eyes with him. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Listen: where are you right now? 
                        Huh? Where are ya?

                                 LUKE 
                        Whattya mean, Quinn?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not Quinn, pal. Look at me...

           John gets Luke to look him the eye. He keeps talking while 
           gently tapping Luke on the cheek. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Where are you right now, huh? 
                        Where’d you go, pal?
           ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

           Bobby and Jackie watch as Luke shakes his head and squats 
           down, taking deep, quick breaths, as if he’d just had the 
           wind knocked out of him. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        The fuck does he say to him?

                                 BOBBY 
                        I don’t know. Only ever seen my 
                        father do that. 

           John gently puts his arm around Luke and carefully picks him 
           up. They walk towards the crowd together. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        How longs it been since your old 
                        man past?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Coupla years. 

           Luke stumbles by and into the bar. Rocco and Jimmy follow 
           him. But John stops, and puts a hand on each of his brother’s 
           shoulders. The Calleary’s walk in together. And as they do... 

           They pass the Stivetti Bros. standing on either side of the 
           doorway, smoking. They’ve seen the whole thing, and they 
           study John carefully as he disappears into the bar. 

           INT. COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Luke slumps down in a chair at Ma’s table. He sees all the 
           people at the surrounding tables turn and stare.  

           John pulls up a chair. Luke looks embarrassed - both by what 
           just happened, and the attention he’s getting for it now. 
           John puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. 

           Ma leans over to John.  

                                 MA
                             (Conspiratorially)
                        What happened?

                                 JOHN
                        Nothing. Don’t worry about it. 

           Ma gives him her LOOK, imploring for more. He ignores it. 
                                 MA
                        Well, ya better make sure ya uncle 
                        gets home tonight, ya hear me? 

           John nods off-handedly. Yeah, whatever.

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        I’m tellin ya right now, John, you 
                        gotta take care of this family.

           He nods, not needing to be told again.  

           EXT. STREETS OF SOUTHIE - NIGHT

           John stumbles along next to Rocco, Jimmy and Luke. They’re 
           all shit-faced now. 

           Rocco punches Luke in the shoulder, hard but affectionately. 

                                 ROCCO 
                        ...You’re a fucking dad now.

           Luke shoves him away. 

                                 ROCCO (CONT’D)
                        That’s ya life. It’s over. All you 
                        got to look forward to is dying. 
                        That’s all you got left.

           Bobby and Jackie follow behind them, laughing. 

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah? Well, I’ll think about that 
                        when I’m railin ya sister for Kid 
                        #2. 

           Rocco jumps on Luke’s back and the two of them tumble into 
           the street. Everyone LAUGHS.

           “The Joker” by Steve Miller Band starts to play. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LUKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Family pictures, Red Sox pennants, etc. line the walls. Luke - 
           a CAN OF BUD in one hand, a PALL MALL in the other - stomps 
           around his wood-paneled living room singing along with John. 

                                 LUKE 
                        You’re the cutest thing I ever did 
                        see - I really love your peaches 
                        want to shake your tree!
                                 JOHN
                             (Crooning into a bottle)
                        Lovey-dovey-lovey-dovey all the 
                        time--

           Rocco sings backup from the arm of a recliner. 

                                 ROCCO
                        -WOO-WOO!

                                 LUKE
                        Ooey-baby, I’ma show you a sweet 
                        time...

           Bobby’s on the couch, keeping the beat with his head. 
           Jackie’s passed next to him. Jimmy’s KO’d on the floor. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Cause I’ma joker, I’ma--

                                 JOANIE (O.S.)
                        -Luke! What the fuck are you doing? 
                        I just got the baby to sleep! 

           Luke walks over to the stairwell, a big grin on his face. 

                                 LUKE
                             (to Joanie)
                        Don’t worry, don’t worry, Mamma, 
                        ‘cause I’m right here at home. 

           Bobby falls over laughing and wakes up Jackie. His Uncle and 
           John are dancing around, singing, laughing. He watches, 
           smiling, as if committing it all to memory.   

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - CALLEARY HOUSE - DAY

           John rolls over in bed, WINCING as he opens his eyes. He 
           looks around: he’s in a tiny, wood-panelled room with exposed 
           piping and a concrete floor. The clock on the night stand 
           says 11. He looks closer. There’s a POLAROID leaning against 
           it of his younger self (13) with QUINN (37), his father, in 
           full Boston Police uniform.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           John folds open the Globe at the kitchen table. The headline, 
           in big bold type, reads “BUSING.”

           Ma walks in, heels ringing off the tile. She’s dressed up. 
                                 JOHN CALEARY
                             (without looking up)
                        Where you off to?

                                 MA
                        “Meeting.”

           Ma pours herself a cup of coffee.

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        I heard you cartin’ Jackie’s dead 
                        ass in at 3 in the morning last 
                        night. Didn’t I tell you to watch 
                        out for him before I left?
                             (Off his grin)
                        Yeah, it’s real fuckin funny, John. 
                        You gotta be careful - all of you. 
                        Or you’re all gonna end up spending 
                        the rest of your lives in a fucking 
                        Church basement, too. 

           John nods along - he’s all heard this before. Ma sits down 
           and gives him a hard look he can feel through the paper. 

                                 JOHN 
                        I heard ya already, Ma. 

                                 MA
                        No, there’s something else I gotta 
                        talk to you about.   

           John looks over the Globe.

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        I went down to the bank the other 
                        day. With what’s left of your 
                        father’s insurance there’s uh... 
                        there’s only enough left to send 
                        one of you to parochial school.  

           She taps the “Busing” headline. 

                                 JOHN 
                        So send Bobby. 

                                 MA
                        I’m little more worried about the 
                        little one, you know?

                                 JOHN
                             (Shaking his head )
                        I wouldn’t be. Send Bobby. 
           John just turns back to the paper. Looking him over, Ma 
           smiles. He never even thought to argue his own case.  

                                 MA
                        So you’re not at all mad I’m not 
                        sendin’ you?

           John shakes his head. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        You know, there’ll still be money 
                        for your cop test though, right? 

                                 JOHN CALEARY
                             (Not looking up)
                        I know. 

           Ma smiles, a proud mother, and takes a sip of her coffee as 
           she considers this adult in front of her. 

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Luke stumbles down his stairs, gripping the rail. He’s hung 
           over - BAD. He hears VOICES coming from around the corner. He 
           peers around the stairwell and sees the Stivettis sitting at 
           the kitchen table with his wife. He’s not happy about it.  

           Sabatino raises a COOL HAND LUKE coffee mug.

                                 SABATINO
                             (Smiling)
                        Morning.

           INT. LUKE’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Luke sits opposite both brothers, Joanie at his side. 

                                 JOANIE
                        I asked Teeney yesterday, and he 
                        says he can find some kind of work 
                        for John this summer. 

           Luke gives Sabatino the DEAD EYE. He’s furious. 

                                 LUKE
                        Not a good idea. 

           The Brothers stare back at him, coldly. Joanie hikes the baby 
           up on her thigh. 
                                 JOANIE
                        It took my father callin in a favor 
                        to get you a job, honey. What 
                        chance does a kid have? I mean, 
                        your sister’s already worried sick 
                        about what the other two are--

                                 MARIO
                        -Give us some credit here, Luke. 
                        It’d be a legitimate job.

           Luke’s eyes swing to Mario like gun turrets.

                                 LUKE
                        OH, I’m sure. It just makes me 
                        curious why you’d go so far out of 
                        your way to tell me this if you 
                        didn’t think you were getting 
                        something in return.

                                 SABATINO
                        It’s just hauling boxes at the 
                        docks, brothah. What could we get 
                        from that--

                                 LUKE
                        -I’m sure you’d find something. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Look, Joan just said the guy needed 
                        a favor - only reason we’re here. 

           Joanie puts a hand on Luke’s arm. 

                                 JOANIE
                        The kid needs a job, Luke. He needs 
                        to stay busy with all the...you 
                        know. 

           Luke shakes his head. He doesn’t like this at all. 

                                 LUKE
                             (Sighing)
                        Fine. I’ll see what he wants. 

           Sabatino leans back in his chair, a small grin on his like he 
           just won something. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Ma’s at the table reading the Herald and smoking a 100. 
           Jackie stumbles in. He’s just waking up. 
           Ma looks at the clock. 2 p.m.

                                 MA
                             (Not looking at him)
                        Ya startin awful young, Jack.

           He drags a chair out from the table, wincing as the wood 
           SCREECHES on the tile floor. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                             (Haggard)
                        Sorry, Ma.

                                 MA
                        Yeah, you’re real sorry, Ma.

           She flicks him hard in the temple. He groans. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                         How’s your head?

           He places it flat against the table. Not good. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        You know, I’ve been thinkin about 
                        Catholic schools. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        That’s good. You always said you 
                        wanted to go back to college.

                                 MA
                        It’s for you, ya ball-buster.

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                             (Laughing)
                        The hell do I want with that?

                                 MA
                        How well you think you’re gonna do 
                        at that Jungle next year?

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                             (Shrugging)
                        The other two’ll be there.

                                 MA
                        Don’t worry about the other two. 
                        I’m talking about you right now. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        I’ll be fine. 
                                 MA
                        Another tough guy. Just what I 
                        needed. Wait until some nigger’s 
                        sticking a syringe in your eye...

           Ma stabs out her cigarette. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        ...then you’ll wish you’d listened.

           Jackie groans. He’s hungover and doesn’t want to hear 
           anymore. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        Just think about it, huh? All I’m 
                        saying. BC High? It’s an option.

           He nods. His head still pressed against the table.

           EXT. LUKE’S YARD - DAY

           Luke and John are sitting on the back steps, drinking a beer. 
           Luke rocks the baby in his car seat. 

                                 JOHN
                        What do you think? You think I 
                        should take it?

                                 LUKE
                             (Shrugging)
                        They’ll pay you well. Just know 
                        that I’m not sure about it.

                                 JOHN
                        What aren’t you sure about?

                                 LUKE
                        The Stivettis. 

                                 JOHN
                        I thought they were friends of 
                        yours?

                                 LUKE
                        Doesn’t mean you gotta know ‘em. 
                             (Off his look)
                        Look, you can take the job if you 
                        want - your mother could use the 
                        dough. Just be aware that ya 
                        brothers are gonna be watchin ya - 
                        everything you do this summer. 
                        You’re all they got - not to put 
                        too fine a point on it.
                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. I know. 

           He’s heard this before, too. 

                                 LUKE
                        Hey - just don’t say I didn’t warn 
                        ya, okay? But I’m telling you right 
                        now - if ‘Tino tries any of his 
                        shit? You come to me. Cause you may 
                        think you can handle this shit 
                        yourself. But I assure you: you can 
                        not. Not with them. Not yet.

                                 JOHN
                        Look, I don’t think Ima do it, 
                        either way. Money’d be nice. But if 
                        anyone finds out I did this it’ll 
                        fuck me on the Civil Service test.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, obviously, John, I think you 
                        can do better than being a cop. But 
                        it’s not an irrational fear to 
                        have, you know?

           Joanie suddenly storms out the back door.

                                 JOANIE
                             (To John)
                        It’s ya mother. Something with 
                        Bobby. I can’t make her out.

           John takes the phone, sighs. 

                                 JOHN
                             (into phone)
                        What he do now?

           INT. DISTRICT C-6 STATION - NIGHT

           John counts out a pile of money and hands it across a desk to 
           the waiting DESK SERGEANT.  

                                 SERGEANT
                        Broke some kid’s jaw in the T. 
                             (He counts the cash)
                        We woulda let him go with just 
                        paying the E.R. bill, but, you know 
                        your brother - he had to go reel 
                        off and hit the T Cop, too. 
                                 JOHN
                             (Shaking his head)
                        I’m sorry, Mr. McCafferty. 

           The Sergeant nods. He’s heard the apologies for Bobby before. 
           He stacks the cash into a neat deck and walks off. 

           EXT. DISTRICT C-6 STATION - LATER

           John and Bobby walk out the front door. Bobby rubbing his 
           wrists. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t give me that guilt shit, 
                        John. You know it was a bad break. 
                             (John shakes his head)
                        It was a T-Cop, John.  

           John keeps walking, refusing to talk to him. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I said I was sorry. Whattya 
                        gotta keep breakin my balls for?

                                 JOHN
                        You know Ma’s gotta pay to fix that 
                        kid’s jaw, right? How do you think 
                        she’s gonna do that and send you 
                        and Jackie to Catholic school, huh?
                             (Bobby sighs)
                        Yeah, you must be real upset, ya 
                        fucking prick. Who you thinks gonna 
                        go and earn that money now? You? 
                        Ma?

                                 BOBBY
                        I am sorry, John. But I said that 
                        already, okay? I’ll figure 
                        something out. 

           He whacks Bobby in the back of the head.

                                 JOHN
                        No. Don’t do shit. Just stop 
                        fucking up, okay? That’s all you 
                        gotta do. 

           Bobby looks down at the ground, emasculated. John storms off. 

           EXT. GATE OF HEAVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           John walks through the parking lot of a Catholic School. 
           INT. GROUNDS OFFICE - GATE OF HEAVEN ELEMENTARY - CONTINUOUS

           John follows Sabatino into a tiny basement office packed with 
           a desk, a filing cabinet and a beaten-up leather armchair. 
           John has to duck under the top of the door. Mario follows in 
           behind him. He’s impressed with John’s size. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Your uncle couldn’t talk you out of 
                        the job, huh?

           John shrugs. Sabatino points to the chair. John sits.

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        So you know your Uncle was hesitant 
                        about us doing you this favor?

           John nods. Sabatino waits for an explanation. Doesn’t get it. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        You don’t say much do you, kid?

                                 JOHN
                        No. Not particularly, Mr. Stivetti. 

           Mario and Sabatino share a knowing look. They smile. Quiet’s 
           a good thing. 

           EXT. T STOP - ANDREW SQUARE - DAY

           Bobby climbs off the bus, drawing an EVIL stare from an old 
           BLACK COUPLE waiting to get on. He ignores them. He looks 
           full of purpose. The BENCH at the STOP reads ANDREW SQUARE.  

           OUTSIDE THE SQUARE

           Bobby crosses a four-lane boulevard, walking towards COTTON 
           CLUB LIQUORS. A brown CADILLAC slows and crawls behind him. 
           Bobby acts as if he doesn’t notice and the Caddy peels off. 

           EXT. COTTON CLUB LIQUORS - ANDREW SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           COUSY (23) - a short, good-looking black kid - leans against 
           a wall, his hands in his pockets, trying to look casual. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY (O.S.)
                        Cooz, what’s going on, brother?

           Cousy smiles as Bobby walks up. 

                                 COUSY
                        Bobby C, whatchu doin’ over here?
                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        That new strange, man. You still 
                        got any of that bud from last week?

                                 COUSY
                        Oh, you know me, brother: I can 
                        supply. Whatchu want, whatchu need, 
                        Cousy got that hand that feed. 

                                 BOBBY
                             (Laughing)
                        Good. Cause Ima need a lot of it. 
                        Got some dough I gotta make up. 

           Cousy smiles. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nigger, what the fuck you doin?

           JO-JO (21) - wide, Haitian dark - and K.C. (24) - ugly, 
           crater faced - walk up to Cousy. 

                                 JO-JO
                        You just sell to any motherfucker 
                        rolls up on the corner now? The 
                        fuck, Cooz? You gotta be ja-dicious 
                        ‘bout this shit, man. 

           K.C. eye-fucks Bobby, as if he’s looking for a problem. 

                                 K.C.
                             (to Bobby)
                        Fuck you apin’ at, Ofay-bitch?

           Bobby raises his eye-brows. 

                                 COUSY
                        Nigger, this is Bobby C. Kid’s been 
                        wholesailing from me for years.

                                 JO-JO
                        Not on this corner he ain’t. 

           K.C. leans into Bobby’s face. 

                                 K.C.
                             (to Bobby)
                        Go back to Quincy. Cunt. 

           Bobby spits on the sidewalk between them.  

                                 BOBBY 
                        You forget what city you’re in?
           K.C. stands up real straight, as if he’s all of a sudden 
           serious. Bobby smiles. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Ga’right ahead, motherfucker. 
                        Fuckin please. Do something. 

           Cousy shoves K.C. and Bobby apart.  

                                 COUSY
                        Nigger get outta here - this my 
                        corner. You want to talk about how 
                        I aggregate my business? That’s a 
                        one thing. But right now? Just Let 
                        me do this thing.  

           K.C. backs up, arms spread. 

                                 K.C.
                        All right. I hear you.  
                             (to Bobby)
                        Hide behind your Uncle Tom, fucking 
                        faggot.  

           Bobby’s shoves Cousy out of the way and charges at K.C. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        What’d you call me, you fuckin’ 
                        nigger?

           Cousy grabs Bobby around the ribs and slams him into a wall. 

                                 COUSY
                        The fuck you do, you dumb bitch? 
                        I’m trying to calm this fucker down 
                        and you go call him a nigger? You 
                        think I need this shit?

           Bobby stares at him, eyes black.

                                 COUSY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause fuckin’ believe me - I 
                        don’t. Now, tell me one fuckin’ 
                        reason I shouldn’t knock you out 
                        myself?
                             (No Response)
                        Yeah, that’s right. Fuck you then. 
                        Now take this shit and get the fuck 
                        out of here. Don’t come back.  

           Cousy throws a bag of WEED in Bobby’s face. 

                                 COUSY (CONT’D)
                        Beat feet. 
           Bobby swipes the weed off the ground and walks away. 

                                 COUSY (CONT’D)
                             (to K.C.)
                        The fuck’s your problem, nigger? 

           Bobby mutters to himself as he storms off. But when he sees 
           the BROWN CADDY coming back up the street, he slows and 
           buries his head in his chest, just wishing he could be gone. 

           But the Caddy glides by, and Bobby SIGHS in relief. Then, 
           TIRES SCREECH behind him.

           Bobby he takes off RUNNING. But the Caddy catches up quick - 
           pulling right up onto the sidewalk and cutting him off. 

           Four BLACK MEN jump out of the car. 

                                 BLACK MAN 
                        Where you runnin to, motherfucker?

           Bobby rips the AERIAL off the Caddy’s hood and slashes the 
           nearest Black Man in the face, drawing blood. He cocks his 
           arm again, but they charge him - one grabs his arm, the other 
           his shirt. They toss him to the ground. 

                                 BLACK MAN (CONT’D)
                        You gonna pay for that shit, 
                        mo’fuckah.  

           Three of them hold Bobby down while the Man-with-the-Slashed-
           Face reels back and kicks him in the head. 

           EXT. FORT POINT CHANNEL - LATER

           Luke pushes a STROLLER along the channel, smoking a 
           cigarette, drinking a cup of DUNKIN DONUTS. He admires the 
           water, the BRIDGES, and the skyline of Boston beyond them.  

           As he comes to the Seaport Blvd. Bridge, a busted-up 
           CONTINENTAL screeches to a halt in front of him. John tosses 
           open the passenger door. 

                                 JOHN
                        Get in. 

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

           Luke and John storm in, and find Ma and Jackie seated. Ma’s 
           sobbing, face in hands, a burning 100 between her fingers. 
           Luke sits down and throws his arm around her.
                                 LUKE
                        What happened, honey?

           Ma looks up, her face tear streaked. 

                                 MA
                        Kid was in the wrong fuckin 
                        neighborhood...

           John sits down next to Jackie. Both of them are shaken. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how I’m going to deal 
                        with this shit, Luke, you know? It 
                        ain’t going to get any better. 

           John hangs his head. He feels responsible. 

                                 LUKE
                        It’s going to be alright, hon. He’s 
                        gonna be alright. Do you want some 
                        coffee? Anything?

           She shrugs, holds her hands out as if to say, “I don’t know.”

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. I’ll buy you a cup. 

           Luke helps her up. He looks over at John. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to do anything 
                        stupid, are ya? At least not 
                        without me?

           John slowly shakes his head. Luke walks Ma down the hall. 
           Jackie looks to John for a reaction. John just stares at the 
           floor. 

           INT. JACKIE’S ROOM - CALLEARY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           John and Jackie carry Bobby over to his bed. His face is 
           green-and-grey-and-purple. He’s got an arm in a sling. 

           They lay him down and pull the covers over him. Bobby curls 
           up and turns away from them. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        They really touched him up, huh?

           A door SLAMS down the hall. They can hear her Ma sobbing 
           through the walls. John’s jaw tightens. They both look 
           ashamed that they can hear her. 
                                 MA (O.S.)
                        ...I don’t know what I’m gonna do, 
                        I don’t know what I’m gonna do. Oh 
                        Jesus Christ, help me God...

           John looks over at Jackie, who’s looking up to him, waiting 
           for some signal of how to act. He’s got to say something. 

                                 JOHN
                             (To Jackie)
                        It’s okay. I’ll take care of it, 
                        pal. Okay? 

           Jackie nods, wipes at his eyes with his palms. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Jackie shoves a spoonful of RICE KRISPIES into his mouth. As 
           he chews, he looks across the table at...

           John, who’s shaking his head and staring off into nowhere, as 
           if he were disagreeing with a ghost. Jackie turns to...

           Bobby, who’s leaning on his elbows, looking into his cereal 
           bowl like it was a toilet. 

           The RICE KRISPIES’ crackle and pop are the only sounds in the 
           room. Until...

           John slams down his mug like a gavel. 

                                 JOHN 
                        The fuck were you doin down that 
                        parta town anyway?

                                 BOBBY 
                             (Takes a deep breath)
                        I was buying weed. 

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck you then. It’s your own 
                        fucking fault. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        I didn’t ask for ya fuckin 
                        arbitration on it, John. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s just like you - always askin’ 
                        for a fucking beatin. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                             (Leans into his face)
                        Just like you and the fuckin Baker. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Why you gotta go and bring that up 
                        for?

                                 JOHN
                        ‘Cause this shit never ends with 
                        you. 

           Bobby turns away. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What was the dealer’s name?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Fuck you, John. Forget about it. 

           John straightens in his chair, as if he were preparing to get 
           up and punch Bobby out. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                             (Relenting)
                        Hi names Cousy. Or “Cooz.” But he 
                        wasn’t the one laid the beatin’ on 
                        me.

           John pushes back his chair to get up.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        D’you hear me?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, I heard ya. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        What are you going to do then? 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, don’t you worry about it. 

           John tosses his coffee in the sink and storms out of the 
           house. Bobby stares helplessly back into his Rice Krispies. 

           Jackie gets up and gently places his bowl in the sink. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        You seen Ma?

                                 BOBBY 
                        I think she’s still in bed. 
                                 JACKIE 
                        Why?

                                 BOBBY 
                        The fuck would I know, Jackie?

           EXT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Luke walks out his front door in a blue CARHART jacket, 
           carrying a Dunkin Donuts thermos and a brand-new TOOL BELT. 

           Joanie holds the baby in front of the window, waving his hand 
           at Luke. Luke waves back, climbs into a ‘68 FASTBACK. 

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY

           John parks his CONTINENTAL in the lot across the street from 
           the Southie waterfront. 

           INT. CONTINENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           As John grabs his coat off the shotgun he can see a crowd of 
           men pouring into the FRONT GATE in his REARVIEW. He reaches 
           for his door when...

           It suddenly opens. Sabatino’s standing there holding a tray 
           of DUNKIN DONUTS.

                                 SABATINO 
                        You want one?

           John climbs out and takes a cup. Sabatino puts an arm around 
           him and they walk towards the FRONT GATE.

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        How’s your brother doin? Heard he 
                        got touched up this weekend, huh?
                             (John nods)
                        You know who did it?
                             (John shrugs)
                        Do you want me to look into it? 

                                 JOHN
                        Nah, I can take care of it myself.  

           Sabatino snorts, slaps John on the shoulder.  

                                 SABATINO
                        You’re a frighan class act. You 
                        know that, Johnny? 
           They walk through the gate just as the FOREMAN (45) - hard 
           hat, gut - walks out of his TRAILER. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Ho, Vinny. Over here. 

           The Foreman sees Sabatino and walks over. 

                                 MARIO
                        Vinny, this is Johnny Calleary. 
                        He’s gonna be working for ya now. 

           The Foreman stares at John, giving him a look as if to say, 
           “fucking great, another one.”

                                 FOREMAN
                        Nice to meet ya. 

           INT. COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           John and Luke are at the bar, smoking, a pair empties sitting 
           between them. Finn puts down two fresh ones.

                                 FINN
                        How was your first day of honest 
                        work ever?

                                 LUKE
                        Ah, wasn’t that bad. 

                                 FINN
                        Yeah? Well, pretty soon you’re 
                        gonna walk into the bathroom and 
                        find a fat, balding 37 year-old 
                        staring back at ya. You won’t even 
                        know what happened. 

           Luke musters up a laugh, and Finn walks off with the empties. 

                                 JOHN
                        Whattsa matter? You sound kinda 
                        tired. You getting old or 
                        something?

                                 LUKE
                             (Laughing)
                        Jesus Christ, it was one day. The 
                        fuck are you guys bustin me for?
                        How’s your brother?

                                 JOHN
                        He’ll live. Fucking asshole.  
           He takes a long pull off his beer. 

                                 LUKE
                        Ya? How you doin? You alright?

                                 JOHN
                        Niggers didn’t kick in my head.

           Luke stares at him. John’s holding something back. 

                                 LUKE
                        Well, you know if you need 
                        something you just ask, right?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. I know, Luke. 

           John signals Finn for another round. 

           EXT. DORCHESTER - NIGHT

           The Continental cruises past the Andrew Square T Station. 

           INT. CONTINENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           John searches up and down the sidewalks. He spots three BLACK 
           KIDS standing on a corner. 

           CORNER

           The Continental pulls up to the curb and John rolls down his 
           window. The THREE BLACK KIDS eye-fuck him hard. 

                                 BLACK KID
                        The fuck you want, narc?

                                 JOHN
                        You Cooz? Cousy?

                                 BLACK KID
                        Nigger, you want pussy go down 
                        Chinatown. I sell drugs, man.

                                 JOHN
                        That ain’t what I mean. Are you 
                        Cousy?

                                 BLACK KID 3 
                             (to Black Kid 1)
                        Who the fuck is Cousy?
                                 BLACK KID 2
                        Cousy that old white mo’fucker 
                        played for the Celtics.

                                 BLACK KID 
                        Man, get the fuck out of here. 

           The Black Kid shoos John away, but John just gives him a set 
           of dead eyes. The Kid stares back, but John’s unrelenting. 
           The Kid finally breaks. Satisfied they don’t know anything, 
           John peels off. 

           INT. HOUSE - DAWN

           Jackie, in boxer shorts and a Narrangansett Beer T-shirt, 
           walks towards Ma’s BEDROOM DOOR. He knocks three times. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Ma, you awake?
                             (No answer)
                        Ma.

                                 MA (O.S.)
                             (Muffled)
                        What?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Aunty Joanie’s on the phone. 

                                 MA (O.S.)
                        (Inaudible)

                                 JACKIE 
                        What?

                                 MA (O.S.)
                        Tell her I’ll call her back

           Jackie opens the door. Ma’s still wrapped in her covers. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Are you all right?

                                 MA
                        Yeah, just shut the door. 

           Jackie stares at her. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        When was the last time you went to 
                        one of those meetings?
                                 MA
                        Just shut the door, Jack.

           She curls away from him. Jackie, confused, shuts the door. 

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY

           A crew of men wearily walks out the front gate. All except 
           John, who charges past them and out into the parking lot -  
           determined. He throws opens the door to his Continental and 
           flings his hard hat inside. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - NIGHT. John, heavy-eyed, cruises Dorchester, sipping from a 
           cup of Dunkin Donuts. The clock radio reads midnight.

           - John pulls into the DOCK parking lot. It’s dawn. He throws 
           back his seat and lays down. 

           - John cruises Dorchester, again. He yawns. The clock radio 
           reads 2 a.m. He spots FOUR BLACK KIDS on the sidewalk and 
           pulls over. But when he sees they’re 12 or 13 - much too 
           young to have jumped Bobby - he swings back into traffic. He 
           rubs his eyes, as if they’re playing tricks on him.

           - John pulls into the lot as the sun’s rising. The lot’s 
           already full. He parks, and stumbles out of his car.

           EXT. DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

           John - bags under his eyes the color of leeches - slips a 
           CRANE HOOK into the netting of a CARGO PALLET. He gives the 
           CRANE a signal to take her up. 

           But as the netting’s pulled it slips, and the load of boxes 
           spills all over the deck - one narrowly missing John’s head.

                                 FOREMAN (O.S.)
                        Calleary!

           The FOREMAN storms over to John. 

                                 FOREMAN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is your problem 
                        today? You sick or what?

           John looks at the ground, pissed but knowing he fucked up. 

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry. 
                                 FOREMAN
                        Don’t tell me your sorry. Just do 
                        your fucking job. 

           John starts picking up boxes. The Foreman stands over him to 
           make his point. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DOCKS - LATER

           John storms off towards his Continental. A black CADILLAC 
           pulls up behind him. 

                                 SABATINO (O.S.)
                        Hey, Calleary. 

           John turns. Sabatino’s in the driver’s seat.

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get calls from your boss in 
                        the middle of the day? What’s the 
                        matter with you?

           John snaps, fires his hard hat off the back of his Lincoln. 

                                 JOHN
                        I worked my fuckin ass off the rest 
                        of the day. I told that cocksuck--

                                 SABATINO
                        -Hey, calm down, alright? I asked 
                        him to call if anything happened. 

           John stares at him, fuming. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Look, if you’re losin’ sleep over 
                        what happened to your brother? Let 
                        me handle it. I ain’t gonna be 
                        asking you for anything just ‘cause 
                        I cracked some niggers’ heads, you 
                        know what I mean? You’re 
                        practically family. 

           John looks off, thinking. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s asking you to be noble 
                        here, kid. Just gimme a name. 

           John sighs, relenting. 

                                 JOHN
                        Dealer’s name’s Cousy. 
                                 SABATINO
                        Old point guard for the Celtics?

           John gives him a look. You’re gonna make jokes? Sabatino 
           smiles.  

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Lemme look into it. 

           EXT. UPHAMS CORNER - NIGHT

           The Continental cruises along Dudley Street. 

           INT. CONTINENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           John drives, Luke sits shotgun. 

                                 LUKE
                        You been out here every night this 
                        week and you didn’t tell me? The 
                        fuck were you thinking?

                                 JOHN
                        You got a kid. 

           Luke winces. Never going to get used to hearing that. 

                                 LUKE
                        You know, your brother comin out 
                        here by himself is what got his 
                        head stove-in in the first place, 
                        right? 

                                 JOHN
                        It‘s different. 

           Luke stares at him, waiting for John to realize the 
           foolishness of what he just said. John doesn’t. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        So you ever done this before?

                                 LUKE
                        Whattya mean? Cruise for a dealer?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. Or buy from one? 

                                 LUKE
                        Ya bustin’ my balls, right?

           John smiles. He is. 
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for calling though. Even if 
                        it is a couple days late. I mean 
                        it.  

           John shrugs. He’s not happy he had to. 

                                 JOHN
                        Dad woulda been able to do it 
                        himself. 

           EXT. CORNER - UPHAM’S CORNER - CONTINUOUS

           Cousy sits on top of a BLUE MAILBOX, watching a shit-box 
           DATSUN pull up to the curb. He slides off, hands something to 
           the passenger and takes something back. 

                                 COUSY
                        Yall take care now. 

           The Datsun drives off. Cousy turns around and hands a WAD OF 
           CASH to Jo-Jo. He pulls himself back on top of his box, just 
           as the Continental turns onto the street. 

                                 JO-JO
                        Here we go, here we go. 

           Cousy walks over to the curb again as the Continental pulls 
           up. Luke rolls down the passenger window. 

                                 COUSY
                        Whatchu want, brother?

                                 LUKE
                        Well, I got this buddy tells me 
                        this cat Cousy’s got the prime 
                        squeef ‘round here. You Cousy?

                                 COUSY
                             (Shrugging)
                        Maybe. Either way though, my 
                        product is righteous. 

                                 LUKE
                        Nah. Too risky. Gotta be this guy 
                        Cousy. I’m not gonna get burned.  

           Cousy senses something’s up. He takes a cautious step back. 

                                 COUSY
                        Well, who is it gave you the line 
                        on this cat Cousy?
                                 LUKE
                        Oh just this kid - Bobby Calleary. 
                        You know him?

           Cousy stares at Luke, not sure what this is all about. Luke 
           just gives him a big, sadistic grin in return. Cousy BOLTS. 
           But Luke and John spring out of the car, each with a bat. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           John’s swollen and cut up HANDS rifle through a BOSTON GLOBE. 

           Jackie stares at them, wide-eyed and curious as he spoons 
           cereal into his mouth across the table. 

           Bobby sits down between the them. He’s carrying two pieces of 
           toast on a paper towel. 

           The radio’s on in the background. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ROAR, or Restore Our Alienated 
                        Rights held another protest last 
                        night...

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        We’re going to be hearing about 
                        this shit for years and school 
                        hasn’t even fuckin started yet. 

           Jackie sarcastically whistles Streisand’s “The Way We Were.” 
           John looks up. Jackie immediately stops. 

           Bobby takes a bottle of jam off the table and tries to open 
           it with his cast-hand, but he can’t get the cap off. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me...

           John and Jackie watch him. He pops it open, holds the jar 
           with his cast and reaches for a knife with the other. But the 
           jar slips and spills all over him.

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh what the fuck. 

           John smiles. Jackie laughs. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus fucking Christ.  

           He bends down to get the jar. The jam leaks into his cast. 
                                 BOBBY CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh now it’s in me fucking cast. How 
                        am ‘sposed to - FUCK.

           He wings the jar against the Fridge. It bounces off with a 
           dull THUD. John and Jackie laugh. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, it’s real fucking funny. 
                        Fuckin’ assholes. 

                                 JOHN
                        Fuckin moron. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        In breaking news...State and 
                        Municipal Police have been 
                        struggling all morning to restore 
                        order at Carson Beach, as a black 
                        protest...

           They all stop laughing. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        ...has been met with heavy 
                        resistance from South Boston 
                        residents...

           John and Bobby share a look. They both jump up from the table 
           and dash for the front door. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                             (Shocked)
                        Where you guys going? 

           EXT. STREETS OF SOUTHIE - CONTINUOUS

           John and Bobby run down the street, the shoreline in the 
           distance. Jackie trails behind them. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        Johnny, I don’t think this is a 
                        good idea. 

                                 JOHN
                        Then don’t come. 

           They keep running. 
           EXT. CARSON BEACH - DAY

           John, Bobby and Jackie find a line of POLICE CRUISERS 
           circling the beach, and a crowd of SPECTATORS circling them. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - HORSE MOUNTED STATE TROOPERS separate an angry black crowd 
           from an angry white crowd. Both sides talk shit at each other 
           over the horses.

           - A scrappy white kid gets carried off - an arm under each 
           armpit - by two MOUNTED TROOPERS. 

           - A line of uniformed MUNICIPAL POLICE lean against their 
           cars, arms folded, watching the circus. 

           - Cops stuff two black guys into the back of a BPD WAGON.

           EXT. CARSON BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           The Calleary’s start walking around the side of the crowd.

                                 COOLYAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, Calleary.

           Bootch and Coolyan climb out of the throng.

                                 BOBBY 
                        The fuck’s going on?

                                 BOOTCH
                        Bunch of niggers came down for like 
                        a sit in or some shit. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Someone should turn on the fucking 
                        fire house.

           John keeps searching the crowd. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        What are you looking for?

           John keeps walking until he spots a BIG BLACK GUY (24) - 6’5, 
           225 - and FIVE of his friends breaking free from the crowd 
           and heading across Day Boulevard towards the PARK. 

           John takes off at a sprint. Jackie suddenly sees why.

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        Oh shit. 
           ACROSS THE PARK

           A medium-sized BlACK GUY turns as he hears John coming, and 
           takes a running ROUNDHOUSE off the chin. Something CRACKS and 
           the medium-build Black Guy COLLAPSES. 

           John takes two running steps over him and crashes full steam 
           into the BIG GUY. John grabs him by the collar and drags him 
           to the ground. They roll over and over on top of each other, 
           kicking up dust and trading punches.  

           The rest of John’s crew catches up. 

           Bobby smashes a BLACK KID in the face with his cast. Both of 
           them scream. The Black Kid’s NOSE sprays blood.

           Jackie tackles another Black Kid to the ground. He straddles 
           him and starts beating the Kid’s face in. 

           John manages to pin the Big Guy down. He WAILS on him.  

           Coolyan trades blows with one Black Guy, as Bootch gets his 
           shirt pulled over his head and punched in the back.

           A POLICE WHISTLE BLOWS. 

           Jackie sees three MOUNTED TROOPERS riding towards the park. 
           He jumps off his vic, grabs Bobby, and runs.

           Most of the Black Kids pick themselves up and take off. 

           But John won’t let go of the Big Guy. He just keeps pounding 
           him. Jackie grabs him by the back of the shirt, pulls. John 
           falls backwards, sees the Troopers, and jumps to his feet. 

           The Callearys take off running. 

           EXT. STREETS OF SOUTHIE - LATER

           John leads his brothers through a tiny alley and down another 
           which opens onto a wide avenue. Sirens WAIL in the distance. 

           Coming out onto the main street, a COP CAR flies by, but it 
           keeps going. 

           They take a left onto the street and find themselves right 
           out front of the COMEHAIL.

           INT. COMEHAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Callearys stroll in, out of breath, and up to the bar. 
           It’s packed full a DAYTIME REGULARS. 
                                 FINN
                        What the fuck happened to all of 
                        you?

                                 JOHN
                        Troopers. 

           The Regulars turn around. 

                                 BARFLY
                        What’d you do?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Beat the shit outta a couple of 
                        niggers.

           The bar CHEERS. 

                                 FINN
                        All right, calm down. You can hide 
                        in the back. But keep the kid out 
                        of sight, all right? Please? I got 
                        enough trouble with the liquor 
                        board already. 

           They skulk over to a small table by the back door. 

                                 JOHN
                             (to Bobby)
                        Your hand okay?

           Bobby flexes his fingers, nods.

                                 BOBBY 
                        Still got jam in it. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        You all right?

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t worry about me. 

           Finn comes over and puts down three beers. 

                                 FINN
                        From the guys at the bar.

           John nods his thanks, and Finn moves off. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        I gotta take a piss. 

           Jackie gets up. John turns towards the Sox game on the TV 
           above the bar.  
                                 BOBBY 
                        You beat the fuckin shit out of 
                        that big Spade, huh?

                                 JOHN
                        He wasn’t no fucking joke though. 

           End of conversation. Bobby nods. John turns back to the game. 

           At the bar, a RUMMY (40), in a 1st Marine Division hat, and a 
           FAT GUY (45) lean over their beers, watching the Sox game.

                                 RUMMY-AT-THE-BAR
                        ...ain’t even gonna recognize this 
                        place. Five years from now? 
                        Completely different city. 

                                 FAT GUY
                        Maybe they repeal the whole thing - 
                        take the busing thing back. 

                                 RUMMY-AT-THE-BAR
                        Nah, that Garrity’s a federal fuck. 
                        Stubborn as a retarded bull. 
                        Thing’s ain’t ever gonna go back to 
                        the way they were. 

                                 FAT GUY
                        Tell ya what I’d like to do? I’d 
                        like to go up to that guy’s place 
                        in Winchester or wherever-the-fuck-
                        he’s-from, and take a big shit 
                        right on his goddamn front steps. 

                                 RUMMY-AT-THE-BAR
                        Probably already been done. But you 
                        know what we should do? We should 
                        blow up all the fucking bridges 
                        into South Boston. That’s what we 
                        should do: Fort Point, Day Blvd. 
                        All of em. That’d show them fucks 
                        but good. 

                                 FAT GUY
                        There’s other ways in...

                                 RUMMY-AT-THE-BAR
                        ‘Course, there’s other ways in! But 
                        it’s a political demonstration. The 
                        Judge and the Governor’d sure as 
                        shit get the fucking message by 
                        then, right? You know, it’s like a 
                        Don’t Tread on Me, motherfucker 
                        kinda thing.
           Bobby looks over at John, who’s still staring at the game, 
           drinking.   

                                 FAT GUY
                        You know...that’s an idea. That is 
                        a solid fucking idea. 

                                 FINN
                        What are you two bullshit artists 
                        babbling about? 

                                 FAT GUY
                        We’re going to blow up the bridges 
                        into South Boston. Me and this 
                        fucking guy over here. 

           John finally sees Bobby’s staring at him. 

                                 FINN
                        Hell, that is an idea. I’d say it’s 
                        worth at least a draft. 

           Bobby and John share a look. But Jackie sits back down 
           between them and the moment’s broken. Bobby downs his beer.  

                                 BOBBY 
                             (to Jackie, RE: his beer)
                        You gonna finish that?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Yeah. Fuck off. I earned it.

           Jackie grabs his beer and starts drinking. Bobby looks over 
           at John, who’s already gone back to watching the game. 

           INT. JACKIE’S ROOM - CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bobby and John carry Jackie in drunk. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        No, he’ll never return/no he’ll 
                        never return/his fate is still--

                                 JOHN
                        -Hey. 

           Jackie stops, looks at John. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You think Ma wants to see you come 
                        home reeking again? No. Shut ya 
                        mouth.  
                                 JACKIE 
                             (Smiling)
                        All right, all right. Ya don’t 
                        gotta tell me twice. 

           They toss him into bed, and he rolls over - passed out. Bobby 
           sits down on his own bed. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        It’s such a fuckin’ shame, all of 
                        this, you know? Like, when did you 
                        ever have to run from a fucking cop 
                        after a fight in this city?

                                 JOHN
                        Places change. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Not here, man.

           The room goes silent. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I wonder who could we get to do 
                        it...

           John gives him a look. 

                                 JOHN
                        What are you talking about?

           Bobby stares at him. You know. Johns gets it, rolls his eyes. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It wasn’t a bad idea, John.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh het the fuck outta here, Bobby. 
                        You’re a fucking loon.

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s something we could actually do 
                        though, you know? Protest. It’s 
                        like Tea party kinda shit. 

           Realizing Bobby’s serious, John crawls into his face. 

                                 JOHN
                        Get it out of your fucking mind. 
                        Right now. We’re not doing it. I’m 
                        not doing it. I catch you doin it, 
                        I’m gonna beat your fuckin face in. 
                        You got me? 
           John stares right into his eyes to make sure Bobby gets it. 
           Bobby just looks away. John walks out. 

           Bobby falls back in his bed. He stares up at the ceiling, 
           thinking. 

                                 JACKIE
                             (Drunk, half-asleep)
                        What are you guys even talking 
                        about?

                                 BOBBY
                        Shut up and go to bed. 

           INT. HOUSE - DAY

           Jackie walks in the front door. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        Ma? You up? I just got my class 
                        schedule, frighan... 

           He walks into the kitchen and finds Ma at the table. A SIX 
           PACK of unopened BUDWEISER sitting in front of her. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Ma, what the fuck are you doing?

           Ma shakes her head and takes a long drag off her 100. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give me that, Ma. What the 
                        fuck?

                                 MA
                        I’m just scared, Jackie.

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        And this is gonna help? Jesus 
                        Christ. You need to talk to 
                        somebody, get out of the god damn 
                        house for Crissakes. 

           He walks over to the phone. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LUKE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Joanie puts the phone between her ear and shoulder as she 
           pulls the baby’s BOTTLE out of a pot on the stove. 
                                 JOANIE
                        I’ll be right over, sweet-heart, 
                        okay? Tell her to stay there...I 
                        said I’d be right over, all right? 
                        I’ll see ya in a few.

           She tests the bottle on her wrist and walks into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           She finds Luke on the couch, drinking a beer and half-
           heartedly playing with the baby. 

                                 JOANIE (CONT’D)
                        I guess your sister’s dangling off 
                        the back of the wagon. I told the 
                        boys I’d go over and talk to her. 

                                 LUKE
                        You want me to come?

                                 JOANIE
                        No, it’ll be alright. She’s not 
                        drunk, just a little emotional. 

                                 LUKE
                        Okay. I guess I’ll just see you 
                        later then.  

           Joanie hands him the bottle and walks out. He looks down at 
           the milk, the baby. Something seems to hit him. When did I 
           suddenly get domesticated? He doesn’t look happy. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Jackie opens a cabinet. It’s empty. 

                                 JOANIE (O.S.)
                        Honey, you’re missing work...

           Jackie opens the fridge. Baking soda. Half a carton of milk. 

                                 JOANIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re sleeping all day...

           Jackie sits across from John at the table, spinning open a 
           bag of WONDERBREAD. 

                                 JOANIE (CONT’D)
                        You need to start taking care of 
                        yourself, honey. 
           John watches as Jackie eats the plain bread. Jackie sees him 
           staring and offers him a slice. John looks into... 

           THE LIVING ROOM. 

           Joanie’s sitting next to Ma, lovingly rubbing her back. Ma’s 
           got her face in her hands. 

                                 JOANIE (CONT’D)
                        If you can’t take care of yourself, 
                        honey, how are you gonna take care 
                        of them?

           Ma trembles, crying quietly. 

           In the KITCHEN, John clenches his jaw; he knows who’s going 
           to have to take care of them. Frustrated, he reaches across 
           the table for a slice of bread.

                                 JACKIE
                             (Chewing)
                        It’s not bad. 

           INT. COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           Bobby sits at the bar with Jimmy Mull and Rocco. Rocco’s bent 
           over a SCRATCH TICKET with a quarter. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        You’re just bustin’ me right?

           Bobby shakes his head. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS (CONT’D)
                        You really want to do this?

           Bobby’s dead serious. Jimmy sighs. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS (CONT’D)
                        Well, if you’re actually 
                        serious...yeah, we can do probably 
                        do that. 

                                 BOBBY
                        How much do you think the...you 
                        know, how much does stuff like that 
                        usually cost?

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Probably around...

           Jimmy Mull writes a FIGURE on a napkin. Bobby takes it in. 
           It’s big. 
                                 ROCCO
                        But hell, if we tell the guy what 
                        it’s for? They’ll probably give it 
                        to us for nothing.

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Lemme ask ya something though, do 
                        your brother or your uncle know 
                        what you’re up to?

                                 BOBBY
                        Nope. 

           Rocco and Jimmy Mull exchange a look. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just say “not yet.”

           EXT. DOCKS - DAY 

           John rides a pallet as a CRANE carries it from SHIP DECK to 
           DOCK. As he climbs off, the Foreman walks over.

                                 FOREMAN
                        Calleary. Trailer. Now. 

           John looks confused. 

           INT. FOREMAN’S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           John walks in carrying his gear - hard hat, lunch pail, etc. - 
           and finds Sabatino sitting at the Foreman’s desk, Mario on 
           his couch. They’re both eating big, fat DELI sandwiches. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Hey, kid, how are ya?

           John eyes Sabatino’s sandwich like a set of tits.

                                 MARIO
                             (RE: the sandwich)
                        You can take ya lunch if you want. 

           John lifts up his PAIL. It quietly rattles like it’s empty, 
           and he decides not to open it. Mario shrugs. Suit yourself.

                                 SABATINO
                        So that thing went all right with 
                        your brother, huh?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. It went all right--
                                 MARIO
                        -We heard. We got dealers on the 
                        next street. 

           John smiles, politely. Why’d you ask then?

                                 SABATINO
                        Look, we uh, we got a job we think 
                        you might be particularly good at - 
                        thought we’d ask. No pressure. 

           John shrugs. I’ll listen.  

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Well, we got this guy on our crew - 
                        older guy, right? He’s got some 
                        money out on the street, but he’s 
                        getting a little long in the tooth 
                        to make his rounds, know what I 
                        mean? So, uh, essentially...you’d 
                        do that.

                                 JOHN
                        Loanshark?

                                 SABATINO
                        No, no, no, no. You collect for the 
                        loanshark. You don’t actually loan 
                        anything yourself. 

                                 JOHN
                        I gotta break guys up?

                                 SABATINO
                        Nah. These are all old timers 
                        mostly. Guy’s puttin’ a little 
                        money on the Bruins. They ain’t 
                        gonna give you any problems. 

                                 MARIO
                        It’s solid pay.

                                 JOHN
                             (Quickly)
                        Yeah, sure. I’ll do it. 

           The Stivettis share a look. They’re pleasantly shocked. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Yeah?
           EXT. DUNKIN DONUTS - DAY

           Rocco climbs into his CHARGER with a tray of coffees and a 
           bag of PASTRY. He hands a cup to Jimmy in the shotgun.  

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Thanks.
                             (He takes a sip)
                        Fuck. 

                                 ROCCO
                        What? 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        They never make this shit right. 

           He takes off the lid to his coffee, and just as he brings it 
           to his lips, the car SHAKES. He spills it all over himself. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS (CONT’D)
                        Oh holy fuck!

                                 LUKE (O.S.)
                        Get a real job, motherfuckers. 

           Jimmy looks in the rearview. Luke’s bouncing on the fender. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        You son of a bitch! My cock feels 
                        like a fucking egg, you prick.

           Luke climbs in the back seat, laughing. Rocco’s crying he’s 
           cracking up so hard. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS (CONT’D)
                        Keep laughing. Fucking hyena.
                             (to Luke)
                        What the fuck do you want?

                                 LUKE
                        Just seeing what you two faggots 
                        were up to. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        What, you bored playing dad 
                        already?

           Luke shrugs. 

                                 ROCCO
                        Go have another kid then.
                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, ‘cause that worked out for 
                        your old man, huh? Your sister’s a 
                        fucking General Practitioner and 
                        her little brother steals shit off 
                        the backs of trucks. 

                                 ROCCO
                        And what’s that? A career you want 
                        another go at?

                                 LUKE
                             (Grinning)
                        Who knows? You got anything good 
                        going on?

           Rocco looks over at Mullins. Should we tell him? Mull subtly 
           shakes his head. 

           INT. JACKIE AND BOBBY’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           A MAP of SOUTH BOSTON is spread out on Bobby’s bed, Bobby 
           drags his finger along the FORT POINT CHANNEL. 

           His face is healed now, and his arm’s in a light cast. Bootch 
           and Coolyan are on either side of him. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        You got the Northern Avenue bridge 
                        at the mouth of the channel.

           INSERT: A rusting wrought iron bridge. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Then you got Seaport boulevard 
                        going over the Moakley Bridge.

           INSERT: A duel lane, concrete/steel bridge. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Congress and the Tea Party. 

           INSERT: The H.M.S. BEAVER/BOSTON TEA PARTY MUSEUM floats 
           under a concrete bridge with a retractable iron center. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        And after that, you got both lanes 
                        of Summer Street. That’s a two-fer 
                        right there.

           INSERT: A four lane bridge, the date of construction (1899) 
           cut into the wrought iron suspension arched over the roadway.
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Now, you wait for the one day a 
                        year traffic into South Boston is 
                        non-existant...

                                 BOOTCH
                        St. Patrick’s Day. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        And boom. Yastrzemski goes yard. 

                                 COOLYAN
                        What if they take back busing 
                        before then?

           Bobby holds out his hands at this side.

                                 BOBBY 
                        Hey - God willing.

           His buddies nod, impressed. But suddenly... 

           The door’s thrown open and Jackie walks in, tossing his coat 
           on his bed. Bobby jumps up and tries to hide the map.

           Jackie sees him scurrying and looks intrigued.

                                 JACKIE 
                        The fuck are you guys doing?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Don’t worry about it. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Ho shit! You still got those 
                        pictures of Aunty Joanie? You know 
                        Luke’ll flip a shit he finds out. 

           Jackie moves towards the bed. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Jackie, get the fuck out of here. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Come on, what is it?

                                 BOBBY 
                        I’m not going to tell you again: 
                        get lost. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Whattya gotta be a cocksucker for? 
                        Fine. Fuck you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACKIE  (CONT'D)
                        Like I give a fuck -I’ve seen a 
                        beaver picture before, you fuckin 
                        faggot. 

           Jackie turns to storm off. Bobby and Bootch and Coolyan 
           exchange looks. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Can you keep your mouth shut about 
                        something?

                                 JACKIE 
                        What do you think?

                                 BOBBY
                        ‘Cause if I tell you, and you 
                        squawk to John? I am going to break 
                        your fucking arm, Jackie. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Jesus, Bobby - yeah, I heard ya.

                                 BOBBY
                        We’re gonna blow the bridges on the 
                        Fort Point Channel. 

           Jackie stares at him. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Either you’re new or you think I’m 
                        fuckin retarded. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        We are going to blow up the bridges 
                        across the Fort Point Channel. 

           Jackie walks over to Bobby and slaps him across the face. 
           Bobby, dumbstruck for a second, quickly snaps out of it and 
           tackles Jackie to the floor. He punches his brother in the 
           gut, repeatedly. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You fucking asshole, the fuck is 
                        your problem? Huh?

                                 JACKIE 
                        My problem? My problem!

           Jackie kicks Bobby off, slamming him into a dresser. A shower 
           of loose baseball cards rains down on him. 
                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re the one talking like a 
                        fucking black panther. You go soft 
                        all of a sudden? 

                                 BOBBY
                        This is our town, Jackie. We’re 
                        lettin’ ‘em know, we ain’t --

                                 JACKIE 
                        -Your town? And they’ll stick you 
                        in a cell for the rest of your life 
                        for it, too. Is that worth it?

                                 COOLYAN
                        Yeah, it’s fucking worth it. 

           Jackie turns from Coolyan to Bobby. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        For one fuckin stupid Pyrrhic 
                        victory? That’s what the rest of 
                        your life is worth to you?

                                 BOOTCH
                             (to Coolyan)
                        The fuck is a Pyrrhic victory?

           Jackie jumps to his feet, and grabs his jacket.

                                 BOBBY
                        Where you going?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Don’t worry about it. 

           Bobby leaps up, slams the door shut. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to call up the FBI, 
                        Bobby. That’s where I’m going. 

           Bobby picks him up by the shirt front. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        I got my fucking first day of high 
                        school tomorrow, I just wanna get 
                        some sleep, ya fuckin bastard. 

           Bobby puts him down and Jackie tears out of the room, 
           slamming the door shut. 

           “Time” by the Chambers Brothers starts to play. 
           EXT. SOUTHIE HIGH - DAWN

           A row of UNIFORMED COPS lines the front steps facing a mob of 
           PROTESTORS twenty feet in front of them, screaming, carrying 
           signs. “HANG NIGGERS,” “THIS IS OUR TOWN,” “NIGGERS GO HOME.” 

           Three NEWS TRUCKS pull up down the street.

           EXT. BUS DEPOT - DAWN

           A row of YELLOW SCHOOL buses turn over their engines. 

           INT. CALLEARY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jackie opens the front door and stares out at the 
           neighborhood. He can already hear SIRENS in the distance. 

           INT. BUS - DAY

           A bus full of BLACK KIDS looks tired, worried, on edge as 
           they watch Southie whip by out the windows.

           SOUTHIE HIGH - SERIES OF SHOTS:

           Jackie turns a corner in front of the school and finds...

           - The crowd has grown (in size and volume) since daylight. 

           - Leagues of news cameras panning over the CROWD, the SIGNS, 
           the COPS.

           - The first bus pulling onto the block, and the crowd 
           turning, eager to meet it.

           INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

           The driver puts the bus into low gear and crawls towards the 
           school. As he reaches the first protestors, the bus is 
           peppered with rocks, beer cans, pieces of concrete, etc. One 
           woman SMASHES the side of the bus with a HOCKEY STICK.

           The kids duck under their seats, screaming. 

           A ROCK is hurled through a windshield.  

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Jesus fucking Christ.
           He accelerates the bus through the crowd, and past the high 
           school. A Black Kid watches as they blow by the school. 

                                 BLACK KID
                        Aw fuck, man, now we gotta go back!

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Ma sits at the table in her bathrobe, nervously chain 
           smoking. The radio’s on. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...four students already taken to 
                        the Carney hospital...

           Ma lights a new cigarette off the old.

           INT. CLASS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A TEACHER (50) sits on his desk and looks out over his class: 
           four kids, including JACKIE. He reads from his ledger. 

                                 TEACHER
                        Allen?

                             (No Response)
                        Boone?

           SHOUTS can be heard in the hallway, and the class turns 
           towards the glass inlay in the door. 

           THROUGH THE WINDOW.

           Two BLACK KIDS and two WHITE KIDS exchange blows. One black 
           kid smashes a white kid’s head off a locker. 

           A UNIFORMED COP and a Teacher run towards the fight.

           BACK IN THE CLASSROOM.

           The Teacher looks up from his ledger. 

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to South Boston High. 

           Jackie scribbles “fuck” onto his desk. 
           EXT. SOUTHIE HIGH - LATER

           A band of PROTESTORS marches towards the school carrying a 
           banner reading: ROAR.

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           - Police drag protestors towards POLICE WAGONS. 

           - Buses, already banged up, pull away from the schools and 
           are again pelted with debris. 

           - A reporter stands in front of a protestor/cop SCUFFLE, 
           reporting into a Channel 7 CAMERA. As he glances over his 
           shoulder, a 7-11 big GULP EXPLODES off the back of his head.   

           EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT

           Rows upon rows of damaged, dented, and busted-up yellow buses 
           line the lot, their engines ticking down and cooling off. 

           INT. CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jackie walks in and finds the house empty. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Hey Ma. 

           There’s no answer, just the whine of the radio.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Ma?

           Jackie walks into the KITCHEN. No one there. He turns off the 
           radio on the table. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Ma? You home?

           IN THE SINK, he finds an empty bottle of SMIRNOFF stuck down 
           the drain. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Aw Ma you didn’t haveta. 

           He smashes the bottle against the sink, and slices his hand.  

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t FUCKIN haveta.
           INT. JACKIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jackie sits on the floor, his back against his bed. He tosses 
           a tennis ball against the wall, catches it on the bounce, and 
           tosses it back. His right hand’s wrapped in a dirty bandage.

           A window’s open. SIRENS echo in the distance. He bounces the 
           ball, catches it, bounces it back. 

           Bobby slowly pushes open the bedroom door. When Jackie 
           doesn’t look up, he walks in and sits down next to him. 

           Jackie just bounces the ball, catches it, throws it. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m sorry I knocked you around last 
                        night, Jack.

           Bounces the ball, catches it, bounces it back. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You know it ain’t a nigger thing, 
                        right? What I’m trying to do here? 
                        It ain’t about them. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        I don’t give a fuck. 

           Bobby stares at him. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        This uh...This about Ma then?

           John quietly walks in, he sees Jackie and frowns. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Look, Jack, she’s just gonna do 
                        this every once in awhile. She has 
                        forever. You just can’t take it so 
                        personally. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Get the fuck away from me, Bobby. 

           Bobby looks to John, and off his nod, moves out of the way. 
           John sits down next to Jackie, and just sits there next to 
           him for awhile. Jackie keeps bouncing the ball. 

                                 JOHN
                        You know Dad...before he went...

           Jackie holds the ball for a second.
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ...He fucking hated this place. 
                        Hated the neighborhood: the 
                        attitude, the bullshit; the people - 
                        people like the Stivettis.  

           Jackie faces John. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        That’s why he worked 60, 70 hours a 
                        week at the station - so we could 
                        get a house like this, have some 
                        place to go. We used to live down 
                        Old Colony, when you were real 
                        little - I don’t know if you 
                        remember that. But Dad, even here, 
                        he’d always say he wanted to leave. 
                        Said he didn’t want us to live the 
                        kinda life that comes with a place 
                        like this, you know? What he and Ma 
                        and Uncle Luke had. A place like 
                        this it’s...it’s a jungle. It makes 
                        you an animal. It’ll make you hard, 
                        but you ain’t much use for anything 
                        else after it, you know?

           Jackie tosses a look at Bobby. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        And since Dad’s been gone, I’ve 
                        thought a lot about that. How come 
                        we didn’t go? Why’d we stay? And I 
                        think Dad, you know, he knew 
                        better. But to be honest? He wanted 
                        to stay. He wanted to stay just as 
                        much as the rest of them. ‘Cause 
                        this was home. As much as it broke 
                        his balls, this is what he knew - 
                        what was safe to him, what he knew 
                        was safe for us. That’s why no one 
                        ever leaves here, Jackie. ‘Cause 
                        that’s a rare thing in life - to 
                        feel safe some place; like it’s 
                        your own. Most people never have 
                        that - their whole lives they never 
                        have anything like it. But most 
                        people here do. Or did. And now, 
                        it’s all being taken from ‘em.

           Jackie looks back up at Bobby again. Bobby raises his 
           eyebrows. See what I mean?  
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        And Ma, she’s never known anything 
                        else. She’s not like Dad in that 
                        she can see a way out of here, or 
                        know that things will get better. 
                        She doesn’t, and she worries, and 
                        this is what happens. But what I’m 
                        saying is that we’re here for you. 
                        Your uncle’s here for you. Things 
                        might look like shit, but this is 
                        still Southie, Jackie. We’re gonna 
                        get through it.

           John puts a comforting hand on his brother’s shoulder. Jackie 
           shrugs it off, and throws the ball against the wall again. 
           But as he catches it, he wipes his eyes on his arm. 

           John sees this and gets up. He walks by Bobby on his way out.

                                 BOBBY
                             (to Jackie)
                        You see what I’m talkin about?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Blowin’ up a part of the 
                        neighborhood ain’t gonna save it, 
                        Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, but if busing is our sentence 
                        in life, man? It’ll put a fucking 
                        exclamation point at the end of it. 

           Jackie looks away. He throws the ball again, and Bobby just 
           stands there, watching him throw and catch, throw and catch. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. TABLE - COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Bobby folds a BOSTON HERALD in his lap and passes it under 
           the table to Jimmy. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That enough for now?

           Rocco peaks into the paper. He shows it to Mullins. Mullins 
           eyes widen. 

                                 ROCCO
                        Certainly’ll get things moving. 
                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        The fuck did you get all of that?

                                 BOBBY 
                             (Grinning)
                        Shovelling drive ways. 

           INSERT: EXT. FLASHBACK - SOUTHIE DOCKS - DAWN

           Bobby pulls a box of LOBSTERS out of an open CARGO CONTAINER, 
           and tosses it to Coolyan. Next to him, Bootch - a pair of 
           BOLT CUTTERS hanging around his neck - already holds a box.

           BACK TO THE COMEHAIL

           Mullins and Rocco smile, knowing Bobby’s full of shit. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You find a place to put the plunger 
                        yet?

                                 ROCCO
                             (Grinning)
                        Yeah. Ya gonna love it. 

           EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           An OLD MAN (65) in a ratty bathrobe opens his door to find 
           John waiting for him. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Oh, hey kid. Look, I’m sorry, but 
                        I, uh, took a good fall at work and-

           John holds up a hand. 

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Honest, John, I can’t pay my heat, 
                        how am I supposed to...

           John turns and walks towards the EXIT sign.  

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, where - what are you gonna do?

           John pushes opens the exit door, walks out.  

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck? Who are you, my wife 
                        with this silent shit. Come on.
                             (No response)
                        Kid?
           The SOUND of BOOTS ringing off steps echoes into the hallway. 

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright! KID! Come back, come back! 
                        I’ll give you what I can. 

           John walks back into the hall. 

                                 JOHN
                        Told ya I wasn’t gonna argue with 
                        ya, Mr. Goldsmith. 

           Mr. Goldsmith digs into his WALLET. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Yeah, yeah. But just tell me, for 
                        my own edification: what were ya 
                        gonna do?

                                 JOHN
                             (Smiling)
                        Just be happy you didn’t find out. 

           EXT. SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

           Sabatino rifles through a stack of dirty-looking bills at his 
           desk. Every once-in-awhile he stops, flips a bill around, and 
           picks up his count where he left off. 

           Mario hovers over the desk, nodding along with Sabatino’s 
           count. He looks over to John leaning against the door jam. 

                                 MARIO
                        Kid - I don’t know what to say. 
                        You’re a born Shy.

                                 SABATINO
                             (Peeking up at John)
                        You sure you’re not circumcised?

           Sabatino tosses him a thick ENVELOPE. John awkwardly catches 
           it in his gut and smiles. 

           INT. DISTRICT C-6 - SOUTHIE POLICE STATION - DAY

           The SERGEANT reads and APPLICATION FORM at an arm’s length.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Seems like you’re all set, 
                        Calleary. Just need ya exam fee. 

           John hands him the ENVELOPE. The Sergeant smiles. 
                                 SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        Now, just behave yourself, and come 
                        June you’ll be golden. 

           John taps the desk, as if to knock on wood, and walks out. 

           INT. SOUTHIE HIGH - DAY

           Jackie walks out of a class followed by six or seven of his 
           peers. He looks tired, worn down - slugs under his eyes. He’s 
           also bigger, about two inches taller, and an inch wider. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: DECEMBER. 

           He notices down the hall three BLACKS squaring off against 
           TWO WHITES. One of the whites smacks the books out of a Black 
           Kid’s hands.

           Jackie throws himself in between them. They are all 
           noticeably bigger than him.

                                 JACKIE 
                        Whoa-whoa. Ya just gonna get busted 
                        you do this here. 

                                 BLACK KID 1
                        Man fuck off, nigger. This ain’t 
                        your business. 

           Jackie stares up at him, a knowing grin on his face. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Hey, I’m just trying to help you 
                        out, soul brother. You don’t want 
                        me in this fight, believe me. 

           The Black Kids whistles derisively. His friends laugh. 

                                 BLACK KID 1 
                             (to his buddies)
                        Oh shit! You hear that? He’s--

           Jackie snaps. He rabbit punches the Black Kid in the THROAT, 
           and drops him to his knees. The two other White Kids pounce 
           on the other two blacks. 

           Jackie stomps the one he hit. WHAM. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Laugh at me again. Ga’head!

           A UNIFORMED COP runs over and tries to pull Jackie off.   
                                 UNIFORM
                        Calleary, cut the shit! 

           Jackie elbows the Cop in the gut, winds up, and kicks the 
           Black Kid in the chest - violently. The Black Kid GASPS. 

           The Cop and a Teacher take Jackie to the ground, cuff him. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Whattya want? He fuckin’ laughed at 
                        me! Fuckin’ nigger laughed at me!

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DUSK

           Jackie walks down the front steps followed by Uncle Luke. 

                                 UNCLE LUKE
                        You startin in with this shit now?

                                 JACKIE 
                        I was trying to break it up.

                                 UNCLE LUKE
                        Yeah? Well, next time don’t. Do 
                        yourself the favor - don’t worry 
                        about anyone but yourself. Alright? 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Sure. Just don’t tell John, okay?

           Luke stares down at him. He’s genuinely worried.  

                                 UNCLE LUKE
                        All right, but you owe me for the 
                        bail then. 

           Jackie laughs. Fine, but how am I ever gonna pay ya? Luke 
           snorts, and puts his arm around Jackie’s shoulders as they 
           walk down the street. 

           EXT. DOCKS - DUSK

           John climbs into his CONTINENTAL. 

                                 SABATINO (O.S.)
                        The fuck you still doin this shit 
                        for?

                                 JOHN
                        Jesus Christ.

           John turns around. Sabatino’s in his back seat. 
                                 SABATINO
                        What, we don’t pay you enough or 
                        something?

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know. It keeps me grounded. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Really? You being serious? ‘Cause I 
                        like that. That’s good. 

           John gives him a small non-committal grin - maybe he’s 
           kidding, or maybe he just needs the money. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Either way - I gotta to talk to you 
                        ‘bout something. 

                                 JOHN
                        Well, you obviously got my 
                        attention. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Good, ‘cause you’ve been doin’ well 
                        for us, kid. Real good. This beat 
                        we got you on? It’s a cash flow 
                        again. Money used to come in as 
                        steady as an old man’s piss. Now? 
                        Hey - I had another one of you? 
                        We’d run Hanover Street like a $2 
                        Chink-whore, you know? Anyway, 
                        ‘cause of that, we thought we’d 
                        offer you sort of a promotion. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m all set, Mr. Stivetti. 

                                 SABATINO
                        You don’t even know what I’m 
                        talking about. Whattya shakin ya 
                        head for? 
                             (John shrugs)
                        You’re just like your uncle with 
                        the fucking head shaking. You wanna 
                        at least hear what I was gonna say?

           John stares at him, waiting. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        We need a guy on a job--

                                 JOHN
                        -What kind of job?
           Sabatino sighs. He was hoping he wouldn’t have to get to this 
           so quickly. 

                                 SABATINO
                        A bank job. 

           John turns around and puts the car in gear...

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen: you’re 
                        not gonna have to do shit, all 
                        right? All you gotta do is hold a 
                        gun and stand around. That’s all. 

           ...and pulls the car out of his space. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Hey look, we just need a cool hand, 
                        all right? That’s all. That’s it. 
                        Just a fuckin’ cool hand-- 

           John puts the car in first, but before he can drive off, 
           Sabatino SMACKS him upside the head. HARD.

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Hey, fuck-head - you forget who the 
                        fuck you’re talking to you? Check 
                        your rearview mirror. You 
                        disrespect me again, I’ll slit your 
                        fucking throat and leave you for 
                        the bums. 

           John stops the car, and puts it into park. He takes a moment 
           to straighten himself out, and turns around. 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re right, Mr. Stivetti. I am 
                        sorry. You’ve been very generous to 
                        me. But I’m going to have to say, 
                        “no” to this one every time.  

           Sabatino stares at him. John just stares back. He’s not 
           changing his mind. 

                                 SABATINO
                        Well, that’s all you had to fuckin’ 
                        say, you fuckin’ prick. 

           Sabatino jumps out of the car. 
           INT. COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           Luke, Jimmy Mullins and Rocco nurse HIGHBALLS at the bar. 
           Each one has two empties in front of him. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        ...shipment of detonators comin’ in 
                        out of Camp Edwards. We just gotta 
                        meet the guy on 495, take ‘em off 
                        his hands. Small time stuff. Easy.

                                 LUKE
                        Who in the fuck is buying 
                        detonators from the army?

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Fuck if I know. Guy’s white and 
                        paying up front. I ain’t askin’ 
                        questions. 

           Rocco gets up from his stool, fishes a few bills out of his 
           pocket and tosses them on the bar. 

                                 ROCCO
                        All right, I’m out of here. 

           Jimmy Mullins looks at his watch. 

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Me, too. 
                             (to Luke)
                        I’ll see you tomorrow then. 

           Rocco slaps Luke on the shoulder and they walk out. Finn 
           comes over, starts collecting the empties off the bar. 

                                 FINN
                        ‘nother one?

           Off his look, Finn takes down the bottle of JACK. 

                                 FINN (CONT’D)
                        Guess who I had in here today?

                                 LUKE
                        I’d say if you were lucky, you had 
                        one broad that didn’t look like she 
                        had seafood in her draws. 

                                 FINN
                        Yeah, that’ll be the day my old 
                        man’ll be playing hockey in hell 
                        with Rocket Richard. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FINN (CONT'D)
                        Nah, I had the Federal Bureau of 
                        Investigation honor me with their 
                        good graces today. That’s who I had 
                        in here. Guys got nothing better to 
                        do but come in tossing this place, 
                        chasing some drunken bullshit.

                                 LUKE
                        What’re you talking about?

                                 FINN
                        Couple months back I had these two-
                        shit bums in here, right? They’re 
                        fuckin bombed, yacking about how 
                        they’re gonna blow up all the 
                        bridges on the Fort Point Channel. 
                        Just your typical drunken bullshit,  
                        you know? But some idiot took ‘em 
                        seriously, and made a federal 
                        fucking case of it. I mean, they 
                        didn’t even send the Staties to 
                        look into it, Luke - the fucking 
                        Feds. Can you believe that? 

           Finn places a fresh one in front of Luke. 

                                 FINN (CONT’D)
                        Neighborhoods gone to shit. 

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah. How ‘bout that. 

           Luke, concerned, throws back his drink. He takes a look over 
           his shoulder at the door. 

           EXT. DORCHESTER - NIGHT

           A rusting 1970 PINTO cruises down an empty boulevard, hugging 
           close to the sidewalk. 

           INT. PINTO - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby and his crew, dressed in MUNICIPAL POLICE UNIFORMS, 
           search both sides of the street.

                                 COOLYAN
                        Told you my uncle could get those 
                        uniforms. Fuckin legit, right?

                                 BOBBY’S FRIEND IN THE BACK
                        Fuckin legit.
           Bootch is searching out one of the side windows.

                                 BOOTCH
                        What year was it?

                                 BOBBY 
                        I don’t know. It was just a fuckin’ 
                        brown Cadillac. 

           Bobby’s eyes pop open as they pass a BROWN CADDY and three 
           BLACK GUYS standing around a barrel fire.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        There! Stop the fuckin’ car. 

           EXT. CORNER - DORCHESTER - CONTINUOUS

           The three Black Guys watch as the Pinto backs up and stops in 
           front of them. Bobby rolls down his window. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Hey, Spade, this your car?

                                 BLACK MAN
                        The fuck is it to you, Jethro?

           Bobby points to the uniform, but it looks more like a 
           Halloween costume on him.

                                 BOBBY 
                        It’s more than eighteen inches off 
                        the curb, ‘chucker.  

                                 BLACK MAN 2
                        Fuck you, boy. Get the fuck outta 
                        here. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Hey, in all seriousness, is it your 
                        car? I’m wondering if it’s for 
                        sale? I like shit brown Caddies. 

                                 BLACK MAN
                        No, it ain’t for sale, you ofey, 
                        Opey lookin’ cocksucker. Now, beat 
                        it. 

           Bobby ducks his head back INTO the car. 

                                 BOBBY 
                             (to his boys)
                        Well, I’d say that’s a “yes.”
           Bobby, Coolyan, Bootch and three other guys fly out of the 
           car carrying baseball bats, pipes, etc. 

           The Black Men immediately TAKE OFF. One guy sprints away, but 
           the other two are no faster than the younger white kids. And 
           they get caught. 

           Bobby flings a BAT at Black Man 1’s legs, tripping him up. 
           Coolyan catches Black Man 2 and drags him to the ground by 
           the shirt front. 

           Then they beat the ever loving shit out of them. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Three to one’s better odds than you 
                        gave me, you fuckin’ nigger!

           Bobby raises his bat and smashes the Black Man’s KNEE. The 
           Man lets out a guttural SCREAM. But as Bobby raises the bat 
           again, SIRENS CRY OUT in the distance. Bobby drops the bat.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. 
                             (to buddies)
                        Fuck it, let’s screw.

           They race back to the Pinto, and as Bobby climbs in, he sees 
           the INTACT AERIAL on the brown Caddy. His EYES WIDEN.   

           EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

           John deliberately counts a wad of CASH very slowly - almost 
           agonizingly slow. 

           A SHORT GUY (30) - in a ruffled suit with no tie -  stands in 
           his doorway watching John, nervously rubbing his suspenders. 

           John raises his eyebrows as he nears the end of the roll. 
           It’s not going to be enough. He starts counting even slower. 

           Suspenders foot runs in place. He can’t take much more of 
           this slow play. John reaches the last bill, shakes it between 
           his fingers...it’s not...quite...enough...

                                 SUSPENDERS
                        Okay. 

           He takes off his shoe. Thrusts the remaining money at John. 

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks. 
           The Short Guy slams the door. John laughs, and as he turns to 
           leave, a RUNNER (13) walks out of the stairwell and into the 
           hallway, out of breath. 

                                 RUNNER
                        Boss is lookin’ for you. 

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

           Sabatino and Mario stare gravely at John in the doorway. 

                                 JOHN
                        What he do this time?

                                 SABATINO
                        Rolled a Spade dealer in Dot. Spade 
                        who pays Jay Santanello for 
                        protection. You know who Jay 
                        Santanello pays for protection? 

           John mouths “FUCK” to himself. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Yup. Me. Ya boy’s fucked up pretty 
                        good here, Johnny.  

                                 MARIO
                        Smashed a guy’s knee into a 
                        thousand pieces. They might have to 
                        saw the leg off. A shin at least--

                                 SABATINO
                        -My brother likes to exaggerate. 
                        But in all seriousness, the kid’s 
                        lit a fuse that leads right up his 
                        ass hole on this one. It’s a long 
                        rope, but it’s burning...

           John presses his palms into his eyes. 

                                 JOHN
                        Well, I’m assuming there’s an 
                        “unless” in here somewhere, or you 
                        wouldn’t have even called me.

                                 SABATINO
                             (Smiling)
                        ...Unless he’s got a nice brother 
                        willing to go to bat for him.

                                 JOHN
                        All right, I guess I’m in then. 
                                 MARIO
                        Well...then the nigger’ll be taken 
                        care of tonight. 

           A rare, and haunting grin slithers across Mario’s face. 

           EXT. CORNER - SOUTHIE - DAY

           Bobby and his friends stand in front of a BARREL FIRE, 
           rubbing their hands together over the flames, when...

           John’s Continental FLIES around the corner onto their block. 
           He comes right at them, jumps the curb and smashes into their 
           barrel - sending Bobby’s friends scattering like the ashes 
           and embers. 

           Bobby stands there - shocked - as John hops out of the car.

                                 BOBBY 
                        The fuck John?

           John punches him flat out in the face. Bobby falls straight 
           back onto his ass - his eye already swelling. John climbs on 
           top of him, back hands him across the mouth. 

                                 JOHN
                        You fuckin retard. You fuckin - you 
                        know what you did? Huh? You know 
                        what you did, you piece of shit?

                                 BOBBY 
                        The fuck you talkin’ bout!

                                 JOHN
                        You rolled the wrong nigger, you 
                        dumb motherfucker.

                                 BOBBY 
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        You didn’t get the guys that beat 
                        ya up - you rolled one of the 
                        Stivettis’ dealers, you fuck!

                                 BOBBY 
                        Oh no. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah, brother. What’d you think? 
                        There was one brown Cadillac in all 
                        of nigger town? You fucked me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You fucked me right in the ass, 
                        Bobby. I’m in now. I’m fuckin IN!

                                 BOBBY 
                        I’m sorry, John--

           John punches him in the head and stalks back towards the car. 

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           John lays on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. Jackie walks 
           down the steps and cautiously peers into the room. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        You seen Ma?

                                 JOHN
                        No. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        You know, it’s been weeks now... 

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck you want me to do, Jackie?

           Jackie shrugs, turns to walk away. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Wait. 

           John takes a small TRUNK out of his closet and opens it. 
           Jackie’s eyes pop open. It’s full of STACKS OF $20s. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Look, if you get a call about me 
                        tomorrow...

           He hands Jackie a WAD OF CASH.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ...take this and go downtown. Get 
                        the best kike lawyer you can find. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        This got something to do with why 
                        Bobby’s spitting teeth?

           John exhales deeply, and lies back down.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        This like one of those Rub-a-Dub 
                        situations?
           John looks at him.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub, 
                        the butcher, the...you know, the 
                        Baker? Ma’s old boyfriend?

           John stares at him like, “What’s your point?” 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I don’t remember much about 
                        when Ma was bringing him around, 
                        you know, after Dad... I just 
                        remember him tooling on ya... you 
                        know, before you got big. But I do 
                        remember Bobby. Kid used to just 
                        piss the guy off just to piss him 
                        off. Knew exactly what would happen 
                        every time-- 

                                 JOHN
                        -Yeah. He’s always been that way. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        But how many times you gonna catch 
                        the beating for him, John?

                                 JOHN
                             (Sighing)
                        We’re family, Jack. That’s just 
                        what we do. 

           Jackie lets this sink in. Makes sense. He puts the money in 
           his pocket, and walks up the stairs. 

           John continues staring at the ceiling. 

           EXT. CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           John walks down the street to his curb-parked CONTINENTAL. As 
           he pulls out his keys, a CAR turns onto his road. As it 
           nears, it suddenly SPEEDS right at him and only screeches to 
           halt inches from his knees.

           Luke jumps out. Livid. 

                                 LUKE 
                        What the fuck did I tell you? Huh? 

           He shoves John halfway down the block. 
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t I tell you: the minute they 
                        push the line, you fuckin’ call me? 
                        Didn’t I say that?

           Luke shoves him again, gets in his face. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t I say that?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes. You did. 

                                 LUKE
                        Then what the fuck are you doing?

                                 JOHN
                        I - I don’t know. 

           Luke slaps him upside the head. A good one. 

                                 LUKE
                        What the fuck would ya father do if 
                        he saw you acting like some shanty-
                        Irish trash from Charlestown?

           Before John can respond, Luke grabs him by the shirt, and 
           throws him up against his car. He holds him bent back over 
           the hood. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You know exactly what he’d do. He’d 
                        knock your fucking teeth right down 
                        your throat, you dumb fuck. 

           John hangs his head. He knows it’s true. Luke pulls him off 
           the hood and shoves him towards the passenger door.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Now get in the fucking car.

                                 JOHN
                             (Shocked)
                        What, why?

                                 LUKE
                        Don’t ask questions. Just get in.

           John, with no other choice, climbs in. The Stang takes off. 
           INT. MUSTANG FASTBACK - DAWN

           Luke drives, sipping from a cup of DUNKIN DONUTS. John’s 
           asleep in the shotgun, his head pressed against the glass.

           Suddenly Luke slaps John on the shoulder. John stirs. 

                                 LUKE
                        You hear any of this shit about 
                        someone trying to blow up the 
                        Northern Avenue bridge?

           This grabs John’s attention. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Finn said he had the FBI in his bar 
                        askin’ about it. You heard 
                        anything?

           Something dawns on John. He’s heard this somewhere before...

                                 JOHN
                        Where’d--

                                 LUKE
                        -Shut the fuck up.

           Luke holds up a hand and reaches for the radio dial. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...Three men were apprehended this 
                        morning at the foot of Quincy’s 
                        Fore River Bridge after fleeing the 
                        scene of a bank robbery...

           Luke deliberately looks at John and points to the radio.  

                                 JOHN
                        How many time you want me to tell 
                        you, you were right, huh?

           Luke shakes his head.  

           INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY

           Sabatino very matter-of-factly eats a plate of ravlioli at 
           his desk. He HEARS his DOOR OPEN, turns, and finds John 
           standing there. 

                                 SABATINO
                             (Mouth full of pasta)
                        Oh kid, thank Christ you’re all 
                        right.
           The door flies open, and Luke storms in. He grabs Sabatino by 
           the throat and presses a .38 SPECIAL up against his head. 

                                 SABATINO (CONT’D)
                        Luke, what the fuck are you doing?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m going to blow a hole in your 
                        forehead and stick my cock in it, 
                        you fat guinea fuck. 

                                 SABATINO
                        You forget who--

                                 LUKE
                        -Don’t pull that shit with me, you 
                        faggot. I ain’t impressed. We both 
                        know where each other stands, and 
                        right now you’re looking up at me. 

           Sabatino nods. Slowly. He swallows the food in his mouth. 

                                 SABATINO
                        All right. So let’s talk: why do 
                        you want to stick your cock in my 
                        brain?

           INT. JACKIE’S ROOM - CALLEARY HOUSE - LATER

           Bobby sits on his bed, chewing a fingernail. Jackie watches 
           him from across the room. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        You don’t know what happened. Calm 
                        down. 

           Bobby shoots him a look. Jackie shrugs. John suddenly crashes 
           in through the door. 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s taken care of. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                             (Sighing with relief)
                        Oh thank Christ.

           CCR’s “Fortunate Son” starts to play...

           Bobby, Coolyan, Bootch and Jackie approach a half-dozen 
           ROWBOATS lining the beach. 
           Bobby picks up a chain that runs through them all and Bootch 
           slides his BOLT CUTTERS off his shoulders. 

           INT. YMCA - DUSK

           Jackie pulls on a ROWING MACHINES, his face beaded with 
           sweat. Across the Y is a WINDOW looking onto a group of WHITE 
           KIDS playing in the POOL, not a care in the world.

           EXT. ACCESS ROAD - I-93 - NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER - NIGHT

           Luke’s in the driver’s seat of his MUSTANG watching Rocco and 
           Jimmy pull a TRUCK DRIVER out the cab of an 18 WHEELER. 
           Rocco’s got a gun to the guy’s head. 

           Luke yawns, takes a sip of COFFEE.

           INT. BOBBY/JACKIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby pops open an OD green wooden box labelled, “Camp 
           Edwards,” that looks as if it’s been sitting in a storage 
           room since the end of Korea. Jackie’s eyes go wide. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Who are you, Robert McNamara? Where 
                        the fuck did you get Army shit?

           Bobby pulls an relic PLUNGER-type detonator out of the box, 
           smiling like a pig in shit.   

                                 BOBBY
                        Mull and Rocco had Luke get...
                             (Realizing what he just 
                              said)
                        But don’t you say a FUCKING WORD to 
                        him! You hear me?

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - DAY

           John pulls out his money trunk. The stack’s dwindled. 

           EXT. FORT POINT CHANNEL - DAY 

           Rocco and Mull stroll along the water, studying the bridges. 

                                 ROCCO
                        You believe we’re doing this shit 
                        for a fuckin 16 year-old kid?
                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                             (Shrugging)
                        When he’s right, he’s right.

           EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

           Hard and dirty snow lines the bricks along Government Center. 
           And crude paper clovers hang on the front door of City Hall.

           SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH.

           Jackie walks out wearing an EAGLE SCOUT UNIFORM, a roll of 
           PAPER - like architecture plans - tucked under his arm. He 
           looks ridiculous. Even though he’s only 14, he looks way too 
           big, too old to be wearing that uniform. 

           “Fortunate Son” comes to an end. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ma - shitfaced and haggard - stumbles around the kitchen, a 
           carton of EGGS under one arm and a drink in the other hand. 

           EDDIE RIECHART (50) - cheap suit; solid-big, but with a wide 
           gut - sits at the table, stone-faced, tired. 

           She reaches for a cabinet over the stove and accidentally 
           pulls down a stack of POTS AND PANS. They CLATTER and bang 
           all over the floor. She giggles, picks up the pan she wanted.  

                                 JACKIE (O.S.)
                        Ma, what are you doing?

           Ma turns and finds Jackie watching her. Both of them are 
           horrified at seeing of each other. She tries to smile it 
           away, but her face just comes off looking like an ashtray. 

                                 MA
                        Oh. Hey, baby. I’m just making 
                        Eddie and myself something to eat. 

                                 JACKIE
                        With what?

                                 MA
                        Huh? With--

                                 JACKIE
                        -With the food John bought?
           Ma’s lips part but nothing comes out. Eddie gives Jackie a 
           stern look. But Jackie just stares right back at him. He 
           could give a fuck about this guy and his looks.  

                                 MA
                             (Reaching)
                        Honey, I...Look...Alright, I’m 
                        sorry. We’re just...me and - OH! 
                        Hey. Come here, I want you to meet 
                        my friend over here.

           Ma throws her drink-hand around his shoulder, and ushers him 
           over to the table. Jackie’s too mad to notice she’s spilled 
           booze on his shirt. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        Jackie, this is Eddie. 
                             (to Eddie)
                        Eddie, this is my son, Jackie. 

           Eddie stands to shake his hand, but Jackie just sits down, 
           blowing him off. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Which one are you? The baby, right?

           Jackie just stares at him. Ma sits down between them, the 
           eggs still tucked under her arm. 

                                 MA
                        Hon, Eddie’s brother’s a mechanic. 
                        He changes all the oil on the Red 
                        Sox cars, can you believe that?

                                 JACKIE 
                             (Deadpan)
                        Yeah. 

           Eddie frowns slightly. He’s not liking this kid at all. 

                                 MA
                        You know, come summer, he can 
                        probably get us all tickets... 

           Jackie gives his mother the DEAD EYE. Shut up. She looks 
           away, embarrassed. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Not the talkative type, huh?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Look, I’m sure you’re a nice enough 
                        guy, Ed. But you’re way out of your 
                        depth here. 
           Eddie smirks.

                                 MA
                        Jackie.

           Jackie gives her another look. Shut your mouth. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t know what you’re gabbing 
                        about, kid, but--

                                 JACKIE 
                        -The last man that set foot in my 
                        father’s house that wasn’t related? 
                        Never set foot in the neighborhood 
                        again. That’s kinda what I’m 
                        talking about. 

                                 EDDIE
                             (Laughing)
                        Yeah, you think what you want about 
                        that. Ain’t gonna work this time.  

           Eddie flops out his gold DETECTIVES shield.

                                 JACKIE 
                             (Unphased)
                        I guess it’s going to be pretty 
                        hard for you to do your job, huh?

           Eddies, fed up, lunges across the table - quick for a big guy 
           - and Jackie nearly falls out of his seat dodging him. 

           But in that moment, the front door slams shut. John walks in. 

                                 JOHN
                        The fuck’s going on?

           Eddie sees John and backs away from Jackie. 

           Ma just sits there, shocked quiet and unsure of herself. The 
           eggs slide out of from under her arm and crack on the floor. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        When’d you get home?
                             (No response, RE: Eddie)
                        The hell’s Popeye Doyle over here?

           Eddie lets his hands fall to his side, smack off his thighs.  

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Ma)
                        You know what? You and an omelet 
                        ain’t worth the fuckin trouble.
           He storms out, and the door suddenly banging shut snaps Ma 
           out of her reverie. She wheels on Jackie and slaps him across 
           the face. 

                                 MA
                        What the fuck got into you?

           Jackie jumps up and takes off out of the room. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you turn your back on me, you 
                        little piece of shit. 

           Ma launches out of her seat. But John grabs her. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        John, what the... What’s going--

                                 JOHN
                        Calm down, where’ve you been?

                                 MA
                        Lemme--

                                 JOHN
                        -Calm down. Talk to me. 

                                 MA
                        Fuck you, calm down, talk to me! 
                        Don’t tell me to calm down! Who the 
                        fuck do you think you are? I’m your 
                        mother - I ask the questions. 

           She tries shoving away from him, but John holds her. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        No mother should have to go through 
                        this bull.... Lemme go - let 
                        me...My own children turning their 
                        backs on me. Turning their backs on 
                        me!

                                 JOHN
                        Ma. Sit. Down. 

                                 MA
                        Fuck y--

                                 JOHN
                        -I said, “sit down!” 

           She looks up at John, afraid now. She sits.  
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Where have you been? 

           Ma’s eyes bulge with tears. 

                                 MA
                        Oh I don’t...I don’t know. I don’t 
                        know, John.
                             (Off his furious look)
                        I need help, honey. 

                                 JOHN
                        I know that, Ma. But that doesn’t 
                        answer my question.

           Ma shakes her head, and bursts into tears. She collapses into 
           a seat at the table, and John, filling with pity, sighs and 
           puts his arm around her. She WALES. He hugs her closer. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           John carries Ma, passed out, over to her perfectly made bed, 
           and lays her down. The room is immaculate. He gently tucks 
           her in and looking up, sees a picture of his father hanging 
           above the bed. He turns out the light on his way out.  

           EXT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Luke and John sit on the front steps sharing a BUD. 

                                 LUKE
                        She really that bad?

                                 JOHN
                        She ain’t getting any better. Bobby 
                        found her passed out on the toilet 
                        this morning. I mean, what if that 
                        was Jackie, you know? The kid  
                        might not look it, but he’s still 
                        only 14.

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t know what to tell you. 
                        She’s always been like this, my 
                        sister...’cept when she was with 
                        your father. Rest his soul. 

           John turns his palms up. He doesn’t know what to do.  

                                 JOHN
                        Well, I don’t know - I don’t know 
                        what to do, Luke. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        If I put her up somewhere? I mean, 
                        that’s it. That’s all we got. 
                        That’s what’s left of the Stivetti 
                        money and I can’t support them 
                        sorting bananas at the A&P, you 
                        know? There’s just no money left. 

           Luke polishes off his beer. He’s going out on a limb here.

                                 LUKE
                        Look, I don’t have that kinda cash 
                        right now. Otherwise...But if you 
                        can put her somewhere, for now... 
                        I’ll make sure your brothers are 
                        taken care of later. 

                                 JOHN
                        How you gonna do that on a union 
                        salary with a wife and kid?

           Luke gestures as if to say, “don’t worry about it.” John just 
           stares at him, suspicious. 

                                 LUKE
                        What are you giving me the look 
                        for? Trust me, alright? I ever let 
                        you down before? We’ll find the 
                        money.

           John looks away, as if he doesn’t think it’s a good idea.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Look, you can’t support ‘em forever 
                        anyway, John. At some point that 
                        job's going to end, then what are 
                        you going to do?

           John turns his palms up again. He doesn’t know. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ma peals her face off the plastic lining on the table. She’s 
           being shaken. There’s a HANDLE of Vodka within her reach.

                                 MA
                        Huh? Wha’s goin...?

           John’s wrapping a Bruin’s sweatshirt around her. 

                                 JOHN
                        Come on, Ma. Let’s go for a ride.
                                 MA
                        Johnny, what are you talking about?

                                 JOHN
                        Come on. 

           John picks her up, puts her on her feet. She stumbles, but he 
           holds her, and helps her out of the house. 

           EXT. REHAB - DAY

           John pulls up to the front door of a rehab hospital. Ma comes 
           around, sees where she is.

                                 MA
                        A hospital? What’s a hospital doing 
                        here, John? Are your brothers all 
                        right?

                                 JOHN
                        They’re fine, Ma. 

           John gets out, carrying his MONEY BOX and opens her door. 

                                 MA
                             (Confused)
                        But what did I do, John? Am I all 
                        right?

           John looks away. 

                                 MA (CONT’D)
                        What did I do? 

                                 JOHN
                        Nothing, Ma. You’re all right. 

           John unclips her belt and helps her out of her seat. 

           INT. REHAB WAITING ROOM - LATER

           John sleeps sitting up. Two BOSTON COPS walk over to the 
           FRONT DESK. A Nurse hands them John’s MONEY BOX and points 
           him out in the waiting room. 

           One of the COPS, a hard, dumb-looking man of 27, kicks John’s 
           foot. John wakes up, surprised to see a cop in his face.   

                                 COP 1
                        This your shit?
                                 JOHN
                        Hm? 

           The Cop holds up the box. John nods. It’s his. 

                                 COP 1
                        All right, you’re gonna have to 
                        come with us, guy.

                                 JOHN
                             (Shocked)
                        What? Why? 

                                 COP 1
                        Worry about that later. Get up. 

                                 JOHN
                             (Tired, confused)
                        I don’t understand...do you...do 
                        you know who I am? 

           Before he even gets it out, John realizes this was a mistake. 
           The Cop looks pleased by the comment, as if any hint of 
           arrogance gives him the license to be a prick.  

                                 COP 1
                        Oh should I, Mr. Kennedy? Excuse me 
                        for disturbing your nap inside the 
                        waiting room of your local rehab. 

                                 JOHN
                        Look, I didn’t mean...my father was 
                        just on the job for--

                                 COP 2
                        -Don’t give a fuck who your father 
                        was, or what your father did. These 
                        tracking numbers were reported 
                        stolen a week ago. Get your ass up. 

           John can’t believe it. 

                                 JOHN
                        No. They weren’t... I earned that.

                                 COP 1
                        Yeah, “you earned it.” You got a 
                        pay stub? Who’s paying you?

                                 COP 2
                        Not gonna ask you again, kid. Get 
                        off the fucking ass.

           John doesn’t know how to respond. Cop 2 leans into his face. 
                                 COP 2 (CONT’D)
                        Up. 

           John resignedly pushes himself out of his seat. Cop 1 grabs 
           him and shoves him up against the wall. 

           INT. DISTRICT C-11 - DORCHESTER POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           John walks out of the holding pen and up to the Shift 
           Sergeant’s desk. Without looking up, the Sergeant hands him 
           his things and coldly turns back to his paper work.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Show up to court Monday. 

                                 JOHN
                        What’s the--

                                 SERGEANT
                             (Deliberately)
                        -Show up to court Monday. 

           John slowly realizea he’s not the Cop’s son anymore - he’s 
           just another Southie punk. He swallows this, and stares 
           blankly at the Sergeant.   

                                 JOHN
                        What’d ya do with my mother?

           EXT. DORCHESTER POLICE STATION - LATER

           John slowly walks down the front steps towards Luke’s 
           halfback. Luke’s leaning against the hood. 

                                 LUKE
                        The Stivettis call in the serial 
                        numbers as stolen cash?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, I’m sure.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m sorry, pal. 

           He holds his hands out at his sides.

                                 JOHN
                        All I wanted to do was be a cop, 
                        you know? Now what? What do I got? 
                        A fucking criminal record. The fuck 
                        am I gonna do now? Huh? The fuck am 
                        I gonna do...
           He looks exposed, lost. Luke wraps his arms around him. John 
           lets him. 

                                 LUKE
                        It’s a shit job anyway, John. 

           John holds onto him tight. 

           EXT. KELLY’S ROAST BEEF - REVERE BEACH - NIGHT

           Jackie, Rocco and Jimmy Mullins sit on the sea wall, eating 
           roast beef. A large, plastic KELLY’S BAG sits in between 
           them. The TAKE OUT JOINT is lit up behind them. 

           Two ITALIANS walk up to the sea wall carrying their own BAG. 
           They sit down next to Jackie. 

                                 ROCCO
                        That doesn’t look like it can hold 
                        a lot of explosives. 

                                 ITALIAN
                        You got the cash?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Maybe.

           The Italian bends down, looks into Jackie’s face. 

                                 ITALIAN 
                        The fuck is this? You bring along 
                        your kid brother?

                                 JACKIE 
                        Think of it this way: you consider 
                        letting anyone know about tonight? 
                        Realize you’re about to sell high 
                        explosives to a fuckin minor. 

           The Italians laugh. 

                                 ITALIAN
                        Who is this kid? I like this kid.  

           Rocco and Jimmy Mullins smile. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Your money’s in the bag, pal.  

                                 ITALIAN
                             (Smiling)
                        Well, your shit’s already in your 
                        trunk. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ITALIAN (CONT'D)
                        Think about how we did that if you 
                        wanna tell people who we sold 
                        explosives to. 

           Jackie smiles like this is the best night of his life -
           talking shit to mobsters, eating Kelly’s. The Mobster grins 
           back at him. They all turn to their roast beef. 

           INT. CALLEARY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jackie SLAPS a cheap bottle of Vodka off the table. It makes 
           a dull thud as it hits the floor and chugs out under the 
           stove. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You cheap fuck. Fuck the both of 
                        ya. 

           John and Bobby watch him calmly from the table.  

                                 JOHN
                        Jackie, look--

                                 JACKIE 
                        -This is a family right? That’s 
                        what you said, “this is a family, 
                        we’re family, that’s what we do?”

                                 BOBBY 
                        Look Jack, it wasn’t in the plan to 
                        have her sectioned to Bridgewater--

                                 JACKIE 
                        -Oh fuck off, Bobby. The 
                        competition between you and Ma for 
                        biggest pain in the ass has been 
                        going on for fucking years. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        I’m won’t ever argue with you 
                        there. But you never had to go 
                        through what we did, Jack. She had 
                        to be out of the house. She needs 
                        help. 

                                 JACKIE
                        But why not put her some place - 
                        not a fuckin state mental 
                        institute. What happened to the 
                        money?

           John shoots a look at Bobby: don’t tell him. 
                                 JOHN
                        It wouldn’t have covered it. 

           Jackie makes a jerk-off gesture and storms off. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Jackie, you don’t know what the 
                        fuck you’re talking about. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh fuck you.

           John and Bobby share a look. How are we gonna explain this? 
           John rolls his eyes. He knows, but he doesn’t want to do it. 

                                 JOHN
                        Look, you never had to find her 
                        fuckin catatonic, naked in the 
                        hallway after a binge.

           Jackie pauses halfway up the stairs. Bobby takes John’s lead. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You never had to hear her getting 
                        railed by whoever on a given night. 

                                 JOHN 
                        You never had to search for a 
                        fuckin piss stain on a rug like you 
                        were cleaning up after a dog.

           Jackie looks as if he’s about to burst into tears. 

                                 BOBBY
                        We hid that shit from you. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s what family does. You just 
                        do the best you can. But sometimes 
                        you just gotta know when to stop. 

           Jackie stares at him. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Call me an asshole all you want, 
                        pal. But that’s what I did: I did 
                        the best I fucking could. It wasn’t 
                        my fault.  

           Jackie trudges up the stairs. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Ah fuck it, John. He doesn’t know. 
           John ignores him, runs his hands through his hair. It’s 
           obvious he’s been hurt by Jackie’s reaction. 

           INT. MUSTANG FASTBACK - NIGHT

           Luke barrels down a stretch of open highway following a MACK 
           TRUCK. But as they come around a bend, the truck SLAMS to a 
           stop and nearly jackknifes. Luke spins out, punching the 
           breaks and narrowly misses the trailer’s rear end.

           He sees the DRIVER leap out of the truck and run off. BLUE 
           COP LIGHTS approach from down the road. 

                                 LUKE
                        Oh fuck.

           Luke starts the car and takes off over the GRASS MEDIAN STRIP 
           into the North bound lane. Two CRUISERS dart off after him. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CALLEARY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The PHONE RINGS. John drags himself up from the table. 

                                 JOHN
                        Hello?

           There’s a long pause. Bobby looks over at John. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        ...well, I’m sure he’s all right, 
                        Aunty...it’s probably...

           John’s face slowly WILTS. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Well, do you want us to come over 
                        then?...okay...well calm down. I’m 
                        sure he’s fine...yeah, I’m sure 
                        it’s just...No, Aunty don’t...I’ll 
                        go look for him right now...no, 
                        don’t Joanie please...

           DIAL TONE. John slams the phone down, ripping it out of the 
           wall. He collapses back down into his seat. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Luke never came home. No one knows 
                        where he is now. 

           John puts his head in his hands. Everything’s closing in. 
           It’s too much. 
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck today? Where the fuck 
                        could he be?

           Bobby sighs. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well, you know, he’s been at it 
                        with Rocco and Mull again, right?

           John stares at him. Really? Bobby nods.

           John BANGS his fist off the table so hard Bobby nearly jumps 
           out of his seat. John lets out a low audible GROAN, as if 
           holding back tears, and peals himself away from the table. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                             (Carefully)
                        You all right?

           John rips the VODKA off the floor and walks down the BASEMENT 
           stairs. 

                                 JOHN
                        You can’t trust no one. 

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - LATER

           John’s sitting on the edge of his bed, giving the wall a 
           thousand-yard stare. He’s holding his father’s old BADGE 
           between his hands. The vodka’s between his feet. 

           Bobby softly walks down the steps, as if not wanting to 
           intrude, or as if he’s just not sure what he’ll find. He’s 
           carrying the ROLL OF PAPER Jackie took out of City Hall.

                                 JOHN
                             (Without looking at him)
                        You know, I don’t think I wanted 
                        much, Bobby. But they still found a 
                        way to take it from me.

           He looks over the words, “BOSTON POLICE” on the badge. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Hell, all this city’s ever done is 
                        take from people like us. 

           Bobby unrolls the paper at John’s feet. It’s a map of Boston. 
           John looks up at him. The fuck is that?
           Bobby motions towards the HEADER: ST. PATRICK’S DAY PARADE 
           ROUTE. A BOLD RED LINE runs from the Broadway Overpass 
           through the bottom half of South Boston. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a city holiday. No one’s gonna 
                        be driving into town anyway, but by 
                        the time the parade lets go ‘round 
                        Broadway? Northern part of the 
                        neighborhood’ll be deserted. 

           John looks closer at the map: a BLACK ARROW labelled “JACKIE” 
           winds its way from the Southie Docks through the channel, 
           stopping at each one of the bridges.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Coolyan’s uncle lifted a bunch of 
                        Munnie cop uniforms, so we’ll all 
                        look legit closing off the 
                        roadways. Jimmy Mull and Rocco work 
                        the north side of the bridges. My 
                        guys the South. I run the plunger. 

           John turns to him: what the fuck are you talking about?

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to blow up the bridges 
                        on the Fort Point Channel. 

           John just stares at him blankly, as if the idea is so 
           ludicrous he can’t even feign a reaction.  

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, how ya gonna do that?

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Just like Holden in Kwai.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah? You - you’re gonna get in 
                        a boat and do that?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Fuck no. You know, I can’t swim. 

           John glances down at the map. It’s pulling on his attention.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        But one of us can. 

           John waves him off.
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, we’ve taken it on the chin 
                        long enough, brother. Let’s give 
                        them something to think about.

           John shakes his head. You’re fucking crazy. And turns back to 
           the wall. But he can’t stop staring at the map...studying it, 
           checking out all the angles. He might even be considering it. 
           The room goes SILENT. 

           Bobby turns back to the stairs, letting John to think about 
           it, and as he goes, hey slowly starts to hum the tune to the 
           Rolling Stones “Sympathy for the Devil.” 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                             (Singing)
                        Hope you guessed my name. But 
                        what’s confusing you, is just the 
                        nature of my game...ooo! Ooo!

           John looks up at him. The fuck are you doing? 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        ...just as every cop is a criminal, 
                        and all the sinners saints...

           Bobby looks back as he’s about to disappear into the kitchen, 
           a big GRIN on his face. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Just call me Lucipher, ‘cause I’m 
                        in need of some restraint. OO! OO!

           John looks down at the badge in his hands. He sees a small, a 
           strange reflection of himself in the SEAL OF BOSTON.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           “Sympathy for the Devil” starts to play in earnest. 

           INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY COURT HOUSE - DAY

           John waits on the docket in an old cardigan and khakis next 
           to SGT. MCCAFERTY in his full dress uniform. 

                                 JUDGE (O.S.)
                        Calleary, John Joseph. 

           They both rise to the bench. 
           INT. MA’S ROOM - DAY

           Jackie walks in and sits on the edge of the bed, trying not 
           to disturb the crisp fold of the sheets. He stares at his 
           parents sanctuary, the photos on the wall, taking it all in. 

           EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY COURT HOUSE - LATER

           John and the Sergeant walk down the front steps. John looks 
           forelorn, like the other shoe just dropped. 

                                 SERGEANT MCCAFERTY 
                        Sorry, kid. Tough shit right there. 

           He puts a light hand on John’s shoulders and walks away. No 
           helping him now. John lights a cigarette and walks down the 
           long stair case and out into GOVERNMENT CENTER. 

           EXT. COME-HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           The neighborhood’s quiet - save for the Stones echoing from 
           inside the pub. It’s SNOWING and the flakes look fat coming 
           down in the light outside the bar. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: MARCH 16th, 1975. 

           INT. COME-HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby, Bootch and Coolyan drink at the bar, waiting. 
           “Sympathy for the Devil” is playing on the JUKEBOX. 

                                 BOOTCH
                        Think he’ll come?

           Bobby shrugs. Who knows?

           INT. CONTINENTAL/EXT. COMEHAIL PUB - CONTINUOUS

           John watches the bar from the front seat of his car. He’s 
           shivering. 

           A COP CAR suddenly flies by - LIGHTS on, SIRENS roaring. John 
           watches it go, an ambiguous look on his face.

           He turns up the heater against the cold.

           INT. COME-HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - LATER

           Bobby throws back another shot. A DOOR OPENS. He turns...
           Jackie walks in from the BACK. He looks uncomfortable, turned 
           in - as if he isn’t sure about what he’s doing. He locks eyes 
           with Bobby. He nods. He’s in.

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           Bobby throws a piece of RUG over a BARBED WIRE FENCE. He 
           motions for Jackie to go over, and hold his hands out for a 
           five finger boost. But as Jackie steps up...

           A CAR DOOR SLAMS behind them. They both turn towards the 
           parking lot across the street. Nothing. 

           Jackie goes over the fence. 

           LATER

           Jackie drops over onto the other, side followed quickly by 
           Bobby. They wipe themselves off, and turn towards the docks 
           when...

           JOHN steps out of the darkness. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh holy shit.

           Jackie takes off, but John grabs him by the collar and throws 
           him into the fence. He holds him there by the throat and 
           climbs right up into Bobby’s face. The three of them exchange 
           looks, the two younger ones terrified. A pregnant silence. 

                                 JOHN
                        One thing: I go through with this--
                             (He points to Bobby)
                        You, Shit for Brains, don’t go near 
                        anything that goes, “boom.” ‘kay?

           Bobby holds up his hands. You got it. John takes a deep 
           breath. Nods. He’s in. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        All right. The fuck are we standing 
                        around for then?

           LATER

           The Callearys walk behind the FOREMAN’S TRAILER and towards a 
           pile covered in thick canvas tarp. 

                                 BOBBY
                        ...Jackie’ll meet me at the Summer 
                        Street bridge. We’ll come to you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                             (Off John’s nod)
                        That sound all right?

           John looks Bobby over. He’s just a fucking kid, how could he 
           plan all this out? Jackie rips up the tarp. 

           There’s TWO ROWBOATS. 

                                 JOHN
                        What’s with the two of them? 
                        Thought you weren’t going in?

                                 BOBBY
                             (Shrugging)
                        Figured you might come around. 

           Try as he might, John cracks a grin. 

           CLOSE ON: A BACKPACK full of dynamite. 

           John tosses a flap over it, clamps it shut. A PIN on the flap 
           reads “Champions of the People” over a picture of John and 
           Bobby Kennedy. 

           John throws the bag onto his shoulder and walks towards a 
           launch, where Bobby’s lowering Jackie into one of the boats. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You wanna keep dry out there, all 
                        right? It’s too fucking cold 
                        tonight. 

           He tosses Jackie the other BACKPACK. Jackie catches it, 
           HORRIFIED. Bobby doesn’t get why.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        OH shit! Right. The dynamite.

           John sighs. Jesus. He drops himself into the other boat. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        All right, so we’ll all meet at the 
                        Beaver no later than 2. You good?

           John tosses his keys at Bobby. Bobby goes. 

           John turns and considers the harbor. It’s dark and calm. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You really gonna do this?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. You sure you wanna go through 
                        with it?
           Jackie takes a breath. His teeth are chattering already. 

                                 JACKIE
                             (Nodding)
                        But why? Why do you want to do it? 

           John thinks of how to put it best. Sighs. 

                                 JOHN
                             (In his best Kennedy 
                              Accent)
                        “Because it is there.” 

           Jackie stares at him like he’s waiting for John to drop a 
           punch line. He doesn’t. He just sits down and grabs his oars.

           EXT. MOUTH OF THE CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

           A HARBOR MASTER BOAT passes under the Northern Ave. Bridge, 
           headed for the harbor. 

           As it’s engines echo into the open water, the SOUND of oars 
           SLAPPING can be heard, and John and Jackie row their boats in 
           tandem out from the shadows of the channel’s high walls. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET - LATER

           The Continental pulls over in view of the BRIDGE. 

           INT. CONTINENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby turns off the car, his breath STEAMING as the engine 
           ticks down. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           ...John rows over to the center PYLONS of the Northern Ave. 
           Bridge...

           ...Jackie floats under the Seaport Blvd. Bridge. The H.M.S. 
           BEAVER and Congress Street lay in front of him... 

           ...John rigs the end of a WIRE into BUNDLE of DYNAMITE....

           ...Jackie secures a BUNDLE of dynamite to a PYLON...

           ...John runs his WIRE from a bundle on one pylon to the 
           bundle on another...

           ...Bobby gets out of the car and walks towards the bridge. 
           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - LATER

           Jackie pulls the boat up under the bridge, close to the wall. 
           He’s shivering, his teeth chattering. 

           Bobby walks out from under the bridge, waves to him. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m fuckin’ freezin, Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Shut the fuck up. They can hear you 
                        all the way in Dorchester.

           Jackie rows towards Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        The fuck are you doing? You still 
                        got the second bridge. 

           Jackie hands him the backpack. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Just take it. 

           Bobby, frustrated, takes the backpack. Jackie sits back down 
           in the boat, cradling the last TWO BUNDLES of dynamite. He 
           grabs his oars when...

           FOOTSTEPS echo above them. They both freeze. 

           Bobby slowly climbs out from under the bridge and peaks onto 
           the roadway. He drops right back down, HORROR-STRUCK. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s a fucking cop. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Holy fuck. 

           Jackie stands up in the boat and hands him the dynamite. 

           EXT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           John climbs a ROPE LADDER up the side of the ship, as his 
           rowboat, CAPSIZED, sinks into the black water. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           A BEAT COP in a leather jacket walks across the bridge. 
           EXT. UNDER THE SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jackie’s standing on the exposed hull of his flipped over 
           rowboat, pumping his legs, trying to get it to sink. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Come on, come on.

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m fucking trying. 

           Jackie kicks the hull and accidentally knocks it into the 
           WALL with a loud, metallic THUD. Bobby looks terrified. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Beat Cop stops in his tracks. He pulls out a flashlight. 

           EXT. UNDER THE SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The boat finally goes under just as a FLASHLIGHT BEAM appears 
           on the water. 

           Bobby ducks into the shadows under the bridge. Jackie has to 
           slip into the drink.  

           The FLASHLIGHT catches the ripple from the sinking boat, and 
           lingers, as if the cop were studying it. The light suddenly 
           clicks off.

           Jackie comes up, gasping and shivering, painfully trying to 
           be quiet. He looks up at Bobby, who looks up at the bridge.

           The Cops footsteps ECHO as he crosses to the other side.

           Bobby shakes his head: not safe. Jackie winces, dives back 
           down again. The light appears on the other side - right where 
           Jackie went under.

                                 BOBBY
                             (To himself)
                        Oh Jesus Christ. 

           EXT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           John stands in the stern of the ship, squinting to see if he 
           can make out Jackie’s boat at the other end of the channel. 

           He looks down at his watch: 2.15 a.m. Pensive, nervous, he 
           starts whistling “The Way We Were.” 
           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Beat Cop, peering over the edge, shrugs. He turns off the 
           light and keeps on walking. 

           EXT. UNDER THE SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby listens as the steps move off. He watches the water, 
           intensely. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Jackie.
                             (No reply)
                        Jackie come on. 
                             (No reply)
                        Oh Christ, please...  

           Terrified, Bobby slowly starts to strip off his jacket. But 
           suddenly Jackie pops up, gasping, teeth chattering. He bobs 
           up and down in the current.

                                 JACKIE 
                        Help...Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Jackie, just swim over to me.  

                                 JACKIE 
                        Please help me, Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Jackie, come on, you know I can’t 
                        swim. Just swim over. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I can’t. 

           Bobby looks at the water. He swallows. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        All right then, I guess you’re 
                        going to die in there. 

                                 JACKIE
                        No. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        Yeah. You’re going to die in there. 
                        ‘Cause you can swim five feet, you 
                        fuckin faggot. 

           Jackie starts paddling over to the wall. Bobby smiles, 
           RELIEVED.
                                 BOBBY
                        That’s it, you pussy. Come on. 

           EXT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           John climbs over the side of the ship, and jumps down on the 
           MUSEUM DOCK. He freezes - FOOTSTEPS. 

           John looks up to the Congress St. Bridge. He sees the COP, 
           and he slowly climbs back onto the ship. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby pulls Jackie out of the channel, water rushing out of 
           his clothes, and lays him down under the bridge. His face is 
           blue and his teeth are chattering. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        I’m going to die here, Bobby.  

                                 BOBBY 
                        Oh you’re not going to die, you 
                        pussy. You’re just really cold. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        You can die from that. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Shut up. Help me get you up - 
                        you’ll feel better. 

           Bobby pulls Jackie to his feet, but Jackie collapses. Bobby 
           manages to catch him just before he hits the ground. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Ah, come on, kid, you’re all right. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Help me, Bobby...my fucking hands, 
                        they’re cold. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        You’re alright. 

           Bobby, not without difficulty, throws him over his shoulder, 
           and slowly carries him off. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - LATER

           John sneaks under the bridge. No sign of his brothers. Just 
           the wire to the first bridge hanging limply from a rafter.
           He looks up at the roadway. Do I go find out what happened, 
           or... He starts to climb up into the street when he spots 
           something scrawled on the side of the bridge. It’s a note 
           written in poor kid sidewalk chalk - a rock someone scraped 
           against the steel.  

           CLOSE ON: Everything’s fine. Stay with the Boat. Sincerely, 
           Shit for Brains.

           Conflicted, John backs away towards the Beaver.  

           EXT. FORT POINT CHANNEL - DAY 

           Bobby walks along the channel whistling “The Joker,” trailing 
           the WIRE from the Summer Street bridge. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        The 1975 St. Patrick’s Day parade 
                        is set to begin at the top of the 
                        hour, we’re coming at you live from 
                        South Boston...

           A COP walks towards him and Bobby takes a breath. But as the 
           cop gets closer, he realizes it’s just COOLYAN in one of his 
           uncle’s uniforms. Coolyan passes him with a wink and a grin.  

           INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - H.M.S. BEAVER - LATER

           John sits on the floor, wrapped in blankets, listening to the 
           news on a PORTABLE radio. The plunger’s between his knees.

           Suddenly, he hears FOOTSTEPS on the deck above him. He flips 
           off the radio calmly. 

           Bobby walks in. John jumps up, throws him against the wall. 

                                 JOHN
                        Where the FUCK were you?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Wow, wow, wow--

           John picks him of his feet by the collar. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        I had to take Jackie to the E.R. I 
                        couldn’t make it back--

           John slams him into the wall, harder.
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        -A cop came over the bridge. The 
                        Kid went into the drink. It was a 
                        fuckin disaster, John!

                                 JOHN
                        You couldn’t have told me? 

                                 BOBBY 
                        He was turning fuckin’ blue. It was 
                        one or the other. What would you 
                        have had me do? You woulda left...

           John stares him down. But Bobby doesn’t flinch. 

                                 JOHN
                        Is he all right now?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Well yeah, but he might lose some 
                        fingers. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, motherfuck...

           John puts his hand through the wall next to Bobby’s head. And 
           keeps on punching. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        John--

           John picks up chair and starts smashing the furniture. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        JOHN--

                                 JOHN
                        -No, fuck you. Fuck this goddamn 
                        boat. Fuck this whole mess. How did 
                        I even get into this shit? You know 
                        what? Fuck this. You wanna blow the 
                        bridges on the Fort Point Channel? 
                        Do it yourself. I’m fuckin out. 

           John turns to leave. Bobby grabs him. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Look, we’ve come this far, you can 
                        hold your temper for five fucking 
                        minutes. 

                                 JOHN
                        Get ya hands off me. 
                                 BOBBY 
                        How do you think I felt? Huh? I 
                        couldn’t even go in after him, 
                        John. But it happened. Don’t fuck 
                        this up now. 

           Bobby shoves his watch in John’s face. It’s 12.53.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Just give me until 1 o’clock. 
                        That’s all I’m asking. 7 minutes. 
                        Just don’t do nothing until then. 

           John knocks Bobby’s hand off him and charges off the boat. 

           EXT. CHANNEL - LATER

           John storms away from the Beaver, and as he walks, he surveys 
           the channel. No cars. No people. Even the water is still. 
           There’s no one, literally nothing there to stop them. 

           Then, a small RUMBLING in the distance...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The parade’s PIPE AND DRUM CORPS can be seen warming up on a 
           small, black-and-white TV hanging on the hospital wall. 

           Across the room, Jackie’s asleep, his hands wrapped in 
           pristine bandages. 

           EXT. COME-HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - DAY

           Luke walks towards the bar, his chin tucked into his chest 
           and his collar popped to hide his face. He’s got a three-day 
           old beard and bags under his eyes. He stops at the front 
           door, looks over his shoulder and walks in. 

           INT. COME-HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The bar’s three people deep, and every booth, stool, and 
           piece of wall is occupied with someone wearing green.   

           Luke shoves his way to the bar. Finn, ringing on the cash 
           register, sees him and nods towards a BACK TABLE.

           Luke looks over, sees three MEN IN SUITS sitting there, EYE-
           FUCKING him hard: the FEDS. He turns back to Finn. 
                                 FINN
                             (Inaudible)
                        Back door. Go. 

           Luke turns to the rear door only to see two more SUITS now 
           flanking it. His shoulders sag. He looks back at Finn. 

                                 FINN (CONT’D)
                             (Inaudible)
                        I’m sorry, bro.  

           Luke, trapped, wearily drags himself over to the Feds.

           A WAITRESS turns up the DIAL on the TV above the bar. 

                                 TV ANNOUNCER
                        ...the parade is all set to begin 
                        here in South Boston...

           The bar CHEERS. 

           EXT. SEAPORT BLVD BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jimmy checks his watch. He pulls out a roll of POLICE TAPE 
           and tosses it across the bridge. Rocco catches it and secures 
           it on that side. 

           They each drag a pair of WOODEN HORSES onto the roadway. 

           EXT. CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

           COOLYAN, his UNCLE and FIVE other UNIFORMS start sealing off 
           the Southern side of the bridges. 

           INT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby checks the WIRES going into the plunger. He uses a JACK 
           KNIFE to tighten the BOLTS holding them down. 

           EXT. CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

           John walks down Summer Street, the bridges behind him. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - All the roadways are blocked off. 

           - The streets and sidewalks around the bridges: empty. 
           - All the explosives are in place, tied onto the bridges 
           right above water line. The fuses are connected. Everything 
           is in its place, except...

           - There’s nothing wired to the second Summer St. Bridge. It’s 
           bare, not wired at all. It’s the one bridge Jackie didn’t get 
           to.

           EXT. CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Walking away from the boat and down the channel, John checks 
           his watch again: 2 minutes. He tosses a look back at the 
           Beaver. Bobby might actually get away with this. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Pipes and Drums have started MARCHING on the TV. 

           EXT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby checks his watch. Minute-and-a-half to go.  

           EXT. SUMMER STREET - SOUTHIE - CONTINUOUS

           Bootch, Coolyan and his Uncle cut off their pants with 
           SWITCHBLADES, and shove them into a waiting TRASH BARREL. 
           Coolyan douses the barrel with butane and tosses in a match. 
           They run off as the FLAMES erupt behind them. 

           EXT. ROWES WHARF - CONTINUOUS

           Rocco and Mullins - followed by THREE of their GUYS - walk 
           towards two idling LINCOLNS. They’re all out of costume. 

           At the lead car, Rocco points his crew to the second car. 
           Take that one. 

                                 ROCCO
                        We’ll see you all in a few days. 

           They nod. Rocco and Mullins climb into the lead Lincoln. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET - CONTINUOUS

           John takes one last look around the channel. The bridges. The 
           water. The Beaver. The City beyond all of that. One way or 
           the other, it’s all about to be a lot different. 
           He checks his watch - 1 minute to go. He pops the collar on 
           his jacket, turns his back to the bridges, and walks off. 

           EXT. STREETS OF SOUTHIE - CONTINUOUS

           Coolyan, his Uncle and Bootch sprint down an alley, turn off 
           into a side street, and run smack into a CROWD fifteen deep. 
           They’re SHOCKED. Nobody was supposed to be here. 

           Coolyan walks up to a guy in a red PAT the PATRIOT’S HAT. 

                                 COOLYAN
                        What’s this all about, pal?

                                 GUY IN HAT
                        Didnya hear? They moved the parade 
                        route. Some last minute horeshit. 

           Coolyan and his Uncle are HORRIFIED. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           John walks down the middle of the street, staring at his 
           shoes. But he STOPS, suddenly, as if someone were yelling his 
           name. Only he can’t make it out - he can just barely hear 
           something on the wind...

           BAGPIPES. And they’re getting closer. 

           He slowly turns and finds the entire ST. PATRICK’S DAY PARADE 
           marching towards him and the Summer Street bridge. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh Holy Christ.

           John SPRINTS towards the Beaver.

           INT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           From the back seat of the car, Mullins and Rocco look up at 
           the CUSTOMS HOUSE CLOCK TOWER. The big hands strikes 1. 

           They exchange a look. Here we go.

           INT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby looks down at his watch. 1 p.m. He gives himself the 
           SIGN OF THE CROSS, and grips the plunger. 
                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        God - I’m assumin ya gonna 
                        understand this.

           EXT. CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

           John runs along the channel and hurdles the gate at the Tea 
           Party Museum. 

           EXT. SUMMER STREET - SOUTHIE - CONTINUOUS

           The PARADE marches at a steady pace towards the bridge. 

           INT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby, holding the plunger, takes a deep breath, readies 
           himself. He sighs. And as he’s leans down--

           -FOOTSTEPS crash down on the deck above. He flinches. 

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        BOBBY! BOBBY! BOBBY!

           John appears in the doorway. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        What?

           John goes quiet, gestures out the door. The faint WHINE of 
           the PIPES echoes in the cabin. Bobby’s eyes shoot open. 

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        Which bridge are they on, John? 
                        Jackie didn’t wire the last bridge. 

                                 JOHN
                        What?

                                 BOBBY 
                        WHAT FUCKING BRIDGE ARE THEY--

           John smacks the plunger away from Bobby, but Bobby quickly 
           scrambles for it. John jumps on top of him, but Bobby still 
           reaches for it with his fingertips. It’s only inches away. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Please, John! If they’re on that 
                        bridge, John If there’s ANY chance 
                        they’re on that bridge just let me 
                        do it - they won’t get hurt. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Just let fuckin me do it! I worked 
                        too hard!

                                 JOHN
                        Bobby, it’s too fuckin late.

           The echo of the PIPES and the DRUMS rattles the ship. Bobby 
           hears it and bangs his head off the deck, repeatedly. It’s 
           over. He blew it. He rips the wires out of the PLUNGER. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Let’s get the fuck out of here. 

           EXT. H.M.S. BEAVER - CONTINUOUS

           John and Bobby dump the plunger into the water and take off. 

           EXT. TOBIN BRIDGE - DAY

           The Two Lincolns pass over the bridge - the Bunker Hill 
           monument coming up on their lefts. 

           INT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - CONTINUOUS

           Rocco and Mullins each stare out a separate window, 
           TERRIFIED.  The radio’s on. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...the parade is now making its way 
                        over the Summer Street Bridge, a 
                        minor detour from the day’s 
                        original plan...

           EXT. CHANNEL - CONTINUOUS

           John and Bobby walk away from the channel, back into Southie,  
           as the PARADE passes over the bridge behind them. 

           EXT. PARADE ROUTE - SOUTHIE - CONTINUOUS

           As the parade marches by, Coolyan, his Uncle and Bootch are 
           the only miserable faces in a massive crowd of smiling Irish. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jackie watches the TV, frowning as if he were about to cry. 
           He looks down at his hands.  
                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        One fucking Pyrrhic victory. 

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - LATER

           John shields his face from the outside glass and holds a hand 
           over his ear - the echo of CHEERS and DRUMS can still be 
           heard in the distance.

                                 JOHN 
                        ...anyone heard from my uncle?

                                 ROCCO (O.S.)
                        It’s not looking good John. He’s 
                        the one picked up the detonators. 
                        All of a sudden he goes missing? 
                        Then the thing with the parade? 
                        Fuckin Mull’s besides himself...

                                 JOHN
                        How could it have been him? Did you 
                        tell him? Bobby said he was just 
                        supposed to think he was buying 
                        detonators...

                                 ROCCO (O.S.)
                        Either way, you think one of us 
                        would’ve seen the fuckin news this 
                        morning. How’d--

           John slams down the phone. As he climbs out of the booth, 
           Bobby’s waiting to hear the news. John just shakes his head, 
           and they both walk down the street to the COMEHAIL. 

           INT. COME-HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - DUSK

           John and Bobby sit at the near empty bar, and stare blank-
           eyed at the TV above the top-shelf booze. 

           The EVENING NEWS is showing clips of the PARADE going over 
           the BRIDGE. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        You think they knew?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. They knew. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        But how? How could they’ve known?

           John shrugs. He doesn’t want to mention Luke. 
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        So what do we do now?

                                 JOHN
                             (Shocked)
                        Whattya mean what do we do now?

                                 BOBBY 
                        You know, instead. About this. How 
                        do we find out who ratted?

           John stares at him. Unbelievable.  

                                 JOHN
                        Bobby, you just spent six months of 
                        your life trying to blow up the 
                        bridges on the Fort Point Channel. 
                        We’re not even old enough to be 
                        drafted yet. Our mother’s in the 
                        psyche ward and our brother’s laid 
                        up in Carney with hypothermia... 
                        ‘cause of us. What the fuck can you 
                        do? It’s done. You blew your load. 
                        Now it’s runnin down the tile in 
                        the bathtub. It’s over. And I was 
                        foolish enough to let you do it. 

           Bobby plants his elbows on the bar and, heartbroken, puts his 
           face in his hands. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        I just hope they don’t take his 
                        fingers, John. He’ll get some 
                        fuckin’ stupid nickname - he’ll be 
                        a Southie character for life.

           John slowly closes his eyes, wincing. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a fine fuckin job we did. 
                             (Read:...as brothers.)

           The two brothers sit there quietly. The bar goes silent. 

                                 TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...St. Patrick’s Day parade was a 
                        success in South Boston this 
                        afternoon, despite the constant and 
                        heated reminders of the city’s on-
                        going busing crisis...

           John glances up at the T.V. A small skirmish erupts in the 
           middle of the parade replay: an Irish TEEN raises a fist to a 
           PRIEST before someone steps in and hauls the Teen away. 
           As if it’s all of sudden too much to bear, John slides off 
           his stool and trudges towards the back door. 

           Bobby watches from the bar as John walks out without a word.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - WESTERN MASS. - SUMMER - NIGHT

           Rocco and Mullins walk across an empty lot towards an idling 
           18 WHEELER. Their ITALIAN friend walks between them. 

           SUPERIMPOSE: SUMMER.

                                 ITALIAN
                        Ya ever find out what happened with 
                        ya little demonstration there? Ya 
                        think someone turned rat?

                                 ROCCO
                        What do you think? They re-routed 
                        the entire fucking parade for the 
                        hell of it?

                                 ITALIAN
                        You gotta appreciate the irony 
                        there though. They got your guy 
                        Patty there and instead of leading 
                        all the snakes outta Ireland, he’s 
                        leading all the niggers right back 
                        into South Boston.

           Jimmy Mullins has to smile, as if to say “you’re not wrong.”

                                 ROCCO
                        They’ll learn though. Ten years 
                        from now this city’ll be an 
                        unrecognizable fuckin dump. 

                                 ITALIAN
                        Oh yeah? You want that? Cut off 
                        your nose despite ya...

                                 ROCCO
                        The fuck else can you do? Fuck ‘em. 
                        Fuck ‘em all.

           As they reach the truck, Rocco keeps walking.

                                 ITALIAN
                        Where you going?

           Rocco thumbs towards a CORVETTE. 
                                 ROCCO
                        Riding point. 

                                 ITALIAN
                        Oh ya, who you got in the shotgun?

                                 JIMMY MULLINS
                        Ya buddy there.
                             (to Truck)
                        Yo, Three Fingers. 

           Jackie sticks his head out the passenger window and waves. 
           His right hand is mangled - it’s only got three fingers. 

                                 ITALIAN
                             (Recognizing Jackie)
                        Ho, there he is! I like that kid. 
                        He’s a funny fucking kid that one. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DISCO - NIGHT

           Strobe lights and the disco version of “Oh What a Night” seep 
           in to the john as a MAN IN A WHITE SUIT (25) walks in, and 
           passes Bobby ripping a fast-line off the rim of a sink. 

                                 COOLYAN
                        I hear they’re gonna start busin C-
                        Town next fall. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Fuck Charlestown. 

           Coolyan does a line, passes the straw to Bootch.  

                                 BOOTCH
                        You gonna go back in September?

           Bootch does a short line and rubs his nose. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Yeah probably, I got one more year. 
                        I’ll stick it out. 

           Bobby rips a huge line, coughs, and leans against a stall 
           rubbing his nose. He looks like shit - blood shot eyes, sweat-
           drenched skin. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, one more year. That’s it. 
                        Just one more year... 
           INT. RECRUITER’S OFFICER - DAY

           John sits across a large, oak desk from a Marine Corps 
           RECRUITER, who’s hunched over a form, pen poised. 

                                 RECRUITER
                        ...you ever been convicted of a 
                        felony?

           John shakes his head. The Recruiter stares at him, 
           suspicious, but John just stares back. The Recruiter smiles 
           and turns back to the form.

                        Good. Me neither. 

           INT. JOHN’S ROOM - CALLEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

           John lays out on his bed, his arms behind his head, staring 
           up at the ceiling. The room’s bare - cleaned out. 

           The RADIO on his night stand broadcasts the SOX GAME. 

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        ...and Lynn steps into bat...

           Jackie comes down the stairs and stops at John’s doorway. 
           John doesn’t even look up. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                        Heard you joined the Corps.
                             (John nods)
                        When d’you go in?

                                 JOHN
                        Day after I graduate. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        They got good benefits with that?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah.

                                 JACKIE 
                        You know, Ma’s upset about it. She 
                        won’t say nothing. But she is. 

           John shrugs.

                                  JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        You seen Bobby around at all?
                                 JOHN
                        Don’t see him a lot anymore. 

           Jackie nods, aimlessly. He’s about run out of conversation. 

                                 JACKIE 
                        Well, alright...I’ll let you alone 
                        then.

           He turns to go. 

                                 JOHN
                        How’re Mull and Rocco treatin’ ya?

                                 JACKIE 
                        They treat me good. Not a lot of 
                        jobs you can get with a half-a-
                        hand, you know?

                                 JOHN
                        You tell me if they don’t. 

           Jackie rolls his eyes. Yeah-sure. John’s done a great job of 
           protecting him in the past. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You gonna go back to school in the 
                        fall?

                                 JACKIE 
                             (Shrugging)
                        Don’t know. Maybe. We’ll see. 

           Jackie doesn’t want to talk this time. He turns again and 
           gets halfway up the stairs before he stops. He’s spotted the 
           Polaroid of John and Quinn on a dusty shelf. 

                                 JACKIE CALLEARY
                             (Over his shoulder)
                        You know, I can’t help but think, 
                        with all this shit going on...Dad 
                        would be pretty fucking pissed. 

           John stares at him. He knows Jackie’s right but he doesn’t 
           want to acknowledge it. He just turns away. 

           Jackie slips the picture into his pocket and walks out. 

           INT. COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           John nurses a beer, watching the SOX GAME. He sips his drink 
           and puts it down on a LEATHER FOLDER already scarred with 
           condensation rings.
           The folder reads: SOUTH BOSTON HIGH SCHOOL, CLASS OF ‘75.

           The bathroom door gets kicked open and Bobby walks out. He 
           looks skinnier, paler. He wipes his nose with the palm of his 
           hand. He’s surprised to see John at the bar. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        How long you been here?

                                 JOHN
                        A while. 

           Bobby shrugs, knowing that John must know what he was doing. 
           Either way, he sits down next to him at the bar. They both 
           turn to the game. 

                                 FINN
                        What can I get ya, Bobby?

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        Whatever he’s having. Bring him 
                        another one, too. 

           Finn pours two beers, and Bobby rips a few bills off a large 
           WAD OF CASH. Finn places the drinks down and moves on. 

                                 JOHN
                        Where’d you get that?

                                 BOBBY CALLEARY
                        Work. 

           John gives him a look. Bobby spots the DIPLOMA.  

                                 BOBBY
                        You graduate today?

           John half-smiles.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you say nothing?

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t worry about it. 

           Bobby shakes his head. They both turn back to the game. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You doin’ alright?

                                 BOBBY 
                        Me? Yeah. I’m fine. 
           Bobby drinks. The inning comes to an end and the Sox walk off 
           the field. Finn comes by, pours two more beers. Bobby seems 
           lost in thought.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        We came awful fucking close, John. 
                        Didn’t we?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. You did. 

           Bobby snorts out an empty laugh. Finn puts the beers down. 

                                 FINN
                        It’s probably cold comfort, but at 
                        least you got that story to tell 
                        for the rest of your lives: you’re 
                        the brothers who almost blew up the 
                        bridges on the Fort Point Channel.

           He sets up three SHOT GLASSES on the bar and fills them with 
           JACK DANIELS.

                                 BOBBY 
                        Yup. Almost. 

           Finn raises his glass. 

                                 FINN
                        Well, to that then: almosts. 

           They all drink. Bobby slams his glass down, shaking his head.

                                 BOBBY 
                        He had to fuckin’ rat us out. 

           John frowns. He knows Bobby’s never going to let this go. 

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Luke throws on his jacket standing by the door, sticks his 
           keys in his pocket. 

                                 JOANIE (O.S.)
                        Where you goin?

           Joanie and Ma - lookin’ clean and heavier - play with the 
           Baby on the living room carpet. The Sox game is on the big 
           FLOOR CONSOLE behind them. 

                                 LUKE
                        Out. 
                                 JOANIE
                        Where?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m just going to get a drink. 

                                 MA
                        With that rotten son of mine?

           Luke rolls his eyes, tired of hearing about it. 

                                 LUKE
                        You know he graduated the other 
                        day, right?
                             (She shrugs)
                        I don’t know why you’re still mad 
                        at him, you look great. 

                                 MA
                        Who turns in their own mother to a 
                        State mental ward? He’s a rat. I 
                        raised a fuckin rat. 

                                 LUKE
                        Well, I don’t know what to tell ya, 
                        hon.  He’s not my son. Be mad the 
                        rest of your life then if you want.

           She gives him a dead stare. There’s a pregnant silence. The 
           game echoes in the background. 

                                 TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        ...Rice, Lynn, Fisk - the youth the 
                        Red Sox have cultivated these last 
                        few years - have made all the 
                        difference with this team...

           Luke just walks out.  

           INT. COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           Luke and John drink at the bar. There’s a noticeable distance 
           between them now.

                                 LUKE
                        So when do you leave?

                                 JOHN
                        Tomorrow. 

                                 LUKE
                        Sucks. 
           Luke turns back to the game on the TV. That distance is hard 
           to make up. Finn pours him a shot of JACK DANIELS. 

                                 JOHN
                             (Pressing for 
                              conversation)
                        You gonna be alright with that? Not 
                        gonna flashback on me again are ya?

                                 LUKE
                        Don’t worry about me, all right? 
                        Worry about yourself. 

           He turns to John to make his point, and sees he’s upset about 
           the way they’re talking to each other. Luke relents.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You want one?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll take one, yeah. 

           Finn pours John a Jack. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        So how’s work going? 

                                 LUKE
                             (Shrugging)
                        Steady. 

                                 JOHN
                        It was nice of Mull and Rocco to 
                        give Jackie that job. 

                                 LUKE
                        Glad you’re happy about it. I’m 
                        not. That kid...fuckin’ shame. 

           John turns back to the game, knocking back his drink. 
           Jackie’s probably not the best subject to bring up. 

           The inning comes to an end. The TV goes to commercial. 

                                 JOHN
                        So you, uh...wanna tell me about 
                        the FBI?

                                 LUKE
                             (Defensive)
                        Why? You think I was the rat?

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t say that. 
                                 LUKE
                        Why’d it take you so long to ask?
                             (John shrugs)
                        How would I have dimed? I didn’t 
                        know anything. Mull never told me 
                        who the detonators were for. Kept 
                        me in the dark like Bobby told him 
                        to. 
                             (Read:...and you let him.)

           John stares into the bottom of his glass.

                                 JOHN
                        You know why he didn’t tell ya. 

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, I’ve heard. 

           Luke pulls out his money. He’s ready to go. John grabs the 
           cash out of his hand. 

                                 JOHN
                        Look, I just want to know if maybe 
                        they gave you something about who 
                        told. I don’t want to get through 
                        Paris Island just to get pulled 
                        back here on arraignment, you know? 

           Luke sighs. He doesn’t want to go into it. 

                                 LUKE
                        They just asked me if I’d heard 
                        something about Fort Point. I said 
                        no. They left me in a room by 
                        myself until the bridges stayed up. 
                        Then they let me go. That was it.

           John hands him back his money. Thank you. Luke throws back 
           his drink. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        But Tommy Halloran? Guy I went to 
                        school with down Archies. He’s 
                        worked for the Feds since we got 
                        back from Vietnam. I gave him a 
                        call a few weeks ago - just wanted 
                        to know, you know? Where it came 
                        from. How they got my name. He told 
                        me a couple of soldiers down Camp 
                        Edwards got nervous, started 
                        talking about how they sold some 
                        old detonators to guys from 
                        Southie.

                        Well, the Feds pulled me in ‘cause 
                        of some separate hijacking thing, 
                        but neither the Staties nor the 
                        Army could identify anyone for 
                        either case. So what happened was 
                        the Feds took the Army’s 
                        confession, combined it with that 
                        rumor from December, and got lucky. 
                        That’s it. 

           John snorts, shakes his head. Unbelievable. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        But it’s such a government 
                        clusterfuck - Army selling 
                        explosives to race agitators - they 
                        can’t prosecute without making 
                        themselves look bad. So ya’ll be 
                        fine. Don’t worry about it.

           Luke drains his beer and stares into the bottom of it. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I just can’t believe you didn’t 
                        tell me what you were doin.  

                                 JOHN
                        We were thinking about the kid. 

           Luke shakes his head, sighs. 

                                 LUKE
                        This fucking family. 

           He waves Finn over for another round. 

           EXT. COME HAIL PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT

           Luke and John walk out, and as the door shuts behind them the 
           light above it turns off. They’ve closed the place. 

           Swaying, John sticks out his hand. Luke looks him over - his 
           nephew with the Corps haircut and the drunk grin - as if he 
           wished he had something more to say. But he doesn’t. He just 
           smiles sadly and slaps John gently on the cheek.

                                 LUKE
                        Take care, all right? Keep your 
                        head down. 

           John, too drunk to speak, stares at Luke wanting more. But 
           Luke just grabs his hand and gives it a good shake. 
           Luke turns and walks away. John smirks. That’s just as good a 
           goodbye as he’s going to get around here. 

           EXT. STREETS OF SOUTHIE - NIGHT

           John walks down a dark and empty sidewalk littered with 
           garbage. He kicks a can into the street. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - He passes by Carson Beach, where they had that riot the 
           summer before. 

           - He passes bordered up store fronts and brick walls with 
           graffiti tattooed all over ‘em: “Don’t Tread on Me;” “Fuck 
           Niggers,” “Wallace ‘76.” 

           - He passes the docks where he used to work. 

           - He walks by the Stivetti’s elementary school. 

           - He passes South Boston High. All the places he’s come in 
           and out of in the last year since busing. 

           EXT. CHANNEL - NIGHT

           John, leaning on a railing, looks out over the four BRIDGES, 
           the water, the Beaver, and BOSTON beyond that. He takes it 
           all in, as if it’s the last time he’s going to see any of it. 

           When he’s done, he pushes himself off the railing, and walks 
           away, hands in his pockets. He’s leaving. As he goes he 
           quietly starts whistling the tune to “The Joker.”

                                 JOHN
                        ...You’re the cutest thing I ever 
                        did see, really love your...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
