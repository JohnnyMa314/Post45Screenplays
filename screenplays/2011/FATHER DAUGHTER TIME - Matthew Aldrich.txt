           EXT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           TITLE: SACRAMENTO, CA.  A strip mall, all the stores dark 
           except the all-night convenience store.  A faded ‘77 Malibu 
           drives up and parks in front.

           INT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           The alarm above the door beeps.  THEO WATERS (38) enters with 
           his daughter MAGGIE (11) following closely.

           Theo is a handsome guy -- seen better days, though.  He could 
           use a haircut.  He heads down the first aisle, a bit lost.

           Cold relief, pain relief, allergy relief, feminine hygiene --  
           they stop.  Theo takes in the selection: Discreet applicator; 
           unscented; fresh scent; wings; thin; ultra thin; super thin.

           He checks with Maggie.  She’s a typical pre-teen, caught 
           between adorable and whatever comes after adorable.  She 
           shrugs, just as lost as he.

           Theo looks back at the boxes.  Double Protection.  Extra 
           Protection.  Maximum Protection.

           He grabs Maximum Protection.

           Theo heads to the counter, box in hand.  Maggie skulks behind 
           him, letting her hair hide her face.

           GARY, the night clerk, puts down his nudie magazine and steps 
           up to the register.  Theo puts the box of tampons down.

           Gary looks at the box, then at Maggie, putting two and two 
           together.  Theo notices a glint in Gary’s eye, and considers 
           decking him in the mouth.

                                 GARY
                        Eleven eighty-nine.

           Theo takes out his wallet.  He counts out all his cash: seven 
           bucks.  His head drops, he swears under his breath.

                                 THEO
                        Be right back.

           Theo goes back down the aisle to find a cheaper box.

           Maggie lingers a few feet back from the counter, feeling 
           Gary’s eyes wander over her.

           Theo returns a few moments later, empty-handed.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Do you guys sell just one or two?

                                 GARY
                        What you see is what we got.

           Gary sets the box behind him and helps the next CUSTOMER.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                             (to the other customer)
                        That everything?

           Gary rings him up.  Theo butts in, offering the seven bucks.

                                 THEO
                        Look -- Gary -- I’ll get you next 
                        time, I’m good for it.

           Gary deliberately ignores him as the customer pays.

           Theo stares Gary down for a few tense moments.  He grabs his 
           daughter and leaves before it goes ugly. 

           INT. THEO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Theo and Maggie come out of the store and get in the car.  
           Theo stares at the store, boiling.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I have some money at home.

           He turns his head away from his daughter, hiding the shame.  
           Maggie looks down, regretting opening her mouth.

           Theo takes a breath, then looks back at the store.

           TITLE: ARMED ROBBERY, FIRST COUNT

           Theo starts the engine, then gets out.

                                 THEO
                        Leave it running.

           Maggie turns to see her father open the trunk.  He rummages, 
           takes something out.  Theo slams the trunk down.

           She watches him march inside, one hand stuffed in his pocket.

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           BLACK
           INT. ALANO CLUB - A FEW DAYS EARLIER

           Dingy room, cracked floor tiles, missing ceiling tiles.  An 
           AA Meeting, about 20 people large.

                                 ALL
                             (reciting)
                        God, grant me the serenity to 
                        accept the things I cannot 
                        change...

           Theo sits alone, reciting the prayer under his breath.

                                 ALL (CONT’D)
                        The courage to change the things I 
                        can, and the wisdom to know the 
                        difference.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Bright place.  Hot, lousy coffee.  Corner booth: Theo sits 
           with ED (55), a grizzled guy in a Hawaiian shirt.  Ed picks 
           through his omelette.

                                 THEO
                        I can’t pay my bills, I can’t get a 
                        decent job with my record -- I 
                        can’t even see my kid without an 
                        armed escort.

                                 ED
                        You start your fourth step yet?

                                 THEO
                        I’ve been busy.

                                 ED
                        Oh yeah, I forgot, you got it going 
                        on.
                             (to himself, fuming)
                        Goddamn tomatoes, every time.
                             (calling)
                        Denise!  Tomatoes?  Really?

           DENISE the waitress pays Ed exactly zero mind.

                                 THEO
                        I got a call from an old buddy in 
                        Seattle.  He heard I got out, 
                        wanted to know if I needed work.

           Ed turns to him, knowing full well what “work” means.
                                 ED
                        It’s only been six months -- you 
                        already forgot what jail’s like?

                                 THEO
                        Easy.  I told him no.  I’m just 
                        saying sometimes I look around and 
                        think what’s the goddamn point?  
                        Going to meetings, scrubbing 
                        toilets, drinking shitty coffee 
                        with you?  Is this my life from now 
                        on?

                                 ED
                        Yeah, it is.  And?

           Theo shakes his head, dismissing the subject.

                                 ED (CONT’D)
                        You want your life to get better?  
                        Keep your nose clean, stay sober, 
                        show up for your kid, and do your 
                        fourth step.  Or call your buddy 
                        back, see if he has a better plan.  
                        Your choice.  Want my tomatoes?

           INT. PAROLE BOARD, WAITING AREA - DAY

           Theo sits against the wall, under the California state seal, 
           staring at the ceiling.  The drab room is peppered with an 
           assortment of miscreants.

                                 PA VOICE (O.S.)
                        Waters.  Waters.

           Theo gets up.

           INT. PAROLE BOARD, BATHROOM - DAY

           Theo stands at the toilet, pissing into a cup as his PAROLE 
           OFFICER witnesses with little interest.

           INT. JACK IN THE BOX, MENS ROOM - NIGHT

           Dressed in his uniform, Theo swabs the bathroom floor.  He 
           keeps his head down.  He does a good job of it.
           EXT. THEO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Theo walks down the corridor, food from work in one hand.  He 
           stops at unit 12 and knocks lightly.  Waits.  Knocks again.

                                 THEO
                        Hey, it’s me...  You there?

           Waits.  No answer.

           He sighs, then continues down to his apartment, unit 10.

           INT. THEO’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Theo sits at a folding table, eating Jack-in-the-Box.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DUCK POND - DAY

           Maggie reaches in the Wonder bag and pulls out a handful of 
           old crusts.  She tosses a few to the gathering ducks.  Theo 
           stands next to her, doing the same.

                                 THEO
                        You see that one?  He’s a bully.

           Maggie shrugs.  Her heart isn’t in it.  Theo pauses.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have to do this, you want 
                        to do something else?  It’s your 
                        day.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, this is cool...

           She takes out an oral thermometer and puts it under her 
           tongue.  Theo watches her, concerned.

                                 THEO
                        You feeling okay?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (thermometer in mouth)
                        Yeah.

           A few moments pass.  Maggie checks the temp, then puts it 
           away -- all without ceremony.  Theo doesn’t get it.

                                 THEO
                        What’s with that?
                                 MAGGIE
                        I like to know.

           She glances to the side.  A kindly, round court-appointed 
           SUPERVISOR stands about twenty feet away, watching them.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        When she dies, will the court send 
                        someone else?

                                 THEO
                        Mags...

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?  Chronic obesity leads to 
                        diabetes, heart disease,  
                        hypertension, gout, sleep apnea -- 
                        there was this guy in England, and 
                        when he died they tested his blood, 
                        and it was sweeter than chocolate.

                                 THEO
                        Where’d you learn all that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        WebMD.
                             (a touch of mischief)
                        Think we can outrun her?

                                 THEO
                        Don’t even think about it.

           Theo looks at the supervisor, gives a smile.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I know it stinks, but this is how 
                        things need to be for now.  Maybe 
                        one day, far away from here, things 
                        can be... normal.  But not now.

           Maggie sighs, gives up on the mischief.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t mean we can’t have fun, 
                        though.

           Maggie mopes.  Theo takes a few crumbs out of the bag and 
           throws them at her head.

           She turns, mouth open.  Theo baits her.  She throws her 
           handful of bread crumbs at him.

           Theo withdraws a baseball-sized wad of bread.  Maggie screams 
           out with laughter, and starts running.
           The ducks scramble over each other to pick up the remains of 
           the bread fight.

           INT. BERNADETTE’S CAR - SAME

           BERNADETTE (36) pulls up.  She’s a pretty woman, though her 
           nurses’ scrubs leave her looking shapeless and cranky.

           She watches Maggie and Theo play for a moment.  Then she lays 
           on the horn, two long blasts.

           EXT. DUCK POND - SAME

           Theo and Maggie, both flecked with white bread, turn.  The 
           joy in Maggie’s eyes vanishes upon seeing her mother.

                                 THEO
                        Guess that’s time.

           They start toward the car.  Theo gives his ex-wife a nod and 
           a bullshit smile.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Your mom still seeing that guy?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 THEO
                        How is he, you like him?

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s whatever.

                                 THEO
                        Hiya, Bernie, how’s it going?

           Bernadette rolls down the passenger window and leans over.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        What?

                                 THEO
                        I said how’s it going.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Fine.

           Bernadette rolls the window back up.  Theo bites his tongue.    

                                 THEO
                        Come here.
           Maggie gives her dad a big hug.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        See you in two weeks.  I love you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Love you, too.

           Maggie heads to her mom’s car.  Theo watches her.  The court 
           supervisor stands her customary seven yards away.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                             (calling)
                        Bye, Maggie.

           Maggie doesn’t acknowledge her.  She gets into the car with 
           her mom and buckles up.

           BERNADETTE’S CAR

           Bernadette eyes her ex-husband cynically.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        How come you never hug me like 
                        that?

           Pro forma, Maggie goes for a hug.  Bernadette rejects it.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Please, I don’t need your charity.

           She puts the car in gear.

           PARKING LOT

           As the car pulls away, Maggie looks at her father, and puts 
           the thermometer back in her mouth.

           Theo can do nothing but watch her go.

           INT. JACK IN THE BOX - NIGHT

           Theo clears garbage off a table and wipes it down.  Another 
           EMPLOYEE calls to him from behind.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Theo, Dale wants to see you.

           INT. JACK IN THE BOX, BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

           Theo enters the small box that passes for an office.  The 
           manager, DALE (mid 30s), looks up from his inventory reports.
                                 DALE
                        Hey, Theo.  Have a seat.

           Dale’s grave tone immediately puts Theo on edge.

                                 THEO
                        Finally giving me that raise?

                                 DALE
                        I gotta let you go.

           Theo deflates.  A thousand new problems flood his brain.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a new policy, company-wide: 
                        we can’t have parolees on the 
                        payroll anymore.  Something about 
                        liability.  I hate doing this -- 
                        you’re the best guy I got...

           Dale’s words muddle together and become random sounds, some 
           arcane dialect Theo cannot understand.

           INT. MAGGIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Grunts and groans filter in from the next room.  It’s not 
           obscene, but just loud enough to make Maggie ill.

           Maggie loads an old DV tape into an equally outdated camera.  
           The little label on the spine reads “MAGGIE’S 4TH BDAY”.

           The camera is wired to her hand-me-down TV.  Static on the 
           screen for a second or two, then the home movie comes up.  
           Maggie sits on her bed to watch.

           She turns up the TV to drown out her mother’s intercourse.

           ON TV

           A younger Theo chases his little girl around the yard.  The 
           girl squeals as he catches her and swings her into the air.  
           The camera reveals they’re at a CABIN ON A LAKE.

           ON MAGGIE

           Distant, lost.  She grimaces at a physical pain.  She tries 
           repositioning herself, but can’t get comfortable.

           ON TV

           The image cuts to a birthday cake.  A younger and happier 
           Bernadette comes out from behind the camera and joins Theo 
           and Baby Maggie around the cake.
           ON MAGGIE

           Unable to get alleviate the dull ache inside of her.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Same booth, no Ed.  Theo nurses his coffee, still in shock.

           Next table: a twenty-something couple get up to leave.  The 
           MAN leaves cash on the table.  They exit, chatting.

           Theo watches them leave.  His eyes fall to the cash on the 
           table, as well as the man’s unfinished beer.

           The self pity leave his eyes, replaced by wolf-like cunning.

           He clocks the waitress.  She deals with another table.  A BUS 
           BOY shuffles past with a stack of dishes.

           Eyes back on the beer.

           Theo takes out his wallet and counts out a few bills of his 
           own.  He drops them on the table and slides out of the booth.

           He effortlessly snatches the unfinished beer by the neck and 
           tucks it in his jacket.  He leaves the money.

           EXT. DINER - NIGHT

           Theo walks around the side of the building, into the shadows 
           with the dumpsters.  He grips the beer, still cold.

           Checks both ways -- as if crossing a freeway -- then brings 
           the bottle to his lips.

           His phone rings.  Once, twice.  Theo weighs his options.

           He digs his phone out of his pocket and checks the screen: 
           MAGGIE.  His shoulders slump.  He answers the phone.

                                 THEO
                        Hey.

           His daughter answers, sobbing.

                                 MAGGIE (PHONE FILTER)
                        D-d-d-dad-d-d-d-y?

           Theo drops the bottle.  It rattles against the asphalt.

                                 THEO
                        Slow down, what’s wrong?
           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is dark, save the porch light.  Maggie waits on the 
           front steps, thermometer in her mouth.  Theo screeches to a 
           stop out front, hops out of the car and goes to her.

                                 THEO
                        Are you okay?  Did you call 9-1-1?  
                        Did you call your mom?

           Maggie brushes past him as she gets in his car.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Just take me to the hospital, okay?

           Theo, confused, glances at the driveway.  Bernadette’s car is 
           parked there, with a late-model SUV behind it.

                                 THEO
                        Hey -- You said she wasn’t home.

           Maggie doesn’t answer.  Theo becomes suspicious.  He walks to 
           the car.  Knocks on her window.  She rolls it down.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        You wanna tell me what’s going on?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nothing, I just need to go to the 
                        hospital!

                                 THEO
                        Tell me why.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s personal, okay?!

           It takes Theo a second, but then he gets it.

                                 THEO
                        You don’t need to go to the 
                        hospital.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Early menarche is a warning sign of 
                        cervical cancer.

                                 THEO
                        What the hell is menarche?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m dying, I need medical 
                        attention!
           Her panic is genuine.  Theo takes a beat.  He lowers himself 
           on his haunches so he can look her in the eye.

                                 THEO
                        You’re not dying.  Let’s go inside 
                        and get your mother to take you to 
                        the store.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (acidly)
                        They’re sleeping.

                                 THEO
                        I think we can wake them up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t want her to know, okay?

           Tears in her eyes.  Manufactured or real, Theo is no match.

                                 THEO
                             (to himself, with a sigh)
                        Shit.

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           EXT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           Eyes on fire, Theo opens his trunk.  He rummages around and 
           stuffs something heavy into his pocket.  He slams the trunk 
           and marches back inside.

           INT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           The earlier customer exits as Theo enters.  The place is 
           otherwise empty.  Theo goes back to the counter.

           Gary sees Theo and tenses up.  His eyes go to Theo’s hand 
           buried behind a gun-shaped bulge.

                                 THEO
                        This is gonna be real easy.

           Gary opens the cash drawer.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Did I say open the register?

           Gary shakes his head.

                                 GARY
                        Habit.
           He shuts it.

                                 THEO
                        Did I say shut it?

           Again, Gary shakes his head.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Give me the box.

                                 GARY
                             (confused)
                        ...The box?

                                 THEO
                        Do you really wanna get shot over a 
                        box of tampons?  Because I’m 
                        willing to shoot you over a box of 
                        tampons.

           Gary hands over the box.  Theo grabs it.  But he doesn’t 
           leave right away.  He stares at Gary -- thinking.

           EXT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

           Gary comes out with Theo close behind.  He walks up to 
           Maggie’s window.  She looks up at the clerk a moment, then 
           rolls her window down.

                                 GARY
                        ...I’m sorry for looking at you 
                        like that.

           Silence.  Theo prods him.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        And I won’t do it again.

           Theo signals Maggie to roll up the window again.  She does.

                                 THEO
                        Let’s see some push-ups.

           Gary gets down, and begrudgingly starts doing push-ups.  Theo 
           circles around the car and gets in.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Count off.

                                 GARY
                        One...  Two...  Three...
           Theo’s headlights flash past Gary’s pitiful pushups before 
           screaming down the road.

           INT. THEO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Theo drives quickly, eyes forward.  He takes the crescent 
           wrench out of his pocket and tosses it on the dash.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thanks, dad.

           Theo can’t bring himself to look at her.  He’s not proud.

           She considers the box, then opens it.  She pulls out a 
           wrapped tampon, and puzzles over it.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you even supposed to do 
                        with this?

                                 THEO
                        You’re kidding, right?  Haven’t 
                        they pulled you out of PE yet?

                                 MAGGIE
                        They cut PE.

           EXT. THEO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Theo pounds on unit 12.  ETTA (30s), kind eyes, a little 
           broken, answers in her robe.

                                 ETTA
                        Hey.  You’re off early.

                                 THEO
                        Can we come in?

           Etta looks past Theo and sees Maggie for the first time.

                                 ETTA
                        ...Sure.

           She steps aside and lets the two in.

           INT. ETTA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A small but tidy place.  Warm.  Safe.
                                 THEO
                        Etta, this is my daughter, Maggie.  
                        Maggie, Etta.

           Etta raises a brow at Theo.  She holds out her hand; Maggie 
           doesn’t shake just yet.

                                 ETTA
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi.

                                 THEO
                        Can I talk to you privately?

           Etta follows him into the kitchen.

           Maggie lingers in the living room, looking around.  An 
           incense stick burns on the side table.  A plain blue book 
           next to it.  The spine reads: ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS.

           She picks it up and thumbs through it.

           KITCHEN

           Theo and Etta keep their conversation low.

                                 ETTA
                        I can’t believe you didn’t tell me 
                        you had a kid -- I thought we were 
                        starting something good here.

                                 THEO
                        We were.  We are.  Look, I’m sorry. 
                        I didn’t wanna scared you off.  Can 
                        you help her out?

           Etta weighs her indignation against the girl in the next 
           room.  She takes the box of tampons.

                                 ETTA
                        Yeah, sure.  It’s almost sweet you 
                        thought of me.

                                 THEO
                        Can you give her a ride home, too?  
                        It’s only a couple miles.

           Etta’s eyes widen in surprise.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Please, things have happened, I 
                        can’t hang around here right now.
                                 ETTA
                        You’re her father -- you are taking 
                        her home.

           She goes back into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Where Maggie sits on the sofa, reading.  She looks up.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, honey.

                                 THEO
                        Etta’s gonna help you.

           Maggie puts down the book and gets up.  Etta leads her down 
           the hall to the bathroom.  Maggie looks back at her dad.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be right here.

           Maggie goes with Etta into the bathroom and shuts the door.

           Theo paces to stave off his panic.  When that fails to work, 
           he takes a seat.  When that fails, he stands again.

           Then, faintly, he hears distant police sirens.

           INT. ETTA’S BATHROOM - SAME

           Maggie leans against the shower.  Etta regards the tampons -- 
           entirely wrong for the young girl.  She opens the cabinet and 
           finds a stash of thin pads. 

                                 ETTA
                        Here, these are more your speed.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Are you an alcoholic?

           Etta pauses reassessing the girl.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        My dad has that book, too.

                                 ETTA
                        Recovering.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s a disease, right?
                                 ETTA
                        Some people call it that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I have a disease.  It sucks.

                                 ETTA
                        ...Your dad never mentioned that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He doesn’t like talking about it.
                        Are you two having sex?

           Etta chuckles.  Something about Maggie she finds charming.

                                 ETTA
                        We’re friends.
                             (cautiously)
                        What do you have?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t know yet.  But it’s big.

           Outside: Theo’s car starts.  Maggie scrambles for the door.

           EXT. THEO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie races out just in time to see her father’s tail lights 
           disappear around the corner.  She’s gutted.

           INT. THEO’S CAR - NIGHT

           Theo checks the mirrors, peers down alleys.  He beats the 
           steering wheel, furious with himself.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

           Bernadette, dressed for work, pours coffee into a travel mug.  
           She checks the clock.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (calling)
                        Maggie, let’s go.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

           RANDALL SNOAT (50s) showers -- in silhouette, naked and 
           pillowy -- while murdering some REO Speedwagon.
           Maggie slinks into the bedroom, shielding her eyes.  She 
           finds his pants on the floor. In the back pocket: his wallet.

           She opens it up, pulls out a twenty.

                                 BERNADETTE (O.S.)
                        Margaret Ellen!!

           She replaces the wallet and scoots out, calling back:

                                 MAGGIE
                        Coming, God!

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - SAME

           Bernadette, keys in one hand, coffee in the other -- 
           impatient as ever.  Maggie hustles in with her backpack.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        We’re late, let’s go.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m gonna ride my bike.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Thanks for telling me, I’ve been 
                        standing here waiting for you...

           Maggie heads out the side door, into the garage.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Kiss.

           Maggie returns for the perfunctory kiss.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Watch the lipstick.

           Bernadette offers her cheek.  Maggie gives her a peck.

           INT. ALANO CLUB - MORNING

           Theo sits at the back.  He hasn’t slept or shaven.  His knee 
           bounces up and down on its own.  His breath is short.

                                 ALL
                        God, grant me the serenity to 
                        accept the things I cannot 
                        change...

           Theo simply gets up and walks out before the prayer is done.
           EXT. ALANO CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Theo, jittery, approaches a passer-by.

                                 THEO
                        ‘Scuse me, you wouldn’t have a 
                        cigarette, would you?

           The man shakes his head and continues on his way.

           Theo looks around.  Across the street and down a piece, he 
           spots a LIQUOR STORE.  He takes a good, long look at it.

           EXT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - MORNING

           Maggie rides up to the scene of the crime.  She climbs off 
           her bike, gathers her nerves, and goes inside.

           INT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - MORNING

           Maggie enters, and goes right to the counter where she finds 
           the owner, MR. TOPALIAN, watching an Armenian soap opera.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Excuse me...?

           Topalian turns.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I was in here last night with my 
                        father...?  We accidentally forgot 
                        to pay for something.

           She puts Randall’s twenty on the counter.  Topalian, keeping 
           his cool, rises off his seat -- he knows exactly who she is.

                                 MR. TOPALIAN
                        I’m sorry, what?

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - MORNING

           A cave for booze, beer and smokes.  Theo steps up to the 
           counter, looking jumpy.

                                 THEO
                        Camel Lights.

           As the CLERK fetches the smokes.  Theo stares at the liquor, 
           every flavor and color imaginable, in pretty bottles.
           INT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - MORNING

           Topalian discreetly triggers the silent alarm under the 
           register.  Maggie doesn’t catch on.

                                 MR. TOPALIAN
                        Maybe you can explain again... my 
                        English isn’t so good.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Um... there was a mistake.  Just 
                        take this and we’ll be good.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - MORNING

           The clerk rings up the smokes.

                                 CLERK
                        Six fifty-two.

           Theo counts his money, slowly.  Considering.  Calculating.

                                 THEO
                        ...You got any matches?

           TITLE: ARMED ROBBERY, SECOND COUNT.

           The clerk turns to get matches.  Fast as a snake, Theo 
           snatches a King Sized candy bar and jams it into his jacket.

           When the clerk turns back, he sees Theo jutting his jacket 
           forward in the unmistakable gesture of a hold-up.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        This is gonna be real easy.

           INT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - MORNING

           Topalian’s act makes Maggie start to squirm.  She backs away.

                                 MR. TOPALIAN
                        What was your name again?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I gotta get to school.

           Topalian comes around from behind the counter.

                                 MR. TOPALIAN
                        No, don’t go.  I don’t understand.  
                        Please, tell me again.
           Maggie gets the hell out of there, fast.

           EXT. THE FIRST CONVENIENCE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie hops on her bike.  Topalian comes out after her.

                                 MR. TOPALIAN
                        Get back here!  I know who you are!

           Maggie pedals away as fast as she can.

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE - MORNING

           Theo walks down the alley at a clip.  Without breaking stride 
           he cracks a bottle of Jim Beam, and takes a long pull.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Maggie, standing on her pedals, struggles up the steep hill.

           A POLICE CRUISER creeps up behind her.  She glances over her 
           shoulder -- and tries to go faster.

           BLEWP! The cops give the siren a single bleat.  The lights 
           flick on.  Maggie, ever determined, doesn’t stop riding.

           Then, over the loudspeaker:

                                 OFFICER ONE
                        Pull the bike over.

           There is no escape.

           INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           DETECTIVE DANA ROSS (30s) looks professional, crisp -- but 
           not jaded enough for the job.

           She regards Maggie’s backpack, pink with butterflies on it.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        That’s a cool backpack.  Do you 
                        like butterflies?

           Maggie, arms crossed, stays mute.  Bernadette bores holes 
           into the side of her head with her eyes.
                                 DETECTIVE ROSS (CONT’D)
                        You know, your dad is in a lot of 
                        trouble.  He violated his parole.  
                        Do you know what that means?

           Silence.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS (CONT’D)
                        If you know where he is, and don’t 
                        tell us, you could be in a lot of 
                        trouble, too.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Can I have a sandwich?  I’m 
                        hypoglycemic.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I’ll give you hypoglycemic.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Let’s all keep calm.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        How much did he take?  Is he making 
                        you hold it?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        He didn’t take any money.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        What then, booze?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Beer?

                                 MAGGIE
                        He quit drinking!

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (chuckling, bitter)
                        Oh... pardon me, I forgot.  He’s 
                        the poster boy for sobriety now.

           Maggie shoots her mother a death-stare.  Detective Ross notes 
           the contempt between them.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                             (to Ross)
                        What did he take?
                                 MAGGIE
                             (anxious)
                        I paid the guy back, what’s the big 
                        deal?

           Silence.  Ross proceeds carefully.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        A box of tampons.

           Maggie sinks deeper into her seat.  Bernadette looks at her 
           daughter anew.  The uncomfortable silence lingers.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Interview over.  Detective Ross opens the door.  Maggie 
           wastes no time leaving.  Ross holds Bernadette back a second.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        You might want to have a talk with 
                        her later, when she settles down.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Are you telling me how to raise my 
                        child?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                             (pacifying)
                        I’m saying, if she knows where he 
                        is, she’d be more likely to tell 
                        her mother.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Of course she would.  My daughter 
                        and I are very close.  You do your 
                        job, I’ll do mine.

           Bernadette leaves with her daughter.

           EXT. POLICE STATION, PARKING LOT - DAY

           Maggie comes out of the precinct, phone in her hand, sending 
           a text.  Bernadette marches out behind her.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I have never been so humiliated.  
                        You are so grounded it’s not even 
                        funny.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You can ground me after I run away.
                                 BERNADETTE
                        Promises, promises.

           Bernadette sees Maggie’s cell phone and snatches it away.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are you...

           She reads the text.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        What are you... You warning him?  
                        Have you lost your mind?  He could 
                        have gotten you killed!

                                 MAGGIE
                        You weren’t even there!

                                 BERNADETTE
                        What if that clerk had a gun, huh?  
                        Then what?

           Bernadette puts Maggie’s phone in her purse.  Confiscated.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        You are to have zero communication 
                        with him, do you understand?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You can’t do that -- he’s still my 
                        father!

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I’ve got news for you: A father 
                        provides.  A father is there when 
                        you need him.  He doesn’t land his 
                        ass in jail and leave you with a 
                        daughter to raise!

                                 MAGGIE
                        At least he’s fun!

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Being a parent has nothing to do 
                        with having fun!  Now get in the G-
                        D car, we’re going home.

           INT. BERNADETTE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Bernadette starts the car.  Maggie gets in, slams her door.  
           Both defiant, outraged -- mirror images of each other.

           Bernadette closes her eyes, takes a breath.
                                 BERNADETTE
                             (almost vulnerable)
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Because I hate you.

           Deadly silence, then Bernadette slaps Maggie across the face.  
           Maggie gasps, but otherwise takes it.

           Bernadette re-armors herself.  Pushes her hair back.

           INT. POLICE STATION - SAME

           Detective Ross looks out her window at the parking lot.  She 
           had a good view of the whole exchange, including the slap.

           As Bernadette drives away, Ross’ heart breaks a little.

           INT. MAGGIE’S ROOM - EVENING

           Maggie sits on her bed, watching the birthday video again.

           ON TV

           A younger Maggie sits on Theo’s lap.  He reads her a book.  
           Neither know they’re being taped.  It all looks so normal.

           INT. NICE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Soft music, cloth napkins.  Randall sits beside Bernadette, 
           caressing her arm.  She giggles like a little thing.

           Across the table: Maggie, getting ill.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is there a kids’ menu?

                                 BERNADETTE
                        What does this look like, IHOP?

                                 RANDALL
                        They can probably throw a burger on 
                        for her.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (pointed)
                        She’s old enough to order off the 
                        regular menu.
           The WAITRESS comes to the table with a bottle of champagne 
           and two flutes.  She sets them down and starts pouring.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, we didn’t order this.

           Randall pats her arm reassuringly.  Bernadette raises a brow, 
           intrigued and impressed.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the occasion?

                                 RANDALL
                        First, I closed the Denver deal.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Randall -- that’s wonderful!
                             (to Maggie)
                        Isn’t that wonderful?

           Maggie couldn’t look more bored.

                                 RANDALL
                        Second, they want me to run it.

           Bernadette’s hits a bump.

                                 RANDALL (CONT’D)
                        They’re flying me out to look at 
                        houses next week.

           Maggie perks up.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        ...You’re moving to Denver?

                                 RANDALL
                        And third...

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Let’s stay on number two.

           Stifling a smile, Randall reaches into his pocket.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Your boss tells you to move and you 
                        don’t even put up a fight?  What 
                        about us?

           Randall gets down on one knee, and reveals a ring box.   
           Bernadette’s eyes nearly burst from their sockets.

           Maggie’s jaw goes slack.
                                 RANDALL
                        Bernadette Stanley --

           Before he can finish the question, she starts squealing.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        AAAAHHHH!!!!!  YES!  YESYESYESYES!!

           The entire restaurant turns.  Bernadette throws her arms 
           around Randall’s neck and bounces up and down like a toddler.

                                 RANDALL
                             (to the room)
                        She said yes!

           A round of applause.  Maggie doesn’t join in.

           INT. NICE RESTAURANT, LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie storms into the bathroom.  She immediately shakes out 
           her thermometer and puts it her mouth.

           She leans over the counter, huffing.  Face red.  Staring at a 
           tray of decorative perfume bottles, hair products and mints.

           She picks up a perfume bottle, inspects it.  Pauses.  She is 
           alone.  She slips it in her pocket.

           Pauses again.  Nothing has happened; no alarms have sounded.  
           Her breath has steadied.

           She takes another perfume bottle.  Then the mints, tray and 
           all.  Item by item, she clears off the bathroom counter.

           INT. NICE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Glass bottles clink in Maggie’s coat as she crosses the 
           dining room and sits back down.  She is calm.

           Bernadette, in her own world, shows off her rock to a woman 
           at the next table.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I know, isn’t it divine?

           Randall watches Maggie like a detective.

                                 RANDALL
                        Feeling better?

           She nods.  He leans in, patient as a snake.
                                 RANDALL (CONT’D)
                             (pointed)
                        I’m short on cash.  You wouldn’t 
                        have twenty dollars on you?

           Maggie locks eyes with him.  Busted.

                                 RANDALL (CONT’D)
                             (a threat)
                        Things are going to change, young 
                        lady.

           He drains his drink, eyes fixed on her.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Giggling, tipsy, Bernadette climbs into Randall’s arms.  He 
           kicks open her bedroom door and carries her inside.

           INT. MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The wall is no match for the antics in the next room.

           Maggie closes and locks her door.  She dumps the books out of 
           her butterfly backpack, and starts filling it with clothing.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Maggie drops out her window, sneaks over to her bike, and 
           without fanfare, pedals the hell out of there.

           EXT. THEO’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Maggie bangs on her father’s door.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dad!  DAD!  Open up!

           The door to unit 12 opens and Etta leans out.

                                 ETTA
                        Maggie?

           Maggie turns.

           INT. ETTA’S PICKUP - SAME

           Parked outside the Alano club.  Maggie watches Etta talking 
           to a Ed and few others, then return to the truck.
                                 ETTA
                        They haven’t seen him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’ll come here sooner or later, 
                        though, right?

           Etta sighs.

                                 ETTA
                        How ‘bout I take you home --

                                 MAGGIE
                             (quickly)
                        I told you, my mom’s out of town 
                        and I lost my keys.

           Etta pauses.  She knows Maggie’s in trouble, but can’t pin 
           down the brand.

                                 ETTA
                        I know a place he used to go.

           EXT. THE RAVEN - NIGHT

           Etta pulls up to the Raven, a windowless bar for those who 
           prefer round-the-clock darkness.

                                 ETTA
                        Stay here.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I wanna go in.

           Etta, too tired to argue, allows Maggie to follow.

           INT. THE RAVEN - CONTINUOUS

           A dusty layer of smoke mingles with Lynnard Skynnard.  A 
           cheerless BARTENDER follows the Keno numbers on the CCTV.  

           Etta takes Maggie’s hand.  Maggie drifts through like a deep 
           sea diver beholding previously undiscovered creatures.

           They make a full circle, but come up empty.  Then, Etta spots 
           the men’s room door.

           INT. THE RAVEN, MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dirty urinals, stalls without doors.  Etta ventures in. 
           Maggie hangs back.  It appears empty.
           But then Etta looks in the last stall.  Theo lies curled 
           around an old toilet, unconscious.

           EXT. THE RAVEN - NIGHT

           Etta hauls Theo into the night air.  He’s only vaguely aware 
           of what’s going on.  Maggie follows the sorry sight out.

                                 ETTA
                        Theo?  Theo, where’s your car?

           Theo mumbles.  Etta searches the lot for his car.  Not there.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        Maggie, get my keys out of my purse 
                        and open the door.

           Maggie fishes out Etta’s keys out opens up the door.  Etta 
           dumps Theo in.  His feet stick out.  He’s only got one shoe.

                                 ETTA (CONT’D)
                        This is probably hard for you, 
                        but... Take a good long look.

           She does.  Then, the BARTENDER comes out of the joint.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey -- you gonna settle his tab or 
                        do I have to call the cops?

           Maggie shakes her head vehemently.  Etta holds out her hands.

                                 ETTA
                        I’ll take care of it.  Stay here.

           Etta goes inside.  Maggie looks at her dad, weighing options.

           She looks around.  They are alone.

           The moment takes over.  Maggie shoves Theo’s feet into the 
           truck, and climbs behind the wheel.

           Palms sweating, heart racing, Maggie starts the engine, and 
           puts it in reverse.

           TITLE: AUTO THEFT, FIRST COUNT

           The pickup bucks backward and -- BANG -- crashes into a 
           pylon, denting the bumper. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.  Okay.
           Maggie throws it into drive and peels out.  The truck swerves 
           from side to side as she over-corrects her steering. 

           She jumps the curb -- spraying sparks behind her -- before 
           finally pointing the pickup down the street and speeding off.

           INT. ETTA’S PICKUP - SAME

           Maggie gets a feel for the steering.  Checks behind her.  All 
           clear.  Theo, unaware, mumbling, is wedged in beside her.

           Adrenaline races through her veins; somehow she keeps steady.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           BLACK

           INT. BERNADETTE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           BANG-BANG.  Bernadette lifts her head out of Randall’s 
           armpit.  Mascara has glued her eyes shut.  BANG-BANG-BANG.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - MORNING

           BANG-BANG.  Bernadette shuffles up, knotting her robe.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Who is it?

           A woman’s voice from the other side.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Police.

           Bernadette pauses.  She brushes back her hair and opens the 
           door.  Two police OFFICERS stand on her porch.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        What did she do now?

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, HALLWAY - MORNING

           Bernadette tries Maggie’s door.  Locked.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Maggie, open this door right now.
           No answer.  She looks at the officers apologetically, and 
           fishes a bobby pin from her tangled mess.  She jimmies the 
           lock and opens the door.

           To her surprise, the room is empty.  Down the hall, Randall 
           surfaces in his boxers.

                                 RANDALL
                        What’s going on?

           The look on Bernadette’s face asks the same question.

           INT. ETTA’S PICKUP - MORNING

           Theo wakes -- barely -- and picks his hundred pound skull off 
           the vinyl seat.  Sits up, looks around.  Utterly dumbfounded.  
           Nausea seizes him.  He scrambles for the door.

           EXT. NEVADA GAS STATION - MORNING

           Theo tumbles out and hurls his guts onto the dusty ground.

           He stands up, noticing his solitary shoe, and is baffled.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Are you okay?

           He turns to find Maggie on the hood of Etta’s truck with two 
           cups of coffee, offering one.  Again: baffling.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Cream, two sugars.

           He tries to piece the night together, and make sense of this 
           lonely, high desert filling station.

                                 THEO
                        Where are we?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nevada.

           Again, he looks at the truck.

                                 THEO
                        That’s Etta’s truck -- is she here?

           Maggie shakes her head.  Theo’s gut twists.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Please tell me I didn’t drive you.
           She shakes her head.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Tell me the truth, it’s okay.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You didn’t drive, you slept.

                                 THEO
                        Then who did?

           Maggie bites her lip, stalls.

           His eyes clamp shut.  Keep the temper down.  Down.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dad, just listen.  I’ve got a plan.

                                 THEO
                        Oh, thank God.  I can’t wait to 
                        hear it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was thinking we could --

                                 THEO
                        I DON’T WANT TO HEAR YOUR PLAN!

           Maggie zips it.  Theo pulls himself together.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Get in the car, we’re going home.

                                 MAGGIE
                        There’s not enough gas, and we’re 
                        outta money.

           Theo takes out his wallet.  Empty.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You only had six bucks.  I spent 
                        three on coffee and three on gas.

           She offers him the coffee once more. Theo struggles to keep 
           calm.  He pats himself down.

                                 THEO
                        Where’s my phone?

           She shrugs.  Theo searches the cab, rifles through the glove 
           box, ashtray, arm rest -- anywhere he can think.
                                 MAGGIE
                        The police are looking for you, 
                        they wanna put you back in jail.

                                 THEO
                        What else is new?

           Theo discovers a few quarters under the floor mat.  He gets 
           out, looks around.  Spots a pay phone by the air and water.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Wait here, I gotta make some calls.

           He walks to the phone.  Maggie’s brow wrinkles with worry.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Two police cars are parked out front, one marked and one 
           plain.  A NEIGHBOR stands on his lawn, eyeing the scene.

           INT. MAGGIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Two POLICE OFFICERS search Maggie’s room with gloved hands.  
           One runs his hands between the mattress and the box spring.

           The other notes the collection of medical textbooks lined up 
           on her desk: anatomy, infectious disease, science of death...

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Bernadette’s eyes are red, rubbed raw by the Kleenex she 
           clutches in one hand.  She leans on Randall for support.

           Detective Ross sits across from them, taking notes.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Does he have any family?

           Bernadette shakes her head.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Close friends?  Anyone he might go 
                        to for help?

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I don’t know -- Why don’t you ask 
                        that whore who helped him kidnap my 
                        daughter?
                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Well, we have.  According to her, 
                        your ex-husband was so intoxicated, 
                        he could barely walk.  It appears 
                        your daughter was the one who stole 
                        the vehicle.  

           Bernadette hardens, stares her down.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Here’s what you need to understand 
                        about Theo: he’s good at getting 
                        women to lie for him.  Maggie was 
                        lying for him the other day in your 
                        office, and that woman is lying for 
                        him now.  He kidnapped her!

           Bernadette gets up in a huff.  She finds her purse, digs 
           through until she comes out with smokes.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        His face should be all over the TV 
                        by now.  Where’s the G-D Amber 
                        Alert, for God’s sake?

           Detective Ross and Randall trade a glance.

                                 RANDALL
                        Honey, the quicker you answer her 
                        questions --

                                 BERNADETTE
                        She is wasting time.
                             (to Ross)
                        Who’s calling Channel 3 news, you 
                        or me?

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           Etta sits in a waiting area, looking exhausted.  Her cell 
           phone rings inside her purse.  She pulls it out, checks the 
           screen.  UNKNOWN.  She answers.

                                 ETTA
                        Hello?

           EXT. NEVADA GAS STATION - INTERCUT

           Theo leans against the pay phone.

                                 THEO
                        Etta, it’s me.
           Etta sits forward, cups her hand over her mouth.

                                 ETTA
                             (hushed)
                        Theo -- where are you?  Is Maggie 
                        with you, is she okay?

                                 THEO
                        She’s fine.  I’m, uh... I’m 
                        somewhere in Nevada.  You’re car’s 
                        fine.

                                 ETTA
                        I don’t care about my car -- you’ve 
                        got to get back here, right now, 
                        before this gets any worse.

                                 THEO
                        Listen: I’m on a pay phone, and I 
                        don’t have any more change.  My 
                        car’s at the Alano Club.  There’s a 
                        spare key in my kitchen.  I need 
                        you to drive it out here, and take 
                        Maggie home in your truck.

           Etta pauses at his audacity.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        And I need some money.

                                 ETTA
                             (exercising tolerance)
                        This is why my sponsor told me to 
                        stay away from you...

                                 THEO
                        Christ, you gonna help me or not?

           Etta shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 ETTA
                        Theo, I think under all the 
                        bullshit, there’s actually a good 
                        guy in there.  But, I’m sorry.  I’m 
                        sick of digging through bullshit to 
                        find him.

           She hangs up.  The coins clink into the belly of the machine.

           Then, behind him: Etta’s pickup pulls up.  He turns, sees 
           Maggie throw the passenger door open for him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Get in.
                                 THEO
                        What are you doing?  Get out of 
                        there right now.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        GET IN!

           Maggie looks over her shoulder at the store.  Theo catches 
           that mix of panic and exhilaration in her eyes, and knows.

           TITLE: PETTY LARCENY

           The store’s PROPRIETOR bursts through the doors waving a 
           Louisville Slugger.  He spots the truck.

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        HEY!  STOP!

           Theo -- acting on reflex -- dives into the truck.

           Maggie lays on the gas and aims for the freeway.  The 
           Proprietor runs after them, shouting.

                                 PROPRIETOR (CONT’D)
                        GET BACK HERE!

           In desperation, he throws the bat at the truck.  It hits the 
           broadside, then rattles harmlessly to the ground.

           INT. ETTA’S PICKUP - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie screams -- not with fear, but with delight.

           Pure thrill in her eyes.  She waits for her dad to join in, 
           but he doesn’t.  Theo stares at her, furious.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?

           Theo’s jaw clenches -- it’s all he can do to not explode. 

                                 THEO
                        PULL OVER, RIGHT NOW!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why?

           Theo leas over, grabs the wheel, and stomps on the brake.

           EXT. HIGHWAY ENTRANCE RAMP - SAME

           The car skids to a stop in a cloud of dust.
           INT. ETTA’S PICKUP - SAME

           Maggie withers under her father’s disapproving glare.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I only took enough for gas.

                                 THEO
                        Show me.

           Maggie reaches for her backpack, and removes a wad of cash.  
           Tens and twenties.  A few hundred, easy.

           She continues to take things out.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I also got stuff for the road.  
                        Power bars, Charleston Chew, a 
                        Sudoku book.  Some Alka-Seltzer for 
                        your stomach, this cool key-chain.

           She finally pulls out a telephone receiver.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        And this, so he couldn’t call the 
                        cops.

           Theo pinches the bridge of his nose.

                                 THEO
                        Do you want me to spend the rest of 
                        my life in prison?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (meekly)
                        I have a plan.

           Theo looks at her, dumbfounded.  Then, the reality of the 
           situation strikes him.  He glances back.

                                 THEO
                        Switch seats.

           Theo clumsily climbs over her as Maggie slides under.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t you want to hear it?

           Theo throws the car in gear and takes off.

           EXT. HIGHWAY ENTRANCE RAMP - SAME

           The truck kicks up gravel as it hauls ass onto the highway.
           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Curious neighbors stand on their front lawns speculating as 
           to why there are two news vans and a full compliment of 
           police vehicles parked outside the house.

           A black SUV with tinted windows pulls up, and four FBI AGENTS 
           climb out.  AGENT LIONEL WARD (40s) leads the team as the 
           head to the door.  AGENT REEVES (30s) reads from a dossier.

                                 AGENT REEVES
                        Theodore James Waters, a.k.a. Teddy 
                        James, a.k.a Jimmy Walters. 
                        Arrested four times in Washington 
                        state in the early 90s.  Convicted 
                        here in 2006 on identity theft and 
                        fraud, served four and a half.  
                        Currently on parole.

                                 AGENT COOPER 
                        He was on the run for six months 
                        before they got him last time.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        How’d they end up doing it?

                                 AGENT REEVES 
                        Phone tap.  He called home to talk 
                        to his kid.

           Ward makes a mental note of that.

           One of the TV CREWS is on point and spies the FBI’s arrival.  
           The NEWS REPORTER rushes up, followed by her CAMERAMAN.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        Can we get a statement?

           AGENT BROWN (40s) peels away and holds the news crew at bay.

                                 AGENT BROWN
                        You’ll get your statement, let us 
                        go inside and do our jobs.

           Ward leads the team inside.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the police presence has swollen to a dozen men and 
           women in uniform.  Detective Ross meets the FBI at the door.
                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Detective Dana Ross, we spoke on 
                        the phone.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Is that her?

           Ross nods and leads Ward into the living room.

                                 AGENT WARD (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Waters.  Special Agent Lionel 
                        Ward.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        It’s Stanley.  Soon to be Snoat.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        This is Special Agent Reeves, Agent 
                        Cooper, Agent Brown --

           Bernadette notices an officer searching a curio cabinet.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Excuse me!  What are you doing?  
                        Those are delicate.
                             (to Ross)
                        What is he doing?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Standard procedure, we have to 
                        search the entire house.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Well, I’ll save you some time -- 
                        she’s not in the cabinet.
                             (to Ward)
                        Please tell me you know what you’re 
                        doing.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Ms. Stanley, my team and I have 
                        overseen hundreds of abductions.  
                        Law enforcement agencies in three 
                        states are looking for your 
                        daughter right now, and from this 
                        moment on, they all report to me.  
                        Now: with your permission, we’d 
                        like to put a trace on your phone.  
                        Then, if you feel up to it, we’ll 
                        make a statement to the press.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Thank God you’re here.
           EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE, ELKO NV - EVENING

           Etta’s truck is parked behind an abandoned warehouse, amid a 
           forest of weeds.  A busted chain link fence surrounds the 
           place.  No one else around.

           Maggie stands next to the truck, watching her dad root 
           through the tool boxes in the back.  Theo finds a flat-head 
           screwdriver and pockets it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are you looking for?

                                 THEO
                        Supplies.

           He finds a small cordless drill, no bigger than a handgun.  
           He pulls the trigger to test.  It works.  He takes it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where are we going?

                                 THEO
                        Well, you’re going back to your 
                        mom’s.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No I’m not!

                                 THEO
                        No arguments.  I’m putting you on 
                        the first bus home.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why can’t I go with you?

                                 THEO
                        Because I have to disappear for a 
                        while, and where I’m going is no 
                        place for a little girl.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Neither is mom’s.

                                 THEO
                        You should have thought of that 
                        before you knocked over a gas 
                        station.

           He picks up a blue tarp and hops down from the truck.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Here, give me hand with this.
           He hands her one end of the tarp.  She won’t take it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        If you send me home, I’m just gonna 
                        run away again.

                                 THEO
                        Running away doesn’t solve your 
                        problems.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re doing it.

           Theo pauses.  Touche.

                                 THEO
                        Okay, let’s say you come with me.  
                        Are you prepared to sleep under a 
                        bridge if you have to?  Eat from a 
                        garbage can?  When I say disappear, 
                        I mean vanish.  City after city, 
                        shelter after shelter.  No friends, 
                        no school, no home.  Are you ready 
                        for that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who says we can’t have a home?  Why 
                        can’t we go someplace and be 
                        normal?
                             (venturing)
                        Like the lake.

           Theo pauses at the mention.

                                 THEO
                        The lake?  That was your plan?

           He starts chuckling.  She gets angry.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s better than feeding stupid 
                        ducks.

                                 THEO
                        What do you think, you mom’ll make 
                        a few calls and drive around the 
                        block a couple times?  She will 
                        never stop looking for you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        She doesn’t give a shit about me.
                                 THEO
                        Watch your language.  And you’re 
                        wrong.  She’s probably got the 
                        National Guard after us.  Now give 
                        me a hand.

           Silence.  She reaches out and takes her half of the tarp.  
           They unfold it and drape it over the truck.

           INT. BUS STATION, ELKO NV - EVENING

           Theo and Maggie enter the dingy station -- Theo still only 
           wearing one shoe.  He scans the room.  A SECURITY GUARD 
           stands by the far exit, texting on his phone.  No police.

           Theo spots the entrance to an adjoining diner.

                                 THEO
                        Let me see the money.

           She takes the cash from the gas station out of her pocket and 
           hands it over.  He counts off a few bills for her.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Go get some sandwiches.  I’ll get 
                        the tickets.

           They split: Maggie to the diner; Theo to the ticket counter.  

           He looks up at the destinations: Chicago, points east.  
           Sacramento, points west.  Las Vegas, points south.

           INT. ELKO DINER - SAME

           Part diner, part sundry store, the kind you’d find next to a 
           bowling alley.  Maggie pays for her order.  The CASHIER rings 
           her up and gives her change.

                                 CASHIER
                        Just be a few minutes, honey.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thanks.

           Maggie takes a seat on a stool.  She twists her hips back and 
           forth, just for fun.  She spins around, once, twice.

           Then something catches her eye.  She hops off the stool.
           INT. BUS STATION, ELKO NV - EVENING

           Theo sits against the wall, staring up at the ceiling.

           Maggie walks up with a plastic bag, and sits beside him.  She 
           hands him a sandwich.

                                 THEO
                        Thanks.  Here.  Leaves in an hour.

           He hands her the bus ticket.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 THEO
                        When you get home, they’re going to 
                        ask you all kinds of questions, and 
                        the less you know, the better.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How will I know if you’re okay?

                                 THEO
                        You don’t have to worry about me.  
                        I’m always okay.

           He starts in on his sandwich.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Mom and Randall are getting 
                        married.  We’re moving to Denver.

           Theo takes a moment to process.

                                 THEO
                        When did that happen?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Last night.

           Pause.  Theo’s appetite is gone.

                                 THEO
                        Just like that?

           Maggie nods, then proceeds to take her temperature.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        What is that, what’s that about?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I told you, I like to know.
                                 THEO
                        Know what?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (frustrated)
                        My symptoms, God.

                                 THEO
                        Are you sick?

           Irked, she takes the thermometer out of her mouth.

                                 MAGGIE
                        One of the warning signs for 
                        Pediatric Leukemia is a recurring 
                        fever.

                                 THEO
                        You don’t have Leukemia.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yet.

           Maggie puts the thermometer back in her mouth.  Then she 
           takes a pair of flip-flops out of the plastic bag.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I looked for regular shoes, but 
                        that’s all they had.

           Theo takes the flip flops, feeling guilty as hell.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I paid for them.

           Theo puts one of them on.  Fits perfectly.  He takes a deep 
           breath, and lets his head fall back against the wall.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           There’s a full-blown crowd outside the house now.  News crews 
           point their cameras and shine their lights on Bernadette, who 
           stands in front of a bank of microphones.

           Flanking her are Detective Ross and Randall.  Agent Ward 
           stands in the background, just beyond the light.  

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (reading from a statement)
                        We pray to God that she is safe, 
                        and will be returned to us soon.  
                        If you have any information at all, 
                        please call the police.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNADETTE (CONT'D)
                        We miss her so much.
                             (to the cameras)
                        Maggie, if you can hear me: hi, 
                        pookie, it’s mommy.

           Detective Ross looks sidelong at Bernadette.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        We miss you, sweetheart.  We love 
                        you so much, and just want to see 
                        you home, okay?  Eskimo kisses.

           Bernadette closes her eyes and wiggles her nose.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Mommy loves you.

           Bernadette backs away from the microphones, starting to sob.  
           Agent Ward takes her by the shoulders and leads her and 
           Randall back to the house.

           The reporters shout questions, all ignored.

           INT. BUS STATION MENS ROOM - EVENING

           Theo washes his hands, trying not to look directly at the 
           WEARY TRAVELER taking a hobo shower at the next sink.  Shirt 
           off, splashing hit pits with a smudged washcloth.

           Instead Theo looks at his own reflection.  He can’t decide 
           which sight is worse.

           Over the PA, an garbled announcement:

                                 STATION MASTER (O.S.)
                             (over PA)
                        Sacramento, points west, now 
                        boarding.

           INT. BUS STATION, ELKO NV - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie waits by the door to the busses.  Theo walks up.

                                 THEO
                        Ready?

           He sees the trepidation in her eyes.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call soon as I can.
                                 MAGGIE
                        When?

           Theo pets her hair, looks at her lovingly.

                                 THEO
                        So soon, we don’t even have to 
                        bother saying goodbye.

           Cold comfort.  He hugs her; she doesn’t hug back.

           Maggie walks to the bus, hands her ticket to the driver, and 
           gets on.  She turns, waves, then she’s gone.

           Theo takes a deep breath, lets his head droop.

           He turns around, and starts walking toward the exit.  He 
           keeps his head down.

           On his way out of the door, he accidentally brushes up 
           against the Security Guard, and stumbles a little.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, excuse me.

           The guard frowns, looks him over.  Theo continues out.

           EXT. BUS STATION, ELKO NV - CONTINUOUS

           As Theo comes out he reveals the security guard’s cell phone, 
           freshly lifted from his pocket.  He dials.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - EVENING

           Bernadette lights a new cig off an old one, stares at the 
           purple sky.

           Randall opens the slider and joins her.  He puts his hands on 
           her shoulders, starts rubbing them.  She’s annoyed at first, 
           but his magic slowly starts working on her.

                                 RANDALL
                        How did you ever get involved with 
                        a man like that?

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I was a child.  It was exciting, 
                        and then it wasn’t.

                                 RANDALL
                        As soon as this is over, we’ll go 
                        to Denver, and put this behind us. 
                                 BERNADETTE
                        I can’t even think about Denver 
                        right now.

                                 RANDALL
                        It’s a great place.  Clean air, 
                        friendly people.  I’ll be making 
                        enough to support us.  No more 
                        twelve hour shifts, no more doctors 
                        pinching your ass.  You deserve a 
                        fresh start. 

           Bernadette’s eyelids drop.  A faint grin haunts her face.

                                 RANDALL (CONT’D)
                        It’s time somebody took care of 
                        you.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Keep talking.

           Inside: the house phone rings.  Bernadette’s eyes pop open.

           Agent Ward comes outside.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Ms. Stanley?

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           All hands on deck.  Reeves manages the tracing equipment.  
           Ward leads an anxious Bernadette through the thicket of 
           police to the phone.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Okay.  Remember what we talked 
                        about.  Stay calm, try to keep him 
                        calm.  Ask to talk to her.  Find 
                        out what he wants, if he has any 
                        demands.  Keep him talking until 
                        the local authorities get there.

           Agent Brown hands Ward a set of headphones.  Bernadette picks 
           up the receiver.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Hello?

           EXT. BUS STATION, ELKO NV - INTERCUT

           Theo crosses the lot, checking out the cars as he talks.
                                 THEO
                        Bernie, it’s me.

           Agent Reeves starts tapping keys on his laptop.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (stiff)
                        Hello, Theo.  Where are you?

           Theo waits for the eruption.  Nothing.

                                 THEO
                             (cautiously)
                        It’s not important.

                                 AGENT REEVES
                        It’s a cell.  Two minutes.

           Agent Ward signals Bernadette to keep talking.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (on the spot)
                        ...What are your demands?

                                 THEO
                             (thrown)
                        I don’t have -- what are you 
                        talking about?  Look: I put her on 
                        a bus, she gets into Sac at 11:30.

           The Feds take note.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        You put her on a bus?  Alone?  
                        Great parenting as always.

                                 AGENT COOPER
                             (zeroing in)
                        Elko, Nevada.

                                 AGENT REEVES
                             (into his cell)
                        Elko, Nevada, E-L-K-O.

                                 THEO
                        Great parenting?  You’re the one 
                        dragging her to Denver, not me.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Denver is a lovely city!  And it’s 
                        none of your business!
                                 THEO
                        It is my business when you take my 
                        kid out of state!

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (temperature rising)
                        Oh, now she’s your kid.  Who takes 
                        her to school every day?

                                 THEO
                        Here we go...

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (overlapping)
                        Who sits up with her at three AM 
                        when she’s got the flu?

                                 THEO
                             (running over her)
                        Doesn’t it get crowded on that 
                        cross with you and Jesus?

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        Almost have it, keep him on.

           Ward waves his hands, trying to get Bernadette to cool it.  
           Detective Ross stands in the doorway, practically wincing.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        You have no idea the sacrifices it 
                        takes to raise a kid, because 
                        you’ve never sacrificed a G-D 
                        thing.  It’s whatever Theo wants, 
                        whenever Theo wants it.  So do your 
                        little vanishing act, go hole up 
                        with whatever lowlifes you call 
                        friends, but know one thing: you 
                        will never see her again.

           Theo’s jaw tightens.  There’s a new resolve in his eyes.

                                 THEO
                        You know what, Bernie?  You didn’t 
                        even ask me if she was okay.

           Bernadette pauses.  She didn’t ask, and she knows it.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        You want to see a vanishing act?  
                        Watch this.

           Theo hangs up, and chucks the phone across the parking lot.

           TITLE: ABDUCTION / TRANSPORTING A MINOR ACROSS STATE LINES
           LIVING ROOM

           Everyone stare at Bernadette in stunned silence.  Even 
           Randall looks uncomfortable.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        He hung up.

                                 AGENT WARD
                             (to Cooper)
                        Did you get it?

                                 AGENT COOPER
                        He’s within two miles of 1500 
                        McKinley Avenue.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Have them start at the bus station.

           Bernadette addresses anyone who’ll listen.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (defensive)
                        He hung up.

           EXT. BUS STATION, ELKO NV - EVENING

           The San Francisco-bound bus pulls out of the station.  Theo 
           runs after it, waving his arms.

                                 THEO
                        HEY!  WAIT!  STOP!

           The bus roars on, stopping for no one.  Theo soon loses steam 
           as the effort becomes a lost cause.

           Winded, tapped, he nearly drops to his knees.

           As he picks himself up, his daughter’s voice:

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           He turns.  Maggie stands on the sidewalk, a few yards back.

           Confused, Theo looks back at the Greyhound as it recedes down 
           the street.  Then at Maggie.

                                 THEO
                        Wasn’t that your bus?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I told you, I’m not going home.
           SIRENS.  Theo snaps his head like a dog.  Police are coming, 
           though he can’t see them yet.

           Scrambling, he spots a SEEDY MOTEL a hundred yards away, 
           grabs Maggie, and makes for it.

           INT. SEEDY MOTEL, FRONT DESK - EVENING

           Theo hurries in with his daughter and puts on a casual smile.  
           The MOTEL MANAGER (50s), slumped behind the counter, looks up 
           from his takeout and cigarettes.

                                 THEO
                        We’d like a room, please.

           The manager eyeballs Theo, then Maggie.

                                 MOTEL MANAGER
                             (without judgment)
                        How many hours?

           INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Theo scoots Maggie inside and quickly shuts the door.

           The sirens outside have reached crescendo.  Maggie peeks 
           through the curtains and watches a dozen police cars descend 
           upon the bus station down the street.

                                 THEO
                        Get away from the window.

           Theo turns on the TV and cranks the volume as high as it’ll 
           go.  He crosses the room to the

           BATHROOM

           turns on the shower, examines the window.  Hops up on the 
           toilet, tries to open it.  Stuck.  He grabs a towel, wads it 
           up, and starts beating at the window.

           MAIN ROOM

           Maggie continues to look out the front window at the police.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s a lot of cops.

           BATHROOM

           Theo continues bash the window.
                                 THEO
                        Yeah, well, welcome to life on the 
                        road.  You wanted it, you got it.

           He finally shatters the window and clears away the pieces.  
           He drapes the towel over the sill.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Maggie, come on, let’s go.

           No answer from her.  He goes back into the 

           MAIN ROOM

           To find her gone.  The door is wide open.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Maggie!

           EXT. SEEDY MOTEL, PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Theo runs out of the room, and spots Maggie sprinting across 
           the parking lot.  Theo runs after her.

                                 THEO
                        MAGGIE!

           She doesn’t slow.  Theo’s pumps his legs as hard as he can.

           EXT. ELKO STREET - CONTINUOUS

           They run down the street, away from the police, who -- for 
           now -- haven’t spotted them.

           Maggie bolts into an intersection just as a CITY BUS pulls 
           away from the curb.  SCREECH! -- it nearly runs her down.

           Maggie stops dead.

           Theo catches up, grabs her by the shoulders.

                                 THEO
                        Are you okay?

           She’s too rattled to speak.

           Theo glances back at the maelstrom of police, and hurries 
           himself and Maggie onto the bus before they’re spotted.
           INT. CITY BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Theo and Maggie climb aboard.  Theo rummages for the fare.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Keep a leash on that one!

                                 THEO
                        I know, I’m sorry.

           Theo pays and hauls Maggie to the back.  The bus resumes its 
           route, delivering them from the police and to safety.

           Theo pens Maggie in against a window.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’m waiting.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I never said I’d go with you.

                                 THEO
                        Something wrong with me all of a 
                        sudden?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, I just don’t wanna eat out of 
                        garbage cans, thank you.

                                 THEO
                        So you weren’t going home, you 
                        weren’t going with me -- where 
                        then?

           She turns away, chagrined.  He figures it out.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        You don’t even know where the cabin 
                        is -- you were a toddler the last 
                        time you were there.

                                 MAGGIE
                        15 Woodrow Road, Klamath Falls, 
                        Oregon.
                             (explaining)
                        Google Maps.

           Theo sighs, shakes his head.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to come.  I can get 
                        there myself.
                                 THEO
                        Like I’m letting you go to Oregon 
                        alone.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why not, I drove to Nevada alone.

                                 THEO
                        Because I’m your father, that’s why 
                        not.

           The word hangs in the air.  They look at each other, both 
           feeling the full meaning of that word.  And it feels good.

           She puts her arm around his, and leans into him.

           INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

           Empty mini-van in a parking lot.  Suddenly CRASH -- one of 
           the back windows explodes into the cab.

           TITLE: AUTO THEFT, SECOND COUNT.

           Theo reaches an arm in and slides the door open.  Maggie 
           climbs inside.

                                 MAGGIE
                        This car’s a piece of junk.

           Theo gets into the driver’s seat.

                                 THEO
                        Nicer cars have alarms.

           Theo takes out the flat-head screwdriver and cordless drill 
           from Etta’s truck.  He starts drilling the ignition keyhole.

           Maggie leans forward to watch him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Are you hot wiring it?

                                 THEO
                        Not exactly.

           He holds the screwdriver over the newly drilled hole.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Hand me the rock.

           Maggie retrieves the rock that busted the window and gives it 
           to her dad.  Theo aims for the butt end of the screwdriver.  
           Glances back at Maggie.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ever do this.

           WHACK!  The rock drives the screwdriver into the keyhole.  
           Theo turns it like a giant key.  The engine starts right up; 
           the radio comes on, tuned to mariachi.

           EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME

           Theo and Maggie drive out of the lot in the stolen mini-van.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           They drive into the night, wind whipping through the broken 
           window.  Maggie turns the mariachi on the radio up -- way up.  

           Theo looks at his daughter, and can’t help smiling.

           INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The phone rings in the empty room.  The TV blares.  The 
           shower runs.  Once, twice, three times.  No answer.

           EXT. SEEDY MOTEL - SAME

           A small army of POLICE have swarmed the motel.  A team armed 
           in riot gear waits outside.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Agent Ward is on the phone, waits for an answer in the motel 
           room.  Bernadette holds on to Randall for dear life.  Tension 
           permeates the room like sweat.

           Ward hangs up.  He nods to Agent Cooper.

                                 AGENT COOPER
                             (into his phone)
                        Send them in.

           EXT. SEEDY MOTEL - SAME

           The OFFICERS outside the door get the order.  The one closest 
           to the door pounds on it.

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        OPEN UP, POLICE!
           No answer.  The officer waves the Motel Manager over.  He 
           comes with the master key and unlocks the door.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Everyone waits on pins and needles.  Ward is on the phone 
           with the local police.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Secure the area.  Set up road 
                        blocks.  They can’t be far.

           The room deflates.  Randall comforts Bernadette.  Her jaw 
           clenches as she feels everyone’s eyes on her.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I did everything you said, it’s not 
                        my fault he hung up.
                             (to Randall)
                        I was flustered.  Of course I care 
                        how she’s doing.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        No one’s blaming you.

           Bernadette glares at Detective Ross.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Maybe if you’d done your job and 
                        found him like you said you would, 
                        none of this would have happened!  
                        Get out!  Get out of my house!

           Randall pulls Bernadette out of the room.  Officers move 
           between the two women.  Agent Ward goes to Ross.

                                 AGENT WARD
                             (privately)
                        Thank you for all your work today.  
                        You must be tired.

           She understands.  She finds her coat.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                             (understanding)
                        You should know, this isn’t a 
                        kidnapping.  I’ve seen her with her 
                        mother -- they don’t call each 
                        other pookie and do Eskimo kisses.  
                        This girl’s a runaway.
                                 AGENT WARD
                        He’s a fugitive in the company of a 
                        minor over whom he has no custodial 
                        rights.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I’m aware of the legal distinction.  
                        I’m saying, when you find them, she 
                        won’t want to go with you.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        That won’t be up to her.

           Having said her peace, Ross leaves.  As she closes the door, 
           she can hear Bernadette cursing her name in the next room.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

           Maggie opens her eyes.  Dome light.  Tear in the ceiling 
           fabric.  Sits up.  Kink in her neck.  Looks around.

           EXT. EASTERN OREGON ROADSIDE - MORNING

           Maggie slides the mini-van door open and looks out on a 
           barren, Mars-like terrain.  A dirt road leads to a small 
           highway in the distance.

                                 THEO (O.S.)
                        She lives.

           Theo sits, his back against the van, going over a road map.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where are we?

                                 THEO
                        Oregon.

           There’s a plastic shopping bag next to him.  He takes out a 
           small box of Frosted Flakes and a tosses it to her.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I stopped last night to gas up.  
                        You were lights out.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (re: the map)
                        How far away are we?
                                 THEO
                        Slight change of plans.  We’re 
                        going to Seattle first.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How come?

                                 THEO
                        Because if we want to disappear, we 
                        need provisions, IDs, a clean 
                        car... And all that costs money.  
                        I’ve got a friend up there who can 
                        get me some work.  The trick is 
                        gonna be staying off the main 
                        roads.  It’ll take a couple days.

           Maggie sits with the new plan a moment.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ve got money.  Almost three 
                        thousand in savings.

                                 THEO
                        That’s yours.  Anyway, we need more 
                        than that.  Eat.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you get milk?

           He shakes his head.  She puts the box down.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I have to pee.

           Pause.  Theo, noticing she hasn’t gone anywhere, looks up.

                                 THEO
                        So go.

           Theo gestures to the great wide world all around them.  
           Maggie takes a deep breath, then walks around the car.

           Theo finishes tracing the best route northwest to Seattle.

           Then: MAGGIE SCREAMS.  Theo hops to his feet.  He runs

           AROUND THE VAN

           to find Maggie cowering, pulling her pants back up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        SOMETHING MOVED!

           Theo checks out the ground.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Over there!

           Theo doesn’t see anything.

                                 THEO
                        Probably a lizard, relax.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You relax.

           Maggie circles back around the van and gets in.

           Theo sighs, walks patiently

           BACK AROUND THE VAN

           Maggie in the back, arms folded.  Theo approaches kindly.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Can we just go?

                                 THEO
                        I seem to remember a little girl 
                        turning over rocks in the back yard 
                        to catch crickets.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m not a little girl anymore.

           Theo pauses.  He leans over, collects the map and pen, and 
           gets in the van.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t wanna go to Seattle.

                                 THEO
                        Not your call, Mags.

           Theo starts up the van.

           INT. NEVADA GAS STATION - DAY

           SECURITY CAMERA POV: the Proprietor sits behind the counter.  
           Quiet morning.  No one else in the store.

           Maggie enters.  The Proprietor looks up, gives her a little 
           wave.  She waves back.  She starts perusing the aisles, 
           keeping one eye on the Proprietor at all times.

           Maggie swipes a few protein bars from the rack and slips them 
           into her backpack.
                                 AGENT WARD (O.S.)
                        Would you look at that.

           ON AGENT WARD

           Watching the playback with Reeves on a laptop.

                                 AGENT REEVES
                        There’s more.  Wait.

           SURVEILLANCE TAPE

           Maggie slides a few more items into her bag, biding her time.

           When the Proprietor isn’t looking, she knocks two jugs of 
           wine off the shelf.  They shatter; wine splashes everywhere.

                                 AGENT REEVES (CONT’D)
                        Here it is.

           The Proprietor comes out.  Maggie apologizes profusely.  He 
           waves his hands, telling her to back away.

           Maggie does, and as the Proprietor deals with the spill, she 
           slips behind the counter, unseen.

           The Proprietor walks into the back room to fetch a mop.  
           Maggie opens the register, and madly empties it.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

           Agent Reeves pauses the recording.  They speak quietly.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        He never went in, never got a look 
                        at the layout?

           Reeves shakes his head.

                                 AGENT REEVES
                        She did, though, when she bought 
                        the coffee.  She would have seen 
                        how to open the register, 
                        everything.

           Ward stares at the frozen image of Maggie, mid-flight, 
           blurred beyond distinction.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Detective Ross gets out of her car.  News vans, check.  Nosy 
           neighbors, check.  She nods to the officers on her way up.
           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ross enters and finds Agent Ward.  She goes up to him and 
           hands him a manila envelope.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        What’s this?

           Ward opens the envelope, takes out the papers.  Mug shots, 
           rap sheets -- men we haven’t seen yet.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I have a friend in Seattle PD.  
                        These are the guys Waters used to 
                        run with.  And according to his 
                        cell, last Friday, he got a call 
                        from this man:

           She directs him to a specific mug shot: CHUCK PARSONS (40s)

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Charles Parsons.  Address and phone 
                        number are in there.  Should be 
                        enough for a tap.

                                 AGENT WARD
                             (reserved)
                        Good work, detective.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I know.  Is she up yet?

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           Bernadette pours herself another cup of coffee.  She looks 
           like hell, and the coffee isn’t helping.

           She glances to her side, sees Ross standing in the doorway.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I read the inventory of Maggie’s 
                        room last night.  Her backpack 
                        wasn’t on it.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        So?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        So, her school books were.  And 
                        I’ll bet if we went in her room 
                        right now, we’d find some clothes 
                        missing, too.
           Bernadette shrugs impatiently.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS (CONT’D)
                        When I was thirteen, I decided I 
                        wanted to live with my grandma.  So 
                        one night, I packed some clothes, 
                        snuck out and started hitchhiking 
                        to Palo Alto.  I made it as far as 
                        Davis before the police picked me 
                        up and took me home.  I thought I’d 
                        be in so much trouble, but my 
                        parents just thew their arms around 
                        me and cried.  I never tried to 
                        leave again.  I guess I just needed 
                        to know they’d miss me.

           Bernadette softens.  Ross is getting through.  She approaches 
           Bernadette gently.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS (CONT’D)
                        There are two ways to find 
                        somebody: either chase them down, 
                        or wait for them to come to you.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        If you’re asking where he’s taking 
                        her, I don’t know.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I’m more interested in where she 
                        might take him.

           Bernadette chews on the idea, and for a moment allows it in.  
           But then Randall enters, breaking their privacy.

                                 RANDALL
                        Everything okay?

           Bernadette’s defenses return.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (to Ross)
                        I don’t know what to tell you.

           Bernadette exits.  Randall eyes Ross shrewdly.

                                 RANDALL
                        Do you have a minute, detective?

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

           Randall pulls Ross into the first private room: the laundry 
           closet.  Underwear and bras hang out to dry.
                                 RANDALL
                        Here’s the thing.  I don’t know law 
                        enforcement; I’m a businessman.  I 
                        bring people to the table and get 
                        them to agree to terms.  Now, it 
                        seems to me that once you strip 
                        away all the rigmarole, this is a 
                        garden variety custody battle.  Am 
                        I right?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        You’re not entirely wrong.

                                 RANDALL
                        So lets stop trying to track him 
                        down, and instead incentivise him 
                        to come back.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Explain.

                                 RANDALL
                        Maggie is a wonderful girl, don’t 
                        get me wrong, but she can be a 
                        handful.  And her mom gets a little 
                        overwhelmed.  Theo clearly wants to 
                        see more of her, so why not offer 
                        him that?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Well, he’ll be in jail for the 
                        foreseeable future.

                                 RANDALL
                        I’m not saying laws haven’t been 
                        broken -- but what are we talking 
                        about in material damages?  A few 
                        thousand dollars?  I’ll write a 
                        check.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        That’s gonna be a tough sell.

                                 RANDALL
                        That’s why I’m talking to you and 
                        not the FBI.  If we partner up and 
                        solve this on the local level, 
                        we’ll have a better shot.  Now, 
                        she’ll never admit this, but 
                        Bernadette is happier when Maggie 
                        is with her father.  It’s like a 
                        weight is lifted.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RANDALL (CONT'D)
                        I love Bernadette, but I’ve been 
                        married a few times and I know that 
                        not every woman is cut out for 
                        motherhood.  Do you have children?

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        No.

                                 RANDALL
                        So you see my point.  I propose 
                        this: probationary custody.  Maggie 
                        lives with her father for the next 
                        six months while we resettle in 
                        Denver.  When the time is up, we 
                        regroup and decide on the next six.  
                        I think once heads clear the 
                        decision will be obvious.  
                        Birthdays and holidays negotiable, 
                        of course. 

           Ross pretends to mull it over.  She looks past Randall.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Bernadette, what do you think?

           Randall turns to find Bernadette standing behind him in the 
           doorway.  She’s heard more than enough.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Randall huffs out of the house carrying a bundle of his 
           clothes under one arm.  He goes to his car.

           Bernadette marches out a moment later and chucks a toothbrush 
           at the back of his head.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Take your G-D toothbrush!

           The news crew takes note of the development and stealthily 
           gets its cameras on the events.

           Randall quietly bends down and picks up his toothbrush.  
           Takes a moment to dust it off.  Looks her square in the eye.

                                 RANDALL
                        I was being honest.  You should try 
                        it.

           Randall gets into his car.  Bernadette shouts after him.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Two-faced asshole!
           Randall wastes no time starting up the car and driving away.

           Ross sees the news crew shooting the scene from the sidewalk.  
           She takes Bernadette by the shoulders and leads her inside.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Come on, let’s go.

           Bernadette, starting to sob, goes with her.

           EXT. NORTHERN OREGON GAS STATION - EVENING

           The numbers on the pump zoom upward and then CLICK -- they 
           stop.  $47.93.  Theo counts what’s left of the money.  Just 
           over fifty dollars.

           Maggie skips back to the van with more provisions: chips, 
           drinks, pre-packed sandwiches.

                                 THEO
                        Any change?

           She hands him a few coins.  She climbs into the van.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I think we should give ourselves 
                        new names.  I wanna be Abigail.  
                        Who do you wanna be?  I think 
                        Nate’s a cool name.  You could be 
                        an architect.

           He doesn’t answer.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Earth to Nate...

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

           Parked across the street from a Jack in the Box.  Theo stares 
           at the joint.  His eyes are steel.

           TITLE: ARMED ROBBERY, SECOND COUNT.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So what’s the plan?

                                 THEO
                        You stay here, keep the engine 
                        running.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I wanna go in.

                                 THEO
                        Absolutely not.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You said I could help.

                                 THEO
                        You’re helping by keeping the car 
                        running.

                                 MAGGIE
                        If you don’t let me go in, I’ll 
                        drive off and leave you here.

           He looks at his daughter; she’s dead serious.  He’s stuck.

           TITLE: RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT, FIRST COUNT

           INT. EASTERN OREGON JACK IN THE BOX - NIGHT

           A couple of TEENAGERS pay for their food, get their ticket 
           and step aside.  Theo steps up to the counter.

                                 REGISTER GIRL
                        Welcome to Jack in the Box, may I 
                        take your order?

                                 THEO
                        Small coffee.

           She rings it up.  Theo scans the back.  One employee at the 
           drive-thru window.  One at the fry station, another at the 
           burger station.  Register girl makes four.

           Door down a short hall marked “MANAGER”.

                                 REGISTER GIRL
                        Dollar twenty-five.

           Theo pays for the coffee.  She hands him the cup.

           He walks to the coffee urn to fill it.  Family in the corner.  
           Teens at the soda fountain.  A trucker scarfing a burger.

           And Maggie, alone by a window.  They make no eye contact.

           Theo takes his coffee to the table next to a door connecting 
           the dining room with the back.

           He takes a breath.
           UNDER THE TABLE

           Theo pulls a road flare out of his jacket.  He keeps it 
           unseen.  He waits.

           Register Girl leans into the mic.

                                 REGISTER GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Number 56.  56.

           Maggie gets up and goes to pick up her order.  She hands 
           Register Girl the ticket and takes the tray.

           She carries it to the soda fountain.  With her back to the 
           restaurant, she slyly takes an Alka-Seltzer tab out of her 
           pocket, rips open the wrapper and pops it in her mouth.

           She turns, starts walking to the tables.  Halfway, she 
           pauses.  Her eyes roll back in her head, her body becomes 
           rigid.  She drops the tray.

           People turn in time to see her fall, convulsing.

           The trucker responds first.  Then Register Girl bursts 
           through the door to the dining room, letting it swing wide.

           Theo slips out of his chair and grabs the door before it can 
           swing shut.  Road flare in one hand, he ducks into the back.

           ON MAGGIE

           In the throes of a massive seizure.  The Alka-Seltzer tab 
           creates a white froth, which she lets seep from her mouth.  
           The trucker tries to hold her still.

                                 TRUCKER
                        Jesus -- Hey -- little girl!
                             (calling)
                        Somebody call an ambulance!

           BACK AREA

           Theo, swift and silent, breezes behind the other employees, 
           whose attention is on the scene surrounding Maggie.

           As he closes in on the manager’s door, he pops the cap to the 
           flare.  Lights it.  The door opens, and the MANAGER (30s), 
           balding, comes out, concerned.

                                 MANAGER
                        What’s going on --

           Theo doesn’t slow down -- he grabs the manager by the throat 
           and pushes him backward into the office.
                                 THEO
                        This’ll be really easy.

           ON MAGGIE

           As her “seizure” abates.  She struggles to get to her feet.  
           Register Girl and the trucker try to keep her still.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Mommy...

                                 REGISTER GIRL
                             (to the crowd gathered)
                        Whose little girl is this?

                                 TRUCKER
                        Lay down, it’s okay.

           Maggie recoils from his touch.  Works up tears.

                                 MAGGIE
                        MAH-MEEE!

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SAME

           Theo wields the flare like a knife.  The Manager cowers.  The 
           room fills with acrid smoke.

                                 THEO
                        Open the safe and give me the drop.

                                 MANAGER
                        What drop?

           Theo swipes the brilliant red flame just past his nose.

                                 THEO
                        It’s Sunday night, I want the 
                        weekend drop!

           The manager nods, then kneels down to open the safe.

           BACK AREA

           One of the employees knocks on the manager’s door.

                                 EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                        Kevin, come out, man.  Some kid 
                        fell down.

           MANAGER’S OFFICE

           The manager looks at Theo, who is in no mood.
                                 MANAGER
                        ...Just a second!

           DINING ROOM

           Maggie gets to her feet, wobbles, falls back down.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I need my medicine -- my mommy has 
                        my medicine!

                                 TRUCKER
                             (genuinely shaken)
                        For God’s sake, who’s kid is this!?

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SAME

           The room is thick with smoke.  Both men choke on every 
           breath.  The manager hands over the deposit bag.

                                 MANAGER
                        Here -- just don’t hurt me.

                                 THEO
                        Unlock it.

           The manager finds his loop of keys, and locates the small 
           brass key that unlocks the canvas bag.

           As he does so, Theo glances at the manager’s computer screen.  
           The wallpaper is a picture of the manager with his LITTLE 
           DAUGHTER, about 3, looking as happy as a man can look.

           Then: AAAAK -- AAAAK -- AAAAK --  The fire alarm.

           DINING ROOM

           The overhead sprinklers kick on, dousing everyone.  The 
           teenagers scream and run.  Everyone heads for the exits.

           Maggie pulls away from Register Girl in the confusion.

           EXT. NORTHERN OREGON JACK IN THE BOX - NIGHT

           The restaurant empties.  In the melee, Maggie separates 
           herself from Register Girl and breaks into a sprint.

           Register Girl looks around for Maggie, but can’t find her.
           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           The engine idles on the side of the road.  Through the open 
           side door we see Maggie push through a row of tall hedges and 
           run up to the car.  She practically leaps inside.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That was RAD!

           And then she realizes her dad isn’t in there.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SAME

           Water sprays all over the office, soaking everything, soaking 
           the two men.  Only the flare is unaffected.

           The manager holds out the unlocked canvas bag.

                                 MANAGER
                        Here.  Take it.

           Theo pauses.  Water streams into his eyes.

                                 THEO
                        Let’s see some push-ups.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           Maggie stares out  at the back of the restaurant.  Itching.  
           Every second an eternity.

           EXT. NORTHERN OREGON JACK IN THE BOX, REAR - SAME

           The back door flies open and Theo bolts out.  He drops the 
           flare and pushes through the hedges.

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           Maggie sees her father and finally breathes.  She moves out 
           of the way just as he lunges into the van.

           He scrambles to the front seat.  Maggie pulls the door shut.

                                 THEO
                        Are you okay?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah -- you?
           Without a word Theo slams on the gas.  The mini-van peels 
           out.  They’re off.

           INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE - SAME

           The manager struggles to do his push-ups as the sprinklers 
           continue to douse him.

                                 MANAGER
                        Eight...  Nine...

           He looks back cautiously.  Theo is gone.  He stops doing the 
           push-ups and gets to his feet.

           Right away he sees the canvas bag on his desk.  He picks it 
           up and looks inside.  It’s stuffed with cash.

           INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

           On the highway.  Theo watches the mirrors.  Maggie rides 
           shotgun, bouncing in her seat.

                                 MAGGIE
                        They totally believed me -- that 
                        one big guy was fully scared -- I 
                        almost felt bad -- how much’d we 
                        get?

                                 THEO
                        I don’t know.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Give it to me, I’ll count it.

                                 THEO
                        Not now, I need to concentrate.

           Theo compulsively taps the wheel.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        This car’s burned.  We gotta find 
                        another way north.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Can we take one with seats that go 
                        all the way back?

                                 THEO
                        No.  No more stealing.  That’s it, 
                        it’s over.  We’re done.

           Maggie, thrown by her father’s seriousness, treads lightly.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay... We’ll take a bus.  We can 
                        fly first class if we want to.

           Theo says nothing.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           ON TV: the Jack-in-the-Box, surrounded by law enforcement.

                        Witnesses say the girl apparently 
                        suffered a seizure during the 
                        robbery. 

           Security camera footage shows Maggie having her “seizure”.

                        hospitals and emergency clinics.

           Bernadette watches, numb.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        That’s how she gets out of tests.

           Agent Ward glances outside, sees the news crews buzzing.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Do you feel comfortable making 
                        another statement?  There’s a good 
                        chance he’ll be watching.

           She looks out the window, but this time, she shakes her head.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I need to lay down.

           INT. REST STOP DINER - NIGHT

           Loud truck stop, full-swing.  Theo and Maggie in a booth.  
           Maggie chows down her burger.  Theo’s plate is untouched.
           His eyes dart around, checking for anyone who may be 
           watching.  Nothing but disinterested truckers in the place.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dad, calm down.  You look like you 
                        just robbed a Jack-in-the-Box.

           Theo can’t help chuckling.  He looks at her easy manner, 
           admiring it.

                                 THEO
                        Why aren’t you nervous?

                                 MAGGIE
                        ‘Cause I’m with you.

           Theo pauses.

                                 THEO
                        Listen.  Hey.  Put down the burger 
                        a second.

           She does.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been doing a lot of thinking 
                        last few months, you know, going 
                        over my life, and seeing how I’ve 
                        hurt people.  Truth is, I’ve hurt 
                        just about everyone I’ve ever met.  
                        You especially.  I’m sorry I’ve 
                        been gone so much.  I missed a big 
                        chunk of your life, and I don’t 
                        want to miss another one.

           Maggie nods, not really sure how to respond.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Do you forgive me?

           Again, she nods, pro-forma.  Theo, unburdened, finally takes 
           a bite.  But the bee is in Maggie’s bonnet now.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why did you stop letting me come 
                        visit you?

           Theo pauses.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        That was really mean.  I wanted to 
                        see you.
                                 THEO
                        That was no place for a little 
                        girl.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Stop calling me that.

           Then his eyes move to the television, where he sees his mug 
           shot staring back at him.  They’re on the news.

                                 THEO
                        Finish up, we gotta to get going.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tell me.

           He gestures with his eyes to the TV.  She turns, sees the 
           images on the screen.  She understands.

           INT. REST STOP DINER - NIGHT

           Theo and Maggie walk up to the front counter.  Theo tries not 
           to look at the TV as he passes it.

                                 THEO
                        I’ll pay, I’ll meet you outside.

           Theo nods, Maggie heads out the front door.

           Theo walks to the register where a HOSTESS greets him with a 
           half-hearted nod.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Bathroom?

           She twitches in the direction of the mens room.  Theo walks

           DOWN THE CORRIDOR

           Three doors: one for men, one for women, and another marked 
           EMERGENCY EXIT: ALARM WILL SOUND.

           Theo glances over his shoulder.  Alone.  He takes a breath, 
           bracing himself for an alarm, and pushes open then emergency 
           exit.  Silence.  He slips out.

           EXT. REST STOP DINER - NIGHT

           Maggie waits for her dad just outside the diner.  She’s 
           surprised to hear him call her from behind the building.
                                 THEO
                        Maggie!

           He waves her over.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are you doing over there?

                                 THEO
                        Come on.

           Theo walks briskly toward tractor trailers parked beyond the 
           restaurant.  Maggie trots to keep up.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP. BIG-RIG PARKING - CONTINUOUS

           Theo walks down the row of trucks, checking each rig.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Are we going to steal a truck?

                                 THEO
                        I said no more stealing.

           He stops at a flatbed hauling giant machine parts wrapped 
           under tarp.  He lifts a flap, looks for a place to hide.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Then what are you looking for?

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        A ride.

           Maggie peeks in.  She makes out giant pieces of iron.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Can’t we catch a bus?

                                 THEO
                        Too risky, there’s gonna be road 
                        blocks up and down every highway.

           Theo can’t find a decent hiding place and moves on.  He spies 
           something promising up ahead, and aims for it.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           She follows.  They reach a big rig hauling a section of a 
           modular home.  A banner hangs off the rear: “OVER-SIZED LOAD”
           Theo crouches down and makes his way to the front of the 
           modular home.  A little porch is there, and a front door.  He 
           hops up and gives the knob a try.  It’s open.

           He pushes the door open, and with a grin, waves Maggie up.  
           She doesn’t move.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m not going in there.  How do we 
                        know where it’s going?

                                 THEO
                        We don’t.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I vote bus.

           Theo, antsy, weighs whether to tell her.

                                 THEO
                        We don’t have any money.

           News to Maggie.

           Theo hears voices approaching.  Boots shuffling against the 
           pavement.  No time to explain.  Theo grabs Maggie by the arm 
           and pulls her up on the porch.

           Maggie lets out a little squeal in protest, and Theo covers 
           her mouth.  He pulls her inside the modular home.

           INT. MODULAR HOME ON WHEELS - INTERCUT

           Theo shuts the door as quietly as possible.  He signals to 
           Maggie to be perfectly quiet. 

           Now inside the modular home, Theo turns -- and discovers that 
           one of walls isn’t there.  It’s covered with clear plastic, 
           stretched tight as a drum.

           OUTSIDE THE MODULAR HOME

           A TRUCK DRIVER (40s) turns and walks down the length of the 
           modular home, following the sound of Maggie’s squeal.

           INSIDE

           Theo and Maggie do not move.  They watch the Truck Driver’s 
           head bob past the clear plastic wall, hoping against hope he 
           doesn’t look inside.

           OUTSIDE
           The Truck Driver looks around his rig, but doesn’t check 
           inside the home.  Satisfied, he walks to the cab and gets in.

           INSIDE

           Theo and Maggie let out a relieved sigh.  The big rig’s 
           engine fires up and idles.

           Theo looks around the place.  The living room is completely 
           exposed.  At the far end, a small kitchen provides cover.

           Theo pulls Maggie into the bare kitchen.  No appliances, no 
           cabinet doors.  They squat on the floor.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where’s the money?

                                 THEO
                        I didn’t take it.

           She can’t fathom this.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I said no more stealing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Then how did you pay for dinner?

           Silence, save the rumble of the truck, the hiss of the air 
           brakes being released.

                                 THEO
                        From now on.  No more stealing from 
                        now on.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why didn’t you take the money!?

                                 THEO
                        Because I’m trying to set a good 
                        example!

           The whole home shudders as the rig heaves forward, pulling 
           out of the stall.  Maggie still cannot believe her ears.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I know all this seems exciting, 
                        and... and better than sitting in 
                        some classroom -- but this is no 
                        way to live, do you understand?  
                        You can’t just take whatever you 
                        want whenever you want it.

           Maggie stands up and crosses into the living room.
                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  Someone’s gonna see you!

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t care.

           She sits with her back against one of the actual walls, 
           glaring at her father.

                                 THEO
                        You’ll understand one day when you 
                        have kids.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You don’t want to take care of me -- 
                        just admit it!

                                 THEO
                        That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do!

                                 MAGGIE
                        So what are you waiting for!

           He has no answer.  The distance between them is significant, 
           and for now, unbridgeable.

           INT. MAGGIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           ON TV: The lake house.  The family enjoys each other.  Little 
           Maggie blows out the candles.  Kisses for everyone.

           ON BERNADETTE

           Sitting on Maggie’s bed, cradling one of her daughter’s 
           stuffed animals, watching the memories on TV.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. MODULAR HOME ON WHEELS - MORNING

           Theo shakes Maggie awake.

                                 THEO
                        We stopped.

           EXT. DIESEL STATION - MORNING

           Theo inches open the front door and peeks out.  They’re at a 
           gas station, one of many just off the highway.  He makes sure 
           all is clear, then leads Maggie out.
           The two of them hop down off the modular home and start 
           walking toward the main road.

           INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM - MORNING

           Theo flushes the urinal, goes to the sink.

           Theo looks at himself in the mirror.  He’s scraggly and 
           tired.  He turns on the hot water.  Takes off his shirt.  
           Proceeds to wash his pits.

           INT. CHUCK PARSON’S KITCHEN - DAY

           CHUCK PARSON [we recognize him from the earlier mug shot] 
           smokes pot from a Seattle Space Needle bong, and eats Froot 
           Loops.  His physical appearance reflects this.

           The house phone rings.

                                 CHUCK
                             (calling)
                        Ma, the phone...

                                 MA (O.S.)
                             (calling back)
                        I’m in the tub!

           The phone continues to ring.  Chuck drags himself across the 
           kitchen and answers it.

                                 CHUCK
                        Chinese Embassy.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - INTERCUT

           Theo talks on the pay phone outside the bathrooms. 

                                 THEO
                        Chuck, it’s Theo.

           Chuck searches for the name, comes up blank.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Theo Waters.

                                 CHUCK
                             (clicking)
                        Hey, man... I didn’t think I’d hear 
                        back from you.
                                 THEO
                        You still have work for me?

                                 CHUCK
                        Always, bro.  It’s goin’ off up 
                        here.  You comin’ up?

                                 THEO
                        I’m already here.  I’m at the Pike, 
                        staring up at the Needle as we 
                        speak.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The FBI agents listen astutely to the conversation.

                                 THEO (PHONE FILTER)
                        You still at the same place?

                                 CHUCK (PHONE FILTER)
                        Yeah.

                                 THEO (PHONE FILTER)
                        See you there in a couple hours.

           Theo hangs up.  Call dies.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Notify the Seattle field office, 
                        tell them we’re on our way.  I’m 
                        not letting the locals lose them 
                        this time.

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MORNING

           Theo comes out and finds Maggie staring at the decals in the 
           window: a foot long hot-dog, chili cheese fries, egg 
           burritos, you name it.

                                 THEO
                        Quit torturing yourself.  Let’s get 
                        to work.

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Theo humbly approaches a FATHER pumping gas.
                                 THEO
                        Excuse me, I hate to bother you, 
                        but my daughter and I are trying to 
                        get to Portland, and I lost my 
                        wallet, and we need to get some 
                        cash together to fill up the car.

                                 FATHER
                        Sorry.

                                 THEO
                        I’ll pay you back as soon as we --

           The father waves him off.  Theo backs away.  He walks back 
           over to Maggie, who sits on the curb, doing a Sudoku, 
           thermometer in her mouth.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So let me get this straight, 
                        stealing is wrong, but lying and 
                        begging is okay?

           Theo ignores the jab.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What side is your appendix on?

                                 THEO
                        ...Left, I think.  Why?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Mine hurts.

           Again, he tries to ignore her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’s my ulcer.  How much of 
                        your own blood can you digest 
                        before you get sick?

           Theo takes out some of the wadded bills he’s already 
           collected, and gives her a few.

                                 THEO
                        Here.

           She looks at the paltry take.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Gee, thanks.  Half a bag of chips, 
                        here I come.

           Maggie goes into the convenience store.  As she goes in, she 
           passes an affable-looking MAN on his way out.
           The man glances at her, then does a double-take.  He pauses, 
           just outside the store.  Then he turns, and sees Theo by the 
           pumps, shaking down another mark.

                                 THEO
                        Thanks anyway.  God bless.

           The Man walks up to Theo and lingers a few feet away.  Theo 
           glances his way, nods, but keeps his eyes to himself.  To his 
           chagrin, the Man does not keep walking.  Theo gets cagey.

                                 MAN AT STATION
                        Excuse me...?

           Theo pretends not to hear.

                                 MAN AT STATION (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           Theo has no choice but to turn.

                                 MAN AT STATION (CONT’D)
                        Are you stranded?

                                 THEO
                        Um... yeah.  Yeah, I’m trying to 
                        get to Portland with my kid.  Lost 
                        my wallet.

                                 MAN AT STATION
                        Which car is yours?

           Theo, on the spot, points out a junky sedan by the air pump.

                                 THEO
                        That one, there.

           As the man looks at the car, the car’s OWNER walks up to it 
           and gets in.  Drives away.  Theo hangs his head.

           The man simply smiles, amused.

                                 MAN AT STATION
                        Shouldn’t you try to stop him?

                                 THEO
                        Look, what do you want?

                                 MAN AT STATION
                        I know it’s none of my business, 
                        but I’m not the only one who reads 
                        the paper.  You two shouldn’t be 
                        out in broad daylight like this.
           Theo swallows.

                                 MAN AT STATION (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  I won’t say anything.  
                        I get it.  I have an ex-wife, too.

           Theo looks at him, sizes this guy up.

                                 MAN AT STATION (CONT’D)
                        Forrest.  Forrest Decatur.

           He offers his hand.  Theo hesitates, then shakes.

                                 THEO
                        Theo.

                                 FORREST
                        Where are you headed, really?

                                 THEO
                        Canada.

           Forrest thinks it over.

                                 FORREST
                        I can get you close.

           INT. RV - DAY

           Forrest opens up the side door and presents the RV to Theo 
           and Maggie.  He lets her climb up first.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Coo-uhl!

           Maggie starts exploring right away.  The place is sweet 
           inside: full kitchen, living and dining area.  Bunks over the 
           cab, a real luxury ride.

                                 FORREST
                        Step right up, step right up, make 
                        yourself at home.

           Theo shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 THEO
                        This is... This is too much.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No it’s not.

           Maggie discovers the bathroom and shower.
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        No way -- a shower!  Does it work?

                                 FORREST
                        Water comes out and everything.  
                        Get yourselves clean up, and we’ll 
                        get on the road.

           That’s enough for Maggie, who ducks into the bathroom and 
           turns on the shower.

                                 THEO
                        Let me pay you back, when I get on 
                        my feet.

                                 FORREST
                        If it makes you feel better...  
                        C’mon, let me show you the cockpit.

           Forrest leads Theo to the front of the massive RV.

           EXT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The FBI agents come out, along with most of the police.  The 
           news vans smell something afoot, and try to get answers.

           Ward and the others ignore the press, and get into the 
           Suburban.  The news vans follow.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Bernadette sits on the sofa, waiting for everyone to leave.  
           The room, for the first time, is quiet.

           Detective Ross approaches, and hands her a business card.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        We’ll leave a unit here, just in 
                        case.  If you need anything, that’s 
                        my direct line.  Day or night.

           Bernadette takes the card.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I’m sorry I lost my temper.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        No apology necessary.  Good luck, 
                        Ms. Stanley.

           Ross starts out.
                                 BERNADETTE
                        Do you think Randall was right?  
                        Some people shouldn’t be parents?

           Ross pauses, considers her answer.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I think we all do the best we can.

           Bernadette lowers her eyes.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        They have fun.  I can’t remember 
                        the last time she had fun with me.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        There’s more to being a parent than 
                        having fun.

           Bernadette chuckles to herself, takes a deep breath.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I don’t think they’re in Seattle.

           Ross isn’t surprised to hear this.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        You asked me where she might take 
                        him.  My aunt has a cabin in 
                        Klamath Falls, on a lake.  She’s in 
                        a nursing home, she never uses it.  
                        We used to go up there all the 
                        time, before Maggie.  We took her a 
                        few times, too, when she was 
                        little.  It’s always been a special 
                        place for us.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        How sure are you?

           EXT. WASHINGTON HIGHWAY - DAY

           The RV thunders down the highway, dwarfing every other car.

           INT. RV, KITCHEN AREA - DAY

           Maggie makes lunch for the three of them.  She has to steady 
           herself against the counter while she slices the sandwiches.
           INT. RV, COCKPIT - SAME

           Forrest commands the vehicle from his swiveling, climate-
           controlled throne.  Theo rides shotgun, watching the horizon.

                                 FORREST
                        Would you call yourself a glass-
                        half-full, or a glass-half-empty 
                        kind of person?

                                 THEO
                        Depends.  What’s in the glass?

           Forrest chuckles, shoots him with a finger-pistol.

                                 FORREST
                        I’m a glass-half-full man myself.  
                        I’ve been on the road better part 
                        of eighteen months, and every 
                        morning I say to God, “Okay, 
                        brother --  I’ll work the pedals, 
                        you steer.”  Got a pass to every 
                        KOA in the country, so I get to 
                        meet good people, share stories -- 
                        don’t worry, my lips are sealed 
                        about you two.

           He gives Theo a knowing wink.

                                 FORREST (CONT’D)
                        It gets lonely sometimes, but I 
                        wouldn’t trade it.  I did the 
                        mortgage-wife-kid thing.  It wasn’t 
                        me.  “To thine own self be true.”  
                        Hamlet said that.

           Maggie comes up with the sandwiches.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Here you go.

                                 THEO
                        Thanks, Mags.

                                 FORREST
                        Thank you very much, looks 
                        delicious.  I can’t remember the 
                        last time I had someone cook for 
                        me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How much longer?

           Forrest checks the odometer.
                                 FORREST
                        Couple more hours.  Why don’t you 
                        hop up top and get some rest?  You 
                        look shagged out.

                                 THEO
                             (yawning)
                        I might join you.  Feels like I 
                        haven’t slept in a month.

                                 FORREST
                        I’m wide as the Nile.  Make 
                        yourselves comfortable.

           Theo and Maggie silently confer and decide it’s okay.  Maggie 
           climbs up top.

                                 FORREST (CONT’D)
                             (to Theo)
                        It’s a little tight up there for 
                        two.  You can use the pull-out.

                                 THEO
                        You sure you don’t mind?

                                 FORREST
                        Not at all.  Get some Zs.  And the 
                        bar’s stocked, by the way.  Help 
                        yourself.

                                 THEO
                        Hmm?

                                 FORREST
                        Said the bar’s stocked.  Help 
                        yourself.

                                 THEO
                        ...Thanks.

           Theo gets up and leaves the cockpit.  Forrest continues to 
           drive, content at the wheel.

           RV, BUNK BED

           Maggie sets herself up in the bunk.  Cramped, but 
           comfortable.  A narrow window looks out over the highway 
           ahead.  She spends a few moments looking out.

           RV, PULL-OUT BED

           Theo pulls the hide-a-bed out from its compartment.  Has a 
           seat, directly facing the fully-stocked bar Forrest boasted.
           Whiskey.  Scotch.  Vodka.  Gin.  Top-shelf, all.  Pristine hi-
           ball glasses in a row, sparkling.

           Theo glances at the cockpit.  Forrest drives.  He looks up at 
           the loft bed.  Maggie has pulled the curtains shut.  He is 
           alone.

           He reaches for a bottle of Glen Morangie 18 year.  Admires 
           the label.  Pulls the cork.  Closes his eyes, smells deeply, 
           and is transported.

           Theo opens his eyes.  Chuckles to himself, and plugs the jug.  
           He puts the bottle back, and reclines on the bed.

           He stares at the ceiling, and soon, drifts off to sleep.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. RV, BUNK BED - HOURS LATER

           Maggie sleeps, dead to the world.  The RV has stopped moving, 
           the engine is silent.

           A few moments go by, and then an ARM adjusts itself, moving 
           tighter around her shoulder.

           REVEAL: Forrest, spooning her.  Eyes closed, but awake.

           Maggie stirs.  She turns her head.  Forrest, feeling her 
           move, is quick to clasp his hand over her mouth.

                                 FORREST
                        Shhh... Don’t move, it’s okay.

           Maggie struggles against him, trying to scream through his 
           fingers.  He folds the pillow over her face to muffle the 
           sound -- and potentially suffocate her.

                                 FORREST (CONT’D)
                        I just want to hold you.

           ON THEO

           Sleeping in the pull-out in the rear of the RV.  The muffled 
           noises from the bunk barely reach him.

           ON FORREST

           Fighting a bucking Maggie in his arms.  She kicks at the 
           narrow window -- the first significant noise she can make.

           ON THEO
           Rolling over in his sleep, covering his head with the pillow.

           ON FORREST

           Getting angrier, more frantic.

                                 FORREST (CONT’D)
                             (raspy whisper)
                        Stay still!

           Maggie manages to get a hand up to the pillow.  She pulls it 
           away to just expose her nose and steal some air.

           Then: TWO HANDS grab Forrest and yank him backwards.

           Theo pulls Forrest down to the floor.  Maggie nearly tumbles 
           out, but is able to keep from falling.  She screams.

           Theo starts wailing on Forrest.  His fists beat down on the 
           older man, one after the other, like pistons in a massive 
           internal combustion engine.

           Forrest flails his arms over his face, barely shielding 
           himself from the beating.

                                 FORREST (CONT’D)
                        STOP!  PLEASE!  I’M SORRY!

           Theo rains pain on the man until Forrest can’t even cry out.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Stop!

           Theo doesn’t stop.  This is his mission.

           Maggie leaps down and grabs her father from behind.  He 
           shakes her free to pummel Forrest some more.

           Maggie tries again, slings one of her arms around her 
           father’s in a sort of half-nelson.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re hurting him!

           Theo, off balance, growing tired, glances a few more blows 
           off Forrest’s body.

           Maggie finally succeeds in pulling him off.

           Forrest, his face a blood mess, is still conscious.  His 
           chest heaves up and down.  He groans.

           Theo looks at his daughter.
                                 THEO
                        What did he do -- did he touch you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.

                                 THEO
                        DID HE TOUCH YOU!

           Forrest starts to cough.  Blood and phlegm spurts out.  This 
           momentarily grabs Theo and Maggie’s attention.  He’s CHOKING.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Help him!

           Theo quickly turns him on his side, and pats his back hard, 
           to help him cough up whatever he’s choking on.

           Forrest gags.  His legs lock.  His head cranes back.

           Theo picks him up, and starts giving him the Heimlich.

           Forrest does not breathe.  His tongue juts from his mangled 
           face.  His arms flail, grabbing at the air, grabbing at his 
           throat.  Nothing works.

           He convulses one last time, then he goes limp in Theo’s arms.

           Theo doesn’t give up.  He lays Forrest on his back, and gives 
           him mouth to bloody mouth.

                                 THEO
                        Fucking breathe!

           He compresses the man’s chest, leaning over him, driving his 
           entire weight down.  One.  Two.  Three.  Four.

           Blood spatters upward as the obstruction dislodges, and falls 
           on the floor -- A TOOTH.

           Theo continues trying to revive him.  One.  Two.  Three.  
           Four.  Breathe.  One.  Two.  Three.  Four.  Breathe.

           But it isn’t working.  Forrest is dead.

           TITLE: MANSLAUGHTER, SINGLE COUNT.

           Theo, panting, exhausted, turns to Maggie, who has witnessed 
           every violent second.  They look deeply into each other’s 
           eyes, but neither can speak.

           Then: a knock at the door.

           They whip their heads toward the sound.
           Another knock, followed by a voice.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, neighbor, everything all right 
                        in there?

           Theo moves stealthily to the nearest window, inches open the 
           curtain and peeks outside.

           A third knock, then a try at the handle.

                                 THEO
                             (calling)
                        Just a second...

           Theo steps over Forrest’s body to get to the kitchen sink.  
           He turns on the water and hastily rinses his hands and face.

           He directs Maggie to the very back of the RV.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Coming...

           Theo braces himself, then carefully opens the door a crack.

           Standing next to the RV, a pink-faced man in a UW sweatshirt.

                                 UW MAN
                        We heard some commotion, are you 
                        all right?

                                 THEO
                        Fine.  Thank you.  That was... We 
                        had a little accident.  Problem 
                        with the... thing.

           Theo looks around outside.  They’re at a:

           EXT. KOA CAMPGROUND - SAME

           RVs parked in a long row around a meadow, surrounded by 
           woods.  BBQs and campfires ablaze.

                                 THEO
                        I think we got it under control.
                             (calling inside)
                        Abby, do we need anything?

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        No.
                                 THEO
                        My daughter.  We’re headed east to 
                        see family.

                                 UW MAN
                        Well, like I said, we’re right over 
                        there.  We’re toasting up s’mores 
                        you want to join us.

                                 THEO
                        We just might do that.
                             (calling in)
                        Abby, s’mores sound good?

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        I’m not hungry.

           Theo shrugs.

                                 THEO
                        She might change her mind.  Thanks 
                        for the offer.

                                 UW MAN
                        Welcome.  All right then.  Glad 
                        everything’s okay.

           UW Man takes his leave.  Theo shuts the door.

           INT. RV - SAME

           Theo bolts the door shut, then returns his eyes to the dim 
           interior, the dead man, and Maggie.

           Theo walks over to Forrest’s body, looks down at him for a 
           moment.  Swallows.

           He opens the bathroom door.

           EXT. KOA CAMPGROUND - EVENING

           Forrest’s RV roars to life.  With Theo at the helm, it slowly 
           rolls back out of its stall, and drives away.

           The UW Man, now back with his family around their pit fire, 
           watches the camper lumber back toward the main gate.

           INT. RV, COCKPIT - SAME

           Theo gets the feel for the RV’s handling as he pulls out of 
           the campground and onto a local road.
           Maggie sits shotgun.  She turns a little, stealing a peek at 
           the bathroom door, and what she knows is inside.

                                 THEO
                        Don’t look.

           Maggie puts her eyes back on the road.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are we going to do?

                                 THEO
                        I don’t know, I have to think.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where are we going?

                                 THEO
                        I don’t know.

           A long, long silence.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I wanna go home.

           Theo’s heart breaks.  Maggie turns and stares out her window.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           The RV is parked in the shadows, outside a neon titty bar.

           Maggie lays on the RV’s roof, looking up at the stars.  The 
           sky is remarkably clear.

           INT. RV - SAME

           Theo finds Forrest’s cell phone in the cockpit.

           EXT. BACK PORCH - INTERCUT

           Bernadette smokes a cigarette, looking off.  Her cell rings.  
           She doesn’t recognize the number.  She answers it.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Hello?

                                 THEO
                        I’ll keep this short, I know we’re 
                        on a party line.
                                 BERNADETTE
                        No one’s listening, Theo.  They all 
                        went to Seattle.

           Theo considers whether to believe her.

                                 THEO
                        She wants to go home.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        She said that?

                                 THEO
                        Yeah.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Can I talk to her?

                                 THEO
                        Now’s not a good time.  How soon 
                        can you get to the cabin?

                                 BERNADETTE
                        If I leave now, six hours.

                                 THEO
                        Can you do that?  We’ll meet you 
                        there in the morning.  And no cops.  
                        If I even smell a cop, I swear to 
                        God, we’re gone.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I know.  Put her on.  Please?

           Theo considers it.

           EXT. RV - NIGHT

           Maggie stares up at the sky.  A shooting star blazes across 
           the black, and burns out.

           She hears her father come out of the RV and call up.

                                 THEO (O.S.)
                        Your mom wants to talk to you.

           She thinks it over, then rolls onto her belly and scoots to 
           the edge of the roof.  Theo hands up the phone.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey, mom.
                                 BERNADETTE
                        Hey, baby.  Hi.  Are you okay?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (disaffected)
                        Yeah.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        I miss you.  Baby, honey, I know 
                        that things haven’t been great 
                        between us lately, but that’s going 
                        to change.  I left Randall.  We’re 
                        not getting married.  We’re not 
                        moving.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (confused)
                        ...Okay.  I gotta go.  Bye, mom.

           Maggie drops the phone to Theo.

                                 THEO
                        See you in the morning.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Theo?  I just wanted to say... I’m 
                        sorry.  I’ll try to be a better 
                        mom.

                                 THEO
                             (equally confused)
                        ...We’ll talk about it later.

           Theo hangs up.  Bernadette winces a little as the line dies.

           REVEAL: Detective Ross standing with her.  Just behind them: 

           THE LAKE HOUSE

           They’re already up there.  Waiting.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        They’re on their way.

           Detective Ross gives an encouraging smile, but Bernadette’s 
           nerves aren’t so easily calmed.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        She’ll never forgive me for this.

                                 ROSS
                        You don’t have to be here if you 
                        don’t want to.
           Bernadette considers it.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        No, I’ll stay.

           EXT. ROADSIDE STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

           A bumper sticker on a cheap Corolla reads: STRIPPERS DO IT 
           FROM POLE TO POLE.  Theo swings a pipe wrench into the back 
           window -- CRASH!

           TITLE: AUTO THEFT, THIRD COUNT

           INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

           Theo drives them away.  He notices a lacy pink garter hanging 
           from the rear-view and snatches it off.

           As he accelerates, the wind whips through the broken window.  
           To Theo’s dismay, Maggie takes her temperature.

                                 THEO
                        What’d your mom say?

           She shrugs.  Her hair flutters around her face.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want you to visit because 
                        I was ashamed.  I didn’t want you 
                        seeing me like that.  I’m sorry.

           She just stares out the window, thermometer in her mouth.  
           Her silence is torture.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. THE LAKE - MORNING

           The sun peeks over the hills; the still water glistens.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

           Bernadette sits at the kitchen table with a steaming cup of 
           coffee.  The clock ticks.  She waits.

           INT. STATE TROOPER CRUISER - MORNING

           Two OREGON STATE TROOPERS lay in wait, their car obscured by 
           trees.  They watch the house and road for approaching cars.
           EXT. LAKE TOWN, MAIN STREET - MORNING

           The stripper’s Corolla rattles through the sleepy town.  Bait 
           shop, boat rental, a diner, a sundry store.  Not much else.

           INT. COROLLA - SAME

           Theo’s eyes probe for anything out of the ordinary.  Maggie 
           looks out the window, less concerned over police.

           He pulls to a gentle stop at a blinking red traffic light, a 
           four-way stop.

           His is the only car on the road.  Yet he doesn’t pull 
           forward.  A few seconds pass.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are you waiting for?

           Theo looks side to side, looking for more than just traffic.

                                 THEO
                        This is the only light in town.  
                        There’s usually a cop sitting right 
                        there.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So...

                                 THEO
                        So where is he?

           Then, behind him: two quick beeps from a horn.  He glances in 
           the mirror, sees a pickup back there.

           He pulls forward, suspicious as hell.

           EXT. TRAIL HEAD - MORNING

           Theo parks at the base of a trail leading into the woods.    
           They get out and approach the house on foot.

           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           The trail is steep, but passable.  Theo gives he daughter a 
           hand to step up a tricky grade.

           He stops atop a ridge, and looks down onto the

           LAKE HOUSE
           It’s fifty yards or so ahead.  But he can make out just 
           enough to see the Trooper unit waiting to nab him.

                                 THEO
                        Damn it, Bernie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll go alone.

                                 THEO
                        You do that, this town’ll be in 
                        lock down.  I need more time.

           Theo takes out the phone again and dials.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE, KITCHEN - INTERCUT

           Bernadette answers her cell.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Theo?

                                 THEO
                        We’re still an hour out.  Let’s 
                        meet at the diner -- we could use 
                        some breakfast.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        ...Why don’t you just come here, I 
                        can make us all something...

                                 THEO
                        We want diner food.

           Theo hangs up.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - MORNING

           State Troopers and local police seem to come out from every 
           possible hiding place.  Among the authorities, Agent Ward and 
           the rest of the FBI team.

           EXT. WOODS - SAME

           Theo and Maggie watch the mass exodus from a distance.
           EXT. WINDING ROAD - MORNING

           Theo and Maggie venture out of the woods down the street from 
           the house.  He peers up the road and sees a single unmarked 
           unit left behind.  Two cops inside.

           Theo points out some hedges across the street to Maggie, then 
           signals her to run for it.

           Maggie bolts across the street, full sprint, and slides 
           behind the hedges safely.

           Theo watches the unmarked unit.  No sign they saw her.

           Now it’s Theo’s turn.  He runs across the street, crashing 
           into the hedges and hitting the ground.

           INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR - SAME

           The COP behind the wheel glances in the rear-view an instant 
           after Theo disappears from it.

           EXT. WINDING ROAD - SAME

           Satisfied they didn’t arouse police attention, Theo leads 
           Maggie through the front yard and over the six-foot fence.

           EXT. LAKE SHORE - MORNING

           Theo and Maggie slip along the rocky shore of the small lake, 
           negotiating the moss and lapping water.  Theo’s eyes are on 
           the back of the lake house.  No one’s there.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE, BACK PORCH - MORNING

           Theo and Maggie creep up the steps from the dock all the way 
           to the back door.  Theo cups his hands over his eyes and 
           looks inside.  All clear.

           He moves the planter box beside the door.  A house key, dull 
           with age, looks up at him.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Theo unlocks the door and lets them both in.  Maggie enters 
           and looks around.  Theo comes in quietly behind her.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s smaller than I remember.
           Theo can’t help but revisit a few memories, and lose himself.

                                 THEO
                        They’ll be back soon, you just wait 
                        here.

           He waits for her to nod, agree, something.  He gets nothing.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call soon as I can.

           An uncomfortable pause.  He goes to hug her.  It’s awkward.  
           Not the healing he’d hoped it’d be.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t how I wanted this to 
                        turn out, Mags.  I’m sorry.

           He kisses the top of her head, and lets her go.  He can’t 
           look her in the eyes for long.  He turns and walks out.

           Maggie watches as the door closes on her.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE, BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Theo huffs back tears as he walks back down the steps.  Then: 
           Maggie comes out of the house.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What if I need to call you first?

           Theo turns.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        What if there’s an emergency?  What 
                        if I get really sick?

                                 THEO
                        That’s not going to happen.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What if I was dying?

                                 THEO
                        Don’t even say that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You wouldn’t even know!

                                 THEO
                        For Christ’s sake, you’re not 
                        dying!
                                 MAGGIE
                        YES I AM!  YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I 
                        FEEL!

           She fights the tears with everything she’s got.  Theo takes 
           her by the shoulders.

                                 THEO
                        Hey.  Look at me.  You don’t have 
                        tuberculosis, or diphtheria, or 
                        cancer, or whatever else you think 
                        is wrong with you.  You are strong.  
                        Say it.  Say I’m strong.

           She bucks against him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Let go of me!  I HATE YOU!

           He lets her go.  Silence.

           Then, Theo looks past his daughter and sees Bernadette 
           standing in door way.

           He tenses.  Maggie turns around, sees her mom, and gasps.

           Bernadette steps out, her eyes fixed on Maggie.

           Maggie runs into her mother’s arms.  Bernadette envelops her.  
           They sob into each other.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Shh... It’s okay.  Shh...

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m sorry mom...

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Shh...

           Bernadette looks up at Theo, tears in her eyes.  Theo stands 
           poised to bolt, or fight -- whichever is needed.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           He nods, cautiously.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           Theo looks at Maggie, her face buried in her mother’s chest.
                                 THEO
                        Maggie...?  Hon?

           She isn’t turning back.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Go.

           Theo backs away, still holding out for Maggie to turn around.  
           She doesn’t.

           Theo turns and goes back down the steps to the water’s edge.

           Bernadette holds her daughter, rocking slightly.

           EXT. LAKE SHORE - SAME

           Theo walks back along the rocky shore.  He looks back at the 
           house, filled with remorse, then presses on.

           INT. LAKE TOWN, DINER - DAY

           At first glance the place looks like any other diner, but 
           then it’s clear all the patrons are plainclothes police.  

           Detective Ross sits with Agents Ward and Cooper, pretending 
           to have breakfast.  Ward checks his watch.

                                 AGENT WARD
                        Another goose chase.

           Ross sighs.  No argument.

                                 AGENT WARD (CONT’D)
                        Wrap it up.

           They rise.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Bernadette sits next to Maggie, arm around her.  Maggie holds 
           the thermometer in her lap, contemplating it.

           Outside, the police return.  Bernadette takes a deep breath 
           at the sound.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

           Detective Ross and the others get out of their cars.  As they 
           walk up to the house, Bernadette comes out with Maggie.
           Ross stops dead, then runs up to them.  Ward gets on the horn 
           with the state police.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        She just knocked on the back door.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        Maggie, where’s your father, is he 
                        here?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t know.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        I need you to think, it’s very 
                        important.

                                 BERNADETTE
                             (defending her daughter)
                        She said she doesn’t know.

           Bernadette moves between Ross and her daughter, a gesture not 
           lost on Maggie.

                                 DETECTIVE ROSS
                        She came alone?

                                 BERNADETTE
                        Yes.

           Ross lingers on Bernadette, weighing whether to believe her.

           Maggie looks out to the street and is thunderstruck: she sees 
           Theo coming out of the woods, hands on his head.

                                 MAGGIE
                        NO!

           The Oregon Troopers spot Theo.

                                 OREGON TROOPERS
                             (a chorus)
                        FREEZE!

           Ross and Bernadette turn.  Maggie sprints toward her dad.

                                 OREGON TROOPERS (CONT’D)
                        ON YOUR KNEES!

           Theo gets on his knees.  He offers no resistance.  Troopers 
           push him to the ground and cuff him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        NO!!  NO!!
                                 THEO
                        It’s okay, I’m okay!

           The police hold Maggie back.  She’s not getting anywhere near 
           her father.

                                 MAGGIE
                        YOU’RE HURTING HIM!!

           Bernadette runs up to comfort her daughter, but Maggie’s full 
           attention is on her father.  Tears stream down her face. 

           The Troopers get him to his feet and start moving him toward 
           the car.  He cranes his neck to find Maggie.

                                 THEO
                        I want you to visit me, okay?  
                        Promise you’ll visit!

           She nods, unable to speak.

                                 THEO (CONT’D)
                        Promise!

                                 MAGGIE
                        I promise!

           They load him into the cruiser, and shut the door.  THUMP!  
           Maggie goes limp; Bernadette holds her up.

           INT. OREGON TROOPER CRUISER - SAME

           Theo watches Bernadette lead Maggie away.  Soon, he can’t see 
           her through the police.  The confidence washes from his face 
           as the enormity of the situation settles in.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Theo stands in an orange jumpsuit behind the defendant’s 
           table next to his affordable ATTORNEY.

                                 JUDGE
                        To the third count of auto theft 
                        how do you plead?

                                 THEO
                        Guilty.

           Bernadette and Maggie sit at the back of the gallery.  Maggie  
           stares at the ceiling.
                                 JUDGE
                        To the charge of manslaughter how 
                        do you plead?

                                 THEO
                             (takes a breath)
                        Guilty.

                                 JUDGE
                        Sentencing will be scheduled for 
                        ten AM on the 17th...

           The judge’s words fade into meaningless sounds.  Theo looks 
           over his shoulder at his ex-wife and daughter.

           Bernadette offers a comforting expression.  Maggie still 
           won’t look at him.

           Theo finally turns back to face the court.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

           Theo sits with his back against the wall, staring at the 
           ceiling.  The GUARD calls from the end of the hall.

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Waters, you have a visitor.

           Theo perks up.

           INT. VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           The guard opens the heavy steel door opens and Theo enters.  
           Whatever hope he had in his eyes disappears when he sees his 
           attorney waiting for him, not Maggie.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Nice to see you, too.

           Theo takes his seat.  The attorney unpacks his briefcase.

                                 ATTORNEY (CONT’D)
                        Just a few more things to sign.  
                        We’ll petition that you be allowed 
                        to serve your sentences 
                        concurrently.  You never know.  
                        Keep your nose clean, stay sober, 
                        do what you’re told, you could get 
                        out in fifteen.

           Theo nods, and signs where indicated. 
                                 ATTORNEY (CONT’D)
                        And here.  Your daughter wanted me 
                        to give you this.

           Theo looks up.  The attorney hands him a small box wrapped in 
           brown paper.  He opens it.

           Inside the box: Maggie’s thermometer.

           Theo smiles, welling up.

                                 ATTORNEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think they’ll let you bring 
                        that back to your cell.

           Theo puts it back in the box, and takes a deep breath.

                                 THEO
                        That’s okay.  She wouldn’t want me 
                        to hang on to it, anyway.

           The attorney shrugs and moves on to the next form.

           Theo looks out the frosted glass window, opaque with diffused 
           sunlight.  He is content to know that she’s out there, 
           somewhere, feeling better.

           INT. BERNADETTE’S CAR - DAY

           Bernadette drives Maggie through the city.  Maggie looks out 
           the window, lost in her own thoughts.  The sun shines on her.

           Bernadette looks over, sensing tension.

                                 BERNADETTE
                        You okay?

           Maggie nods, absently.  Bernadette doesn’t prod.

                                 BERNADETTE (CONT’D)
                        Wanna get some ice cream?

           Maggie turns to her mom, and smiles a little.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           Bernadette smiles back.  They drive off together.

                                                              FADE OUT.
