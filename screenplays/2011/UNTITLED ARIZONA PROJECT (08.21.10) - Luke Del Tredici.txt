          Fifth Draft
           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           The camera glides low across the Arizona desert, hurtling 
           over white sand and red rocks. There are no signs of life out 
           there. The heat is relentless.

           A nine-foot concrete wall, painted pale pink, rises ominously 
           in the distance. The camera speeds towards it, craning 
           upwards at the last minute and swooping over to reveal a 
           startling oasis of impossibly green lawns, impossibly blue 
           swimming pools, and impossibly big houses. Dozens of 
           identical, newly constructed McMansions sit in perfect, 
           evenly-spaced rows.

           EXT. HARDING - OPENING MONTAGE

           The credits play over a MONTAGE of billboards advertising 
           luxury homes for sale in Harding’s dozen gated communities. 

           The developments have names like “Sunrise Bluffs,” “The 
           Colony at Portales,” and “Trianda Terrace.” They feature 
           homes in French Provincial, Hawaiian Plantation, Tuscan, 
           English Manor, Mediterranean, and Classic Spanish styles. 

           The houses boast walnut floors, vaulted ceilings, bridal 
           staircases, in-laws quarters, temperature controlled wine 
           cellars, and other deluxe amenities. “Live your dream!” 
           promises one sign. “To buy or not to be,” proclaims another.

           EXT. MCMANSION - FRONT YARD - DAY 

           A palatial house sits with a “Bartka Realty” sign planted in 
           it’s emerald lawn. A pretty brunette smiles falsely beneath 
           the slogan “Cassie Francis: A HouseSOLD Name!”

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        This is the cook’s delight floor 
                        plan with exotic granite island and 
                        walk-in pantry.

           INT. MCMANSION - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           CASSIE FRANCIS (37) is giving a tour to the BOYCHUKS, a 
           balding middle aged man and his much younger second wife. 
           Cassie is dark haired and attractive. She smiles enough to be 
           described as perky, but only by someone who wasn’t really 
           paying attention.
                                 CASSIE
                        Subzero, of course, Viking… 
                        everything top of the line.

           MRS. BOYCHUK is checking herself out in the metal door of an 
           enormous refrigerator. She fixes her hair.  

                                 MRS. BOYCHUK
                        I love the stainless steel.

                                 CASSIE
                        So sophisticated. 

           INT. MCMANSION - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           They stand around an enormous, sparkling pool. 

                                 CASSIE
                        The swim-up bar is probably one of 
                        the house’s sexier features.

                                 MRS. BOYCHUK
                        Pool’s for the kids, mostly.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh. Wonderful. How many do you 
                        have?

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        Two.

                                 MRS. BOYCHUK
                        He has two. (BEAT) I’m not allowed 
                        any.

           There’s an uncomfortable silence.

                                 CASSIE
                        And how great is this yard? The 
                        landscaping for all these units was 
                        designed by an internationally 
                        known architect.

           INT. MCMANSION - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Boychuk is looking up at the 25 foot ceiling. A gaudy, 
           glittering crystal chandelier looms over them. 

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        It’s definitely a lot of space.
                                 CASSIE
                        It’s a lot of space. It’s a lot of 
                        privacy. Nobody right on top of 
                        you. 

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        Who are the neighbors?

                                 CASSIE
                        Well they used to call these towns 
                        bedroom communities, but judging 
                        from the cars you see driving 
                        around, I think it’s really more of 
                        a “boardroom community.”

           Mr. Boychuk gives her a look. Cassie blushes.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sorry, Gary makes me say that. 
                        It’s terrible.

           EXT. MCMANSION - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They’re standing by the Boychuk’s enormous SUV.

                                 CASSIE
                        So you’ll call if you have any 
                        questions?

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        Like why house prices have been 
                        dropping? 

           Cassie smiles, unfazed.

                                 CASSIE
                        Was waiting for that one. Look, Mr. 
                        Boychuk, this town barely existed 
                        two years ago. All this from 
                        nothing. It’s sort of miraculous. 
                        And people… everybody got excited. 
                        And maybe a little carried away.

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        So the bubble burst?

                                 CASSIE
                        There’s been a slight correction. 
                        But honestly, all it means is that 
                        there are deals to be had. I just 
                        bought a home here in Harding 
                        myself, if that makes--

           A woman’s scream pierces the air, interrupting her.
                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        Um…?

           They listen, not sure where it came from. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sure it’s just--

           Another scream. Long and loud. They look out at the house 
           across the street, then back at each other. 

                                 MRS. BOYCHUK
                        Like, creepy.

                                 CASSIE
                        I know her. That’s Mrs… uh…

           From across the street, the woman’s voice cries out.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        HELP!!

                                 CASSIE
                        And her husband. Shit. They’ve been 
                        in the office. Gary sold them that 
                        house. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        HELP ME!!!

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m going over.

           Cassie runs out across the lawn. 

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        We shouldn’t… (CALLING AFTER HER) 
                        Shouldn’t we call the police?

           Cassie sprints across the street. Mr Boychuk jogs after her, 
           unenthusiastically.

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        Let’s just call the police.

           Cassie ignores him and bounds up to the front door. She rings 
           the bell. Nobody comes, so Cassie turns and bolts around the 
           side of the house, heading to the back.

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        Now where?

                                 CASSIE
                        I can get us in.
                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        But do we want-- I mean, we can’t 
                        just break into houses.

           The backyard has a familiar pool with a familiar swim-up bar.  
           Cassie runs over to a sliding glass door. She puts her hands 
           flat against it and, with a quick shove upward, lifts the 
           door off it’s tracks. It falls back towards her.

                                 CASSIE
                        (TO MR. BOYCHUK) Take this.

                                 MR. BOYCHUK
                        How do you even know how to do 
                        that?

                                 CASSIE
                        They put these shitty goddamn doors 
                        on all these units. Take it! 

           Mr. Boychuk struggles with the heavy door as Cassie races 
           inside. She sprints past the exotic granite kitchen island, 
           over walnut floors, and up the spiral staircase. 

           Then she stops dead in her tracks. 

           In the master bedroom, a man hangs from a ceiling fan, a rope 
           around his neck. A sobbing woman bear-hugs his legs, trying 
           to lift him up to take pressure off his neck. The guy is 
           still breathing, but barely.

                                 WOMAN
                        Please help me!

           Cassie, unsure of what else to do, joins her in grabbing the 
           guy’s legs. He’s heavy and unsteady, listing from one side to 
           the other. Every time he falls in one direction, the rope 
           goes taught and they try to angle him back the other way.

                                 WOMAN
                        (HYSTERICAL) I don’t know what 
                        happened. Y’know, the bank was-- 
                        but he didn’t, and I try not to, 
                        y’know, because I don’t, I try to…

                                 CASSIE
                        Okay, it’s okay. We’re gonna get 
                        him down.

           There’s a loud crack. Bits of dry-wall fall on them from 
           above. The fan has pulled halfway out of the ceiling.

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh god…
                                 CASSIE
                        No, this is good. It’s too cheap to 
                        hold him. We just have to--

           Before she can finish her thought, the fan rips out of the 
           ceiling. Cassie and the woman can’t hold the guy up. He falls 
           to the floor with a thud. The fan comes down right on his 
           head. The sound of the impact is stomach-turning.

           The woman screams. Cassie scrambles over and pushes the fan 
           aside. It’s a horrifying sight. Half the guy’s skull is caved 
           in. His teeth have been knocked out. Plaster rains down on 
           them like snow. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh my god.

           The man tries to talk, but his jaw is in pieces and his mouth 
           is filling with blood. He’s almost incoherent.

                                 MAN
                        (GARBLED) Kill me.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m calling an ambulance. 

                                 MAN
                        (LOUDER) Kill me!

                                 CASSIE
                        Somebody get help!

           The man screams louder. The camera is close on his face. 
           Blood and saliva spray everywhere. 

                                 MAN
                        FUCKING KILLL MEEEEE!

           The screen goes black.

           INT. CASSIE’S CAR - EVENING

           The sun is going down, but it’s still 95˚ out as Cassie 
           drives a dented Corolla through the extra-wide streets of her 
           gated community. She’s takes a drag off a cigarette, trying 
           to blow the smoke out the open window. The Dave Ramsey Show 
           plays on the radio.
                                 MALE CALLER (ON RADIO)
                        …good or bad I have another seven, 
                        it was a ten year interest only 
                        loan, so I have another seven years 
                        before it starts amortizing…

                                 DAVE RAMSEY (ON RADIO)
                        Mm-hm.

                                 MALE CALLER (ON RADIO)
                        What I’m looking at right now is, 
                        I’m way underwater, um, and I can’t 
                        qualify for any kind of a 
                        refinance.

           The car slips past block after block of huge, empty, big-lot 
           houses, almost all of them for sale. “Foreclosure” and 
           “Public Auction!” signs sprout like weeds from dead lawns.

                                 DAVE RAMSEY (ON RADIO)
                        So there’s no problem here from the 
                        original deal except the value has 
                        tanked and you woke up and realized 
                        you had a stupid mortgage.

                                 MALE CALLER (ON RADIO)
                        Correct.

                                 DAVE RAMSEY (ON RADIO)
                        Okay. You’re probably not gonna 
                        like my answer much…

           Cassie drives out past the guard shack at the entrance to the 
           development. It’s deserted. The gate-arm that once forced 
           cars to a stop is permanently raised. 

           EXT. SPORTS BAR - LATER

           Cassie pulls the Corolla into a parking space in front of a 
           strip-mall sports bar called “Swish!” She frowns at the sign. 
           Not the most masculine name for a sports bar. 

           INT. SPORTS BAR - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie enters the dark and sparsely populated bar. 
           Diamondbacks jerseys and Arizona Wildcats pennants cover the 
           walls. Flat-screen TVs play a poker tournament on ESPN. 

           A middle-aged guy in a Tommy Bahama ensemble waves to Cassie 
           from a booth across the room. A bit too tan, but otherwise 
           handsome. This is BURT, her date. 

                                 BURT
                        Cassie?
           Cassie smiles back at him, but it’s the same smile she had 
           when she was selling houses. 

           INT. SPORTS BAR - BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie and Burt are in the booth, enormous ten-page menus on 
           the table in front of them.

                                 BURT
                        Sorry I didn’t stand. Don’t want 
                        anybody stealing the booth out from 
                        under us.

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s okay.

                                 BURT
                        (RE: BOOTH) This one’s the best 
                        because you can see both big 
                        screens.

                                 CASSIE
                        (NODDING) Definitely.

           An uncomfortable beat.

                                 BURT
                        Have you had the chicken soft tacos 
                        here? (IMPASSIONED) Ridiculous.

           The waitress arrives carrying two comically large, sweet 
           looking margaritas. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Two ‘extremos' with salt.

                                 BURT
                        I ordered you one. They’re 
                        ridiculous.

           INT. SPORTS BAR - BOOTH - LATER

           The waitress drops off a fresh pair of ‘extremos’ and 
           collects two empty glasses. Given how relaxed Cassie seems, 
           they must be on their fourth or fifth. Awkward tension has 
           given way to drunken intimacy.

                                  BURT
                        …I don’t know, she’s getting 
                        remarried to, like, some old dude 
                        she met at Havasu. I’d be bitterer 
                        except the guy, y’know, the guy’s 
                        new-- the new guy’s name is Ernie. 
                                 CASSIE
                        So? (THEN) Oh. (POINTING AT HIM) 
                        Burt and Ernie. That’s hilarious.

                                 BURT
                        She’s so embarrassed. She won’t 
                        even use his name on Facebook. It’s 
                        all “with my bf, on our way to 
                        Cancun…”

           He trails off. His smile twitches. 

                                 BURT
                        Guy’s loaded, though. He bought her 
                        a boat.

                                 CASSIE
                        Mine’s started dating my daughter’s 
                        counsellor from fat camp. 

                                 BURT
                        She’s fat?

                                 CASSIE
                        She’s a little big. (BEAT) It’s 
                        tough.

                                 BURT
                        I bet. Getting dumped for some cow.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh. No. I thought you meant my 
                        daughter. 

                                 BURT
                        What? No. I thought you meant the 
                        new--

                                 CASSIE
                        (GETTING IT) Kelsey. She used to be 
                        fat. Now she just lords it over 
                        everyone. Like she’s an inspiration 
                        because of what she overcame.

                                 BURT
                        Fat bitch.

           Cassie grins. There’s a moment of silence.

                                 BURT
                        Hey, do you want to get out of 
                        here?
           EXT. SPORTS BAR - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie and Burt settle into his SUV. He turns the key and the 
           radio jumps to life, blaring Nickelback. Burt shuts it off.

                                 BURT
                        Sorry. Whoa. (BEAT) Um, right, so… 
                        you want to hit up your place or…

                                 CASSIE
                        Shouldn’t we go to yours?

           There’s a weirdly long pause. Burt nods.

                                 BURT
                        My place it is.

           EXT. GATED COMMUNITY - LATER

           Burt pulls into the driveway of an enormous, estate-size 
           house. He keeps the car running.

                                  BURT
                        This is it.

           A beat. They don’t get out. 

                                 CASSIE
                        So… 

                                 BURT
                        I don’t live here.

           Cassie blinks at him.

                                 BURT
                        Right now. Anymore. I mean, it’s 
                        still mine. I own it. I just have 
                        to rent it out, to help cover the 
                        mortgage. I’m staying in a cheaper 
                        place with some buddies. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Shouldn’t we… go there, then?

                                 BURT
                        Yeah, no, yeah. I just wanted you 
                        to see my house. So you know I’m 
                        not some sort of loser.

           There’s a pause. Cassie looks out at the building.

                                 CASSIE
                        Well it’s a really nice property.
                                 BURT
                        (SINCERE) Thank you for saying 
                        that.

           INT. BURT’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Burt and Cassie enter a shabby, plain-wrap apartment: white 
           walls and beige carpeting. The front door opens directly into 
           the living room, where two middle aged guys (DON and ANDY) 
           sit on a faux-leather couch, watching TV. 

                                 BURT
                        Hey guys.

                                 DON
                        There he is. (RE: CASSIE) And look 
                        at this! 

                                 BURT
                        Don, Andy… this is Cassie.

           Cassie waves sheepishly.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi.

                                 DON
                        I know Miss Cassie Francis. She 
                        sold me my house.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh. (BLINKS) No, I remember you. 
                        John?

                                 DON
                        Don. Like Burt just said.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sorry. I’m not-- (BEAT) How are 
                        you liking it? The house.

                                 DON
                        They took it.

                                 CASSIE
                        Right. Hence…

           She gesture half-heartedly at the room. A moment of silence. 
           This couldn’t be going worse.

                                 BURT
                        So what are you guys watching?
                                 ANDY
                        Australia was on HBO. 

           They all look at a paused image of a rugged Hugh Jackman 
           riding a horse, backlit beautifully.

                                 DON
                        It’s kind of weird. (THEN) What are 
                        you two crazy kids up to?

           Cassie looks at Burt. She’s suddenly feeling a lot less 
           drunk.

                                 CASSIE
                        I should probably get going, 
                        actually. It’s late.

                                 BURT
                        Oh. (BEAT) Really? Because they’re 
                        not… I mean, I do have my own room. 
                        With door.

           Burt hears himself and nods sadly.

                                 BURT
                        Jesus. I wouldn’t fuck me either.

           EXT. CASSIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - THE NEXT DAY 

           Cassie is in the pool, floating on her back. She stares 
           straight up at the sun, burning menacingly in the cloudless 
           sky. Everything is quiet. Then there’s the sound of a car 
           pulling up out front.

           EXT. CASSIE’S HOUSE - FRONT-YARD - CONTINUOUS

           A convertible is parked in the driveway. An overweight 
           teenage girl exits the passenger side as Cassie comes out of 
           the front door, wrapped in a towel.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey sweetie.

           MORGAN, her 13 year-old daughter, blows right past and goes 
           inside.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hey.

           Cassie watches her go with a raised eyebrow, then turns back 
           to the convertible. Her ex-husband, SCOTT, leans against the 
           car. He smiles at her.
                                 CASSIE
                        Good weekend?

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m worried about her.

                                 CASSIE
                        She’s thirteen. (SHRUGS) And the 
                        product of a broken home.

           Scott’s smile flickers but doesn’t fade.

                                 SCOTT
                        She still won’t talk to Kelsey.

                                 CASSIE
                        Does Kelsey talk to her about 
                        anything other than dieting tricks?

                                 SCOTT
                        Kelsey tried talking to her about 
                        boys. And clothes. And MTV’s True 
                        Life: I Have a Summer Share 2.

           Scott laughs to himself. With maybe a faint touch of 
           bitterness.

                                 SCOTT
                        They actually have a lot in common. 
                        Both being teenagers and 
                        everything.

           Cassie smiles at this, in spite of herself.

                                 CASSIE
                        How’s that going?

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s… okay. It’s good. She’s very 
                        young. Which can be refreshing.

                                 CASSIE
                        I bet. After years of me just being 
                        so… y’know…

           Cassie trails off. There’s a beat of silence.

                                 SCOTT
                        Thirst-inducing. Is the opposite of 
                        refreshing. (GRINNING) And that’s 
                        you. Like a dry cracker.  
           Scott smiles at her hopefully. Cassie doesn’t smile back. He 
           sighs and looks out across the street. The neighbor’s house 
           seems to be deserted, but the lawn is bright green.

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s with the grass?

                                 CASSIE
                        Somebody’s been going around spray-
                        painting all the dead lawns green.

                                 SCOTT
                        God. Painting the roses red.

                                 CASSIE
                        (SHRUGS) Gotta keep property values 
                        up somehow.

           Scott gets back into the car.

                                 SCOTT
                        You should really move back to 
                        Phoenix. This place is turning into 
                        a ghost town. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’d think you’d like it. Nobody 
                        around to see what you’re doing. 
                        Great for sneaking around.

           Scott nods and turns on the engine.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ll see ya, Cass.

           He backs out of the driveway. Cassie watches him go. Her 
           expression is hard to read, but she stays out there a little 
           too long, watching the convertible disappear down the road.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Morgan is in front of the TV, playing Dance Dance Revolution 
           on a roll-out pad on the floor. She’s not particularly good 
           at it. Cassie walks in, looking at her cell phone.

                                 CASSIE
                        Come on, we’re late. Where’s your 
                        bag? We have to pick-up Madison.

                                 MORGAN
                        But I just started. Kelsey said 
                        fifteen minutes every morning.
                                 CASSIE
                        I thought you didn’t like Kelsey.

                                 MORGAN
                        (SHRUGS) I don’t. But she’s pretty.

           Cassie tries to take this in stride.

                                 CASSIE
                        Okay, fifteen minutes.

           Morgan keeps dancing, clumsily. 

           INT. CASSIE’S CAR - LATER

           Cassie is driving. Morgan and another 13 year-old, MADISON, 
           are in the backseat. Both girls have ipod headphones on. They 
           stare out the windows, lost in their music. Morgan sniffs at 
           the air and removes an earbud.

                                 MORGAN
                        Were you smoking in here?

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t smoke.

           Morgan sniffs again and puts the headphones back on. They 
           drive along a two-lane highway, past all the gated 
           communities and out into the desert. Distant mountains dot 
           the horizon. The car seems very small.

           EXT. BARNES COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Cassie drops the girls off in front of a large high-school.

                                 MADISON
                        Thanks, Cassie. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Bye mom.

                                 CASSIE
                        Sweetie, I’m gona be home late, 
                        okay? I have a showing at 5:00.

                                 MORGAN
                        I know.

                                 CASSIE
                        And Madison’s mom is picking you 
                        guys up.

                                 MORGAN
                        (IMPATIENT) I know.
           Morgan starts to walk away.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hey. What do we say when we get out 
                        of the car? 

                                 MORGAN
                        (RELUCTANTLY PLAYING ALONG) Thank 
                        you, driver.

           Cassie smiles.

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s a good girl.

           Cassie watches as her daughter disappears into a mass of 
           other teenagers.

           INT. CASSIE’S CAR - LATER

           Cassie is driving back along the desert highway when her 
           phone vibrates. She checks the caller ID, sighs, and answers.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hello?

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Can I speak to Casandra Francis?

                                 CASSIE
                        She’s not here right now, can I ta--

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        I have this is as her cell.

           Cassie pulls to a stop at a railroad crossing. The red lights 
           are flashing.

                                 CASSIE
                        No, sorry. Office.

           The train-crossing bells are clanging loudly. It’s not a 
           sound you’d typically hear at an office. Cassie tries to 
           shield the phone’s microphone with her hand.

                                 CASSIE
                        We expect her back super soon, 
                        though.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        And who am I talking to?

                                 CASSIE
                        This is Ms. Francis’ assistant.
                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Do you have a name?

           A beat.

                                 CASSIE
                        Phoenix. (WINCES) May I ask who’s 
                        calling?

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Well, Phoenix, this is Glen with 
                        Desert National Bank and Trust. I’m 
                        calling about Mrs. Francis’s 
                        mortgage payment.

           Cassie’s phone beeps. She looks down. It’s an incoming call 
           from “Gary Office”

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sorry, sir, I have someone on 
                        the other line. I’ll have Casandra 
                        call you as soon as she gets in.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Listen, I’m not--

           Cassie switches over to the other line, cutting him off. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Gary?

                                 GARY (V.O.)
                        Where the fuck are you?

           INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           GARY BARTKA (40ish, short, tan, and weirdly buff) sits at his 
           desk in the back of a nondescript strip-mall office. 

                                 GARY
                        No, lemme guess. You’re almost 
                        here, you just got stopped at the 
                        train.

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        I did. 

                                 GARY
                        Bullshit.

           EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie holds the phone out so he can hear the clanging bells.
                                 CASSIE
                        It’s coming. 

                                 GARY (V.O.)
                        You’re fucking ballsy, I’ll give 
                        you that. Usually when people 
                        haven’t sold shit for six months, 
                        they try to get in early, maybe 
                        prove to me they’re not--

           The train is almost on her. It’s getting louder. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Train’s here. 

           Gary tries to yell over it.

                                 GARY (V.O.)
                        --PROBE TO ME THEY’RE NOT TOTALLY 
                        FUCKING WORTHLESS AND I’M NOT--

           The freight train thunders past, drowning out Gary and 
           everything else. We PUSH IN slowly on Cassie as she watches 
           it go by. The deafening roar builds on the soundtrack. 

           The train just keeps going and going. An endless parade of 
           identical red and green cargo containers. It seems absurdly, 
           impossibly long. It must take a full forty seconds to pass.

           Then, abruptly, it’s over. The bells have stopped blaring. 
           The train is gone. And in the gulf of silence it leaves in 
           it’s wake, we can just barely make out the small, tinny sound 
           of Gary still yelling. Cassie brings the phone up to her ear.

                                 GARY (V.O.)
                        …time. I hired you for two reasons, 
                        and they weren’t your goddamn 
                        brains, so get your-- 

           Cassie hangs up on him. She takes a deep breath, then drives 
           forward, over the tracks.

           INT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - LATER

           Cassie arrives at Bartka Realty. It’s an unmemorable office 
           space: gray carpet and dropped ceilings. The front wall is 
           all glass. Dusty mini-blinds are drawn to hold back the sun. 

           Gary’s desk is towards the back. He looks up from his 
           computer, closing a browser window with a little too much 
           urgency. Probably porn, possibly on-line dating.

                                 GARY
                        You hung up on me.
                                 CASSIE
                        The train came.

                                 GARY
                        You look fucking hot.

           Cassie’s in her business-sexy uniform. Low-cut white blouse, 
           tight black skirt, knee-high leather boots. 

                                 CASSIE
                        For the showing. 

           He looks her up and down, then rolls his eyes back into his 
           head and makes an orgasmic noise.

                                 GARY
                        Uurrrhhhh.

           Silence. Cassie isn’t quite sure how to respond to that.

                                 CASSIE
                        (BEAT) Cool? 

                                 GARY
                        So why’re you late?

                                 CASSIE
                        I had to drop off Morgan 12 miles 
                        away. It’s not my fault there’s no 
                        high school in this town. 

                                 GARY
                        Why’d you move here then?

                                 CASSIE
                        Because somebody told me it would 
                        be a glorious place to raise a 
                        family.

           A beat. Gary snorts.

                                 GARY
                        If I didn’t feel bad about that, 
                        you wouldn’t still have a job. Your 
                        incompetent ass should be on your 
                        fucking knees, thanking me.

                                 CASSIE
                        I know.

                                 GARY
                        Good.
                                 CASSIE
                        I appreciate it.

                                 GARY
                        You should.

           Cassie takes a seat at her desk by the front door. She’s just 
           turning the computer on when her cell phone rings again.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hello?

           It’s the debt collector again.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Casandra Francis?

           Cassie looks at the phone’s display and frowns. The guy used 
           a different number this time. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m sorry, she’s still not--

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        So here’s the deal, Casandra, you 
                        can play your little games, but I’m 
                        gonna keep calling and calling. You 
                        may not have all day to deal with 
                        me, but I’ve sure as fuck got all 
                        day to deal with you.

           Cassie angles her body away from Gary. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I wasn’t--

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        You’ve missed six straight mortgage 
                        payments, babe. You’re lucky it’s 
                        me and not the police, so let’s 
                        just cut the crap.

           During this, the door to the office swings open and a tall 
           guy in shorts, a “Freedom isn’t Free” tee-shirt, wrap-around 
           sunglasses and an Arizona State baseball hat strides in. This 
           is SONNY. He blows past Cassie.

                                 SONNY
                        Hey Gary.

            Gary greets him with obviously false enthusiasm.

                                 GARY
                        Oh hey! Cool. What’s up man?
                                 SONNY
                        You never called, so I decided to 
                        just swing by. (BEAT) Surprise!

           As Cassie watches, the debt collector gets impatient.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Casandra?

                                 CASSIE
                        (SOFTLY INTO PHONE) I know, I know. 
                        Look, I’m showing a house later and 
                        this commission would be enough--

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        You can’t shit a shitter, bitch. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I promise I’m not shitting you. I 
                        wouldn’t…

           Behind her, Gary and Sonny’s conversation gets heated.

                                 GARY
                        I meant to call yesterday, then I 
                        totally got totally swamped.

                                 SONNY
                        Are you busy right now?

                                 GARY
                        I mean, I’ve got a few things that--

                                 SONNY
                        You don’t look busy. 

                                 GARY
                        (BEAT) Okay. Yeah. No. Let’s talk. 
                        Cool. Why don’t you sit down.

                                 SONNY
                        (PETULANT) Why don’t you? 

           Gary’s already sitting.

                                 GARY
                        Okay, look… my guy at bank, and 
                        this is just one guy, but he said 
                        they’re not accepting any more 
                        short sales. They’d rather just 
                        hold onto assets and hope it turns 
                        around.
           Cassie is half listening to them, half listening to the debt 
           collector. It’s all happening at once.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Am I interested in your promises? 
                        No. Why? Because you’re obviously 
                        not a person who keeps her word. 
                        And right now it’s my boot on your 
                        throat, so you better--

                                 SONNY
                        You said it was a slam dunk!

                                 GARY
                        I said I’d do what I could. 

                                 SONNY
                        Slam dunk. Slam dunk! SLAM DUNK! 

                                 CASSIE
                        (INTO PHONE) Can you just hold on 
                        for one second--

           Cassie stands up and starts to head for the door.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        No, I can’t fucking hold. I don’t 
                        fucking hold. I won’t fucking hold. 
                        You better not be--

                                 CASSIE
                        (WHISPERING) I’m still here, Jesus, 
                        I’m still here. I’m just going 
                        outside for a little privacy.

           Cassie exits the front door of the office, leaving Gary and 
           Sonny screaming at each other.

           EXT. STRIP-MALL - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           The office is on the second floor of a two-story strip-mall. 
           All the businesses on the top floor are connected by a long 
           concrete balcony with a battered metal railing. 

           Bartka Real Estate is the only place still open in the 
           complex. A big “Retail Space For Lease” banner hangs from the 
           railing. Some offices have never been occupied. Others bear 
           the signage of recently shuttered businesses (like “I Pity 
           the Pool” -- a pool cleaning supply store).

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Mrs. Francis? 
           Cassie looks up at the sun. It must be pushing a 100˚ and 
           it’s not even 10am. She shields her eyes and ducks into an 
           empty office space next door.

           INT. EMPTY OFFICE SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           The room has the same layout as the real estate office, but 
           no furniture. A few panels have been removed from the dropped 
           ceiling. A visible layer of dust blankets everything. A dozen 
           unplugged office phones are piled against one wall.

           She can still hear shouting from Gary and Sonny through the 
           paper-thin plaster walls. The argument is escalating.

           There are no blinds, so Cassie has to walk to the back of the 
           office to get out of the sun. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Sorry. I had to get somewhere 
                        quiet.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        What, are you embarrassed? You 
                        don’t want people knowing you’re a 
                        fucking deadbeat? Well maybe I’ll 
                        just have to go knocking on doors, 
                        then. I’m sure your friends and 
                        neighbors would be very interested 
                        to know exactly how much money you 
                        owe and-- 

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t have any neighbors.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Excuse me?

                                 CASSIE
                        My development is almost deserted. 
                        So have fun.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, are you getting tough 
                        with me? ‘Cuz I’m the guy with his 
                        boot on your throat right now, and--

                                 CASSIE
                        I think I’d like to speak to your 
                        supervisor.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Well I think I am the supervisor, 
                        Casandy. So you’ll fucking talk to 
                        me.
           Cassie closes her eyes, out of frustration or exhaustion or 
           both. Suddenly there’s a loud crash from next door. Her eyes 
           spring open. There’s another crash and more yelling. 

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        I’m trying to help you here, but  
                        don’t forget that I can end your 
                        life. Not violently. This isn’t a 
                        threat. But I will end your life. 
                        That’s not a threat.

           Cassie isn’t listening to the guy. She’s looking at the wall. 
           There’s a muffled yell from the other side, then loud, quick 
           foot-steps leading from the back of the office (Gary’s desk) 
           towards the front. Cassie follows the sound with her eyes. 

           Suddenly, through the glass front wall, Cassie sees Sonny 
           burst out of the real estate office, pushing Gary in front of 
           him. With his size advantage, Sonny has Gary lifted off his 
           feet -- his toes barely touch the ground as he’s propelled 
           backwards.

           Sonny slams Gary’s back hard against the railing of the 
           balcony. Gary goes up and over. Sonny lets go and Gary 
           plummets. His scream is immediately cut short by a dull thud.

           Cassie’s eyes go wide. She drops the phone from her ear.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Mrs. Francis?

           Out on the balcony, Sonny peers over the railing. Cassie is 
           frozen in place. Her breath is caught in her throat.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Cassandra?

           Cassie hangs up on the guy without looking down. She takes a 
           step back, silently.

           On the balcony, Sonny realizes something. He spins around and 
           stares into the real estate office. Then he looks off to his 
           right, towards the far end of the balcony. Cassie scans the 
           office around her for somewhere to hide. It’s a huge, empty 
           white room. 

           She looks back at Sonny. He’s staring right at her. Their 
           eyes lock.

                                 CASSIE
                        (SOFTLY) Shit.

           Sonny opens the door and storms into the empty office.
                                 SONNY
                        What did you see?

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m calling the cops. 

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t do that.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m calling the cops!

           Sonny grabs a discarded office phone from the pile on the 
           floor. Cassie tries to dial 911 on her cell, but there’s not 
           enough time. She looks up and Sonny is already on her. He 
           slams the phone receiver down on the side of her head with 
           vicious force.

           You’d expect the screen to go black. Instead, Cassie just 
           drops to the ground, clutching her head and moaning in pain. 
           Sonny looks down at her with consternation.

                                 SONNY
                        Shit.

           He raises the phone and slams it down on her head again. It 
           makes a sickening thump. Cassie sobs and curls into a ball. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Please don’t kill me.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not trying to kill you! I’m 
                        trying to fucking knock you out! 
                        Fuck!!

           He flings the phone against a wall in a fit of frustration. 
           It makes a dent in the plaster, leaving a little smear of 
           Cassie’s blood.

           Sonny pulls out his Blackberry and types something into it. 
           Cassie looks up at him, trying to focus.

                                 CASSIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 SONNY
                        Shut up.

           There’s a pause as he waits for his phone to load something. 

                                 SONNY
                        (BITTERLY) Fucking Verizon.
           He looks down at Cassie.

                                 SONNY
                        Stop looking at me!

           He makes a half-hearted attempt to cover his face with his 
           hands.

                                 SONNY
                        (RE: PHONE) Come on. Come on. Okay. 
                        (READING) Blah blah blah, knee 
                        bent, right arm down… blah blah 
                        blah… let out a mighty scream? 
                        (BEAT) Shit.

           He looks down at Cassie.

                                 SONNY
                        You have to be standing for this to 
                        work.

           Cassie just lays there, clutching her head.

                                 SONNY
                        Stand up!

           Cassie looks up at him.

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t look at me! Close your eyes! 
                        Stand up and close your eyes! 

           He grabs Cassie by the arm and yanks her to her feet. She 
           wobbles, so he shoves her up against a wall to steady her.

           He consults his black-berry, then assumes a boxers stance. 
           Right knee forward, left knee back.

                                 SONNY
                        (READING) Stay loose. Aim for the 
                        chin. Unleash a mighty scream. 

           He slips the Blackberry back into his pocket, then drops his 
           right hand and twists at the waist. He unleashes a mighty 
           scream. It sounds like a dog being strangled.

                                 SONNY
                        Aiigghhhhhh!

           He punches Cassie hard on the side of her chin. She drops to 
           the ground again, writhing in pain but not blacked out.

                                 SONNY
                        Fuck!! Seriously?
           He takes a deep breath. There’s a pause.

                                 SONNY
                        Okay. Let’s go again.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cassie lies on her back, on a brown leather sectional sofa. 
           Her wrists are duct-taped together. So are her ankles. It 
           takes an enormous effort to open her eyes. 

           She’s in a living room not that different from her own: IKEA 
           furniture, recessed lighting, built-in speakers, and a giant 
           flat-screen TV mounted on one wall.

           There’s a bag resting on her head, wet with condensation. It 
           was once frozen. It’s now melted. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hello?

           Nothing. Cassie tests her jaw. She winces in pain.

                                 CASSIE
                        (LOUDER) Hello?

           Quick footsteps from the direction of the kitchen, then Sonny 
           steps into the room.

           He’s wearing a black, hooded, Arizona State Sun Devils 
           sweatshirt. But it’s on backwards. The hood is up over his 
           head, completely covering his face, except for two eye holes 
           which have been cut out so he can see.

           He tries to disguise his voice, making it deeper. Like 
           Christian Bale as Batman.

                                 SONNY
                        How do you feel?

           Cassie says nothing. She’s not all there yet.

                                 SONNY
                        Let me get that.

           He reaches down. Cassie flinches, but Sonny just grabs the 
           bag off her head.

                                 SONNY
                        Frozen margarita mix. (THEN) You 
                        know how when you make margaritas 
                        it’s mix, tequila, and ice? With 
                        this stuff, the ice is the mix, so 
                        it saves a step. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SONNY (CONT'D)
                        (BEAT) Plus you’re not gonna 
                        realize at the last minute that you 
                        didn’t buy enough ice and…

           He trails off. Cassie’s not sure what to say. 

                                 SONNY
                        Anyway…

           He points to the hood over his face.

                                 SONNY
                        Sorry about this, but I can’t let 
                        you see my face. I have a ski mask 
                        from when I lived in Denver, but I 
                        seriously can’t find where I put 
                        it. So many closets.

           Sonny plops down opposite her into a leather La-Z-Boy. Cassie 
           tries to sit up, but it’s too hard with her ankles duct-taped 
           together. She gives up and just lies there.

           An adorable golden retriever wanders into the room with a 
           tennis ball in it’s mouth. It tries to get Sonny’s attention 
           by dropping the slobbery ball in his lap. Sonny ignores it.

                                 SONNY
                        So… I’m just gonna say it out loud. 
                        (PAUSE) Gary is dead.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh God.

                                 SONNY
                        I know. I still can’t believe it.

           Cassie closes her eyes. Her head is throbbing.

                                 SONNY
                        The whole thing was an accident. We 
                        just had a fight. (THEN) He ruined 
                        my life.

           He waits for Cassie to ask how. She doesn’t.

                                 SONNY
                        He sold me this house. Which I 
                        love.  It’s amazing. But Gary said -
                        - it was a promise -- he promised 
                        that an adjustable-rate would be 
                        fine. And I know he’s not a finance 
                        guy, but a promise is a promise.
           The dog picks up the ball in it’s mouth and drops it on 
           Sonny’s lap again.

                                 SONNY
                        (TO DOG) Lefty! Come on. (TO 
                        CASSIE)
                        Then he promised me, after it’d all 
                        gone to shit, he promised me the 
                        bank was taking short-sales. He 
                        knew a guy. He said he’d make a 
                        call.

           Cassie nods stiffly.

                                 CASSIE
                        Slam dunk.

                                 SONNY
                        You heard that. (BEAT) Now I’m 
                        embarrassed.

           Cassie is starting to get her wits about her.

                                 CASSIE
                        Don’t be.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m a grown man. I shouldn’t have 
                        hissy fits. But my business is 
                        fucked. My wife left me. My new 
                        wife. And this house… y’know, so 
                        I’m under a lot of stress right 
                        now. (BEAT) And I have a temper. 
                        Which is good in business. You 
                        gotta be a shark. But it’s still my 
                        bad. Gary was a friend. 

           Sonny pets his dog. The deep voice he had been affecting is 
           almost entirely gone.

                                 SONNY
                        He just went over the railing. I 
                        tried to catch him. 

                                 CASSIE
                        What do you want from me?

           Sonny looks at her for a moment. The backwards hood slips 
           down over his eyes a little. He adjusts it. 

                                 SONNY
                        First lemme give you a tour.
           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny, with the backwards hood still covering his face, leads 
           Cassie on a tour of his McMansion. Her hands are bound, her 
           ankles aren’t. They’re trailed by Lefty, the golden 
           retriever, wagging his tail boisterously. 

                                 SONNY
                        We got a refi and did a bunch of 
                        work to, y’know, customize the 
                        standard plans. This was Vicki’s 
                        “dream bathroom.” Italian tile. His 
                        and her sinks. 

           He gestures out the window.

                                 SONNY
                        I didn’t care about that stuff, as 
                        long as we were by the golf course.

           Cassie looks out the window. The entire development is built 
           around a golf course, but it’s unfinished. Instead of rolling 
           greens, there’s just a sea of dirt. Trenchers, excavators, 
           and other digging machines dot the landscape, gathering dust.

                                 SONNY
                        They’re never gonna finish it. I 
                        say it’s breach of contract, but 
                        turns out it wasn’t actually in the 
                        contract. That’s my bad, again. 
                        Stupid. Do you golf?

                                 CASSIE
                        Not really.

                                 SONNY
                        I love it. More than anything. I’m 
                        not supposed to play anymore, 
                        because of my back, but I do 
                        anyway. 

           Sonny smiles broadly, trying to get her to like him. Then he 
           remembers that he has a hood on and she can’t see his face. 

                                 SONNY
                        It’s the only thing that keeps me 
                        sane. 

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They’re standing in the big bedroom.
                                 SONNY
                        Master bedroom, obviously. I turned 
                        Vicki’s precious walk-in into a 
                        gym. 

           He opens a closet door, revealing an enormous closet. It’s 
           empty except for a weight lifting bench and a treadmill.

                                 SONNY
                        Revenge!

           He laughs a little. His cell phone rings. He checks it, gives 
           a snort, then pockets it. Cassie is distracted by a photo on 
           the bedside table. It’s of Sonny, a woman, and two boys.

                                 CASSIE
                        Are these your sons?

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah, that’s me and my ex-wife -- 
                        my first ex-wife, I guess I have to 
                        say now -- and our boys. Chase and 
                        Penn.   

           There’s a pause as Sonny realizes she’s looking at a photo of 
           him. He awkwardly removes the backwards hood.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m letting you see my face as a 
                        sign of trust. Okay?

                                 CASSIE
                        Okay.

           Sonny gestures to a set of built-in dressers along one wall.

                                 SONNY
                        We had the built-ins added. And I 
                        had them install this.

           He opens a hidden panel next to the closet, revealing a huge 
           safe. Sonny punches in a combination and it swings open, 
           revealing two dozen guns. Everything from handguns to assault 
           rifles. He pulls out a rifle and inspects it lovingly. 

                                 SONNY
                        Had to keep them out of the way of 
                        the boys.

           He looks down at the gun then up at Cassie. 

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t want anybody accidentally 
                        getting shot.
           The air has gone out of the room a little. Cassie shifts her 
           weight ever so slightly. 

                                 SONNY
                        (BRIGHTLY) You want to see the 
                        pool?

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           They’re looking out the kitchen window at the pool, which has 
           floating basketball nets on it. 

                                 SONNY
                        I swim every morning. It’s easier 
                        on the back than golf so…

           His phone rings again. He looks down at it, rolls his eyes, 
           then sends it to voicemail. He turns back towards the 
           kitchen. The countertops are just plywood, still under 
           construction.

                                 SONNY
                        Sorry the kitchen is such a mess. 
                        We started to redo the counters, 
                        but, y’know, the best laid plans...

           He holds up two jagged samples of polished granite. One is a 
           slightly warmer shade of gray, one slightly cooler.

                                 SONNY
                        Just to settle an argument, which 
                        one of these do you like better?

                                 CASSIE
                        What’s the point of this?

                                 SONNY
                        For the counters. 

                                 CASSIE
                        All this. The tour.

                                 SONNY
                        I wanted to show you my house.

                                 CASSIE
                        Why?

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t know. Just… this is my 
                        home. It’s who I am. (BLUSHES) That 
                        sounds stupid. I just thought you 
                        should see it. You understand, 
                        right? 
           She doesn’t.

                                 CASSIE
                        I do. 

                                 SONNY
                        If they foreclose, I lose my kids. 
                        You can’t keep custody if you’re 
                        financially unstable.

           His phone rings in his pocket. This time he doesn’t even look 
           at it before sending it to voicemail. 

                                 SONNY
                        (RE: PHONE) Jesus.

                                 CASSIE
                        I have debt collectors calling me 
                        too. I’m totally underwater on my 
                        house. I know how stressful it is.

                                 SONNY
                        (MEANINGFUL) Thank you, Cassie.

           Cassie wasn’t sure he knew her name. He shrugs.

                                 SONNY
                        Gary used to talk about you. (THEN) 
                        And I looked in your wallet. Sorry.

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s okay.

                                 SONNY
                        I just want you to know that I’m 
                        not a bad guy. And if you promise 
                        to keep this whole stupid thing to 
                        yourself, I’ll let you go. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t think you’re a bad guy.

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t talk to the cops. If they 
                        ask, tell them you were off… 
                        y’know, showing a house today or 
                        whatever. You never went in to the 
                        office. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I promise I won’t tell anyone.

                                 SONNY
                        Okay. Good.
           There’s a pause. Sonny nods to himself.

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 CASSIE
                        I won’t go to the police.

                                 SONNY
                        You have bruises all over your 
                        face. How are you gonna explain 
                        that?

                                 CASSIE
                        I won’t go to the police.

                                 SONNY
                        Why not? I would if I were you. 

                                 CASSIE
                        No, but… I wouldn’t. I don’t want 
                        to help them take your kids.

                                 SONNY
                        I know you were in love with Gary. 
                        You must hate me.

                                 CASSIE
                        What?

                                 SONNY
                        I know about you two.

                                 CASSIE
                        We weren’t. I’m not-- I’m single. 
                        Very single.

                                 SONNY
                        Well, whatever. Sexually.

                                 CASSIE
                        That’s not true.

                                 SONNY
                        So you’re calling Gary a liar?

                                 CASSIE
                        (BEAT) I don’t know.

                                 SONNY
                        You don’t know?
                                 CASSIE
                        Yes. If he said we had sex. Which 
                        sounds like him.

                                 SONNY
                        Bitch.

                                 CASSIE
                        No, this is good. It’s good news. I 
                        wasn’t in love with Gary, so I’m 
                        not mad and I’m not going to tell 
                        the cops on you, okay?

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t talk to me like I’m ten. You 
                        think I’m stupid? You think you’re 
                        the first woman to ever lie to me? 
                        (WOMAN’S VOICE) “No, you’ve got it 
                        all wrong… We didn’t have 
                        sex…Nothing happened between us.”

                                 CASSIE
                        Nothing did happen between me and 
                        Gary.

                                 SONNY
                        (YELLS) Don’t call my friend a 
                        liar!

                                 CASSIE
                        (YELLING BACK) You killed him!

                                 SONNY
                        That was an accident! I TOLD YOU 
                        THAT ALREADY! 

           Sonny is shaking in anger. Cassie tries to compose herself. 
           She needs to calm him down.

                                 CASSIE
                        I know it was. I know that. I‘m so 
                        sorry.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not ten, Cassie! I’M NOT A 
                        FUCKING CHILD!!

           He grabs a huge kitchen knife from a drawer and points it at 
           her chest.

                                 SONNY
                        Sit down.
                                 CASSIE
                        Okay.

           Before she can sit, he pushes her down into a kitchen chair. 
           He grabs a roll of duct tape and tapes her ankles to the 
           chair legs. Then he uses the knife to slice the duct tape 
           around her wrists. Cassie flinches.

           Sonny slams the knife down on the kitchen island, pulls her 
           arms behind her back, and duct tapes them each to the chair.

                                 SONNY
                        I have to take the dog for a walk. 

           He walks over and opens the freezer. It’s filled with 
           hundreds of bags of frozen margarita mix. He holds one up.

                                 SONNY
                        You need another one of these?

           Cassie shakes her head. Sonny tosses it angrily back into the 
           freezer. 

                                 SONNY
                        Whatever. (CALLING OUT) Lefty! 

           The golden retriever enters, wagging his tail feverishly. 

                                 SONNY
                        Scream if you want. There’s not 
                        another occupied house for two or 
                        three cul-de-sacs. (TO DOG) Come 
                        on, buddy. Yeah, who’s a good 
                        buddy?

           EXT. SONNY’S DEVELOPMENT - GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny stands on the unfinished golf course, hitting a tennis 
           ball with a driver. His form is perfect. The ball soars off 
           into the distance, Lefty sprinting after it. 

           As Sonny waits for the dog to return with the ball, his phone 
           buzzes in his pocket. He takes it out and checks the caller 
           ID, but doesn’t answer. 

           He kicks angrily at a weed peeking out of the dirt.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie eyes the knife that Sonny left sitting on top of the 
           island. It’s handle slightly overhangs the edge.

           Her feet can touch the ground, and she manages to turn the 
           chair around so that her back is to the knife. 
           The counter height is too high for her hands to reach. She 
           has to try to knock the knife off.

           Going up on her toes, she shoves the chair backwards. It 
           knocks into the knife, which goes shooting across the island 
           and falls off, clattering to the ground. But now Cassie has 
           to make it all the way around to the other side.

           As she starts the arduous journey, she hears a key in the 
           front door. She freezes, then tries awkwardly to maneuver 
           back to where Sonny had left her.

           But it isn’t Sonny who comes walking into the kitchen. It’s a 
           30-something blonde woman in a pink Juicy track suit. Cassie 
           recognizes her from some of the photos upstairs. It's Sonny’s 
           second ex-wife, VICKI. 

                                 VICKI
                        Who the fuck are you?

           The front door opens and slams shut as Sonny comes sprinting 
           in, followed by Lefty.

                                 SONNY
                        What are you doing, Vick? You can’t 
                        just let yourself in anymore.

                                 VICKI
                        Me? What am I doing?

           Sonny clenches his fists and closes his eyes. The stress of 
           the situation is starting to overwhelm him.

                                 SONNY
                        Oh, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. 

                                 VICKI
                        What is this?

                                 CASSIE
                        (TO VICKI) Please call the police.

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t do that!

                                 VICKI
                        Then tell me who she is!

                                 SONNY
                        Okay, okay. There was an accident. 

                                 CASSIE
                        He killed somebody!
                                 SONNY
                        (TO CASSIE) Shut up.

                                 VICKI
                        You fucking killed someone?

                                 SONNY
                        Gary. 

                                 VICKI
                        Gary the real estate guy?

                                 SONNY
                        It was an accident. You know I 
                        wouldn’t ever hurt anybody.

           Vicki laughs in disbelief.

                                 VICKI
                        Are you crazy? If it was an 
                        accident then--

                                 SONNY
                        I AM NOT CRAZY!

                                 CASSIE
                        Please help me.

                                 SONNY
                        Look, I’m not going to hurt her. I 
                        don’t even know her. I just have 
                        her… retained so I can make sure 
                        she’s not going to talk to anyone. 
                        If she promises, I’ll let her go. 
                        (TO CASSIE) That’s our deal, right?

           Cassie looks at Sonny, then at Vicki. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Call the cops.

                                 SONNY
                        (HURT, TO CASSIE) Why would you say 
                        that?

                                 VICKI
                        I can’t be here.

           Vicki starts for the door, but Sonny grabs her from behind.

                                 SONNY
                        No.
                                 VICKI
                        Fucking let me go, Sonny.

                                 SONNY
                        You can’t leave.

           They struggle. Sonny has her in a bear hug. Vicki manages to 
           kick him in the shins. 

                                 SONNY
                        Ahh!

           He picks her up and throws her against one of the counters. 
           Her back hits it with a wicked impact. She crumples to the 
           floor. Sonny looks at Cassie, fire in his eyes.

                                 SONNY
                        You’re an evil little bitch. Thanks 
                        a lot! 

           EXT. SONNY’S DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           We see a series of shots of the deserted development. Empty 
           pools. Abandoned living rooms. A flyer taped to a street lamp 
           reads “Recession 101: It’s a Test, Not a Final.”

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Cassie is still duct-taped to the chair, but now Vicki is 
           taped to a chair next to her. Sonny stands over them with his 
           arms crossed.

                                 VICKI
                        What are you gonna do, Sonny? If 
                        anything happens to me, you don’t 
                        think you’ll be the first person 
                        they look for?

                                 SONNY
                        Nothing’s gonna happen to you. But 
                        you’re in this with me now. And if 
                        you try to back out, I’ll tell 
                        everyone you were an accomplice.

                                 VICKI
                        An accomplice you had to tie to a 
                        chair to keep her here!

                                 SONNY
                        Prove it. Duct tape doesn’t leave 
                        bruises.

                                 VICKI
                        Where’d you get that from?
                                 SONNY
                        It doesn’t.

                                 VICKI
                        Says who?

                                 SONNY
                        It was on some reality show.

                                 VICKI
                        Some reality show about kidnappers?

                                 SONNY
                        Mythbusters. I don’t know. Dirty 
                        Jobs. Does it really fucking 
                        matter?!

           Sonny is getting agitated. He’s playing with one of the 
           granite samples. Turning it over and over again in his hands.

                                 SONNY
                        God! You pick and pick and pick. 
                        But you’re not my wife anymore, 
                        remember? So that means I don’t 
                        have to listen to you.

                                 VICKI
                        (SCOFFS) Because you always 
                        listened so good before.

                                 SONNY
                        Just shut up, okay? Here’s the 
                        plan. Our plan. (RE: CASSIE) We 
                        kill her. 

                                 CASSIE
                        No.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not talking to you right now, 
                        believe it or not. We get rid of 
                        the body. Then we leave her keys in 
                        her mailbox. (PROUD) Get it?

                                 VICKI
                        How are you going to get rid of a 
                        body?

                                 SONNY
                        That’s not the point. Just-- do you 
                        see why it’s perfect? 

                                 CASSIE
                        Sonny…
                                 SONNY
                        (TO VICKI) Great. Good. Now she 
                        knows my name. Awesome. But it 
                        doesn’t matter, because our plan is 
                        perfect, because every day in this 
                        town, people who are underwater on 
                        their homes just leave their keys 
                        in the mailbox and walk away. They 
                        disappear. The last thing anybody 
                        would suspect is, y’know… (UNDER 
                        HIS BREATH) murder.

                                 VICKI
                        What if she’s not underwater?

                                 SONNY
                        She is. She told me. (PROUD) I got 
                        her to tell me.

                                 VICKI
                        And you don’t think somebody will 
                        miss her?

                                 SONNY
                        Her boss is dead. No wedding ring. 
                        She told me she’s single. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I have a daughter.

           A beat.

                                 SONNY
                        What?

                                 CASSIE
                        I live with my daughter. Please…

                                 SONNY
                        WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME THAT!?

           Vicki starts laughing at him.

                                 VICKI
                        You’re fucking unbelievable. Smart 
                        people don’t get away with murder, 
                        Sonny. Rich people. So you, Mr. 
                        GED, I don’t think you--

                                 SONNY
                        Shut up.
                                 VICKI
                        Okay. No, you’re right. You’ve 
                        clearly got this situation under 
                        control. 

                                 SONNY
                        I didn’t plan this. I’m just trying 
                        to make the best of a shitty 
                        situation.

                                 VICKI
                        Oh, poor Sonny. He tries. He tries 
                        so hard. Who cares if he fucks 
                        everything up. 

                                 CASSIE
                        My daughter’s only 13.

           Sonny’s not paying any attention to Cassie. 

                                 SONNY
                        I fuck everything up? That’s 
                        bullshit. I always provided for 
                        you. We went to fucking Bermuda. I 
                        bought you a house.

                                 VICKI
                        This house? The one they're about 
                        to take from you?

                                 SONNY
                        Just leave me alone!

                                 VICKI
                        How’s the margarita mix business 
                        these days? 

           Suddenly and without warning, Sonny takes the granite sample 
           in his hand and smashes Vicki in the face with it. The force 
           of it knocks her chair over. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh my God.

           Sonny leaps on top of his ex-wife, pummeling her face with 
           the jagged stone. Blow after blow. Blood spurts everywhere, 
           getting all over him. He’s a man possessed. He continues to 
           pound her face into pulp, long after it’s clear she’s dead. 

           Lefty is barking. Cassie struggles against her duct tape. 
           Sonny finally stops, breathing heavily. He collapses on the 
           ground in tears, then looks up at Cassie. His face is 
           dripping with blood.
                                 SONNY
                        Were you telling the truth?

                                 CASSIE
                        About what?

                                 SONNY
                        Do you have a daughter?

                                 CASSIE
                        No.

           Sonny looks upset. He looks down at Vicki. A dark red pool is 
           slowly spreading from her head.

                                 SONNY
                        So this was for nothing then? 
                        Because you’re a fucking liar?!

                                 CASSIE
                        She’s only 13.

           Sonny looks at her, then nods. He stands up and walks out the 
           door, dropping the bloody hunk of granite on the floor.

           The door to the garage opens and slams shut. A car starts up. 
           Cassie peaks over at the base of the kitchen island. The 
           knife is still there, on the floor. 

           She starts maneuvering her chair over to it, except the pool 
           of blood has now reached her feet. The floor is slick and 
           sticky. The chair leg slips and Cassie falls forward.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh shit.

           She slams face first into the ground. This time the screen 
           does go black.

           EXT. CASSIE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Sonny pulls his SUV into Cassie’s driveway. He’s managed to 
           wipe Vicki’s blood off his face, but not his shirt. He double-
           checks the address on Cassie’s license.

           He approaches the house and rings the bell. After a beat, the 
           door opens, chained from the inside. Morgan peers out.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hello?

                                 SONNY
                        Are you Cassie Francis’s daughter? 
                        (BEAT) You’re so pretty.
                                 MORGAN
                        What’s going on?

                                 SONNY
                        Your mom’s been in a terrible car 
                        accident. She sent me to get you.

           Morgan looks at the blood on his shirt.

                                 SONNY
                        We don’t have a lot of time.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hold on.

           She takes out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial button. 
           There’s a ringing from Sonny’s pocket. It’s Cassie’s phone. 
           He takes it out, a little sheepishly.

                                 SONNY
                        She gave it to me so I could call 
                        you.

                                 MORGAN
                        But you didn’t call me.

           A beat.

                                 SONNY
                        In case I got lost. We really have 
                        to go. Her life depends on it.

           Morgan thinks about it for a second. 

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m gonna call my dad--

           Even chained, the door is open wide enough for Sonny to reach 
           his arm in and grab at Morgan’s wrist. He misses, but manages 
           to knock the cell phone out of her hand. It hits the floor 
           and splinters into pieces.

           Morgan screams and runs upstairs. Sonny tries to reach in and 
           unlock the chain, to no avail. He thinks for a second, then 
           walks around to the back of the house. Locating a sliding 
           glass door, he uses Cassie’s trick from the beginning of the 
           movie and pops it off it’s rail.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie’s eyes snap open. The chair is on it’s side. Her head 
           is resting in a pool of blood slowly seeping from the almost 
           headless dead body next to her. Lefty laps at the blood 
           hungrily.
           Cassie looks for the knife. It’s lying on the ground fifteen 
           feet away. She tries to maneuver over to it, pushing with her 
           tip-toes, but she’s just spinning around in circles.

           Thrusting her hips, she realizes that the cheap IKEA chair 
           she’s tied to is starting to break - the seat is pulling away 
           from the back. She starts thrashing about, ripping the home-
           assembled chair apart, little by little.

           Lefty saunters over to see what the commotion is. He starts 
           licking at her face, leaving slimy, bloody streaks. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Stop, Lefty.

           The dog keeps licking. He’s being playful.

                                 CASSIE
                        GET AWAY FROM ME!!

           She head butts the dog, who jumps back, slipping and landing 
           on his side in the puddle of blood. He pops back up and runs 
           out of the room, his golden hair matted and red.

           INT. CASSIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny tiptoes to the front hall of Cassie’s house, where 
           Morgan’s cell phone lies on the ground in pieces. He picks up 
           a cordless phone sitting on an end-table. He hears a dial 
           tone, then stands there quietly, peering up the stairs.

           Suddenly, there’s beeping from the phone in his hands. Morgan 
           is dialing out on another handset from somewhere in the 
           house. 9-1… but just before she dials the second “1” Sonny 
           manages to hit ‘9’ on his handset. 

           He listens for a moment. After a beat of silence, he talks 
           into the phone.

                                 SONNY
                        (SOOTHING VOICE) 911. What’s your 
                        emergency?

           ANGLE ON: Morgan is in Cassie’s bedroom, frantically 
           rummaging through her mother’s drawers, looking for something 
           to protect herself with.

                                 MORGAN
                        (WHISPERING) There’s somebody in 
                        the house.

                                 SONNY (V.O.)
                        Okay, an intruder. And you’re at 84 
                        Sunset Lane, is that right?
                                 MORGAN
                        Yeah. Please come.

                                 SONNY (V.O.)
                        And where are you right now? 

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m in my mom’s room.

           Morgan finds a box of condoms, a pack of cigarettes, and a 
           plastic lighter hidden in her mom’s underwear drawer. She 
           makes a face and shoves the lighter into her back pocket.

           ANGLE ON: Sonny, cupping his hand over his mouth so he can 
           keep his voice from carrying upstairs. 

                                 SONNY
                        And where is that?

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 SONNY
                        Specifically. Where in the house is 
                        it? So I know where to send the 
                        officers.

           ANGLE ON: In the bedroom upstairs, Morgan stops what she’s 
           doing. She looks a little confused.

                                 MORGAN
                        Upstairs. On the second floor.

                                 SONNY
                        To the right or left, at the top 
                        the stairs.

                                 MORGAN
                        The left. All the way at the end of 
                        the hall.

           ANGLE ON: Downstairs, Sonny smiles, pleased with himself.

                                 SONNY
                        Well okay then. You just stay where 
                        you are. Don’t move. Someone will 
                        be there in a second.

           He hangs up, then silently climbs the stairs, turning left at 
           the top and walking to the closed door at the end of the 
           hall. He puts his hand on the door knob, pauses for a second, 
           then kicks the door open. It’s not Cassie’s bedroom.
           Behind him, at the other end of the hall, Morgan throws open 
           the actual door to Cassie’s room and sprints out, heading for 
           the stairs.

           Sonny turns. His eyes go wide. She tricked him. He starts to 
           run after her, but she has a head start. She’s already at the 
           stairs. 

           And then, for no good reason, Morgan trips over her own feet. 
           She tumbles to the ground and face-plants on the wooden 
           floor, her head bouncing painfully off the ground.

           She groans and looks up at Sonny, now standing over her.

                                 SONNY
                        What if your mom was really in a 
                        car accident? She could be dead by 
                        now.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie is furiously jerking her body back and forth, up and 
           down, slamming the chair against the tile floor. Finally, it 
           comes apart into pieces. 

           Cassie is able to pull her hands free, though they’re each 
           still duct-taped to unwieldy pieces of chair. She rips the 
           tape off her ankles and then her wrists. 

           She walks over, a little unsteady, and grabs the knife off 
           the ground. She heads into the house.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie hurries through the McMansion, looking everywhere. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Come on. Shit. Where the hell is a 
                        fucking phone? 

           She freezes when she hears the garage door open. She hurries 
           back into the kitchen and bolts out the back door.

           EXT. SONNY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie runs past the pool, through a gate in the back fence, 
           and onto the unfinished golf course. She sprints out across 
           the ocean of dirt without looking back. 

           A moment later, she comes to the edge of a ten foot drop - a 
           “cliff” where desert winds and summer thunderstorms have 
           eaten away at a hill of dirt. Cassie is able to stop just in 
           time, but the loose dirt underfoot gives way. 
           As the ground crumbles beneath her, Cassie falls, landing 
           awkwardly on her ankle and almost stabbing herself with the 
           knife.

           She swears, but gets up and keeps going, limping slightly.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny enters the house, dragging Morgan by the wrist. Lefty 
           scampers over to greet them, happily. 

                                 SONNY
                        Hey buddy. (TO MORGAN) This is 
                        Lefty. Named him after Phil 
                        Mickelson. He’s not really a puppy 
                        anymore, but he still thinks he is.

           Morgan looks down at Lefty. He’s covered in blood.

                                 SONNY
                        He likes it when you scratch his 
                        butt.

           Sonny looks through the hallway into the kitchen. He spots 
           the broken pieces of chair on the floor. 

                                 SONNY
                        Oh fuck.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie is still running across the golf course when she comes 
           to the nine foot tall, pink, concrete wall from the beginning 
           of the movie. She looks right and left. The wall seems to 
           encircle the entire development. 

           Cassie checks behind her. Seeing nobody, she drops her knife, 
           then jumps up and grabs onto the top of the wall with her 
           fingertips. She’s able to pull herself up and swing one leg 
           over. She takes a breath, then leaps down to the other side.

           She looks out at the vast desert all around her. It’s hot and 
           big and empty. So she starts running along the outside of the 
           wall, following it back around towards town.

           INT. GUARD SHACK - LATER

           Inside the guard shack at the entrance to Sonny’s 
           development, a pimply faced 18 year-old security guard named 
           SHANE is playing a game on his iPhone. A Rottweiler lies at 
           his feet, wheezing in the heat.
           Cassie, bruised and sticky with blood and dust, knocks on the 
           window behind him. Shane, startled, almost jumps out of his 
           chair. He spins around, white as a ghost.

                                 SHANE
                        Oh my God! What the fuck!

           The dog is barking loudly and bearing it’s teeth. Shane has 
           to hold him back.

                                 SHANE
                        Down. DOWN! (TO CASSIE) What’s 
                        going on?

                                 CASSIE
                        I need to use your phone.

                                 SHANE
                        What for? Why?

                                 CASSIE
                        There’s been a murder.

                                 SHANE
                        Holy shit. (THEN) They’re not 
                        paying me.

                                 CASSIE
                        What?

                                 SHANE
                        They haven’t paid me for, like, two 
                        months. I don’t think I should have 
                        to do anything, y’know, dangerous 
                        because--

                                 CASSIE
                        (SHARP) I need to use your goddamn 
                        phone!

           EXT. SONNY’S DEVELOPMENT - MAIN GATE - LATER

           Cassie crouches in a shadow by the front entrance to Sonny’s 
           gated community. A stone sign with gold metal letters reads 
           “Welcome to the Las Casas de Oro Luxury Experience. Where 
           Life Imitates Vacation.” 

           Shane stands by the guard shack, staring warily into the 
           development, his hand on his tazer. Cassie dials a number on 
           the iPhone. She’s sent straight to voicemail.
                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Hi, this is Morgan’s cell phone. If 
                        you don’t know what to do after the 
                        beep, I guess you’re screwed. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Shit.

           She hangs up and dials again.

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Hi, this is Morgan’s cell phone. If 
                        you don’t know--

                                 CASSIE
                        Shit!

           She takes a deep breath, then dials a new number.

                                 SCOTT (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 CASSIE
                        Scott?

           INT. SCOTT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Scott, Cassie’s ex-husband, is on the couch next to his 
           young, blonde, perky girlfriend KELSEY (24 and wearing a 
           “Shut up and Sweat” tee-shirt). He’s paying bills on a laptop 
           while she watches “For the Love of Ray J” on VH1. She lies 
           with her legs in the air, draped over the back of the couch. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey Cass, what’s up? Who’s number 
                        is this?

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        I borrowed it from some kid. I 
                        think something happened to Morgan. 

           Scott walks towards the kitchen to get away from the TV.

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

           There’s a police siren from Cassie’s end.

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s going on?

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        I’m not sure. The cops are here. I 
                        have to go. Can you come?
                                 SCOTT
                        Of course. I’m coming. But tell me 
                        what happened.

           EXT. SONNY’S DEVELOPMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A battered police SUV screeches to a halt in front of Cassie, 
           siren blaring.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m at the Las Casas de Oro 
                        development. Just get here. I don’t 
                        have my cell. I don’t know where 
                        I’ll be. 

                                 SCOTT (V.O.)
                        Okay, but it’s rush hour. It’ll 
                        take me forev--

                                 CASSIE
                        I really need you, Scott.

           She hangs up the phone.

           INT. SCOTT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           In the kitchen, Scott looks at his phone for a moment, then 
           over at Kelsey who’s now standing in the doorway.

                                 KELSEY
                        Like, what did Princess want?

           EXT. SONNY’S DEVELOPMENT - CONTINUOUS

           COBURN, an older police officer, gets out of the car. He 
           wears snake-skin boots, a cowboy hat, and has the creased, 
           weather-beaten face of a sherif from the Wild West. 

                                 COBURN
                        (TO SHANE) You called in a 
                        homicide?

                                 CASSIE
                        A guy in there has my daughter. 
                        He’s already killed two people.

                                 COBURN
                        A man has your daughter? And 
                        they’re in there right now?

                                 CASSIE
                        Yes. I think.
                                 COBURN
                        You think he has your daughter or 
                        you think they’re in there right 
                        now?

                                 CASSIE
                        Both.

           Coburn sizes her up thoughtfully.

                                 COBURN
                        Okay. Now this--

           Shane interrupts him, holding his hand out towards Cassie.

                                 SHANE
                        Can I have my phone back?

                                 CASSIE
                        What?

                                 SHANE
                        My phone. My iPhone.

           Cassie stares at him in disbelief.

                                 SHANE
                        It cost, like, $400.

                                 CASSIE
                        Yes, you can have your iPhone back.

           She hands it back to him.

                                 SHANE
                        (POINTED) You’re welcome.

           Coburn smiles at Cassie, unfazed.

                                 COBURN
                        Now this man you think has your 
                        daughter, do you know him? 

                                 CASSIE
                        No, but his name is Sonny. I don’t 
                        know his last name.

                                 COBURN
                        Do you know where Sonny lives?

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t know the address. But I can 
                        find it if we drive past.
                                 COBURN
                        (TO SHANE) How many exits does 
                        this… “luxury experience” have.

                                 SHANE
                        This is the gate. It’s the only way 
                        in or out. Unless you, like, go 
                        over the wall.

                                 COBURN
                        And do you know this Sonny?

                                 SHANE
                        They stopped, like, paying me, 
                        like, months ago.

           Cassie is getting agitated by the pace of this conversation. 

                                 CASSIE
                        (SNAPPING) So why are you still in 
                        uniform you little prick?!

           Coburn takes off his sunglasses.

                                 COBURN
                        Ma’am.

                                 SHANE
                        Fuck you lady. If I work, like, a 
                        job all summer, my dad’s buying me 
                        a truck. So I’m not fucking gonna 
                        quit.

                                 COBURN
                        Did you know this Sonny before they 
                        (GENTLY MOCKING) like, stopped 
                        paying you?

                                 SHANE
                        I don’t know any of these assholes. 
                        Do you think any of them know my 
                        name?

           Cassie closes her eyes, trying to contain her anger.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh my God.

                                 COBURN
                        Would it be asking too much for you 
                        to look it up on that PC of yours?

                                 SHANE
                        No, okay. Whatever.
           He types something into a computer. Then something else.

                                 SHANE
                        We don’t have a “Sonny.”

                                 COBURN
                        Might be a nickname. 

                                 CASSIE
                        He did business with my boss. If 
                        you send backup, they could pull 
                        the name from the computer. 

                                 COBURN
                        There’s no backup, Ma’am.

                                 CASSIE
                        Why? Why not?

                                 COBURN
                        The entire Harding police force is 
                        already on the case.

           He gestures to himself with his thumb.  

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 COBURN
                        Four years ago, this was a small 
                        agricultural community. 800 people 
                        plus 300 illegals. We weren’t even 
                        incorporated.

                                 CASSIE
                        And in four years of massive 
                        population growth, nobody thought 
                        it might be a good idea to expand 
                        the police force to, I don’t know, 
                        two fucking people?!

                                 COBURN
                        Do you know how long it takes a 
                        state task force to perform a 
                        (MOCKING THE JARGON) mandatory 
                        study necessary to establish proper 
                        levels for allocation of 
                        supplemental government services?

                                 CASSIE
                        (THROUGH GRITTED TEETH) Four years?
                                 COBURN
                        Three. ‘Cept by the time they were 
                        finished, you people were suddenly 
                        fleeing just as fast as you came. 
                        So they ordered a new study.

                                 CASSIE
                        So what are we gonna do?

                                 COBURN
                        You said where you could find where 
                        he lives?

           Cassie nods. Coburn puts his sunglasses back on.

                                 COBURN
                        Then hi ho silver. 

           INT. SCOTT’S CAR - LATER

           The convertible is stopped in traffic on a freeway onramp 
           leaving Phoenix. Scott is getting frustrated. A Katy Perry 
           song plays on the radio. Kelsey sings along to herself.

                                 KELSEY
                        …you change your mind, like a girl 
                        changes clothes. Yeah you PMS, like 
                        a bitch, I would know…

                                 SCOTT
                        (IRRITATED) Where are all these 
                        people going?!

           He snaps the radio off. Kelsey shoots him a huffy look.

                        I don’t know. She had to go.

                        then, like, doesn’t give any 
                        details and stops answering their 
                        phone?

                                 SCOTT
                        The cops came. I’m sure it was 
                        serious.

                        Whatever. It’s always serious when 
                        she needs your help.

           Scott looks at her wearily. They’ve had this fight before.

                                 SCOTT
                        My daughter is in trouble.

                        wrong, it’s, like, mean of her to 
                        not tell us anything. And if 
                        nothing’s wrong, then it’s, like, 
                        mean of her to scare us like this.

                                 SCOTT
                        You don’t seem all that scared.

                        supposed to sit here in silence, 
                        looking sad?

           She makes an exggerated pouty face. Scott sighs and looks out 
           the window. They sit silently for a long beat. Then Kelsey 
           reaches down and turns the radio back on.

           INT. POLICE SUV - LATER

           Cassie and Coburn drive through Sonny’s development.

                                 COBURN
                        How many of these houses have 
                        people living in them?
                                 CASSIE
                        Maybe one in ten.

           Coburn grunts disapprovingly as he eyes the enormous houses.

                                 COBURN
                        Privacy. Isn’t that what they came 
                        for?

           Cassie really doesn’t want to have this conversation, she’s 
           studying the houses, looking for Sonny’s.

                                 CASSIE
                        I think it’s down one of these 
                        streets. 

           Coburns reads passing street signs, disdainfully.

                                 COBURN
                        Bee Balm Road? Whispering Wind 
                        Lane?Pink Savory Way? 

           He looks at Cassie, who’s not amused.

                                 COBURN
                        Ma’am, if someone has your 
                        daughter, we’ll find her. I promise 
                        you that.

                                 CASSIE
                        Turn here. 

           Coburn turns onto a street that dead ends in a cul-de-sac. 

                                 CASSIE
                        There. On the left.

           Cassie points to a big, gray McMansion. Coburn pulls over. 

                                 COBURN
                        How can you tell? They’re all 
                        identical.

           He’s right. The other houses have all been built from the 
           exact same plan.

                                 CASSIE
                        The lawn’s green. 

                                 COBURN
                        We saw other green lawns.
                                 CASSIE
                        But not right on the golf course-- 
                        Look, I’m a real estate agent. I’ve 
                        showed houses in here. I know my 
                        way around. 

                                 COBURN
                        (NODS) You wait here.

           He gets out of the SUV. Cassie does too. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m coming with you.

           Coburn looks at her for a beat.

                                 COBURN
                        Stay ten paces back.

                                 CASSIE
                        Paces?

           Coburn unholsters his handgun and approaches the front door 
           silently. Cassie tiptoes behind him. 

                                 CASSIE
                        (WHISPERS) He has a lot of guns.

                                 COBURN
                        That’s alright. (SMILES) So do I.

           With one swift motion, he kicks in the front door. The shoddy 
           construction gives little resistance. The front foyer is 
           quiet and empty.

                                 COBURN
                        Hello? 

           There’s no answer.

                                 COBURN
                        (TO CASSIE) Wait out there.

           Cassie stays put. Coburn steps silently into the house, gun 
           drawn. He’s done this sort of thing before. Coburn surveys 
           his surroundings, then leans cautiously into the living room. 

           Suddenly, a middle aged WOMAN pops out from the other side of 
           the wall and pepper sprays him in the face. Acting on pure 
           reflex, Coburn pulls the trigger, shooting her in the chest. 
           She exhales sharply, like somebody being punched. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Ooff.
           She falls to her knees. Coburn is already on the ground, 
           hunched over and clawing at his red, swollen eyes.

                                 COBURN
                        Godammit. Godammit! Who did I 
                        shoot?!

           Cassie comes running in. She freezes when she sees the 
           furniture in the living room.

                                 CASSIE
                        This isn’t the house.

                                 COBURN
                        You said you could tell! You’re a 
                        goddamn real estate agent!

                                 CASSIE
                        All these units look exactly the 
                        same!

           The woman slumps over on the ground. She looks up at Cassie 
           through glazed eyes. Blood pools in the corner of her mouth.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh my God.

                                 COBURN
                        Did I kill her?

                                 CASSIE
                        No. Shit. I don’t think so. But we 
                        have to get my daughter. Shit. I’ll 
                        call an ambulance, you just-- Can 
                        we-- shit!

           Coburn is kneeling now, rubbing his eyes. 

                                 COBURN
                        Hold on. Just hold on. I reckon I 
                        can still see.

           He blinks. Then blinks again.

                                 COBURN
                        God in Heaven. I’ve never been--

           There’s a gunshot from out of nowhere. A bullet rips through 
           Coburn’s head. He’s dead before he hits the ground. Cassie 
           stumbles backwards. She looks up at the front door to see 
           Sonny standing there, holding a handgun.

                                 SONNY
                        Wow. That was really loud.
           He looks down at Cassie.

                                 SONNY
                        You drove right past my house. I 
                        couldn’t believe it. I mean, who 
                        even lives here?

           He looks down at the woman lying on the ground. She’s not 
           breathing.

                                  SONNY
                        Oh. (THEN) See? Other people kill 
                        people too. Shit happens, right?

                                 CASSIE
                        Where’s my daughter?

           Sonny walks over and points his gun right at her.

                                 SONNY
                        I was bringing her back to you so 
                        we could work something out. But 
                        now, since you lied to me about not 
                        going to the cops…

                                 CASSIE
                        If you’ve hurt her, I swear I’ll--

                                 SONNY
                        (TOUGH GUY) You’ll what? What’re 
                        you gonna do, Cassie?! 

           Sonny raises the handgun up over his head in a violent 
           backswing. He’s about to bring the butt of the gun down on 
           Cassie’s head when he freezes.

                                 SONNY
                        Oh crap.

           He winces in pain and grabs the small of his back with his 
           other arm. The gun hand is still raised.

                                 SONNY
                        My back, my back, my back. Oh fuck.

           Cassie eyes the gun lying on the ground in Coburn’s stiff 
           hand. It’s maybe seven feet away. 

                                 SONNY
                        Oh god, oh god. This is not good. 
                        Fuck! 

           Cassie inches towards Coburn’s body. Sonny sees her.
                                 SONNY
                        Uh uh. Don’t even think it.

           He points the gun at her, though the act of bringing it down 
           obviously causes him considerable pain. 

                                 SONNY
                        I can still, ow--motherfucker! I 
                        can still end this.

           He stands there for a long beat, aiming the gun right at her 
           forehead. 

                                 SONNY
                        Shit. This is gonna screw up 
                        everything. 

           He drops the gun to his side.

                                 SONNY
                        I guess I need your help. Welcome 
                        to Team Sonny.

           INT. WOMAN’S HOUSE - GARAGE

           They enter the woman’s garage. Sonny hobbles stiffly behind 
           Cassie, his gun in her back. He grimaces with each step.

                                 SONNY
                        Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

           There’s an enormous red Chevy Suburban parked in one spot and 
           a jet-ski on a trailer in the other.

                                 SONNY
                        Open the garage door.

           Cassie locates the control panel. She presses a button and 
           the garage door opens. 

                                 SONNY
                        Catch.

           She turns just as he tosses a set of keys at her. She catches 
           them, then looks down. They’re covered in blood. The key-
           chain has a small pepper-spray canister attached to it. It 
           came from the dead woman’s hands.

                                 CASSIE
                        What do I do with these?

                                 SONNY
                        You’re driving.
           Cassie looks at him questioningly.

                                 SONNY
                        Back her out, park her on the 
                        street, pull the cop car in. Can’t 
                        leave that baby sitting out there 
                        in plain sight, and my fucking back 
                        can’t take it. Getting in and out 
                        of cars is the worst. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Okay.

                                 SONNY
                        You thinking about driving off 
                        without me?

                                 CASSIE
                        I promise I wouldn’t--

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not interested in your promises 
                        anymore.

                                 CASSIE
                        But--

                                 SONNY
                        Trusting people is what got me into 
                        this fucking mess. So just know 
                        this: if you drive off, I’ll kill 
                        your daughter. I’ll make her 
                        suffer, then I’ll slit her goddamn 
                        throat.

                                 CASSIE
                        How do I know you even have her?

                                 SONNY
                        Big girl, isn’t she?

           There’s a beat. Cassie nods. Sonny’s phone buzzes in his 
           pocket. He looks down at it.

                                 SONNY
                        Oh, hey, this is my son. I’m gonna 
                        take this. (ANSWERING) What’s up 
                        Buddy? (THEN) You did? That’s super 
                        awesome.

           Cassie gets into the Suburban and puts it into reverse. Sonny 
           watches, pointing the gun at her with one hand, holding the 
           phone with the other.
                                 SONNY
                        (INTO PHONE) Well I promised I 
                        would, didn’t I? (BEAT) I’ll buy 
                        the tickets today.

           Cassie backs out and parks on the street. Before turning off 
           the car, she looks over at Sonny. He’s walked out to the edge 
           of the garage, still talking on the phone. 

           He looks up at Cassie and gives her a throat slit gesture. 

           Cassie turns the engine off. In doing so, she tests the 
           pepper spray container on the key-chain. Nothing comes out. 
           She leaves the keys in the ignition and gets out.

           INT. SCOTT”S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Scott and Kelsey are sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on 
           the freeway. Scott is agitated. Kelsey cups her hand in front 
           of her face and breathes, trying to smell her own breath.

                                 KELSEY
                        Do we have mints?

           She checks the cup-holders then opens the glove compartment.

                                 KELSEY
                        OMG.

           She pulls out a small .22 caliber pistol.

                                 KELSEY
                        I thought you, like, never ever 
                        wanted to see me with this ever. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t.

           He takes it from her and shoves it back into the glove 
           compartment.

                                 KELSEY
                        I, like, grew up shooting. You’re 
                        the one who’s, like, never even 
                        fired a gun. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I know.

                                 KELSEY
                        So why can’t I hold it?

                                 SCOTT
                        Because I said so.
                                 KELSEY
                        Please?

                                 SCOTT
                        No.

                                 KELSEY
                        Pretty please?

                                 SCOTT
                        No.

                                 KELSEY
                        I’ll give you a blow job.

           Scott just looks at her. She crosses her arms.

                                 KELSEY
                        (POUTY) It’s my gun. (THEN) Why did 
                        you even bring it?

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. Cassie doesn’t 
                        usually sound scared like that. So 
                        just-- in case, I guess.

                                 KELSEY
                        In case you need to gun some 
                        motherfucker down.

                                 SCOTT
                        In case I need to protect my 
                        family. 
                        (BEAT) My daughter.

                                 KELSEY
                        You never even told me where you 
                        hid the bullets.

           Scott gestures to the back of the car with his thumb.

                                 SCOTT
                        In the trunk.

                                 KELSEY
                        What? You know they could go off 
                        back there if it gets hot enough.

                                 SCOTT
                        Really?
                                 KELSEY
                        (GIGGLING) No. You’re such a dork. 
                        (THEN) God help us if you actually 
                        have to shoot somebody.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sonny leads Cassie into the living room. Morgan is lying on 
           the couch, bound with duct tape. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom?

                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan. Oh my God.

           She goes over to her daughter. Sonny leans against a wall in 
           obvious pain.

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you hurt, sweetie?

                                 MORGAN
                        Why is this happening?

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s gonna be okay.

                                 MORGAN
                        How?! Where’s dad.

                                 CASSIE
                        Dad’s not here. He’s not coming.

                                 MORGAN
                        Why not?

           Cassie glances at Sonny.

                                 CASSIE
                        I didn’t want to call him.

                                 SONNY
                        Look, here’s the deal. We need to 
                        wait ‘til it’s dark. Probably 
                        another hour. So lets all sit, make 
                        believe we’re friends, and watch 
                        some TV, okay?

                                 CASSIE
                        What are we waiting for?

                                 SONNY
                        Let’s just watch TV. 
           He picks up a remote and turns the TV on. He navigates the 
           DVR menu to HBO.

                                 SONNY
                        How about Australia? 

           No response from Morgan or Cassie. Sonny shrugs.

                                 SONNY
                        Kind of a chick flick.

           He turns it on. The movie plays for a beat. Nicole Kidman 
           stares into the thoughtful eyes of an aboriginal boy.

                                 SONNY
                        (RE: TV) Great picture, right? 
                        (THEN) You should see a Blu-Ray.

           INT. SONNY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           They’re all watching a Blu-Ray of Troy. Cassie and Morgan are 
           on the couch, both bound with duct tape. Sonny lies on the 
           floor, flat on his back. Next to him is his gun, a little 
           orange bottle of pain medication, and his cell phone. It 
           rings. He sits up, stiffly.

                                 SONNY
                        There we go, feeling a little 
                        better. 

           He checks the caller ID on his phone but decides not to 
           answer. He looks out the window. It’s totally dark out.

                                 SONNY
                        Let’s hit the golf course.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - LATER

           It’s pitch black on the unfinished golf course. Cassie and 
           Morgan are struggling to carry the body of Vicki, Sonny’s ex-
           wife. Morgan has the feet. Cassie has the shoulders. What 
           little remains of Vicki’s head dangles limply from her neck. 
           Two shovels rest precariously on the body.

           Sonny walks behind them, a gun in one hand and a huge, police-
           grade Maglite in the other. 

                                 SONNY
                        Bodies are heavy, right? Sorry to 
                        make you carry her, but I can’t 
                        risk it with my back. One time I 
                        was in bed for eight days from 
                        tying my shoes.
           Walking backwards, Morgan trips over an exposed irrigation 
           pipe. She stumbles and lets Vicki go, landing on her hands 
           and knees. The body and shovels tumble to the ground.

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus H. Christ. 

           Cassie kneels down beside her daughter.

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you okay sweetie?

           Sonny shines the flashlight on Morgan’s face. Tears are 
           streaming down it. Sonny sighs.

                                 SONNY
                        Well I guess this seems like a good 
                        enough place.

                                 CASSIE
                        For what?

                                 SONNY
                        Haven’t you ever seen a movie? 
                        You’re gonna dig me a grave.

                                 CASSIE
                        (RE: VICKI’S BODY) Just for her?

                                 SONNY
                        Her and Gary. The cop can stay 
                        where he is. (BEAT) Unless you 
                        think someone else is gonna end up 
                        dead.

           Cassie doesn’t say anything.

                                 SONNY
                        Oh come on, Cassie. Have a little 
                        faith in me. My back is royally 
                        fucked. I can’t dig. I can’t carry 
                        bodies. You’re doing me a big 
                        favor.

           Cassie looks down at the gun, then back to him. 

                                 SONNY
                        And your reward for that favor is 
                        that I won’t kill you.

           He gestures back and forth with the flashlight.

                                 SONNY
                        Now get digging.
           Cassie lifts her shovel and starts digging. Sonny pops off 
           the top of the Maglite and attaches it to the bottom, 
           exposing the bulb. It creates a broad area of light.

                                 SONNY
                        Candle mode. Cool, right?

           He puts it on the ground by his feet. Morgan isn’t digging.

                                 SONNY
                        You too, kid.

           Morgan looks tearfully at Cassie.

                                 CASSIE
                        (TO SONNY) She’s a child.

                                 SONNY
                        Right, and children can’t be 
                        expected to do anything anymore. Do 
                        you know I had a job when I was 
                        ten? 

                                 CASSIE
                        (SHARPLY) She’s scared.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom, it’s okay.

                                 SONNY
                        See mom, it’s okay.

           Morgan starts to dig, but she’s bad at it. The shovel doesn’t 
           get very far into the ground, and doesn’t come up with much. 

           There’s a strong gust of wind. Dirt blows everywhere.

                                 SONNY
                        Goddamn hot wind. I never get used 
                        to it.

           Cassie says nothing. She just keeps digging. 

                                 SONNY
                        So, just ballpark, how long do you 
                        think this is gonna take?

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t know. I’ve never dug a 
                        grave before.

                                 SONNY
                        Have I? I’m just saying, twenty 
                        minutes? Forty?
                                 CASSIE
                        How long does it take in the 
                        movies?

                                 SONNY
                        They always cut away.

           Cassie and Morgan continue to dig. We don’t cut away.

                                 SONNY
                        (IMPATIENTLY) What’s the girl’s 
                        name again?

                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan.

                                 SONNY
                        Do you think you could dig just a 
                        little faster, Morgan?

           Morgan is already a little out of breath.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m going as fast as I can.

                                 SONNY
                        I think we both know that’s not 
                        true.

           Morgan tries to dig faster. It’s a little spastic. Cassie 
           tries to calm her.

                                 CASSIE
                        Just do the best you can, sweetie.

                                 SONNY
                        No, see, no. That’s the attitude 
                        that probably got her into this… 
                        shape. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’ll dig. You leave her the hell 
                        alone!

                                 SONNY
                        (MOCKING) She’s fat, but it’s not 
                        her fault. She just got that way 
                        randomly. And it’s awesome if she 
                        tries to lose weight, but it’s also 
                        awesome if she doesn’t. No 
                        judgment. Do the best you can, 
                        sweetie.
           Throughout all of this, Morgan has been digging faster and 
           faster. She’s not getting much dirt out, but she’s moving 
           quickly. Too quickly. She’s seems a bit crazed.

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s okay, baby, it’s okay. Stop.

           Morgan starts to cry. She crumples to the dirt, sobbing and 
           panting. Then she throws up.

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus. 

                                 CASSIE
                        (SHARP, TO SONNY) I told you to 
                        leave her alone.

                                 SONNY
                        Well that’s the miscommunication 
                        here, because I have a gun, so you 
                        don’t tell me--

           Sonny’s cell phone rings. 

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus. (RE: PHONE) These guys 
                        really don’t give up. You have to 
                        admire that, don’t you?

           He sends it to voicemail.

                                 SONNY
                        Anyway, I just thought you might 
                        want baby here to get a little 
                        exercise.

           His phone rings again.

                                 SONNY
                        Seriously?

           He sends it to voicemail.

                                 SONNY
                        I’ve had to change this number, 
                        like, eight times. I don’t even 
                        know what it is anymore.

           The phone rings again. He sends it to voicemail.

                                 SONNY
                        (ANGRY) God. Leave me alone. (AT 
                        CASSIE) How much longer?!
                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t know. Two hours? Three?

           They look down at the modest hole in the ground.

                                 SONNY
                        You’ll be done in an hour and a 
                        half. I don’t care how you do it.

                                 CASSIE
                        How am I going to do it except by 
                        shoveling?

                                 SONNY
                        (SHARP) Ninety minutes.

           Cassie, still looking at the hole, notices a bit of white PVC 
           pipe peeking out of the dirt. It’s the irrigation pipe Morgan 
           had tripped on earlier. 

                                 CASSIE
                        I’ll do the best I can.

           Cassie resumes digging. Sonny’s phone rings again. He looks 
           exasperated. As he looks down, Cassie raises her shovel high, 
           then brings the point down on the pipe as hard as she can. 
           Water explodes out of it, spraying in every direction. 

                                 SONNY
                        Whoa--

           Before Sonny can react, Cassie swings her shovel towards him, 
           releasing it so it goes flying. It misses him, but he ducks 
           and the sudden movement sends pain shooting from his back.

                                 SONNY
                        Ahhh! Fucker.

           As Sonny doubles over in pain, Cassie lunges for the 
           flashlight on the ground, knocking it over and shattering the 
           bulb. Darkness envelopes them. 

           There are running footsteps, rustling clothes, a thump, and a 
           gunshot. The flash from the gun briefly illuminates Sonny. 
           Then there’s nothing but blackness and the sound of rushing 
           water.

           Sonny, hunched over awkwardly, fumbles with his cell-phone 
           and tries to use it as a flashlight. He can only see two feet 
           in front of him. He spins around, disoriented. 

                                 SONNY
                        Shit.
           The camera tracks back into the darkness and down one of the 
           “cliffs” we saw Cassie tumble off of earlier. She and Morgan 
           are now crouching, hiding against the base of it. The cliff 
           is ten feet high and more eroded at the bottom than the top, 
           so they’re shielded from above by an dirt overhang. If Sonny 
           were to walk over and peer down the side, he wouldn’t see 
           them beneath him.

           Cassie has her hand over her daughter’s mouth. 

                                 CASSIE
                        (WHISPERS) Shhh.

           Sonny is completely turned around. He can’t hear anything but 
           the sound of the water. He stares off into the blackness.

                                 SONNY
                        (SHOUTING) Cassie! Why are you 
                        doing this? I told you I was gonna 
                        let you live!

           Cassie and Morgan look at each other, silently.

                                 SONNY
                        (SHOUTING) Okay, fuck it, now 
                        you’re dead. You and your fat slob 
                        of a daughter are fucking dead!

           His phone rings.

                                 SONNY
                        Leave me alone! Leave me alone! 
                        Leave me alone! 

           He answers violently.

                                 SONNY
                        (INTO PHONE) Look, you prick, if I 
                        had the money, I’d pay you! I’m not 
                        a crook! You think I don’t know how 
                        much I owe? You think I need 
                        somebody to call me every five 
                        seconds to remind me?! It’s all I 
                        think about! Every minute of every 
                        fucking day! Your job is to scare 
                        me, make me feel shitty? Well I 
                        feel plenty shitty and scared on my 
                        own, so you can just LEAVE! ME! 
                        ALONE!

           He hurls the phone off into the night, back in the direction 
           of the houses. It lands in the dirt, the light from it’s 
           screen still visible off in the distance. Sonny takes a deep 
           breath.
                                 SONNY
                        Shit.

           He walks off after it, slowly and painfully. Cassie breathes 
           a silent sigh of relief and removes her hand from Morgan’s 
           mouth. But above them, the geyser from the irrigation pipe 
           has formed a huge pool of water. Under the weight of it, the 
           dirt overhang gives way. 

                                 CASSIE
                        What--

           She barely has time to stand up halfway before an avalanche 
           of dirt falls on her head. It comes down all around them. 

           We cut wide. Where Cassie and Morgan had been crouching, 
           there’s now just a pile of dirt.

           INT. SCOTT’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Scott and Kelsey are exiting the highway at the Harding exit. 
           Kelsey has the GPS unit out.

                                 KELSEY
                        Now where?

                                 SCOTT
                        She said to go to the… one of the 
                        developments. Shit. The something… 
                        something Spanish. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Okay. But what do I put in the GPS?

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t remember.

                                 KELSEY
                        Like, seriously?

           There’s a gas station on the other side of the street. Scott 
           jerks on the wheel and makes a dangerous U-turn. Kelsey is 
           thrown back against her seat.

                                 KELSEY
                        Jesus.

           INT. DIRT PILE - CONTINUOUS

           Pitch blackness. We can’t see anything. All we can hear is 
           Morgan breathing heavily.

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        Oh my God. Morgan?
                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Mom?

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        Are you okay? Can you breathe?

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Wait, hold on.

           There’s a rustle, then the sound of Morgan trying to spark a 
           plastic lighter. On the third attempt a flame appears. It 
           sheds light on the scene. 

           They’re buried alive.

           Morgan lies on the ground. Cassie leans over her, bent at the 
           waist, her arms up by her face. She props up a ceiling of 
           dirt with her head, arms and back -- like Atlas with the 
           world on his shoulders. It creates a tiny cave: an air pocket 
           between mother and daughter. All around them is dirt.

           Cassie tries to push up with her back, but the weight of the 
           dirt pressing down on her is too much. She dips her head and 
           shoulders to try to get more force, but all that does is 
           bring more dirt down on them. Some falls into Morgans mouth.

                                 MORGAN
                        Oh, ffhha… ugk.

           Morgan lets the lighter go out. It’s completely black again. 

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        Morgan!

           Morgan relights it, though it takes several attempts.

                                 MORGAN
                        Are we trapped?

                                 CASSIE
                        I don’t know.

                                 MORGAN
                        Yell for help.

                                 CASSIE
                        No, what if he--

           But Morgan is already screaming at the top of her lungs.

                                 MORGAN
                        Help! HELP! HELLLPPP! HELLLLLP!
           We cut outside the cave. With the thick wall of dirt 
           surrounding them, you can’t hear their screams at all.

           INT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Scott approaches the counter as a young, Mexican ATTENDANT 
           looks up from his magazine.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        What’s up, man?

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey. I’m looking for a housing 
                        development around here. One of the 
                        gated communities. 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Which one?

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t remember. That’s the 
                        problem. I know it’s something 
                        Spanish.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        The developments all have Mexican 
                        names. (SMILES) And no Mexicans 
                        living in them. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I guess they just think it sounds 
                        fancy.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Because what says fancy like 
                        Mexico?

           The attendant grins at his own joke. Scott’s look says he’s 
           not in the mood for banter.

                                 SCOTT
                        How many developments are there?

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Nine or ten. Was it something “de 
                        Oro”?

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes! Yeah, totally. 
                                 ATTENDANT
                        There’s five of them. Villa de Oro, 
                        La Costa de Oro, Las Casas de Oro, 
                        Rancho de Oro, and… (THINKING) wait 
                        for it… Vista de Oro.

           Scott blinks at him in disbelief. The attendant shrugs.

           Cassie is still holding up the dirt ceiling. Morgan is 
           freaking out, hyperventilating.

                                 CASSIE
                        Calm down baby. Calm down. I’m 
                        gonna get us out of here.

                                 MORGAN
                        We’re buried alive. We’re gonna 
                        die.

                                 CASSIE
                        I just need to think.

           Cassie closes her eyes. Then she reopens them. A strand of 
           her hair, hanging down over her face, is blowing slightly. 
           There’s a breeze in there.

                                 CASSIE
                        Wind.

                                 MORGAN
                        What?

                                 CASSIE
                        Hold the light by the wall.

           Morgan holds the lighter up against the back wall of the tiny 
           cave, the original cliff face they had been hiding against. 

           There’s a small round hole - the opening to a tunnel. Cassie 
           moves her head slightly, maneuvering so her mouth is right by 
           the hole. More dirt rains down from the ceiling onto Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom!

           Cassie feels the breeze on her face. 

                                 CASSIE
                        It goes outside. We have air.
                                 MORGAN
                        Yell out it for help!

                                 CASSIE
                        No, it means we don’t have to 
                        panic. We’re not gonna suffocate. 
                        We can at least wait to make sure 
                        he’s gone. 

           Cassie puts her mouth right up to the hole and inhales.

                                 CASSIE
                        Just take deep brea-- aggh. Uchh--

           Cassie gags and jerks her head back. A desert squirrel 
           (halfway between a chipmunk and a gray squirrel) pokes it’s 
           head out of the hole. The flame from the lighter reflects off 
           it’s beady black eyes. Morgan freaks out.

                                 MORGAN
                        Ahhhh!

           The squirrel jumps down onto her. She lets the lighter go out 
           as she tries to get it off. In the darkness, the only sound 
           is of Morgan screaming.

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        Morgan, the lighter.

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Ah! AHHH! Ah! AhHH!

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        The lighter!

           Morgan is thrashing around in the blackness.

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Mom! Ew! Mom! There’s two.

                                 CASSIE (V.O.)
                        I can’t see! Use the lighter.

           Morgan tries to strike the lighter. It takes four attempts. 
           When there’s finally a flame, another squirrel is making it’s 
           way out of the hole. It jumps down onto Morgan. It’s followed 
           by another squirrel. Then another.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh god.

           The squirrels keep coming. An endless stream. The small cave 
           is filling up with them - a writhing, teeming mass of fur and 
           claws. Twenty squirrels. Then thirty.
                                 CASSIE
                        Cover your face.

           The lighter goes out. Morgan relights it. The hand with the 
           lighter, held aloft, is now the only part of her that’s 
           visible. The rest of her is buried in squirrels. Her screams 
           are lost in the cacophony of squeaking and clawing.

                                 CASSIE
                        Get away from her! 

           Cassie tries to kick at them, but the squirrels just keep 
           pouring out of the hole. There must be fifty of them now, 
           jammed into the tiny space.

           Morgan is struggling to hold the lighter aloft above the 
           rising tide of squirrels. It goes out and she lights it 
           again. She gets it on the first try this time, but she also 
           lights a strand of Cassie’s hair on fire. 

           As the flames spread up towards Cassie’s face, she screams. 
           Several of the squirrels catch fire as well. Their fur burns 
           with brilliant orange flames. 

           Cassie pulls her hands down to slap at the flames. Removing 
           her hands causes the roof to completely cave in. Dirt comes 
           down all around them. The screen goes black. 

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS

           We cut outside the collapsed dirt mound. Everything is still. 
           After what feels like an eternity, a squirrel comes burrowing 
           through the dirt, poking it’s head out and scampering away.

           Suddenly another squirrel appears, burrowing a different 
           hole. Then another. Then another. They’re streaming out of 
           the dirt pile like rats fleeing a sinking ship.

           Finally, with the mound weakened by all the holes, Cassie is 
           able to stand up, emerging from the dirt like a zombie rising 
           from the grave. She stumbles backward, gasping for air, and 
           lands on her back.

           She immediately runs back to the dirt pile, digging for 
           Morgan. She finds her daughter’s hand and pulls her out. The 
           two of them collapse in a heap, panting and gagging.

           From all around them, squirrels continue to burrow out of the 
           dirt and flee into the night. 
           EXT. VISTA DE ORO - FRONT GATE - CONTINUOUS

           Scott and Kelsey pull up to the guard station of the Vista De 
           Oro. It looks incredibly similar to all the other 
           developments we’ve seen. A GUARD stops them.

                                 GUARD
                        (DRY) Hello and welcome to Vista De

                        Hey. Was there a woman here who 
                        called the police and they showed 
                        up? Like maybe two hours ago? 

                                 GUARD
                        Nope.

                        can tell you, to the minute, 
                        exactly what time the mail-guy 
                        showed up today. I’m not gonna 
                        forget the cops coming.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m just trying to--

                                 SCOTT
                        (BEAT) Okay, thank you. 

                                 GUARD
                        (DRYLY) No, thank you for visiting 
                        Vista De Oro. A great place to call 
                        home.

           Scott backs up and turns the car around. 

                                 KELSEY
                        So what, like, Cassie made a 
                        mistake?

                                 SCOTT
                        She didn’t make a mistake, I just 
                        forgot what she said. 
                                 KELSEY
                        But I thought the gas station guy 
                        told you--

                                 SCOTT
                        I didn’t know every development 
                        would have the exact same name!

           They drive in tense silence for a moment.

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s my fault, not Cassie’s.

                                 KELSEY
                        I know. Nothing’s ever her fault. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I didn’t listen. I fucked up! I 
                        made a mistake!

           There’s a moment of silence. Kelsey looks at him. Her eyes 
           start to well with tears.

                                 KELSEY
                        Do you like her more than me?

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you thirteen?

                                 KELSEY
                        Do you?

                                 SCOTT
                        You really want to have this 
                        conversation right now? 

                                 KELSEY
                        I just feel like you don’t even 
                        like me. And then Cassie calls and 
                        you jump right in the car and-- 
                        like, do you still love her?

                                 SCOTT
                        First, this is about my daughter, 
                        okay, not you. Or Cassie. Second, 
                        love isn’t… we were married for a 
                        long time. You don’t have any 
                        complicated feelings for your exes?

           Kelsey is crying now.

                                 KELSEY
                        No.

                        That’s because you’re 23. Your last 
                        boyfriend was named Reno.

                                 KELSEY
                        So I’ll understand when I’m older?

                        were?  You think I know what to do

                        else would I want you to say?

           There’s a long pause. 

                                 SCOTT
                        No. I don’t still love her.

           They drive in silence past a billboard reminding you that 
           melting down pennies is a federal crime.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Morgan hurry across the golf course. They’re 
           dripping wet, having washed most of the dirt off in the water 
           from the irrigation pipe. Morgan clutches her side, cramping 
           badly. She’s breathing hard, but also exaggerating a little.

                                 CASSIE
                        (WHISPERING) Come on, baby, it’s 
                        okay. Look. You did it. Look.

           They’ve reached the the big pink wall surrounding the 
           development. The one Cassie scaled earlier. They’re near a 
           few McMansions again. The street lamps shed some light on the 
           scene, though the houses are still dark and silent.

                                 CASSIE
                        We’re almost safe.
           Cassie struggles to pull herself up onto the wall the same 
           way as before. She swings her leg up, straddling the top, 
           then reaches down for Morgan.

                                 CASSIE
                        Give me your hand.

           Cassie takes Morgan’s hand and tries to pull her up. But the 
           girl is too heavy and Cassie isn’t strong enough. Morgan is 
           pulling her mother off the wall. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hold on, hold on.

           Cassie lets go. Morgan falls, and even though it’s just a 
           foot, she lands awkwardly on her ankle. She collapses to the 
           ground and starts to snivel. Cassie hold out her hand again.

                                 CASSIE
                        Here, Morgan.

           Morgan doesn’t take it.

                                 CASSIE
                        (SHARP) Morgan!

                                 MORGAN
                        (PETULANT) What? You can’t lift my 
                        fat ass.

                                 CASSIE
                        Please, sweetie, just give me your 
                        hand.

                                 MORGAN
                        I want Dad.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m getting us out of here, but I 
                        need you to give me your hand.

                                 MORGAN
                        I had squirrels in my mouth!

                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan get up.

                                 MORGAN
                        I can’t. I’m too tired. I’m lazy, 
                        remember. I hate exercise.
                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan, I’m not nagging you right 
                        now. A man out there is trying to 
                        kill us!

                                 MORGAN
                        I want Dad.

                                 CASSIE
                        Stop saying that.

                                 MORGAN
                        I want Dad.

                                 CASSIE
                        (YELLS) What is Dad gonna do?!

           Cassie realizes how loud that was. Her voice echoes off 
           something in the distance. She stares nervously into the 
           silent blackness all around them. 

                                 MORGAN
                        He makes fun of Kelsey all the 
                        time. Behind her back.

                                 CASSIE
                        Your dad does lots of things behind 
                        people’s backs.

                                 MORGAN
                        I know he had intercourse with 
                        someone else. 

           A beat.

                                 MORGAN
                        He said it was his fault and that I 
                        should be pissed at him, not you.

                                 CASSIE
                        He shouldn’t have told you 
                        anything.

                                 MORGAN
                        I think you should forgive him. I 
                        really want you to.

           A beat. Cassie sighs.

                                 CASSIE
                        If I told you that I think about it 
                        every single day, will you please 
                        stand up?
           Just then, a gun shot rings out from somewhere in the night. 
           Not that close, but not that far off either. As Cassie looks 
           out from her perch atop the wall, something catches her eye. 
           They’re right by the house where Sonny shot the policeman. 
           She can tell from the red Suburban parked on the street.

                                 CASSIE
                        Screw this. I got a better idea.

           INT. SUV - MOMENTS LATER

           Cassie opens the door to the Suburban and reaches for the 
           keys in the ignition. They’re still there, still sticky with 
           blood.

           As Morgan hustles to the passenger side, Cassie starts the 
           engine. She peels out, speeding towards the end of the cul-de-
           sac. She swings around in the opposite direction. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Here we go.

           They turn right at the first intersection.

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s gonna be okay, baby.

           As she says this, she realizes the street they turned onto 
           dead-ends in another cul-de-sac. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Whoops.

           She turns the car around and heads in the opposite direction. 
           Where she had turned right before, she goes the other 
           direction. But after a few moments, that street ends in a cul-
           de-sac, too.

                                 CASSIE
                        Where’s the main street?

           She takes the cul-de-sac curve going 35. The tires squeal. 
           The whole thing threatens to tip.

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom!

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m getting us getting out of here.

           She speeds back in the opposite direction, then comes to a 
           stop at a main drag. She looks right and left. Nothing but 
           big, empty houses in both directions. She decides to go left.
                                 CASSIE
                        I think this way.

           After a moment, they hit another cul-de-sac.

                                 CASSIE
                        God dammit!

           INT. SCOTT’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Scott and Kelsey pull up to the Costa de Oro development. The 
           gates are locked. 

           The sign reads: “The Costa de Oro. A luxurious residential 
           community featuring intimate botanical gardens, walking 
           trails, and tranquil lakes. Coming Spring 2008.” A happy 
           couple holds hands while gazing out on a computer generated 
           rendering of a swan-laden lake. 

           Inside is just an unfinished construction zone. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Strike two.

           He puts the car into reverse. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Are you sure?

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not sure about anything.

                                 KELSEY
                        Yeah, like, I’m definitely getting 
                        that sense.

           They drive off silently.

                                 SCOTT
                        I still love her.

           Kelsey looks hurt.

                                 SCOTT
                        It has nothing to do with you--

                                 KELSEY
                        (SHARP) Lets just find your 
                        daughter. That’s what this is 
                        about.
           INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Morgan are hurtling around a corner in the red 
           Suburban. Suddenly the main gain is in front of them, just 
           400 feet away.

                                 CASSIE
                        Oh thank god. 

           A light is on in the guard shack and the gate arm is down. 
           Cassie guns the engine. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom. The gate.

                                 CASSIE
                        We’re not stopping.

           The security guard steps out of the booth, into their path.

                                 CASSIE
                        (YELLING) Out of the way!

           He doesn’t blink. Instead he calmly points a handgun at them.

                                 CASSIE
                        What--

           Peering over the barrel of the gun is not the pimply faced 
           kid from earlier. It’s Sonny. The guard’s uniform is three 
           sizes too small on him. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Shit.

           Sonny opens fire. Cassie and Morgan duck as the bullets 
           shatter the windshield. Cassie keeps her foot on the gas. 
           Sonny keeps firing.

           He shifts his aim from the windshield to the tires. His first 
           shot clangs off the front grill of the SUV.

                                 CASSIE
                        (TO MORGAN) Stay down! 

           Sonny takes a deep breath and steadies his aim. The car is 
           less than 100 feet from him now. Sonny waits for what seems 
           like forever, then calmly squeezes the trigger.

           The right front tire bursts. The Suburban lurches suddenly to 
           the left, slamming into a curb and going up and over. It 
           careens into an empty fountain. The airbags deploy, throwing 
           Cassie and Morgan back against their seats. The car comes to 
           a stop, it’s hood crumpled, smoke rising from the engine.
           A huge smile sweeps across Sonny’s face. He gives a dorky 
           fist-pump, like somebody watching a game at a sports bar.

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah!

           He does the full body Tiger Woods fist-pump. 

                                 SONNY
                        Yeahhhh!

           It hurts his back.

                                 SONNY
                        Crap, crap. Ouch.

           Inside the SUV, amid smoke and shards of glass, Cassie pushes 
           the airbag away from her face.

                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan? Are you okay?

                                 MORGAN
                        I think I broke my nose.

                                 CASSIE
                        We have to get out of the car.

           Cassie struggles out of the vehicle and limps her way over to 
           the passenger side. As she opens the door, she sees Sonny 
           standing next to the guard station, watching her, his gun at 
           his side. The Rottweiler, in a cage next to him, is going 
           crazy -- barking and snarling and gnashing his teeth. 

                                 SONNY
                        (TO CASSIE) Well well well.

           Cassie can’t hear him over the barking of the dog. She’s 
           pulling Morgan out of the SUV.

                                 SONNY
                        (AT DOG) Shut up! Down boy! 
                        (YELLING AT CASSIE) Well well well!

           Cassie hears him this time. Seeing the gun, she grabs Morgan 
           by the wrist.

                                 CASSIE
                        Baby, we have to run.

           They take off. Sonny sighs and raises his gun. But holding 
           his arms up causes him extreme pain. He grabs his back. 
                                 SONNY
                        Ow. Ow. Shit.

           The dog is throwing itself against the bars of it’s cage -- a 
           terrifying whirlwind of teeth and rage. Sonny looks down at 
           it and smiles.

                                 SONNY
                        There’s a good boy.

           Cassie looks back in time to see Sonny reach down and grab 
           the latch of the dog’s cage. Morgan, hardly a fast runner, is 
           struggling to keep up. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Hurry, baby. You have to hurry! 

           Sonny releases the latch on the Rottweiler’s cage. It bursts 
           out ferociously. But instead of chasing after Morgan and 
           Cassie, the dog turns and and leaps right at Sonny.

                                 SONNY
                        No! Them--

           The force of the huge dog knocks him to the ground. He drops 
           the gun, which clatters to the pavement and lands a foot 
           away. The dog tries to tear at Sonny’s neck while he 
           struggles to hold it back with his left forearm, feeling for 
           the gun with his other hand. 

           Cassie looks back, then grabs her daughter’s arm.

                                 CASSIE
                        This way.

           She pulls her down a side street as Sonny wrestles with the 
           Rottweiler. The dog’s teeth are just inches from his face. 
           Suddenly, a shot rings out. Blood splatters on Sonny. The dog 
           stops thrashing. It’s jaws go still. 

           Sonny pushes the Rottweiler off him. It flops to the ground 
           like a sack of potatoes. Sonny stands up painfully, holding 
           the handgun. He looks at the dog with pity. 

                                 SONNY
                        I’m sorry, buddy. It wasn’t your 
                        fault. I didn’t give you a choice. 

           He tucks the handgun into the back waistband of his pants, 
           then bends over stiffly and grabs the dog’s hind legs.

                                 SONNY
                        Lets get you out of the street.
           EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Morgan tiptoe down a street of darkened, quiet 
           McMansions, doing their best to avoid the pools of light 
           created by the street-lamps. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Mom!

           Morgan points at a house across the street from them. It’s 
           boarded up with plywood, but there’s a small white light 
           shining between a crack in two pieces of plywood.

                                 CASSIE
                        Must be squatters. 

                                 MORGAN
                        If they have power they might have, 
                        like, a phone.

           They run up to the house. The front door is padlocked. A 
           posting declares that the property has been foreclosed on. 

           The pin-point of light shines from a boarded-up window next 
           to the front door. Cassie raps lightly on the plywood. It’s 
           met with silence.

           Cassie tries to pull one of the sheets of plywood away from 
           the window. No luck. It’s been nailed to the house. Morgan 
           nervously eyes the empty street behind them.

                                 MORGAN
                        Hurry up, mom.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’m hurrying.

           She grabs the plywood again and, bracing one foot against the 
           wall, pulls with all her might. It gives a loud crack.

           EXT. LAS CASAS DE ORO - GUARD STATION - CONTINUOUS

           In his too-small guard uniform, his back killing him, Sonny 
           is dragging the dog’s body behind the guard shack. Hearing 
           the sound of the plywood crack, he looks up with a start.  

           He unceremoniously dumps the dog next to Shane, the guard 
           from earlier. Shane’s been stripped down to his underwear. 
           There’s a bullet hole in his forehead. 

           A pair of headlights suddenly appear behind Sonny. He spins 
           around to see Scott’s convertible driving towards him. He 
           quickly steps away from the dead dog and the dead teenager.
           INT. SCOTT’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Scott looks at the sign for “Las Casas de Oro.” Where life 
           imitates vacation.

                                 SCOTT
                        Good. At least this one has a guy.

           EXT. MCMANSION PORCH - CONTINUOUS 

           Making a considerable amount of noise, Cassie pries the 
           plywood away from the window. She manages to pull two nails 
           out of the wall, allowing her to bend the plywood far enough 
           away from the window for a person to slip in between. 

           A bright white light pours forth from inside. It’s almost 
           blinding.

                                 CASSIE
                        What the hell?

           EXT. LAS CASAS DE ORO - GUARD STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Scott rolls down his window. Sonny greets him with a smile.

                                 SONNY
                        Hey there. Welcome to Las Casas de 
                        Oro.

           Scott is distracted by the sight of the still smoking SUV.

                                 SCOTT
                        What happened?

                                 SONNY
                        Oh. Tiger Woods and his wife live 
                        in the neighborhood.

           He smiles at this joke. Scott and Kelsey share a confused 
           look. Sonny’s smile fades. 

                                 SONNY
                        Some guy got hammered and plowed 
                        into the curb. Just went up and 
                        over and right into the fountain. 

           As Scott and Kelsey stare at the wreck, Sonny untucks his 
           shirt so that he can cover up the gun sticking out of the 
           back waistband of his pants. 

           But doing so accidentally pulls the gun out. It clatters 
           loudly to the ground. Scott looks up at him. Sonny tries to 
           act nonchalant.
                                 SONNY
                        At least nobody was hurt.

           Scott eyes Sonny’s shirt, which is splattered in dog’s blood.

                                 SONNY
                        Oh. I meant-- nobody else. The guy 
                        broke his arm. Bone sticking out 
                        and everything. I had to pull him 
                        out of there.  

                                 SCOTT
                        When was all this?

                                 SONNY
                        Ambulance left 20 minutes ago. I 
                        wanna go change, but I gotta wait 
                        for the tow-truck. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Where are the police?

                                 SONNY
                        Damn if I know. There’s only one 
                        cop in the whole town. So if he 
                        gets two calls at the same time…

                                 SCOTT
                        Well that might actually-- I’m 
                        looking for my wife. 

           Kelsey snorts angrily.

                                 SCOTT
                        My ex-wife. And my daughter.

                                 SONNY
                        Does she live here? What’s her 
                        name?

                                 SCOTT
                        Her name’s Cassie, she doesn’t live 
                        here. But she might have been here 
                        earlier, with a policeman.

           Sonny acts like he’s thinking really hard. He puts a finger 
           to his chin.

                                 SONNY
                        I see. I see. Interesting. When was 
                        this?

                                 SCOTT
                        Three hours ago.
                                 SONNY
                        That was before my shift. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well could you call whoever was 
                        working and--

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t know his number. We’re not 
                        friends. (THEN) He slept with my 
                        wife.

           He smiles at Kelsey and winks.

                                 SONNY
                        Ex-wife. 

           There’s an uncomfortable pause.

                                 SCOTT
                        But--

                                 SONNY
                        I tell you what, if your ex-wife is 
                        in here, we’ll find her. She can’t 
                        have gone far.

                                 SCOTT
                        In three hours?

                                 SONNY
                        We’ll find her.

           INT. MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS

           The camera sits in the brightly lit McMansion, facing the 
           front window from inside. Cassie’s hand, wrapped in a shirt, 
           punches through the window. Glass goes everywhere.

                                 CASSIE (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           No reply, so Cassie reaches in -- pushing aside the shards 
           still stuck to the frame -- and feels for the catch. She 
           unlocks the window and lifts it open.

           A second later, Morgan wedges herself between the plywood and 
           the window. There’s not much room for her. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Ow. Ow. Mom. The nail. Mom!

                                 CASSIE (O.S.)
                        Sorry. I can’t-- can you fit?
           Morgan squeezes into the open window. Between her size, her 
           general lack of coordination, and the plywood pressing on her 
           from outside, it’s not a graceful maneuver. She manages to 
           get through, but falls awkwardly, getting her arm out just in 
           time to keep from hitting the ground face first.

           She lands on broken glass and gives a yelp, then sits there, 
           looking at a small gash on her hand. 

           A second later, Cassie -- in a bra, with her shirt still 
           wrapped around her hand -- squeezes into the room. With 
           nobody holding it from outside, the plywood snaps shut behind 
           her.

                                 CASSIE
                        Are you okay, baby?

                                 MORGAN
                        I cut my hand.

                                 CASSIE
                        You’re okay.

                                 MORGAN
                        It hurts, like, really bad.

           Cassie is distracted by the blinding light. We see the room 
           from her POV. The entire house is filled with potted 
           marijuana plants. Bright white hydroponic lights hang from 
           every inch of ceiling. Small paths run between the plants, 
           winding from room to room.

                                 MORGAN
                        What is this?

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s nothing.

                                 MORGAN
                        It’s weed.

                                 CASSIE
                        How do you know that?

                                 MORGAN
                        (“DUH”) Mom. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Do they even call it “weed” 
                        anymore?

                                 MORGAN
                        Is anybody in here?
           They survey the room for a beat.

                                 CASSIE
                        Do we want anybody to be in here?

           EXT. LAS CASAS DE ORO - STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Kelsey and Scott are driving down the deserted streets of the 
           development. Sonny drives 15 feet ahead of them in the 
           security guard’s golf cart. He pops pain-killers from the 
           little orange bottle. 

           Scott yells out the windows at the top of his lungs.

                                 SCOTT
                        Cassie! Morgan! CASSIE!

           His screams echo off the empty houses.

                                 KELSEY
                        This guy creeps me out.

                                 SCOTT
                        Everything about this place creeps 
                        me out. 

                                 KELSEY
                        He’s covered in blood and his pants 
                        don’t fit.

           Sonny turns back to look at them. He smiles too broadly.

                                 SONNY
                        Keep yelling!

                                 SCOTT
                        Cassie! Morgan!

           One house they drive past does have lights on. A neighbor 
           watches them from the front door.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        What’s going on?

                                 SONNY
                        Just get back in your house, sir.

           The guy recognizes Sonny.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Sonny?

                                 SONNY
                        Oh, hey Dave. What’s up?
                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Why are you… are you a security 
                        guard?

           In their car, Scott and Kelsey share a look.

                                 SONNY
                        Well, you don’t have to judge me, 
                        Dave. Times are tough, as I’m sure 
                        you know. But you take whatever 
                        jobs you can get. A paycheck is a 
                        paycheck is a paycheck, am I right?

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        (AWKWARD) Um, you’re right.

           Sonny nods. 

                                 SONNY
                        You gotta do what you gotta do to 
                        stay alive.

           INT. MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie pokes around the house, looking for a phone hidden 
           somewhere among the pot. With the tall plants, it’s like 
           she’s wading through a corn field. 

           Suddenly, she hears Scott calling out from the street.

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Cassie! Morgan! CASSIE!

           Morgan’s ears perk up as well.

                                 MORGAN
                        Dad?

                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan, stay here…

           Cassie climbs out the window, pushing aside the plywood. 

           EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Scott’s car is driving past. Cassie calls after it.

                                 CASSIE
                        Scott!!!

           The car stops suddenly, 20 feet past the house. Cassie takes 
           a step, then notices Sonny in the golf cart, watching her.
                                 CASSIE
                        No. (YELLING) Hit him! Hit him! Run 
                        him over!

           In the car, Scott and Kelsey are looking back at her. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s she saying?

                                 KELSEY
                        Why isn’t she wearing a shirt?

           Scott puts the car into reverse. Suddenly there’s a gun shot. 
           The window explodes and Scott’s head jerks back. Blood spurts 
           into the back seat. Kelsey screams.

           Sonny is standing in front of the car, holding a smoking 
           handgun. He looks up at Cassie. 

                                 CASSIE
                        Scott!!

                                 SONNY
                        (TO CASSIE) Why aren’t you wearing 
                        a shirt? 

           Sonny points the gun at her. Inside the car, Kelsey is 
           crumpled on the floor at the foot of the passenger seat. 
           She’s sobbing and shaking, looking up at Scott’s bloody, 
           lifeless face.

                                 CASSIE
                        (TO SONNY) How are you going to get 
                        away with any of this?

                                 SONNY
                        How can it get any worse for me, 
                        Cassie? I can kill… (THINKING) four 
                        people and leave behind a witness 
                        who can positively identify me. Or 
                        I kill seven people and maybe still 
                        get to Mexico before the cops put 
                        out an alert on my license.

                                 CASSIE
                        I’ll tell them I never--

                                 SONNY
                        Eight people. Forgot about your 
                        daughter. (COUNTS, TO HIMSELF) One, 
                        two, three… four, five, six… seven, 
                        yeah, eight. 
           In the car, Kelsey can hear them talking. Through her tears, 
           she looks over at the gas pedal under Scott’s feet.

                                 CASSIE
                        I didn’t do anything to you.

                                 SONNY
                        You want me to feel bad for you, 
                        Cassie? Did anyone feel bad for me 
                        when my life fell apart? The banks? 
                        The government? Or did I get 
                        lectures about personal 
                        responsibility?

           Sonny is standing right in front of the car. He’s only 
           fifteen feet from the front bumper. Kelsey reaches over and 
           puts her hands on the gas pedal.

                                 SONNY
                        And, quite frankly, I think you’re 
                        getting exactly what you deserve. 
                        You and Gary both, you looked 
                        honest, hardworking people in the 
                        eyes and you told them this was a 
                        great investment. Can’t miss! You 
                        told th--

           Kelsey pushes down hard. The car jumps backwards. She forgot 
           that Scott had set it into reverse.

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus.

           The car flies backwards, turning sharply with Scott’s dead 
           weight slumped against the wheel. It slams into a street 
           lamp, which snaps in half and comes down on the roof, 
           crushing the car. 

           Sparks go everywhere. The dead lawn of one McMansion catches 
           fire. All the other street lamps go black, plunging the scene 
           into darkness. Cassie quickly pulls back the plywood and 
           climbs into the house.

           INT. MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie tumbles into the pitch black room. The hydroponic 
           lamps were killed with the rest of the power. A bit of 
           moonlight comes shining down from a skylight in the foyer.

                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan?

           Nothing.
                                 CASSIE
                        Morgan?

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Mom?

                                 CASSIE
                        where are you?

                                 MORGAN (V.O.)
                        Over here.

           A light clicks on. Morgan is standing by some plants, holding 
           a flashlight. She shines it underneath her face.

                                 MORGAN
                        I found this. 

           She shines the flashlight on a pair of botanical clippers.

                                 MORGAN
                        And these.

           EXT. MCMANSION - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny walks up to the front of the house. He pries open the 
           plywood over the window like he saw Cassie do. Then he gives 
           it an angry jerk. The wood cracks. 

           INT. MCMANSION - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny climbs through the window and is confronted by pitch 
           blackness. He takes out his cell-phone and holds it in front 
           of him for light.

           Sonny sneers at the marijuana plants, illuminated by the pale 
           glow of the cell-phone. 

                                 SONNY
                        Fucking criminals.

           He raises his gun and looks around, waiting for his eyes to 
           adjust. There’s a creak from the other room.

           INT. MCMANSION - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Morgan crouch as they cut a path between marijuana 
           plants. Cassie has the flashlight on, but pressed firmly 
           against her palm. The skin of her hand glows red.

           She occasionally spreads her fingers a little, letting out 
           just enough light so she can see where she’s going. 

           Behind her, Morgan clutches the pair of clippers tightly.
           INT. MCMANSION - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny picks his way through the marijuana jungle, his head on 
           a swivel. He holds the gun with his right hand, the cell 
           phone with his left. 

           He thinks he hears something off to his right. He whips 
           around in that direction, brushing the top of several plants 
           with the gun.

           The marijuana plants flutter in the cell phone light. It 
           might be Cassie and Morgan, or it might just be because he 
           brushed the leaves. The cell phone suddenly goes black.

                                 SONNY
                        Shit.

           He wakes the phone up from sleep mode. He shines it out over 
           the plants again, which are now totally still.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Scott’s car sits smoking and crumpled beneath the lamp post. 
           The dead-lawn fire is much bigger now. Several shrubs have 
           gone up in flames, and it’s spread to the house as well. A 
           hot wind whips through and the fire surges and jumps to the 
           dead lawn of a neighboring McMansion.

           The passenger side door of the car swings open with a loud 
           creak. Kelsey falls out. She stumbles to her feet, woozy. In 
           her hand is the .22 caliber pistol.

           INT. MARIJUANA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie and Morgan crouch amidst the plants. Sonny calls out 
           from the darkness.

                                 SONNY (V.O.)
                        Cassie! I know you’re in here.

           Cassie tries to locate Sonny’s voice. 

                                 SONNY (V.O.)
                        (SING SONG) Come out, come out, 
                        where-ever you ar--

           Before he can finish, there’s the sound of him tripping on a 
           potted plant and tumbling to the ground. His gun smacks 
           loudly against the floor.

                                 SONNY (V.O.)
                        Godammit.
           Through a forest of pot leaves, Cassie can see the light of 
           his cell phone. She gestures to her daughter to head in the 
           opposite direction.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Kelsey, still unsteady, tries the trunk. It’s locked. As the 
           fire burns ferociously behind her, she walks over to the 
           driver’s side door. The window is shattered and Scott sits 
           slumped over against the wheel. His head is a bloody mess.

           She tries the door. It opens a half inch, but only a half 
           inch. The top is jammed where the weight of the fallen street 
           lamp has crumpled the metal.

           Using a small LED light attached to her keychain, Kelsey 
           leans in and sees the trunk release lever on the inside of 
           the door, at the bottom. 

                                 KELSEY
                        Shit.

           She has to put her arm down through the open window to try to 
           get at the trunk release. But it’s out of reach. So she leans 
           her torso all the way in, her face just inches from the 
           bloody back of Scott’s head. She tries not to sob.

           In the darkness, her fingers feel for the trunk release. For 
           several agonizing seconds she can’t find it. There’s a loud 
           crack from the burning house behind her. She jumps. Her face 
           brushes against Scott. 

           Finally she finds the release, pulls up on it and stumbles 
           back, away from the car. Blood is smeared across her face.

           The trunk pops open.

           INT. MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie makes her way through the plants silently, 
           occasionally letting a little bit of light beam through her 
           fingers. Each time, it illuminates a patch of ground, then 
           she presses the flashligh against her palm again, plunging 
           the scene into darkness. She and Morgan walk forward for ten 
           or fifteen feet before using the light again.

           It goes on like this. A brief second of light followed by 
           several seconds of black. Illuminated ground. Darkness. 
           Illuminated ground. Darkness.

           The final time she flashes her light at the ground, there are 
           a pair of feet right in front of her.
           Cassie gasps and points the light upwards. Sonny stands 
           there, aiming his gun at her forehead. He flicks on his cell 
           phone, casting a blue glow over Cassie and Morgan.

                                 SONNY
                        Oopsy.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The fire is raging. As the winds continue to blow, several 
           other McMansions are burning. 

           Kelsey opens the trunk of the car, the gun still in her hand. 
           It’s a mess in there. Some old issues of Sports Illustrated. 
           A sweatshirt. A half-full box of Clif bars. But no bullets. 
           She doesn’t know where Scott hid them.

           She starts frantically digging through the junk.

                                 KELSEY
                        Where are they? 

           INT. MCMANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny has the gun pointed right at Cassie. He takes a step 
           towards her. She reaches back with one hand, as if to protect 
           her daughter. Behind her back, she makes a little “give it to 
           me” gesture with her fingers. Morgan presses the clippers 
           into her Mom’s open palm.

                                 CASSIE
                        (TO SONNY) Please don’t.

           Sonny shrugs his shoulders.

                                 SONNY
                        You gotta be a shark. 

           His finger tightens on the trigger. Behind her back, Cassie 
           squeezes her hand around the clippers. Morgan whimpers. 

           An incredibly loud gunshot rings out. Blood sprays from 
           Sonny’s neck. He crumples to the ground. Morgan screams. 
           Sonny’s cell-phone drops from his hands, shattering on the 
           ground. The scene goes dark.

           Cassie spins her flashlight in the direction of the shot. 
           Standing there is a 25 year-old hispanic guy with tattoos on 
           his arms and neck. He’s holding a gun.

           They stare at each other for a beat.
                                 HISPANIC GUY
                        Silent alarm. In case anybody 
                        breaks in and tries to rip us off.

           Cassie nods.

                                 HISPANIC GUY
                        You see my face?

           Cassie shakes her head “no.” The guy nods. There’s a long 
           pause.

                                 HISPANIC GUY
                        You want to buy some weed?

           Cassie shakes her head, “no.” 

           With that, the guy walks off, disappearing into the pot 
           bushes. Morgan is sobbing. Cassie hugs her.

                                 CASSIE
                        It’s okay, baby. It’s done. I’ve 
                        got you.

           There’s the crash of someone climbing in through the window.

                                 KELSEY (O.S.)
                        Morgan?

           Cassie spins her flashlight over towards the window. Kelsey 
           points Scott’s pistol at her. 

                                 CASSIE
                        No, Kelsey, it’s me. It’s Cassie. 
                        It’s over. It’s over.

           Kelsey doesn’t drop the gun. She just holds it there, aiming 
           it right at Cassie. Nothing happens for what seems like an 
           eternity.

           Then we cut outside to a wide shot of the street. As the fire 
           has jumped from dead lawn to dead lawn, half the houses on 
           the street are engulfed in flames. 

           The screen goes black.

           TITLE CARD: “Six months later”

           EXT. HARDING - DAY

           The sun beats down mercilessly on the McMansions of Harding.
           INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie is showing an enormous house to a Mexican family. A 
           mom and dad, three little kids, a young baby, and two older 
           women. The dad wears jeans and a battered “Colorado Avalanche 
           2001 Stanley Cup Champions” tee-shirt. 

                                 CASSIE
                        And this kitchen: you’re not going 
                        to find a lot of places for rent 
                        with this, um, floor plan -- the 
                        cook’s delight -- and the granite 
                        island…

           The little kids are running around the island, screaming. The 
           mother yells at them.

                                 MOTHER
                        Carlito! Callaté!

           The children don’t stop running.

                                 FATHER
                        How many bedrooms?

                                 CASSIE
                        Six to eight, depending on if you 
                        want an office or a screening room. 
                        How many of you are there?

                                 MOTHER
                        (AT KIDS) Callaté! 

                                 FATHER
                        We’re twelve.

                                 CASSIE
                        Wow. That’s a lot of people. 

           She smiles.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        It should be perfect.

           INT. CASSIE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Cassie unlocks the front door of a modest apartment. It’s 
           nice, but not nearly as big as her old house.

                                 CASSIE
                        Hi baby.

                                 MORGAN (O.S.)
                        Hi mom.
           Cassie rounds the corner into the living room. Morgan is 
           playing Dance Dance Revolution. 

                                 MORGAN
                        Want to play?

           Cassie smiles at her daughter.

                                 CASSIE
                        Sure.

                                 MORGAN
                        Cool.

           As Cassie takes off her shoes, Morgan restarts the game. She 
           selects Franz Ferdinand’s “You Could Have It So Much Better.”

           Cassie steps onto a pad next to her daughter. It’s quiet for 
           a moment, then the song starts. 

           They dance in perfect unison.

                                                       THE END.
