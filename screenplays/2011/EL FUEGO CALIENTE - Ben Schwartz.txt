           EXT. BEAUTIFUL MEADOW- 1800’S - SUNSET

           Rain pours down with such force, the ground seems helpless. A 
           stunning PRINCE, donned in regal attire, lustfully embraces a 
           beautiful PEASANT WOMAN, busting out of her low-cut blouse. 
           They look into each other. It’s as if the universe were 
           created for this one moment.

                                 PRINCE (IN SPANISH)
                        Luz...my heart aches when you’re 
                        not close. Your love riddles my 
                        dreams. Your body exhausts my mind.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        In my fantasies, we leave this 
                        place and live entangled in each 
                        other. But this life...is not a 
                        fantasy. You are marrying the 
                        princess.

                                 PRINCE (IN SPANISH)
                        But I am in love with you!

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        It doesn’t matter.

                                 PRINCE (IN SPANISH)
                        It’s all that matters!

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        If you left the princess to marry a 
                        peasant...you would lose 
                        everything.

                                 PRINCE (IN SPANISH)
                        I don’t care.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        They would relinquish your crown!

           The Prince takes off his CROWN and looks at it with fire in 
           his eyes.

                                 PRINCE (IN SPANISH)
                        Then consider my 
                        crown...RELINQUISHED!

           (SLOW MOTION) The Prince DRAMATICALLY THROWS his crown to the 
           ground. SPLAAAAAAAAAASH! It falls in a puddle.

           Luz is SHOCKED! He would really throw it all away for her. 
           The camera ZOOMS IN on Luz, saturated with emotion. ZOOMS IN 
           on the Prince, close to tears. ZOOMS IN on the crown, filthy.
           The Prince holds Luz close, nose to nose, water dripping 
           between faces...and their now see-through white shirts.

           HE KISSES HER. So much emotion transfers through their lips, 
           the heavens peer down to relish the moment.

           The Prince tilts his head, holds Luz CLOSER and KISSES EVEN 
           DEEPER. He’s no longer kissing her lips but rather HER SOUL.

           Luz’s eyes open. She moves her arms off the prince, expecting 
           the session to end...but end it does not. The kiss 
           continues...for way too long. Luz’s expression changes from 
           passion to annoyance. She tries to push away. 
           UggghhhhhhhAHHHHH! Struggles...until...finally...she is free!

                                 LUZ
                        CUT!!!

                                 DIRECTOR
                        CUT!!!

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - STAGE 10 - CONTINUOUS

           We WIDEN TO REVEAL we are in modern day Miami, at a taping of 
           the Telenovela El Fuego Caliente (The Hot Fire).

           Luz, played by PENELOPE, early 30s, pushes the Prince, played 
           by ANTONIO, mid 20s, to the ground.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                        It says he kisses her! Not he rapes 
                        her mouth!

                                 ANTONIO (IN SPANISH)
                        I was in the moment, Penelope.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                        Then let it be a moment. Not AN 
                        HOUR!!!

           Penelope STORMS OFF the set. The crew tries to avert their 
           eyes. ROSE, 30s, head writer for the show, slaps the DIRECTOR 
           on the back of the head and hurries after Penelope.

           Just beyond the cameras, SALMA, late 30s, dressed in full 
           Princess attire, watches Penelope’s demise with a devilish 
           grin.

           INT. FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - HALLWAY- MOMENTS LATER

           Penelope BURSTS through the building’s entrance in a frenzy. 
           Rose follows with the calmness of a crafty veteran.
                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                        I am done! This show can go fuck 
                        itself!

                                 ROSE
                        English, Penelope. I have no idea 
                        what you are saying.

                                 PENELOPE (ENGLISH)
                        THIS SHOW CAN EAT MY ASS!

                                 ROSE
                        That has to be a loose translation.

           They walk down a hallway, Sorkin style, passing production 
           offices left and right.

                                 PENELOPE
                        These people can’t even act! Who do 
                        they think they are?

                                 ROSE
                        Models.

                                 PENELOPE
                        MODELS! Ahhhh! This isn’t what I 
                        signed up for! I’m done! I want 
                        out!

                                 ROSE
                        You don’t want to leave the show.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (pleading)
                        But I do, Rose. I do!

           They pass by the office of young producer, DAVID, American 
           Jew, 30. He sits on his “trying too hard to be cool” desk and 
           talks on an expensive cell phone. He covers the phone for a 
           second.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m taking care of it, Penelope.

           Penelope doesn’t even look in the office.

                                 PENELOPE
                        You are an errand boy to the 
                        network, David. You can’t take care 
                        of a sea-monkey.

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        I know you’re angry, so I’m going 
                        to ignore that.
           Penelope and Rose turn a corner and in the distance see the 
           desk of ISABELLA, 19, Penelope’s smoldering hot assistant. 
           She wears a white, skin-tight shirt and plays Angry Birds on 
           her iPad. 

           The second she hears Penelope’s footsteps, Isabella throws 
           the iPad in a drawer and pretends to type on a computer that 
           isn’t turned on.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Isabella! Stop playing Angry birds!

                                 ISABELLA
                        What are you talking about? I’m 
                        writing an e-mail.

           There is nothing on the screen.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I can still hear the squawking.

           Penelope opens up the drawer. A medley of squawking comes 
           from her iPad.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Uch! But I’m so bored!!!

                                 PENELOPE
                        We all are. Trust me.

           Penelope opens her office door.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        And cover yourself up. That shirt 
                        is not appropriate for work.

                                 ISABELLA
                        We are wearing the same shirt!

           Penelope looks down, they are wearing the same 
           inappropriately tight shirt. Penelope ignores Isabella and 
           enters her office with Rose in tow. Isabella begrudgingly 
           puts on a VERY low-cut, sexy sweater.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - PENELOPE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope’s office/dressing room is beautiful. Trendy 
           furniture, posters from previous Telenovelas, a trophy case 
           filled with various Telenovela awards. Penelope pours herself 
           a Pellegrino in a Martini glass. She sips through a straw.
                                 PENELOPE
                        I’m not kidding this time, Rose! I 
                        quit!

                                 ROSE
                        You’re not going to quit.

           Penelope fills with rage. She points at the posters on the 
           wall- each one cheesier than the last. (Every poster shows 
           Penelope moments before a big kiss with interchangeable 
           handsome young men. Behind the main couple, a crazy cast of 
           characters- Priests, cowboys, maids, pirates, astronauts, 
           etc.)

                                 PENELOPE
                        Ahhhh!!!! This is not art! It’s not 
                        even television!!! Nobody respects 
                        our shows!!!

           Penelope spots something on the counter. She walks towards it 
           with purpose.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        If you won’t let me out of this god-
                        forsaken show, I’ll find my own way 
                        to end this nightmare!

           Penelope picks up a bottle of Ibuprofen, opens the top and 
           gestures like she is going to DOWN THE ENTIRE BOTTLE. 

           DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS.

           A TENSE BEAT! Will she do it? 

           ZOOM IN on Penelope’s face. ZOOM IN on the Ibuprofen bottle. 
           ZOOM IN on Penelope’s face.

           Unfazed, Rose slowly walks over and easily takes the pills 
           out of Penelope’s hand. She’s been through this before.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                             (defeated)
                        Nobody in the real world cares 
                        about us.

           Rose swallows two Ibuprofen with a sip of Penelope’s 
           Pelligrino.

                                 ROSE
                        That’s not true. Telenovelas get 
                        better ratings than most American 
                        network shows.
                                 PENELOPE
                        Uch.

                                 ROSE
                        Listen, if this show wasn’t 
                        important, why would I be working 
                        here?

                                 PENELOPE
                        Because it pays more than you were 
                        getting on Grey’s Anatomy.

                                 ROSE
                             (lying)
                        No.

           A beat.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        These stories touch people’s lives! 
                        YOU touch people’s lives...and it 
                        goes BEYOND America. El Fuego 
                        Caliente is translated into a 
                        million languages and transmitted 
                        to countries all over the world. 
                        You are a global icon.

           Penelope slumps in her fluffy chair.

                                 PENELOPE
                        No, I’m not. I’m like a knock off 
                        Spanish Barbie doll. No young girl 
                        or gay boy wants me. They want the 
                        normal Barbie instead.

                                 ROSE
                        I would buy a Spanish Barbie.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Probably just to piss off your 
                        parents.

           Rose smiles.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        Rose, this was supposed to be a 
                        stepping stone to something bigger. 
                        I do a few telenovelas, make some 
                        money, get recognized by big 
                        American casting directors and my 
                        life changes!

                                 ROSE
                        It will.
                                 PENELOPE
                        It hasn’t! It’s been eight years 
                        and nothing has changed! I want to 
                        be in American movies NOW! I want 
                        to be directed by Ron Howard and 
                        Steven Spielberg! I want to stare 
                        into Brad Pitt’s old eyes as he 
                        ages into a baby!

                                 ROSE
                        You’ll get there. It just takes 
                        time.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - DAVID’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           SLAP!

           A well-manicured hand flies across David’s face. He is 
           dazed...and extremely turned on. We widen to reveal it is 
           Salma, still dressed as a princess, STRADDLING David in his 
           fancy leather chair.

           Another SLAP with the other hand!

                                 DAVID
                             (nervous excitement)
                        Oh my god.

           Salma gets closer to David’s face.

                                 SALMA
                        I’m done playing second fiddle to 
                        Penelope in EVERY SHOW!

                                 DAVID
                        Next year, you’ll be the lead!

           Salma SLAPS him again. David fights back a smile.

                                 SALMA
                        You say that EVERY year!

           Salma points to a series of posters on the wall. They are the 
           same Telenovela posters we saw in Penelope’s dressing room.

                                 SALMA (CONT’D)
                        Yet somehow, I end up in the 
                        background of every poster!!!

           We take a closer look and see SALMA as one of the crazy 
           characters in the background of every poster- a nun, cowgirl, 
           princess, etc.
                                 SALMA (CONT’D)
                        I should be in the front of these 
                        posters! I SHOULD BE THE STAR!

           Salma quickly changes gears. She plays with David’s hair, it 
           gets sensual.

                                 SALMA (CONT’D)
                             (sweet)
                        I’m like a flower, David. And 
                        Penelope is this ugly weed blocking 
                        all of my light. How am I supposed 
                        to grow without that light?!? 
                        Flowers need light to grow!

           David caresses her lower back.

                                 DAVID
                             (begging for it)
                        God, I want you to grow so bad.

           Salma gets closer, grinds her body into his.

                                 SALMA
                        Good. Because I’m tired of waiting.

                                 DAVID
                        So am I.

           She moves her hips on top of him. He breathes deeply with 
           nervous excitement.

                                 SALMA
                        We need to make her look so 
                        terrible on this show, no one will 
                        hire her again.

                                 DAVID
                        Absolutely. Whatever it takes to 
                        keep your hips moving like that.

                                 SALMA
                        Write her the worst lines. Put her 
                        in the stupidest situations. Make 
                        her lose her mind!

                                 DAVID
                             (Barely listening)
                        Yes.

           Salma stops.

                                 SALMA
                        David. You’re not listening.
                                 DAVID
                        Not with my brain, no.

           Salma leans in.

                                 SALMA
                        Make Penelope’s character a mess.

                                 DAVID
                        I will. Trust me...but you have to 
                        remember, Rose is the one who 
                        writes all of her lines. The entire 
                        story, from premiere to finale, 
                        every word Penelope says in those 
                        hundred and fifty episodes comes 
                        from Rose.

                                 SALMA
                        So what?!? You are the producer!

           Salma gets up.

                                 DAVID
                        No, no, no. Don’t get up. It’s so 
                        stupid up there.

           Salma whispers into David’s ear.

                                 SALMA
                             (whispers)
                        David, do this and I’ll make that 
                        Hebrew National of yours feel like 
                        it’s swimming in Spanish honey.

                                 DAVID
                             (out of breath)
                        Spanish honey?

                                 SALMA
                        You have no idea.

           Salma licks David’s ear and exits.

           A beat as David stares at the ceiling in ecstacy.

           EXT. SOUTH BEACH - EVENING

           Hip, gorgeous men and women walk Miami’s famous South Beach. 
           They enter clubs, dance down streets and fall in love near the 
           ocean. Beautiful Cuban music fills the air.
           EXT. MIAMI STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A different part of Miami. Not as majestic but still pretty 
           exciting. Tall buildings, bright colorful lights, linen 
           shirts. Music plays but at a far lower volume.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS

           The beautiful music is muzzled. The skyline blocked. An old 
           Jewish couple walks toward a dirty building adorned with blue 
           and white balloons. The song “Hands Up” by Ottawan bellows 
           through the entrance.

           INT. DOWNTOWN VENUE - GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           An exhausted, ruggedly good-looking man, JAVIER, late 30s, 
           sits in a makeshift dressing room. He shakes a tiny box of 
           Frosted Mini-Wheats into a tiny box of Cocoa Krispies, pours 
           some skim Milk and mixes with a plastic spork. As the milk 
           turns chocolate, he watches an episode of El Fuego Caliente 
           on a damaged TV-

           EXT. SLUM VILLAGE - 1800S - SUNRISE

           Our Prince is now in tattered rags. He cleans laundry by hand 
           beside the love of his life, Luz. Cheesy Telenovela music 
           aids in the moment.

           The Prince’s hand slips and soapy water splashes all over his 
           white shirt and face. Luz laughs, moves the soapy water away 
           from his lips and kisses him passionately.

           In the distance, the Princess watches from behind a tree. Her 
           eyes FILL with ANGER. We ZOOM IN on the Princess.

           We immediately see a FLASHBACK of the kiss that happened 
           seconds ago-

           (FLASHBACK)- The Prince’s hand slips and soapy water splashes 
           all over his white shirt and face. Luz laughs, moves the 
           soapy water away from his lips and kisses him passionately.

           (WE CUT BACK FROM THE FLASHBACK)- The Princess narrows her 
           eyes, evil flowing through her veins.

           INT. DOWNTOWN VENUE - GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Javier grunts his disapproval and eats another scoop of 
           cereal. Chocolate milk spills on his white under-shirt.
           A knock at the door.

                                 PARTY PLANNER (O.S.)
                        Two minutes.

                                 JAVIER
                        Thank you, two.

           Javier slurps down the remainder of the bowl, gets up and 
           grabs a HIGHWAY PATROL uniform from the back of the door. 
           While tucking in the very tight khaki shirt, he looks at a 
           poster taped to the wall- 

           A 1990’s TV show entitled NIFTY ARREST. It dons a much 
           younger/more attractive Javier in full uniform, leaning on a 
           highway patrol motorcycle, shifting his aviators just low 
           enough to peer into the lens.

           Javier’s eyes drift from the poster to the mirror. He is a 
           different man. Out of shape, unshaven, busting out of his now 
           way too snug uniform. Javier gathers his strength, 
           aggressively slides his nightstick into his utility belt and 
           shifts his aviators just low enough to peer into the mirror.

           INT. DOWNTOWN VENUE - BAT MITZVAH BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Young kids wear comically large sunglasses and “strum” blow-up 
           guitars. The small dance floor is filled with 13 year olds 
           aggressively grinding and rhythm-less parents twisting to 
           SISTER SLEDGE’s “We Are Family”. It is now apparent- we are at 
           a Bat-Mitvah. The theme is Space Travel. The PARTY PLANNER 
           hands Javier a microphone.

                                 PARTY PLANNER
                        You’re up after this song.

           A kid sidles up to Javier.

                                 PARTY KID
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 JAVIER
                        I’m Officer Johnny Ramirez from TV.

                                 PARTY KID
                        Not any TV I watch.

                                 JAVIER
                        Well, the show was on for two 
                        seasons in the 90s.

                                 PARTY KID
                        Did you shoot anyone?
                                 JAVIER
                        No. We didn’t have guns, just billy 
                        clubs.

                                 PARTY KID
                        That sounds like the biggest piece 
                        of shit in the world.

           A JEWISH MOM, 50, with too much make-up, joins the 
           conversation.

                                 JEWISH MOM
                        Stop that, Lewis!

           The kid is pushed to the side.

                                 JEWISH MOM (CONT’D)
                        Officer Ramirez. Thank you so much 
                        for coming. My EX-husband and I 
                        were such big fans of yours, we 
                        just had to have you for Carrie’s 
                        Bat-Mitzvah.

                                 JAVIER
                        That’s really sweet. Thanks again 
                        for paying in advance.

                                 JEWISH MOM
                        Please, I totally get it. It’s been 
                        way too long since I’ve seen that 
                        gorgeous face on my television. 
                        What have you been up to? 

                                 JAVIER
                        Well, I’m writing a movie for 
                        myself to star.

                                 PARTY KID
                        Give up now. Nobody’s gonna watch a 
                        movie about an old ass cop who 
                        doesn’t know how to shoot a gun.

                                 JEWISH MOM
                        LEWIS!

           The mom takes out a pack of cigarettes.

                                 JEWISH MOM (CONT’D)
                        Go try your first cigarette.

           The kid grabs the cigarettes with giddy eyes and runs 
           outside.
                                 JEWISH MOM (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that. Nowadays kids get 
                        their manners from internet porn 
                        and war video games.

           A beat. The mother leans closer to Javier.

                                 JEWISH MOM (CONT’D)
                        Maybe when Carrie is done lighting 
                        the candles, you and I can go to 
                        make your own sundae station and 
                        get to know each another a little 
                        better.

           The mother licks her lips “seductively.” The theme to Nifty 
           Arrest plays. The lyrics actually say the words Nifty Arrest 
           in them. So 90s. So terrible. Javier turns on the mic and 
           joins Carrie on the dance floor.

                                 JAVIER
                        CHALLLA!!! Guess what time it is?

           Silence. An awkward beat.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        That’s right, it’s time for Grandpa 
                        Moshe to come down and cut the 
                        challa!

           Grandpa Moshe walks towards the dance floor, unsure of what’s 
           going on. He stumbles into a table of guests.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Does someone want to help Grandpa 
                        Moshe to the floor.

           An equally old woman grabs grandpa and tries to steer him in 
           the right direction. She fails. They are going the wrong way. 
           Waiters bring out the challa on a rolling table. Javier 
           unsheathes his billy club...REMOVES one of the ends to reveal 
           it is a BUTTER KNIFE! Carrie looks at it in disapproval.

                                 CARRIE
                        Who the fuck are you?

           Grandpa Moshe and the older woman have stopped to drink some 
           water. They are totally confused. Javier closes his eyes. 
           He’s had enough.
           EXT. FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - AFTERNOON

           A beautiful Miami day. Penelope sits on a bistro chair outside 
           of the El Fuego Caliente Stages. She chews on celery and spits 
           the waste into a Dixie cup. A gorgeous PA, GABRIELA, walks by.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Why don’t you just swallow it?

                                 PENELOPE
                        I don’t need the extra calories. 
                        Throw this out for me.

           Gabriela rolls her eyes, grabs the tiny cup and throws it in 
           a garbage can inches away. Pedestrians pass by without as much 
           as a glance towards Penelope. In the real world she is nobody.

           There is a commotion down the street. A Rolls Royce pulls up. 
           Cameras flash. TMZ runs beside the car. Penelope looks to see 
           what’s going on. It’s SCARLETT JOHANSSON!!!

           Cameramen get down on one knee to capture the illicit up the 
           skirt shot. Flashes all over the place. TMZ running and 
           asking stupid, hurtful questions. 

           Penelope is EXTREMELY jealous. She wants that life. She wants 
           to be hounded. She angrily spits out the remainder of her 
           celery and enters the stages.

           INT. FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS

           Penelope walks down the hallway and sees her assistant, 
           Isabella, flirting with a very attractive 20 year old mailboy. 
           Isabella touches his arm and laughs at what can only be a 
           terrible joke. Penelope catches up to them.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Did you deliver the mail?

                                 MAILBOY
                        Oh, ya. It’s right here.

           The mailboy hands over the mail.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Great. So you are all set.

                                 MAILBOY
                        Right...well...talk to you soon. I 
                        like your shirt.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Thanks.
           The mailboy scurries off.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        What was that about?

                                 PENELOPE
                        You can’t just flirt with the 
                        mailboy. You are my assistant, 
                        which means when I’m not around, 
                        you represent me. If you look like 
                        a slut, I look like a slut.

                                 ISABELLA
                        We were just talking.

                                 PENELOPE
                        That was more than talking.

                                 ISABELLA
                        All I did was laugh at his joke!

                                 PENELOPE
                        With tits like that, that’s all it 
                        takes.

           Penelope grabs Isabella’s sweater off a hanger and hands it 
           over. Isabella begrudgingly puts it on. Penelope looks 
           through the mail.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        I’m just looking out for you. One 
                        day, you’ll thank me.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Whatever. Your fiancé is in the 
                        office. He said he couldn’t go the 
                        entire day without kissing you. 
                        That sentence almost made me throw 
                        up.

           Penelope smiles.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        I told him you weren’t around for 
                        another hour but he swore it was 
                        worth the wait. That sentence DID 
                        make me throw up and now we need 
                        more garbage liners.

                                 PENELOPE
                        That’s your job.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Right. I’ll figure it out later.
           Penelope looks at her office door lovingly.

                                 PENELOPE
                        See Isabella, when you act like a 
                        lady, you are rewarded with a 
                        wonderful man.

           Penelope opens the door to her office. Her fiancé, FELIPE, is 
           FUCKING a HOT YOUNG PEASANT EXTRA AGAINST THE TROPHY CASE!!! 
           Everything stops. Penelope IS SHOCKED. Jaw-dropped to the 
           floor. She SCREAMS AND RUNS INSIDE THE ROOM LIKE A MANIAC!

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - PENELOPE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Felipe’s pants are around his ankles, the peasant’s worn 
           undergarments at her feet. Isabella runs to the doorway to 
           watch.

                                 PENELOPE
                        ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME, 
                        FELIPE?!?!

                                 FELIPE
                        Penelope...I wasn’t expecting you.

                                 PENELOPE
                        WASN’T EXPECTING ME?!? YOU’RE IN MY 
                        DRESSING ROOM!

                                 FELIPE
                        This isn’t what it looks like.

                                 PENELOPE
                        How is it not what it looks like? 
                        You are INSIDE another woman!

           Felipe takes himself out of the extra. Penelope grabs a 
           Pelligrino bottle and smashes it against the table. Sharp, 
           broken bottle in hand, Penelope is now armed and VERY 
           dangerous. The peasant extra tries to run but her rags aren’t 
           very mobile.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        AN EXTRA?!?

           She swipes the broken bottle at Felipe. He dodges...barely.

                                 FELIPE
                        Honey! Stop! You are acting crazy!

                                 PENELOPE
                        YOU WERE FUCKING A PEASANT EXTRA 
                        AGAINST MY TROPHY CASE!!!!

                        Trust me, this is the APPROPRIATE 
                        REACTION!!!

           She swipes again and by mistake tears one of the telenovela 
           posters on the wall. Upon further inspection we see she 
           sliced Salma’s face. 

           Penelope goes after the extra. She swipes and rips some of 
           her rags, exposing her beautifully perfect cleavage and 
           midriff.

                                 CHEATING EXTRA
                        Please, Penelope! I’m so sorry. I’m 
                        such a big fan!

           Penelope swipes again and rips the extra’s skirt, exposing 
           her sexy legs. The extra runs beside Isabella. Penelope 
           circles Felipe, stabbing near his face and crotch.

                                 PENELOPE
                        HOW COULD YOU?!?

                                 FELIPE
                        She came in for your autograph. I 
                        was the only one here, so we 
                        started talking. One thing lead to 
                        another and we by mistake had sex.

                                 PENELOPE
                        BY MISTAKE?!?! YOU ARE A PIECE OF 
                        SHIT!

                                 FELIPE
                        WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? EVERYONE WHO 
                        WORKS HERE IS BEAUTIFUL! IT’S 
                        INSANE!!!

                                 PENELOPE
                        OUR ENGAGEMENT IS OFF!

                                 FELIPE
                        FINE! Good luck finding someone to 
                        listen to you talk about yourself 
                        for twenty hours a day!

           Penelope pulls the engagement ring off her finger and throws 
           it at Felipe.

                                 PENELOPE
                        GET OUT OF MY LIFE!!!

           Felipe grabs the ring and THROWS IT BACK.
                                 FELIPE
                        Keep the ring. You bought it for 
                        yourself, remember? Right after you 
                        threw out my great grandmother’s 
                        ring because it was “tacky” and 
                        “smelled like my family.”

           Felipe exits. Penelope looks around. Her office is a mess. 
           Trophy case broken. Posters ripped. Awards damaged. Torn rags 
           on the floor.

           Penelope cries.

           The cheating extra steps back into the room with an autograph 
           book.

                                 CHEATING EXTRA
                        Can I have your autograph?

                                 PENELOPE
                        GET OUT!!!!

           The extra runs away. Penelope collapses to the ground and 
           WAILS towards the ceiling at the top of her lungs. The camera 
           ZOOMS OUT from above in dramatic fashion.

           Isabella slowly backs away.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - BOARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           David, Rose, WRITERS, and the DIRECTOR sit at an enormous 
           table. A projector is set up on one side of the wall 
           displaying the Network’s logo- TELEUNIVERSO. The group hears 
           Penelope’s screams but quickly disregards them.

                                 ROSE
                        So, let’s get it out of the way. 
                        How are we going to get the 
                        Prince’s shirt wet this week? 
                        Remember, we need it to feel 
                        organic.

                                 WRITER 1
                        Waterfall?

                                 ROSE
                        It’s been done.

                        We’ve exhausted ALL precipitation! 
                        Keep thinking.

           As the room debates, Rose and David talk amongst themselves.

                                 DAVID
                        Our ratings went down a thirtieth 
                        of a point yesterday. Avi is going 
                        to lose his shit.

                                 ROSE
                        He’ll be fine. Nobody cares about a 
                        thirtieth of a point.

                                 DAVID
                        You should have listened to me and 
                        added a love interest.

                                 ROSE
                        Jesus, David. Stop suggesting we 
                        add a love interest. It’s the only 
                        thing you pitch and it’s been done 
                        TO DEATH.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, I’m YOUR boss. You can’t tell 
                        me what to do!

           We get back to the table.

                                 WRITER 2
                        I’ve got it! What about...A 
                        WATERFALL?

           A VIDEO CONFERENCE lights up on the projector. Everyone shuts 
           up and gives the screen their full attention. We see AVI 
           KLAUCHMAN, 50, President of TeleUniverso, sit on a beautiful 
           leather chair overlooking a private beach in Tel Aviv.

                                 AVI
                        Friends, listen...I’m a nice guy. 
                        Hell, last night I bought a three 
                        legged dog a fourth leg just so he 
                        could feel normal.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s amazing, Avi. He must be so 
                        happy.

                                 AVI
                        The dog died during the surgery. 
                        The point is, it’s in my nature to 
                        be nice.

                        That’s what my body wants to 
                        do...but...when I see our show went 
                        down a thirtieth of a point...

           David looks at Rose.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        It makes me want to spit on all of 
                        you. Do you understand? Deep down, 
                        I don’t want to...but impulsively, 
                        I wish I could spit on all of your 
                        faces right now.

           The room gets nervous.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        Even then, when my saliva glands 
                        eagerly produced spit for today, I 
                        gave you the benefit of the doubt. 
                        I thought, maybe every show’s 
                        ratings were down.

           Avi grabs a piece of paper that comes out of an old fashion 
           ticker.

                        COMPETITION El Lumbre Caluroso (The 
                        Warm Flame) went UP a fortieth of a 
                        point!!! So, I ask you...how is 
                        that possible? If we have the most 
                        expensive writing staff and the 
                        biggest stars, how is it possible 
                        that EVERY WEEK we LOSE to EL 
                        LUMBRE CALUROSO!!!

           A beat.

                        Does anyone know?

           A beat.

                        ...no?

           Rose and David can’t believe that idiot just talked.

                                 AVI
                        Because of this!

           Avi presses a button, his face minimizes to the corner. On 
           the remainder of the screen, the competition’s logo appears- 
           TELEPLANETA Presents! EL LUMBRE CALUROSO!!!-
           EXT. LARGE MEADOW - EARLY 1900S - DAY

           It is raining so hard, we are borderline monsoon. A gorgeous 
           woman, MARGARITA, wears a white dress with EVEN MORE cleavage 
           than Penelope and rides a horse. A man, SANGRIO, rides beside 
           her. He is shirtless but wears a cowboy hat...with a clear 
           plastic rain guard. The two kiss with all the passion in the 
           world.

                                 SANGRIO (IN SPANISH)
                        Margarita...I have to tell you 
                        something.

           A beat.

                        I love you. I’ve always loved you.

           Margarita smiles. She’s been waiting her whole life for this 
           moment.

                                 MARGARITA  (IN SPANISH)
                        Sangrio, I lo...

           But before she can finish her sentence, a SUDDEN FLASH OF 
           LIGHTNING and a TERRIFYING BOOM OF THUNDER spook the horses. 
           Sangrio is bucked WAY off his horse. He flies through the air 
           and lands on his neck. His rain-guarded hat lands beside him.

                        Nooooo!

           Margarita gets off her horse and rushes to her love.

                                 SANGRIO (IN SPANISH) 
                             (struggling)
                        Margarita...

                                 MARGARITA (IN SPANISH)
                        Sangrio! I lov...

           Before she can make it all the way over, another FLASH of 
           lightning and BOOM of thunder! Sangrio’s horse gets spooked 
           again and TRAMPLES the injured man TO DEATH!

                                 MARGARITA (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        NOOOOOOO!!!

           Margarita cradles Sangrio’s lifeless body in her arms. She 
           tries kissing him but it’s too late.
                                 MARGARITA (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        SANGRIO! I LOVE YOU!!! I LOVE 
                        YOU!!!

           Sangrio’s horse turns around and looks at Margarita. 
           Margarita looks back at the horse with vengeance in her eyes. 

           ZOOM IN on Margarita. ZOOM IN on the horse. ZOOM IN on 
           Margarita’s now assassin like eyes. ZOOM IN on the horse’s 
           eyes. ZOOM IN on the rain guarded hat.

           The horse runs away. Margarita BANGS her fist against the 
           ground. Mud gets all over her cleavage. She picks up 
           Sangrio’s hat, puts it on dramatically and watches the horse 
           escape.

                        Why the hell aren’t we doing stuff 
                        like that?!? Rose...please. We 
                        can’t keep getting our asses kicked 
                        in the ratings.

                                 ROSE
                        We’re beating NBC.

                        beating NBC.

           Avi takes a breath.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        Guys, this is important to me. My 
                        father laughed when I started 
                        TeleUniverso. He swore I would 
                        never get a number one show on the 
                        air. We have to prove him wrong.

                                 ROSE
                        We will, Avi. I just need more 
                        time.
                                 AVI
                        You’ve done five years of 
                        telenovelas, Rose. You are 
                        officially out of time. If you 
                        don’t find a way to make this show 
                        number one, I’m personally flying 
                        down to Miami and firing you.

           David smiles.

                                 ROSE
                        Avi...

                                 AVI
                        This is your moment, Rose. Don’t 
                        fuck it up.

           Avi’s screen turns black. The TeleUniverso logo lights up 
           again.

                                 ROSE
                        Shit!

           A beat. Gametime.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Alright everyone. It’s time to kick 
                        it up a notch. I know we’ve got the 
                        series mapped out for the year but 
                        now we need bigger and BETTER plot 
                        twists. Let’s think of our falling 
                        off the horse and getting trampled 
                        moment, OK?

                        Let’s challenge ourselves! Think 
                        outside the box! If one of our 
                        characters has a secret, it’s NOT 
                        that she’s been raped.

                        I BELIEVE IN YOU! LET’S DO THIS!!!

           Rose grabs her things and leaves to WILD APPLAUSE from the 
           writing team.
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah guys, let’s think of our 
                        falling off the horse and getting 
                        trampled...

           Everyone is quiet and typing away. Nobody cares about David’s 
           input. David leaves.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Rose walks down the hallway. She rubs her head hoping it will 
           alleviate her problems. She passes Penelope’s office. 
           Penelope is STILL CRYING. Isabella sits at her desk trying to 
           ignore the screams.

                                 ROSE
                        How bad?

                                 ISABELLA
                        Really bad.

                                 ROSE
                        Worse than when those naked photos 
                        of her got zero views on the 
                        internet?

                                 ISABELLA
                        WAY worse. She caught Felipe having 
                        sex with an extra in her dressing 
                        room.

                                 ROSE
                        Wow.

           Rose grabs two Aspirin and downs them with no water. She 
           gathers her courage, straightens up and enters.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - PENELOPE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope grasps onto the peasant extra’s rags and props. Rose 
           starts cleaning the office.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Nobody loves me. Not even my 
                        fiancé!

                                 ROSE
                        EVERYONE loves you. Your fiancé was 
                        an asshole.

           Rose picks up a framed headshot of Penelope and sits it upright 
           on the desk. 
           An OLD PICTURE OF PENELOPE HUGGING JAVIER slips out the back of 
           the frame and lands on the floor. Penelope looks at it 
           longingly (with appropriate telenovela music) and hides the 
           photo before Rose notices.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I could die right now and the only 
                        person who would care is you.

                                 ROSE
                        That’s not true.

                                 PENELOPE
                        It is! 

           Rose stops cleaning up.

                                 ROSE
                        I know what you need.

           Penelope realizes what Rose is suggesting.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Rose, no. It’s a crutch.

                                 ROSE
                        You’ll be fine.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I told myself I would stop.

                                 ROSE
                        One last time.

           Penelope looks up at Rose.

           EXT. MIAMI STREET - HOURS LATER

           Penelope gets out of a black Prius. She looks at Rose and 
           nods. They walk by a sign that reads- “WELCOME TO LITTLE 
           HAVANA!”

           EXT. LITTLE HAVANA - PUBLIC PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           The park is packed with Spanish speaking residents from Cuba, 
           Spain and various other countries. The happy group plays 
           dominoes, smokes cigars, drinks Cuban coffee and listens to 
           beautiful music. Penelope and Rose make their way to the 
           center of the park.

                                 ROSE
                        You ready?
           Penelope takes off her sunglasses and hands them to Rose.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Ready.

           Rose takes one step forward and stops in her tracks.

                                 ROSE
                        No...way.

           Rose turns to Penelope FLABBERGASTED! She screams with joy.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        OOOO! OOOOO! Are you her?!?

           Penelope smiles.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You are! Ahhh! I knew it! You’re on 
                        that show! El Fuego Caliente! I 
                        love you! You are so talented! So 
                        beautiful! I can’t believe you are 
                        her!

           Older women and young men turn to see who it is. PENELOPE!!! 
           FROM EL FUEGO CALIENTE!!! They can’t believe it. Fans flock 
           towards Penelope as if she was a member of the Beatles.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve gotta sign something for me!

                                 PENELOPE
                        Of course. What would you like me 
                        to sign?

           People snap photos and take out whatever they can for 
           Penelope to sign.

                                 GROUP (IN SPANISH)
                        Penelope! Penelope! I love you!

           Rose looks through her purse. All she can find is a tampon. 
           She takes it out and hands it to Penelope.

                                 PENELOPE
                        A tampon?

                                 ROSE
                        It’s all I had in my bag! Oh my 
                        god, if you could sign that for me, 
                        it would make my life!

                                 PENELOPE
                        OK, what’s your name?
                                 ROSE
                        Juuuuana...Valdez.

           Penelope smiles. Rose hands over a RED PEN.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Red. Appropriate.

           Penelope signs the tampon and hands it back to Rose.

                                 ROSE
                        Thank you so much! I’m going to 
                        save this forever! Ahhh! I can’t 
                        believe it! PENELOPE SIGNED MY 
                        TAMPON!!!

           Rose moves out of the way. MOBS of fans push in to get 
           Penelope’s autograph.

                                 GROUP (IN SPANISH)
                        Penelope! My love! I watch your 
                        show every week! Sign this for me! 
                        I’m your biggest fan!

           Penelope lights up for her fans. She loves the attention. The 
           crowd goes CRAZY! 

           Young men take photos kissing Penelope’s cheek. 

           Mothers take photos of Penelope holding their babies.

           Penelope signs posters and magazine covers. Everyone is 
           overjoyed.

           Penelope is in heaven. Rose watches from afar with pride.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Salma changes clothes behind a very thin curtain. David 
           watches her shadow like a school boy.

                                 DAVID
                        Penelope’s fiancé was caught 
                        fucking an extra.

                                 SALMA

                        of my life.

                                 DAVID
                        Now is the perfect time to show Avi 
                        I can make El Fuego number one. And 
                        I’ve got the PERFECT plot twist to 
                        do it.

                                 SALMA
                        I’m listening.

                        All we have to do is...ADD A LOVE 
                        INTEREST!

           Salma stops changing.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I know it sounds cliche and done to 
                        death but...

           Salma comes out in her bra and panties.

                                 SALMA
                        It’s genius.

                                 DAVID
                        I need to enter you.

                        We make the love interest someone 
                        terrible. Someone Penelope CAN’T 
                        STAND! She’ll get so frustrated, 
                        she’ll leave the show.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m gonna take off my clothes too, 
                        so you aren’t the only one standing 
                        in your underwear.

           David kicks off his shoes and fiddles with his belt.

                                 SALMA
                        Stop. Do you remember the guy 
                        Penelope banned from the stages?

                                 DAVID
                        No.
                                 SALMA
                        Javier. He’s from her first series, 
                        El Resplandor Tibio (The Tepid 
                        Blaze). They drove each other 
                        INSANE. I’ve masturbated to his 
                        security photo. The idea of someone 
                        hating Penelope as much as I do...I 
                        couldn’t help myself.

                                 DAVID
                        Where is he now?

                                 SALMA
                        After Resplandor, he played Officer 
                        Johnny Ramirez on that terrible 
                        show Nifty Arrest.

                                 DAVID
                        Avi loved Nifty Arrest.

                                 SALMA
                        Perfect.

           Salma goes into David’s pocket (David moans in delight) and 
           grabs his cell phone. She finds Avi’s number and calls it.

                                 DAVID
                        Whoa, what are you doing?

                                 SALMA
                        Tell Avi that Javier is going to 
                        play a competing love interest on 
                        the next episode of El Fuego 
                        Caliente.

                                 DAVID
                        What? I can’t do that. I’ve never 
                        called Avi’s cell before.

                                 SALMA
                        You know how you want to enter me?

           David nods.

                                 SALMA (CONT’D)
                        Make this call and I’ll show you 
                        where the entrance is.

           David looks at the phone. It’s still ringing.

                                 SALMA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe even the exit.
                                 DAVID
                        Can I enter through the exit?

                                 SALMA
                        It’s like a saloon door. Swings 
                        both ways.

                                 AVI (V.O.)
                        Avi.

           David grabs the phone.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 DAVID
                        Avi, it’s David from El Fuego 
                        Caliente.

                                 AVI
                        David? Why are you calling my cell?

                                 DAVID
                        You remember the show Nifty Arrest?

                                 AVI
                        I LOVED Nifty Arrest!

           David and Salma smile.

           EXT. BOCA RATON CHEESY OUTDOOR VENUE - DAY

           A poorly built outdoor stage. A packed, mostly 
           mother/grandmother audience. PRINCE’s “The Most Beautiful 
           Girl in the World” plays on shoddy loudspeakers. A ten-year-
           old girl wearing far too much make-up struts on stage in a 
           ball gown.

           Javier stands in the corner dressed in a tuxedo version of 
           his Officer Johnny Ramirez outfit. He holds a microphone 
           designed like his signature billy club. Above Javier, a sign 
           reads- “LITTLE MISS BOCA RATON PAGEANT.”

                                 JAVIER
                        Here comes Jamie Wilowitz. Her 
                        likes- sandwiches and parakeets. 
                        Her dislikes- snails and terrorism. 
                        That’s Jamie folks.

           The audience applauds. Jamie walks off stage and blows them a 
           kiss. 

           David, dressed sharply in a suit, joins the audience. 
           A new 10-year-old is SHOVED onto the stage by a FUSSY MOTHER. 
           She DOES NOT want to be there.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        And here we have Melissa Glickman. 
                        Her likes- coffee and rain. Her 
                        dislikes- her...bitch of a mother, 
                        Janine.

           Melissa gives the middle finger to the woman who pushed her 
           on stage.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Melissa.

           Melissa glares at Javier.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        OK, let’s give it up one more time 
                        for Melissa Glickman.

           Scattered applause. Judges scribble down notes. Melissa exits 
           the stage and PUSHES her mother out of the way.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Officer Ramirez is gonna take a 
                        quick refreshment break before the 
                        next under-aged contestant.

           Javier puts his billy club microphone in his police belt and 
           jumps off stage. While mid-air, the cord from the mic runs 
           out of line and TUGS HIM BACK. He embarrassingly unplugs and 
           makes his way to the drinks. 

           An old BOCA RATON MOTHER, 60, meets him near the alcohol-free 
           refreshment station. Javier takes out a flask of Vodka.

                                 BOCA RATON MOTHER
                             (playfully)
                        Excuse me, officer.

           The mother plays with the top of Javier’s billy club.

                                 BOCA RATON MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        If you help my Jamie win, I’ll make 
                        it worth your while.

           She seductively puts Javier’s finger in her mouth. When the 
           finger comes out, there is a smear of WHITE SUBSTANCE on it.

                                 JAVIER
                        Uch. What the hell is that?
                                 BOCA RATON MOTHER
                        Oh, sorry. I was just eating an 
                        everything bagel with cream cheese.

           David approaches.

                                 DAVID
                        Javier, my name is David 
                        Silverstein. I’m a television 
                        producer from Miami.

                                 JAVIER
                        You’re shitting me.

                                 DAVID
                        No.

                                 JAVIER
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DAVID
                        Watching you perform.

                                 JAVIER
                        No. NO. NO! COME ON! You can’t 
                        judge me off of this! I’m a trained 
                        actor. I’ve done Shakespeare in the 
                        park! I’m not a children’s beauty 
                        pageant host.

           Javier looks down at his finger.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        And I almost never walk around with 
                        someone else’s cream cheese on my 
                        finger.

                                 DAVID
                        Listen Javier, I didn’t get to 
                        where I am without being able to 
                        spot real talent.

                                 JAVIER
                        Excuse me?

                                 DAVID
                        I think you are special. Even 
                        before you blew me away with that 
                        intro of Melissa Glickman.

           Javier is shocked.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I loved you on Nifty Arrest and was 
                        a huge fan of El Resplandor Tibio.

                                 JAVIER
                        Wow. You’ve seen Resplandor?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s my favorite show of all time. 
                        In high school, I grew a mustache 
                        just to be like your character 
                        Ricardo.

           Javier touches his mustache-less face.

                                 JAVIER
                        I loved that mustache. You want a 
                        drink?

           Javier pours some Vodka into a glass.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s eleven in the morning.

           Javier looks at his watch.

                                 JAVIER
                        10:30.

           Javier drinks.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m interested in putting you back 
                        on television.

           Javier does a SPIT TAKE INTO his glass. He holds back his 
           excitement and takes a classy sip from the now back-washed 
           beverage.

                                 JAVIER
                        Hmmm. That’s interesting. I 
                        mean...I have so much going on 
                        right now. Writing a movie. Working 
                        on a graphic novel about the 
                        process of writing that movie 
                        through the eyes of a werewolf.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re prepared to work around your 
                        schedule.

           Even more excitement is held back.
                                 JAVIER
                        Interesting. Interesting. What’s 
                        the show? I don’t do porno.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s called El Fuego Caliente.

           The emotional wind is knocked out of Javier.

                                 JAVIER
                        El Fuego Caliente?

                                 DAVID
                        Yes. Have you seen it?

                                 JAVIER
                        With Penelope...

                                 DAVID
                        Yes.

                                 JAVIER
                        Do you produce any other shows? 
                        Literally any other show in the 
                        world.

                                 DAVID
                        Just this one.

                                 JAVIER
                        I would now consider porno.

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry.

                                 JAVIER
                        Fuck! FUCK! FUUUUCK!

           David smiles.

                                 DAVID
                        You know what...I will have that 
                        drink.

           INT. LAME BOCA RATON BAR - MANY DRINKS LATER

           Boca Raton, lame bar, boring bartender, Dharma and Greg on the 
           TV. Javier and David sit at a table. Javier is HAMMERED.

                                 JAVIER
                        Listen, David. I WANT to do TV 
                        again. It’s just...THAT WOMAN! That 
                        fucking whorewolf of a woman! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAVIER (CONT'D)
                        She drives me crazy! Would I have 
                        to be in any scenes with her?

                                 DAVID
                        You would play her new love 
                        interest.

                                 JAVIER
                        DAVID! YOU ARE STICKING THIS NEEDLE 
                        FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN MY DICK 
                        HOLE!

                                 DAVID
                        What happened between you two?

           Javier takes another shot, puts it down next to the seven 
           empty glasses in front of him. 

           We ZOOM IN on Javier’s face. Dramatic.

                                 JAVIER
                        Have you ever lusted after a woman 
                        so intensely your balls cry to 
                        escape their sacs?

                                 DAVID
                             (whispers)
                        God yes.

                                 JAVIER
                        On Resplandor, Penelope and I 
                        couldn’t take our hands off each 
                        other. Between takes we would 
                        wildly make love in various 
                        closets, bathrooms and oversized 
                        garbage cans.

                                 DAVID
                        Jesus.

                                 JAVIER
                        Anytime I told her I cared for her, 
                        she would push away. Making love 
                        turned into fucking. Fucking turned 
                        into fist fights. Fist fights 
                        reverted back to fucking.

                                 DAVID
                        The circle of life.

                                 JAVIER
                        The craziness of our love affair 
                        made the show unstable. Penelope 
                        couldn’t handle it.

                        She gave the producers an 
                        ultimatum. Either they fire me...or 
                        she quits. She had the breasts. I 
                        was fired.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s terrible.

                                 JAVIER
                        Normally, the stars from 
                        telenovelas can’t break into 
                        American film and television. The 
                        only roles we can get are 
                        stereotypical nonsense like maids, 
                        gardeners or nannies with no 
                        dialogue.

           A bus boy comes by to get their empty glasses. We notice the 
           bus boy is FERNANDO COLUNGA from Soy Tu Duena! (The number 
           one telenovela in the real world). Fernando picks up their 
           glasses and leaves without saying a word.

                        But by some wonderful handjob from 
                        God, the very next week I booked 
                        Nifty Arrest, which went on to two 
                        beautiful seasons on UPN. The 
                        success drove Penelope crazy. 
                        Knowing that she was suffering made 
                        the series even more gratifying for 
                        me.

           David smiles and nods in agreement.

                        After the show was canceled, I lost 
                        all of my money on stupid 
                        investments- Pogs, rare beanie 
                        babies, investing in the Spiderman 
                        Musical...and that takes us to 
                        today. I’m broke. When I’m not 
                        getting fatter, I’m whoring out my 
                        trademark character to host beauty 
                        pageants, Bat Mitzvahs and penis 
                        enlargement infomercials.

                                 DAVID
                        Javier, if you come to El Fuego, 
                        you can stop all that. You’ll be 
                        back in the spotlight making real 
                        money.

           Javier starts to crack. David almost has him.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        And you can get back to making 
                        Penelope’s life a living hell.

           Javier smiles.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ROSE’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Rose sits on an ergonomic chair. She finishes a huge cup of 
           coffee and starts on a new one. The TV plays an episode of El 
           Lumbre Caluroso-

           EXT. LARGE MEADOW - EARLY 1900S - DAY

           Sunny day. Margarita puts on Sangrio’s rain-guarded cowboy hat 
           (even though there is no rain) and stares towards the distance. 
           Fifty yards away, staring right back into her eyes, is the 
           horse that trampled Sangrio. The horse snorts in disgust. 

           IT’S A SHOWDOWN.

           ZOOM IN on the horse. ZOOM IN on Margarita. 

           FLASHBACK to Sangrio getting trampled by the horse. 

           CUT BACK to the showdown at hand.

           Margarita unsheathes a machete from under her sexy tattered 
           skirt.

                                 MARGARITA (IN SPANISH)
                        AHHHHHHH!!!

           She runs FULL STEAM at the horse. The beast lets out a mighty 
           NAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY and runs faster at Margarita. The two 
           gladiators rush towards each other with fury in their souls.

           SLOW MOTION- ZOOM IN on the horse’s hooves POUNDING the 
           ground, dirt flying everyone. ZOOM IN on Margarita’s breasts 
           bouncing out of her shirt. The two get 
           closer...CLOSER...CLOSER...until THEY ARE INCHES AWAY.

                                 MARGARITA  (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        THIS IS FOR YOU, SANGRIO!!!

           Margarita JUMPS to the side and stabs the horse directly in 
           the heart. The horse stumbles to the ground, defeated. The 
           life drains from it’s eyes.

           THE GHOST OF SANGRIO FLOATS OUT OF THE HORSE’S BODY.
                                 SANGRIO’S GHOST (IN SPANISH)
                        Margarita.

           Margarita turns to see the ghost of her deceased love!

                                 MARGARITA (IN SPANISH)
                        Sangrio?!?

           (Rose watches, completely blown away.)

                                 ROSE (WATCHING TV)
                        Holy shit.

           (Back to the show.)

                                 SANGRIO’S GHOST (IN SPANISH)
                        Thank you for avenging my death.

                                 MARGARITA (IN SPANISH)
                        Sangrio...I love you.

           Sangrio’s ghost smiles.

                                 SANGRIO’S GHOST (IN SPANISH)
                        I know, my love. I’ve always known.

           Margarita climbs the horse’s lifeless corpse and passionately 
           kisses Sangrio’s ghost.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ROSE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 ROSE
                        FUCK!!!

           Rose throws her Starbucks cup against the wall. Gabriela, the 
           gorgeous P.A., dodges the cup and enters.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Here’s today’s script in Spanish 
                        and English, so you can follow 
                        along with the taping.

                                 ROSE
                        Thanks Gabriela.

                        Also, wardrobe needs you to OK the 
                        outfit for the new love interest.

                                 ROSE
                        What new love interest?
                                 GABRIELA
                        Penelope’s new love interest.

                                 ROSE
                        I didn’t write Penelope a new love 
                        interest.

           Rose RUNS out of her office and towards wardrobe. Gabriela 
           sighs and cleans the coffee off the wall.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - WARDROBE - MOMENTS LATER

           David and Salma smile at the changing area. A man steps from 
           beyond the curtain, his back towards the duo. He’s dressed in 
           an all-white suit (like Kevin Kline from the original 
           Soapdish). Rose enters.

                                 ROSE
                        WHAT THE FUCK, DAVID?!?

           The man takes a fake mustache from the table and slowly fixes 
           it to his face. He turns around. It’s Javier and he looks 
           stunning.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT! I did not 
                        approve this!

                                 DAVID
                        Avi did.

                                 ROSE
                        We are not using the asshole from 
                        Nifty Arrest in our show!

           Penelope enters the room wearing a sexy, form fitting peasant 
           dress.

                                 PENELOPE
                        You used way too much fabric, 
                        Marissa! How am I supposed to wear 
                        this on TV?! You’ve got to slut it 
                        up. Pretend it’s Halloween...

           Penelope sees Javier. She FREEZES...and FAINTS.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - STAGE 10 - DAY

           The stage has been transformed into a poor village in the 
           1800’s. Penelope paces back and forth. She wears a much more 
           snug version of the peasant dress we saw in wardrobe moments 
           ago. Rose approaches.
                                 ROSE
                        You don’t have to worry. I am a 
                        genius and I made this love 
                        interest work for us.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Where is Isabella? I want her 
                        close.

                                 ROSE
                        Why?

                                 PENELOPE
                        Because she’s my assistant and I 
                        want her here!

                                 ROSE
                        OK, you are flipping out. Just calm 
                        down. Can someone get Isabella, 
                        please!

           Just off stage, Javier goes through his acting warm ups.

                                 JAVIER
                        I’m a BIIIIIG LION. I’m a tiny 
                        mouse. I’M A BIIIIIG LION! I’m a 
                        tiny mouse.

           Javier stretches his face as far as it can go, then quickly 
           tightens it up. Back out to a BIG STRETCH then quickly into a 
           ball.

           Isabella passes by and notices Javier for the first time. 
           He’s looking good. He smiles in her direction. She smiles 
           back.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        I’m Javier.

                                 ISABELLA
                        I know who you are. My boss watches 
                        Nifty Arrest re-runs all the time. 
                        You’re even more handsome in 
                        person.

                                 JAVIER
                        You should see my penis.

           Isabella laughs flirtatiously. Penelope sees the whole thing.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (like yelling at a dog)
                        NO! Isabella! Come here! Now! COME!
                                 ISABELLA
                        Sorry, my master is calling me. 
                        We’ll have to reschedule this 
                        flirting for another time.

                                 JAVIER
                        Try to pencil me in soon.

           Javier blows a kiss to Isabella. Isabella grabs it and SLOWLY 
           MAKES OUT with it in her hand. Penelope approaches.

                                 PENELOPE
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 ISABELLA
                        What? I’m saying hi to the new guy. 
                        That’s what coworkers do. Why are 
                        you flipping out?

                                 PENELOPE
                        I’m not flipping out!

                                 ISABELLA
                        Why am I here? Do you need 
                        something?

                                 PENELOPE
                        Yes, I do. I need you to get 
                        me...a...Pepsi.

           Without taking a step, Isabella reaches into a cooler inches 
           away, grabs a Pepsi and gives it to Penelope. Penelope throws 
           it back in the cooler.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        No. Not a Regular Pepsi...I 
                        want...a...Crystal Clear Pepsi.

                                 ISABELLA
                        What?

                                 PENELOPE
                        I want a two liter bottle of 
                        Crystal Clear Pepsi.

                                 ISABELLA
                        They stopped making those in the 
                        90’s.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I didn’t ask for Pepsi’s Wikipedia 
                        page. I asked for a two liter 
                        bottle of Crystal Clear Pepsi.

                                 ISABELLA
                        That’s going to be impossible!

                                 PENELOPE
                        GO!

                                 ISABELLA
                        Argh!!!

           Isabella leaves in a “Penelope like” huff. Javier takes note 
           of the interaction.

                                 ROSE
                        I thought you wanted her here?

                                 PENELOPE
                        What?

                                 ROSE
                        Nevermind.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        First team!

           Penelope takes her position on set. Salma watches next to the 
           camera, twitching her fingers like Mr. Burns. The crew gets 
           ready. Things settle and- 

           EXT. PEASANT VILLAGE - 1800’S - DAY

           Luz (Penelope), hangs a white bed sheet on a laundry line. She 
           gets on her toes to secure the sheet, and in doing so, 
           accidentally pops the top button of her blouse.

           In the distance, a man donning a military uniform wildly 
           races on horseback towards the village.

           Luz returns to her laundry basket, bends over, and with even 
           more bust, grabs another bed sheet.

           The man draws closer. Luz looks up and notices the stranger 
           but can’t make out who it is.

           The mystery man rides within inches of Luz and sharply pulls 
           back on his horse, allowing a beautiful SLOW MOTION shot of a 
           now sun-silhouetted military man on horseback. The horse 
           settles. Luz squints to see through the sunset...

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH) 
                        Gonzalo?
                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        Luz.

           Luz can’t believe it. GONZALO (Javier) gets off his horse, 
           brushes his mustache with his fingers and looks into Luz’s 
           eyes.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                             (in shock)
                        It can’t be...

           There is IMMEDIATE CHEMISTRY. The two are in a trance. 
           Hypnotically moving closer to each other. Luz snaps herself 
           out of it.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        No. NO! This is IMPOSSIBLE! You 
                        were shot in the war!

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        Bullets can’t stop me from touching 
                        you.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        They said you were dead! They sent 
                        me your tags!

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        This is what kept me alive.

           Gonzalo takes Luz’s hand and places it over his heart. Their 
           eyes lock. Luz grabs Gonzalo’s chest.

           In the distance, the Prince returns with a bucket of water. 
           He watches the pair touch. The bucket drops to the ground. 
           The woman he threw everything away for...is throwing 
           everything away.

           Luz and Gonzalo breathe heavily. Bodies grind. Shirts pulled. 
           Necks scratched. It’s like watching two beautiful people turn 
           into werewolves. And then-- 

           THEY KISS! HARD, FORCEFUL, PASSIONATE!!!

           We cut back to the real world POV.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - STAGE 10 - CONTINUOUS

           Rose stands next to the camera.

                                 ROSE
                        I never wrote a kiss.
           The director is so turned on by the kissing, he doesn’t hear 
           Rose.

                                 DAVID
                             (to Director)
                        They aren’t supposed to kiss!

                                 DIRECTOR
                        CUT!!!

           Penelope and Javier don’t stop. They throw each other all 
           over the set, ripping clothes and breaking everything in 
           their path. The crew watches in shock. Javier’s fake mustache 
           RIPS OFF and STICKS to Penelope’s breasts. 

                                 DAVID
                        We should seal up the over-sized 
                        garbage cans.

           Penelope jumps on Javier and continues to kiss wildly. They 
           bump into the Prince who falls down and spills the bucket of 
           water all over his chest.

           SUDDENLY, Penelope STOPS kissing. She looks at Javier and 
           SLAPS him across the face with one hand, and AGAIN with the 
           other (classic telenovela move).

                                 PENELOPE
                        Asshole!

                                 JAVIER
                        Whore!

                                 PENELOPE
                        Get off my show! Nobody wants you 
                        here!

                                 JAVIER
                        There it is. The jealousy. You 
                        kicked me off once before but this 
                        time it’s impossible! My IMDB 
                        starmeter is too high!

                                 PENELOPE
                        NOBODY WATCHED NIFTY ARREST! It was 
                        fucking TERRIBLE!

                                 JAVIER
                        At least I get recognized in places 
                        outside of Little Havana!

           Low blow. Penelope SEETHES with anger and ATTACKS. She throws 
           props at Javier’s face. Javier easily avoids them and grabs 
           his fake mustache off the ground.
                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Look at you! Throwing props like a 
                        child. You are A MESS! Why don’t 
                        you do the show a huge favor and 
                        kill yourself.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Oh yeah?!? You want me to kill 
                        myself?!?

           Penelope grabs a bottle of Tylenol off the director’s chair, 
           opens the top and hovers it above her lips. She tilts it just 
           enough for the pills to balance on the rim of the bottle.

           ZOOM IN on the bottle.

                                 ROSE
                        Penelope stop, that’s enough!

           She tilts the bottle a little more. One pill falls into her 
           mouth.

                                 JAVIER
                        You love yourself too much to 
                        commit suicide.

           Penelope’s eyes FILL with rage. SHE DROPS THE ENTIRE BOTTLE 
           OF PILLS INTO HER MOUTH.  The crew doesn’t know what to do. 
           Rose runs on stage. Javier chuckles and remains calm.

                                 ROSE
                        PENELOPE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?

           Penelope motions for Rose to stop.

                                 JAVIER
                        You don’t have to worry, Rose. 
                        She’ll never swallow.

           Penelope looks Javier right in the eyes. The entire crew is 
           terrified. The room takes a worried breath...Penelope’s eyes 
           fill with tears.

           An emotionally charged beat...Oh my god...Penelope is going 
           to swallow! 

           Just then, Penelope SPITS out the pills. She falls to the 
           ground and cries.
           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - BOARD ROOM - LATER

           MAYHEM!!! YELLING!!! FRUSTRATION!!! David and Rose sit at the 
           end of a very packed and agitated table. Avi appears via 
           video chat.

                                 AVI
                             (calm)
                        So.

           The room quiets down and looks at the screen.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        When I got the call at 2:50 that we 
                        needed to have a meeting, I was 
                        confused. I was confused because as 
                        you know, at 3PM, I like to make my 
                        smoothie for the afternoon and play 
                        Bananagrams...and I know nobody at 
                        this table would want to interrupt 
                        my Bananagrams time.

           David looks nervous.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        So, I figured something terrible 
                        must have happened. I looked out my 
                        window expecting to see angry 
                        zombies or berserk demons but 
                        nothing was there. So, I ask you, 
                        if there was no apocalypse, and our 
                        ratings in Turkey were even with 
                        last week, why in the world would 
                        you interrupt my delicious smoothie 
                        and Bananagram hour?

                                 DAVID
                        You’re right, Avi. We shouldn’t 
                        have bothered you. We’ll reschedule 
                        for a more convenient...

                                 ROSE
                        Avi, David pitched you this love 
                        interest without going through me 
                        first. Now our set is a fucking 
                        disaster and it’s all due to Nifty 
                        Arrest. I’m sorry but Javier is not 
                        working out. We need him off the 
                        show IMMEDIATELY.
                                 AVI
                        He’s not going anywhere. We’ve 
                        already paid him for the five 
                        episode arc and having a TV veteran 
                        on the show can only help ratings.

           Rose rolls her eyes.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        So...instead of COMPLAINING about 
                        the situation, let’s think of ways 
                        to FIX it.

                                 DAVID
                        Absolutely. We’ll get to work on 
                        that right away.

                                 AVI
                        No David. I’m talking about now. 
                        Think of how to fix this NOW.

                                 DAVID
                        Right...well...

           David looks to Rose for help. Nothing.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        We...could...

           Just then, Isabella BURSTS through the door. She’s sweaty. 
           Shirt torn. Hair a sexy mess. Isabella slams a two liter 
           bottle of Crystal Clear Pepsi on the table and leans over.

                                 ISABELLA
                        I did it! I found Penelope her 
                        idiotic Crystal Clear Pepsi at some 
                        bullshit hipster store downtown. 
                        Where is she?

                                 DAVID

                        Her what?

                        We are putting her on the show. She 
                        is the hottest thing I’ve ever 
                        seen.

                        Rose, I am rock hard right now and 
                        that’s without the aid of Javier’s 
                        penis pills.

                        No one on this show is. Put her in 
                        a shirt that doesn’t have enough 
                        buttons and our ratings will soar.

                        write her in as?

           EXT. MIAMI FREEDOM TOWER - DAY

           David walks through downtown Miami. He turns a corner and 
           passes the majestic Freedom Tower. A city worker sweeps the 
           sidewalk. Upon further inspection, we realize that worker is 
           JAIME CAMIL from Los Exitosos Perez! (Enormous real life 
           telenovela in 2010). Before we give the audience a moment to 
           get excited, David gets a phone call.
                                 DAVID
                        Hello?

                                 SALMA (V.O.)
                        Where are you?

                                 DAVID
                        Oh hey baby, I’m near the Tower. 
                        Where are you?

           She hangs up.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Within milliseconds, BOOM!!! Salma appears out of nowhere and 
           PUNCHES David in the stomach...hard. It knocks the wind out 
           of him but he stays on his feet. Even through the pain, he 
           enjoys being dominated by Salma.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. How did you get here so fast?

                                 SALMA
                        What the hell did you do?

                                 DAVID
                        Nothing. I was just walking and you 
                        punched me.

                                 SALMA
                        There are now TWO women above me on 
                        the call sheet, David! And one of 
                        them is an assistant!

                                 DAVID
                        Baby, that was all Avi. I had 
                        nothing to do with it.

                                 SALMA
                        You couldn’t stop him?!?

                                 DAVID
                        I tried to but when Avi makes up 
                        his mind. It’s over.

                                 SALMA
                        Uch. I wish you weren’t such a 
                        pussy.

                                 DAVID
                        I mean, I took that punch pretty 
                        well.
           Salma punches David in the gut again. This time he drops.

                                 SALMA
                        It’s time I took things into my own 
                        hands.

           David squirms on the floor but bites his lip with pleasure. 
           He reacts to pain like Bill Murray in Little Shop of Horrors.

           INT. TRENDY MIAMI CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Penelope shops in a clothing store. Rose helps.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Isabella CANNOT be on the show!!! 
                        She’s not even an actress!

                                 ROSE
                        I know...but it’s too late.

           Penelope angrily goes to the changing room with Rose, but 
           it’s occupied. Penelope bangs on the door.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to worry. I’m going 
                        to make this work for us...again. 
                        I’m like your personal air bag. No 
                        matter how bad the crash, I will 
                        always protect you.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Unless you don’t inflate when I 
                        need you the most. Then I end up 
                        dead and you get moved to a 
                        different car for some quick cash.

           Penelope bangs harder. The door opens. IT’S JAVIER...WEARING 
           ONLY A BLACK THONG. Penelope and Rose were not expecting 
           this. They just stare.

                                 JAVIER
                        Ladies.

           Rose looks up. Penelope remains mesmerized.

                                 ROSE
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 JAVIER
                        Trying on underwear.

           Penelope can’t talk.
                                 ROSE
                        Do you know how unsanitary that is?

                                 JAVIER
                        Oh, they don’t mind.

           Javier waves to the employees, all over fifty years old. They 
           smile and wave back. Penelope snaps out of her trance.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Listen idiot, they are adding a new 
                        character to the show and you are 
                        NOT to talk to her outside of work. 
                        Understood?

                                 JAVIER
                        Why didn’t anyone tell me about 
                        this?

                                 ROSE
                        I tried calling but your cell 
                        wasn’t working.

                                 JAVIER
                        It works. I’m just late on 
                        payments. Right now, I can only 
                        make and receive calls from 1-800 
                        numbers.

                                 PENELOPE
                        You are a fucking joke.

                                 JAVIER
                        A joke that makes your body wet 
                        with anticipation.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Uch.

                                 JAVIER
                        Who’s joining the cast?

                                 ROSE
                        Isabella.

           Javier lights up.

                                 JAVIER
                        Hot assistant, Isabella?

                                 PENELOPE
                        STAY! AWAY!
                                 JAVIER
                        What does she play?

                                 ROSE
                             (hates to say it)
                        Your new love interest.

                          JAVIER
                                                        PENELOPE
           Perfect.
                                              NO!!!

           Penelope slams the changing room door closed in Javier’s 
           face.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (serious, panicking)
                        Rose. Isabella CANNOT play that 
                        asshole’s love interest.

                                 ROSE
                        What does it matter?

                                 PENELOPE
                        It...it just can’t happen! 
                        She’s...never acted before. You 
                        can’t force her to do something so 
                        dramatic on her first try. If she 
                        fails, her confidence will be 
                        destroyed. Just...please. Rose. For 
                        me.

           Rose sees this is real.

                                 ROSE
                        OK. She’ll be an a-sexual peasant 
                        or something.

                                 PENELOPE
                        That’s so smart. Thank you, Rose.

           Javier appears behind Penelope wearing a smaller, tiger print 
           thong. He gets close to her face.

                                 JAVIER
                        Why don’t you want Isabella to play 
                        my lover?

           Penelope tries to look away.

                                 PENELOPE
                        It has nothing to do with you.

           Javier gets closer. He pushes his body against hers and 
           whispers.
                                 JAVIER
                             (whispers)
                        Admit you still fantasize about me.

           He touches her face. She can’t help but exhale desire.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        It makes you crazy when other women 
                        touch my body.

           Penelope tries to be strong but Javier pushes her body 
           against the wall. He kisses her neck softly.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Admit my kiss makes your body 
                        tremble.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Your kiss does nothing.

           Javier kisses her cheek. She closes her eyes and shivers in 
           delight. They are so close, you can see his breath on her 
           lips. He leans in. She instinctively opens her mouth just 
           enough for a kiss. Her palms against the wall. 

           Javier stops.

                                 JAVIER
                             (whispers)
                        You’re lying.

           He steps away and walks towards the counter.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take this pair.

           The female workers are so turned on, they climb over each 
           other to get to the register.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Do you mind if I wear them out?

           Penelope slams the wall in frustration.

                                 PENELOPE
                        AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ISABELLA’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Isabella paces. Looking hot in a VERY TIGHT shirt missing a 
           series of buttons. She nervously studies a script and sips tea. 
                                 ISABELLA
                        Her heart belongs...

           Isabella checks the script.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        To another man. FUCK! OK. Her HEART 
                        beLONGS to ANOTHER man. 
                        Herheartbelongstoanotherman.

           Gabriela, the P.A., opens the door.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Five minutes.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Shit. Can you bring me another 
                        memory tea. This one isn’t working.

           Gabriela rolls her eyes and exits, leaving the door ajar. 
           Javier peers inside.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        You talking about her heart? Well, 
                        let me tell you, it 
                        belongs...to...ARGH!

           Isabella looks down at her script.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        ANOTHER MAN!!!

           Javier enters dramatically.

                                 JAVIER
                             (serious)
                        HER HEART BELONGS TO ANOTHER MAN!

           Isabella stops in awe.

                                 ISABELLA
                        That was amazing.

                                 JAVIER
                        I know.

                         ISABELLA
                                                         JAVIER
           How...
                                              Shhhhh...

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        I can teach you.

           Javier steps inside and shuts the door.
           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - PENELOPE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope paces back and forth in costume.  She bites her nails, 
           downs two Aleve and takes a swig straight from the two liter 
           bottle of Crystal Clear Pepsi. Her face sours at the taste.  
           She throws the bottle in the trash. Gabriela walks in.

                                 GABRIELA
                        Five minutes.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Thank you, five.

           Penelope looks across the hall and sees a Nifty Arrest poster 
           hanging on Javier’s dressing room door. She walks over with 
           the intentions of playing nice.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        Javier...

           The door opens. Nobody is there. Knowing EXACTLY where he is, 
           Penelope RIPS DOWN the Nifty Arrest poster and stomps towards 
           Isabella’s dressing room.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ISABELLA’S DRESSING ROOM - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Isabella balances on a stool, blind folded.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Her heart belongs to another man!

                                 JAVIER
                        Yes!

           Isabella pulls down the blind fold and smiles at Javier.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Now, do you see? Acting doesn’t 
                        come from here.

           Javier points to his head.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        It comes from here.

           Javier points to every part of his body and ENDS on his head. 
           Javier and Isabella share a moment...until BOOM! Penelope 
           BURSTS through the door.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (to Javier)
                        What did I tell you?!?
           Penelope looks at Isabella.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        GET DOWN FROM THERE NOW!

                                 ISABELLA
                        Javier was just helping me with my 
                        lines.

                                 PENELOPE
                        The only thing Javier can help you 
                        do is fail.

                                 JAVIER
                        Ha! If it wasn’t for me, Resplandor 
                        would have been cancelled after two 
                        episodes.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Are you crazy? The audience audibly 
                        GROANED every time you entered a 
                        scene.

                                 JAVIER
                        Oh, this is sad. Your old age must 
                        be effecting your memory. My back 
                        is still sore from carrying you in 
                        EVERY SCENE of that show!

                                 PENELOPE
                        No, no. Your back is sore from all 
                        the critics fucking you in the ass! 
                        Face it, Javier. You are a TERRIBLE 
                        ACTOR.

           WHOA. The sentence cuts Javier like a knife. 

           He grits his teeth, lunges forward and strikes a dramatic 
           pose.

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                             (serious)
                        I’m sorry...but your sister is 
                        dead.

           Penelope catches on.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                             (serious)
                        This was the clock my father gave 
                        me. Every time it ticks, I imagine 
                        his heart beating in heaven.

           Isabella watches in awe as this ACT-OFF gets deadly serious.
                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                             (serious)
                        My heart isn’t strong enough for 
                        another break up. If you leave...I 
                        will die.

           Penelope sits, pretends to be in a wheelchair.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                             (serious)
                        In the end, I sacrificed my 
                        legs...so this city could keep it’s 
                        soul.

           It’s like watching an amazing tennis match.

           Javier sits.

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                        If I can only have you in dreams. 
                        Then I want to sleep FOREVER!

           Penelope steps closer to Javier.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                        IF YOU’RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO 
                        JUMP...YOU’LL NEVER BE BRAVE ENOUGH 
                        TO FALL!

           Javier takes a step.

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                        YOUR SISTER RAPED ME!

           Penelope takes a step.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                        YOUR GRANDFATHER RAPED ME!

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                        MY LIFE IS...IS...ummm.

           They are face to face.

                JAVIER (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                 (stumbling)
           My life is...um...is 
           over...because...it...ummm...
           is time to...
                                                  PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                                              I SEE YOU SATAN! IF YOU WANT 
                                              THIS BABY, YOU’LL HAVE TO RIP 
                                              IT OUT OF MY WOMB WITH YOUR 
                                              BARE HANDS!!!

           Javier stumbles to one knee! Penelope wins.

           Gabriela knocks on the door.
                                 GABRIELA
                        Two minutes.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (smiles)
                        Thank you, two.

           Gabriela leaves.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        Isabella, come.

           Isabella follows Penelope out. Javier throws the stool 
           against the wall. He notices an old Resplandor poster- 
           (Penelope and Javier kissing in front of a sunset. Salma is 
           in the background dressed as a balloon salesman.) He snorts, 
           runs over to the memory and SMASHES it to pieces.

           INT. RUN DOWN CHURCH - 1800S - DAY

           Worn out candles illuminate a barren, run down church. Luz, 
           close to tears, pours her heart out to an OLD PRIEST.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        I can’t leave him. The Prince threw 
                        away his kingdom for me.

                                 OLD PRIEST (IN SPANISH) 
                        Luz, sometimes you have to put your 
                        own feelings before others. Does 
                        this other man, Gonzalo, make you 
                        happy?

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        He’s everything to me. When I 
                        thought I lost him, my world 
                        collapsed.

                                 OLD PRIEST (IN SPANISH)
                        And the Prince?

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        I love him. I truly do...but...he 
                        is not Gonzalo.

                                 OLD PRIEST (IN SPANISH)
                        Then you know what you must do.

           Luz looks at the priest for the answer.

                                 OLD PRIEST (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        Go to him.
           The candles shine brighter.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        Who?

                                 OLD PRIEST (IN SPANISH)
                        Gonzalo.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        Now?

           The old priest nods.

                                 OLD PRIEST (IN SPANISH)
                        Now.

           Luz kisses the priest on the forehead and runs out the door.

                                 LUZ (IN SPANISH)
                        Gonzalo! I’m coming!

           EXT. MEADOW - 1800’S - MOMENTS LATER

           Gonzalo leans on his sleeping horse and picks flowers. RAQUEL 
           (Isabella) enters, her shirt trying DESPERATELY to hang 
           on...but there just aren’t enough buttons.

                                 RAQUEL (IN SPANISH)
                        Gonzalo, I must tell you something.

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        I know you are A-sexual.

                                 RAQUEL (IN SPANISH)
                        It’s not that.

           She leans over so you can easily see down her shirt. Gonzalo 
           does so with no hesitation.

                                 RAQUEL  (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        The woman you wait for...her heart 
                        belongs to another man.

           (Isabella looks at Javier like “I did it, I memorized the 
           line.”  Javier smiles back then gets back to the scene.)

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        What do you mean?

                                 RAQUEL (IN SPANISH)
                        When you left, Luz fell in love 
                        with the Prince. They are to wed.
                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        No...

                                 RAQUEL (IN SPANISH)
                        Yes...

           Gonzalo breaks down.

                                 RAQUEL  (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Raquel walks away. Gonzalo wipes away his tears.

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        Well...at least I have you.

           Raquel turns around confused. That was not in the script.

           (Off-stage, Rose stands next to the camera.)

                                 ROSE (OFF CAMERA)
                        What did he just say?

           (Cut back to the scene)

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        Come to me, Raquel.

           Raquel takes a step towards Gonzalo.

                                 RAQUEL (IN SPANISH)
                        But I’m A-sexual.

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        Let’s see if we can break that 
                        spell.

           Gonzalo pulls her close, they are about to kiss. Raquel is 
           LOVING IT. 

           (Penelope sees the embrace from off-stage and FLIPS OUT. She 
           RUNS onto the set, ruining the scene.) 

           We cut to the real world POV.

           EXT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE SET - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope SHOVES Javier off Isabella. The crew doesn’t know 
           what to do.

                                 PENELOPE
                        YOU CANNOT KISS HER!
           Salma takes out a FLIP CAM and records.

                                 ISABELLA
                        What are you talking about?!? I can 
                        kiss whoever I want!

           Isabella steps towards Javier. Penelope gets in the way.

                                 PENELOPE
                        No, you can’t! Isabella...trust me.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Javier, kiss me!

           Javier comes closer to Isabella. Penelope TACKLES JAVIER TO 
           THE GROUND. The two slide on the floor.

                                 JAVIER
                        Ah ha! See! You ARE jealous!

                                 PENELOPE
                        I am not!

                                 JAVIER
                        Then why can’t she kiss me? Because 
                        she’s your assistant?

                                 PENELOPE
                        No, you nitwit.

                                 JAVIER
                        THEN WHY?

                                 PENELOPE
                        BECAUSE SHE’S MY DAUGHTER! And YOUR 
                        daughter! She’s our child, Javier. 
                        She’s our child.

           WHAT...THE...FUCK...Everyone is stunned. Props and boom 
           microphones drop to the floor in shock.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        I got pregnant while we were 
                        shooting Resplandor but I didn’t 
                        want you finding out, so I got you 
                        fired. I had the baby during a 
                        hiatus week and gave it to a nanny 
                        to raise. When she was old enough, 
                        I hired Isabella as my assistant so 
                        I could keep her close and look 
                        after her.
           Penelope gets off Javier. Nobody says a word. Salma continues 
           to record. She smiles at EVERY SYLLABLE that comes out of 
           Penelope’s mouth.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        I know what I did was wrong. I 
                        should have told you about Isabella 
                        and we should have raised her as a 
                        family. I made a mistake and I’m 
                        sorry. I chose my career over my 
                        family and I’ve regretted it every 
                        day since. Please...forgive me.

           Penelope goes towards Isabella who RUNS AWAY in tears.

           Penelope looks at Javier who walks silently to his dressing 
           room.

           Penelope is alone. She drops to the floor and cries.

           We see the scene through the lens of Salma’s camera- footage 
           digitized, sound muffled. Penelope crying.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        GET THAT CAMERA OFF OF ME!!!

           Penelope goes right at the lens and everything turns black. 
           We widen to reveal that the last part of the video was being 
           viewed-

           INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - EARLY AFTERNOON

           ON YOUTUBE! A 20 year old woman of Mexican decent can’t take 
           her eyes off of Penelope on the computer screen. An El Fuego 
           Caliente poster hangs on the woman’s wall.

                                 COMPUTER GIRL
                        Holy shit.

           INT. JAVIER’S ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Javier returns to his run-down apartment for the first time 
           since the debacle. Without turning on the lights, he kicks off 
           his shoes, sits on a worn out futon and rubs the stress from 
           his eyes.

           A beat.

           With a deep exhale, he grabs the universal remote and turns on 
           the TV. The local news plays-

                        the set of the number two Spanish 
                        speaking show in Miami- El Fuego 
                        Caliente.
           Javier sits up. This is not good.

           Penelope’s YouTube video plays in the background.

                                 PENELOPE (ON TV)
                        I know what I did was wrong. I 
                        should have told you about Isabella 
                        and we should have raised her as a 
                        family. I made a mistake and I’m

                        cardiac arrest.

                        Nice one, Sherry.

           Salma cracks up. David goes in for a kiss but Salma pushes 
           him to the side.

           A beat.

           What has she done?
           EXT. ISABELLA’S TINY STUDIO APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           Isabella waits by a crosswalk for the light to change. A 
           couple whispers and points. Isabella gets self-conscious and 
           hurries across while the light is still red.

           INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING

           A depressed Javier waits on line at Starbucks. A passerby 
           smiles. Javier smiles back to be polite. Javier gets to the 
           counter.

                                 JAVIER
                        Grande Caramel Macchiato with skim 
                        milk please.

           The woman behind the register seems paralyzed with 
           excitement. She looks at Javier like she’s seeing a 
           celebrity. Not someone from Nifty Arrest...a real celebrity.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)

                        would you like?

                             (confused)
                        That’s it.

           Javier goes to the pick up station. He looks around as random 
           people stare with smiling faces. They seem genuinely excited 
           to see him. A BARISTA hands over Javier’s drink.

                                 BARISTA
                        Here you go.

                                 BARISTA

                                 JAVIER
                        Sorry, I ordered a grande.

                                 BARISTA
                        The upgrade is on the house. As 
                        well as this lemon square and bagel 
                        with vegetable cream cheese.

           Both items are handed to Javier. As he grabs the cup, the 
           barista touches his hand.

                                 BARISTA (CONT’D)
                        It’s terrible the way Penelope 
                        treated you. Keeping your daughter 
                        hidden for so long. You are such a 
                        good man, we’re all rooting for 
                        you.

                                 JAVIER
                        ...Thank you.

                                 BARISTA
                        No, thank you.

           The barista sneaks something into Javier’s hand.

                        Here’s another lemon square.

           Javier grabs all his food and exits.

           INT. PENELOPE’S GORGEOUS HOUSE - GARAGE - MORNING

           Penelope, cell in hand, walks through her garage and makes a 
           phone call.

           RING. RING. RING. The call goes to voice mail.

                                 ISABELLA (OVER THE PHONE)
                        This is Isabella, leave a message 
                        after the beep. (Kiss noise) (BEEP)

                                 PENELOPE
                        Isabella, it’s Penelope. I’m so 
                        sorry. You never deserved this. 
                        It’s not fair that you have to 
                        suffer for my mistakes. Please call 
                        me back. Please.

           Penelope hangs up, opens the garage door and backs out 
           slowly. As she exits, she notices a MOB OF PAPARAZZI on her 
           property.
                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)

                        Penelope!!! Penelope!!!

           Cameras flash like CRAZY! There are fifteen bearded, out of 
           shape men with digital cameras snapping as quickly as they 
           can. Penelope can barely open her eyes. Paparazzi surround 
           her car, absorbing it like an amoeba. TMZ jumps to the 
           driver’s side.

                                 TMZ CAMERAMAN
                        Penelope, did Javier wear his Nifty 
                        Arrest uniform during sex? Is it 
                        true he liked to handcuff you to 
                        the bed and use his nightstick?

           Penelope can’t take it. She changes gears and FLIES back in 
           the garage. She presses a button to close the garage door. 

           In the rear view mirror, photographers get on their knees 
           with the precious time before the door is fully closed. They 
           look like zombies crawling for brains.

                                 PAPARAZZI
                        Penelope!!! Penelope!!! Penelope!!!

           The door finally closes. Their voices are faint in the 
           background. 

                                 TMZ CAMERAMAN (O.S.)

                        Mr. Belvedere?

           Penelope rests her head on the steering wheel.

           Isabella walks down the sidewalk. She listens to Penelope’s 
           voice mail and angrily erases it. Before she can put her 
           phone away, a text message from an unknown number appears on 
           the screen.

           TEXT- “HEY, I FOUND YOUR NUMBER ONLINE. WOULD LOVE TO TALK 
           AND MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.”

           Another text comes from a different number.
           TEXT- “HEY BABY, UNLIKE YOUR PARENTS, I’LL MAKE SURE I’M 
           ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU. CALL ME. I HAVE OILS AND SIZE 13 
           SNEAKERS.”

           A different number.

           TEXT- “ISABELLA, THIS IS YOUR MAILMAN. WE HAVE A PACKAGE 
           WAITING FOR YOU AT THE POST OFFICE.”

           PICTURE TEXT- A PHOTO of a mailman lying NUDE on top of a 
           BASKET OF MAIL. 

           Isabella throws the phone into the street.

           INT. PENELOPE’S GORGEOUS HOUSE - GARAGE

           Penelope is still in her car. She grips the steering wheel, 
           pumps herself up and opens the garage door. Paparazzi waits 
           like a pack of starving hyenas. She SLAMS on the gas, and 
           reverses into a half dozen cameramen. In a Fast and the 
           Furious like maneuver, Penelope skids 180 degrees and FLIES 
           away from the flashing lights. 

           She picks up her phone, scrolls through her contacts and 
           dials Javier.

           RING. RING. RING. Someone picks up.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Javier, I’m so sorry...

                                 OPERATOR (ON THE PHONE)
                        This phone can only make and 
                        receive calls from 1-800 numbers. 
                        Thank you.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!

           Penelope can’t take it. She SCREECHES to a halt and takes a 
           breath. 

           A beat.

           She thinks...makes a decision and spins the car around.

           INT. GOLD’S GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Javier is on the stair master- lemon square on the magazine 
           rack, lemon square in hand. 
           As he climbs at a slow pace, a gorgeous WORK OUT GIRL, 21, 
           jumps on the empty stair master to the right. Her work out 
           shirt far too tight and small. Javier pumps a little faster 
           hoping to impress.

           Just then, the open stair master to the left is ATTACKED by 
           two gorgeous women, both desperately trying to work out next 
           to Javier. One pushes the other to the ground and jumps on.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        I saw you on TV yesterday.

                                 JAVIER
                        Oh, ya?

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        Ya. And then I played with you all 
                        night in my dreams.

           Javier wasn’t expecting that...Not from a woman who isn’t 60.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2
                        Why don’t you come to the steam 
                        room with us.

                                 JAVIER
                             (flirty)
                        What would we do in the steam room?

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        We would fuck.

                                 JAVIER
                        Wow.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2
                        Ya.

           The girls use the Stairmasters seductively. Each step, 
           another moan.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2 (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

                                 JAVIER
                        I mean...I have to be at work soon.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        Forget work. How that woman treated 
                        you is terrible.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2
                        Let us make it all better.
                                 JAVIER
                        I don’t know.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        Just like you, we can go for two 
                        straight hours.

                                 JAVIER
                        It’s probably because of all the 
                        working out you do.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        Don’t make us beg.

           Javier wants this bad but he’s having moral issues.

                                 JAVIER
                        Uch. I can’t believe I’m saying 
                        this but I feel like I need a day 
                        to process all the stuff in my life 
                        before I can have crazy sex with 
                        two random women in a steam room.

           Work out girl 2 GETS ON Javier’s stairmaster and joins him in 
           stride.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2
                        I don’t think you need a day to 
                        figure it out.

           Javier shakes his head. This is insane! How can he pass this 
           up...but...

                                 JAVIER
                        No...no...I definitely need at 
                        least a day. Can I take a rain 
                        check?

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 1
                        Fine. Here’s my number.

           Work out girl 2 takes a pen, lifts up Javier’s pants all the 
           way to his TIGER PRINT THONG and writes her number on his 
           inner thigh. The other work out girl does the same with the 
           other thigh.

                  WORK OUT GIRL 1 (CONT’D)
                                                     WORK OUT GIRL 2
           Call us.
                                              Call us.

                                 JAVIER
                        It’s gonna be kind of hard to read 
                        that without a mirror.
           They both kiss his thigh. Javier shivers with delight. He 
           takes his towel and steps off the machine.

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2
                        Can I have your towel?

                                 JAVIER
                        Sure.

           Javier throws the towel over. Work out girl 2 smells the 
           towel and rubs it on her crotch.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Are you guys real...or am I 
                        dreaming?

                                 WORK OUT GIRL 2
                        We’ll be waiting...

           EXT. LITTLE HAVANA - PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Penelope parks her car near the Little Havana sign. She 
           stands upright, takes off her sunglasses and struts through 
           the park.

           As pedestrians take notice, everyone stops and stares. “Fans” 
           turn their backs. Each person we saw on our last visit is now 
           disgusted with the telenovela star.

                                 LITTLE HAVANA MAN (IN SPANISH)
                        Get the hell out of here.

                                 LITTLE HAVANA WOMAN (IN SPANISH)
                        Whore!

           Penelope tears up and tries to leave only to be bumped by a 
           fourteen year old girl.

                                 LITTLE HAVANA GIRL (IN SPANISH)
                        We looked up to you.

           Penelope regains her footing and leaves.

           EXT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON

           Isabella puts her head down and pushes through the COLLECTION 
           of paparazzi in front of the stages.

                                 PAPARAZZI
                        Isabella! Isabella! What’s your bra 
                        size?!?
           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ISABELLA’S DRESSING ROOM - 
           SECONDS LATER

           Isabella walks down the hallway and into her dressing room. 
           Javier is there waiting.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Get out!

                                 JAVIER
                        Isabella.

                                 ISABELLA
                        I can’t believe you tried to kiss 
                        me! You are sick!

                                 JAVIER
                        I had no idea!

                                 ISABELLA
                        I DON’T CARE! MY LIFE IS RUINED!

                                 JAVIER
                        Your life isn’t ruined. It’s going 
                        to be fine.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Don’t talk to me like you’re my 
                        father.

                                 JAVIER
                        No, I didn’t mean...

                                 ISABELLA
                        JUST LEAVE!!!

           Javier exits.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - JAVIER’S DRESSING ROOM - 
           SECONDS LATER

           Javier steps into his dressing room. Penelope is there 
           waiting...next to a big pile of mail, gifts and nude photos 
           from fans.

                                 JAVIER
                        Get out!

                                 PENELOPE
                        Javier, I wanted to tell you.

                                 JAVIER
                        Then why wouldn’t you just TELL ME?
                                 PENELOPE
                        I don’t know. I made a mistake. We 
                        never seemed stable enough for a 
                        child.

                                 JAVIER
                        YOU were never stable enough for a 
                        child.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Who knows whose fault it was.

                                 JAVIER
                        YOURS! IT WAS YOUR FAULT!!!

                                 PENELOPE
                        It doesn’t matter. I am so sorry.

                                 JAVIER
                        It’s one thing to kick me off a 
                        show and try to ruin my 
                        professional life...but to destroy 
                        my personal life too...that is pure 
                        evil.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (close to tears)
                        I didn’t mean to hurt you. There 
                        are times in life when your 
                        emotions run so high, you can’t 
                        control the way you act. I was so 
                        saturated in your emotion, I made 
                        an enormous mistake. One that 
                        changed my life forever. And not a 
                        day goes by that I don’t wish I 
                        could take that decision back. 
                        Not...a...day.

                                 JAVIER
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 PENELOPE
                        What?

                                 JAVIER
                        That was a monologue from last 
                        week’s episode of El Fuego 
                        Caliente.

           Oh shit...it was. Penelope closes her eyes in shame.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I’m not used to using my own words 
                        to express the way I feel.
                                 JAVIER
                        You are a fucking joke. If you 
                        stopped looking at yourself in the 
                        mirror for one second, you would 
                        see all of the people you hurt 
                        every day.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Javier.

                                 JAVIER
                        JUST LEAVE!

           Penelope opens the door to exit. Salma is there, listening 
           through the door with David beside her. Penelope pushes 
           through the smiling pair.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope walks away from Javier’s office and sees Isabella 
           opening her dressing room door.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Isabella!!!

           Isabella sees Penelope and tries to close the door. Penelope 
           uses her foot to block the way.

                                 PENELOPE (CONT’D)
                        Isabella, please. I need to talk to 
                        you.

                                 ISABELLA
                        Get away from me!

                                 PENELOPE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 ISABELLA
                        No, you aren’t!

                                 PENELOPE
                        I am! Isabella, I love you.

           Isabella opens the door.

                                 ISABELLA
                        No.

           Isabella SHOVES Penelope away from the door.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        NO! YOU DON’T GET TO LOVE ME!
           Isabella PUSHES Penelope HARDER across the hallway.

                                 ISABELLA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t get to love someone you 
                        THREW AWAY!!!

                                 PENELOPE
                        Isabella, I never threw you...

           Isabella SLAMS Penelope against the wall. Her back SMASHES 
           into a framed poster of El Fuego Caliente. The glass frame 
           breaks into a hundred pieces.

           ZOOM IN on Isabella.

                                 ISABELLA
                        I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

           Isabella pushes Penelope into the glass shards on the ground 
           and leaves. Cut and bruised, Penelope slowly gets up. This is 
           a different type of pain. Penelope is hurting deep. Holding 
           back all of her emotions, she enters her dressing room.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - PENELOPE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope slams the door and silently bleeds. 

           She sees a bottle of Tylenol on the table and stares at it 
           like it’s taunting her. She picks it up, blood from her hands 
           turning the white bottle red. She pops the cap and EMPTIES 
           the ENTIRE BOTTLE into her mouth!

           Silent tears stream down her face. She holds the pills in her 
           cheeks. This isn’t for show. No one is around to watch. 
           Penelope closes her eyes...and CHOKES DOWN ALL OF THE PILLS!!

           A beat. 

           She breathes fast, arms shaking, pills pulsing through her 
           body. Panicking, she runs to the toilet, puts her fingers 
           down her throat and throws up violently. White substance 
           slowly drains onto the bowl and floor. Defeated, Penelope 
           leans against the toilet and stares blankly at the wall, too 
           exhausted to cry.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - BOARD ROOM - LATER

           The room is PACKED. Isabella, Javier, Salma, Antonio, David, 
           Rose, the director, writers, Gabriela, everyone but Penelope 
           is stuffed into this board room. They angrily shout over each 
           other. A cacophony of noise and mayhem. 
           Just then, for the first time ever, AVI ENTERS THE ROOM IN 
           PERSON! 

           Total silence.

           Without saying a word, Avi rolls up the projector screen and 
           sits at the head of the table. 

           A beat.

           Everyone anxiously waits. Avi leans in.

                                 AVI
                        Hi.

           Thinking they are all fired, the room ERUPTS in MAYHEM! 
           EVERYONE SHOUTS AT THE SAME TIME.

                           DAVID
           This is all Rose’s fault. You 
           should fire her immediately!
                                                          ROSE
                                              We can fix this Avi. There’s 
                                              no need to fire anyone.

                         DIRECTOR
                                                         ANTONIO
           We can get new actors. But 
           it’s near impossible to 
           replace a director!
                                              Please don’t fire me. I’ve 
                                              been working out more!  I’m 
                                              so close to going from a six 
                                              pack to an eight pack!

           I have four kids, what am I 
           supposed to say to them when 
           you fire me?
                                              I can’t go back to being a 
                                              camp counselor. That job only 
                                              works two months of the year. 
                                              Please, Avi, don’t fire me.

                                                         JAVIER
                         ISABELLA
           This is all Penelope’s fault! 
           She should be fired!
                                              You’ve already paid me for 
                                              the rest of the season, you 
                                              would be losing money if you 
                                              got rid of me now.

                           SALMA
                                                        GABRIELA
           It’s time to make me the 
           star, Avi. It’s what the 
           world wants!
                                              I’ll blow you. I’ll do it 
                                              right now to keep this job. I 
                                              can’t move back in with my 
                                              parents.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        EVERYONE STOP!

           The room does as the King says.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        All I said was hi.
           A beat.

                        Hi.

           David stares at the writer.

                                 AVI
                        No one is fired.

                                 DAVID
                        Really?

                                 AVI
                        Really! This is the happiest day of 
                        my life!

                                 ROSE
                        What?

                                 AVI
                        We are in every newspaper! Every 
                        magazine! Every trashy news show- 
                        both Spanish AND English!!! That 
                        never happens to telenovelas!

                                 ROSE
                        But it’s for all the wrong reasons. 
                        It shows us as a mess. A joke.

                                 AVI
                        That’s what our show is! A mess! A 
                        joke! The free publicity is a 
                        dream! We are the closest we’ve 
                        ever been to number one in the 
                        ratings!! Lumbre Caluroso must be 
                        shitting their pants.

           The room can’t believe it.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        Everyone is on pins and needles to 
                        see what we are going to do next! 
                        Whatever you guys did to make 
                        Penelope that unstable was genius! 
                        And her mental breakdown is 
                        HAPPENING JUST IN TIME FOR 
                        SWEEPS!!!

           Salma CAN’T BELIEVE IT!!! She punches the El Fuego Caliente 
           poster off the wall. The glass frame shatters.
                                 GABRIELA
                        Come on! That’s the second frame I 
                        have to replace TODAY!

           Penelope enters the room. She looks sluggish and depressed 
           from her pill episode just minutes ago.

           Frightened, Antonio jerks the table which spills a glass of 
           water on his shirt.

                                 AVI
                        There she is! Our web sensation! We 
                        need something BIG out of you next 
                        week, Penelope. So, start gearing 
                        up that crazy!

           Penelope is there but barely listening. She’s in her own 
           depressed world.

                                 AVI (CONT’D)
                        If we pull this off, we finally 
                        have a chance to beat those idiots 
                        at Lumbre Caluroso. We could be 
                        number one in the ratings! AHH! I 
                        can’t wait to see the reaction on 
                        my father’s face! But we have to be 
                        smart. We need something huge. Our 
                        Luz, Prince, Armadillo love 
                        triangle wasn’t enough last year. 
                        Sex with placental mammals is NOT 
                        what our demographic wanted to see. 
                        This year, we need to think BIGGER!

                                 JAVIER
                        There is no need to think because I 
                        will NOT do the show if that whore 
                        is still on it.

           Javier points to Penelope.

                                 JAVIER (CONT’D)
                        Either she goes...or I go.

                                 ISABELLA
                        And I will not step foot on that 
                        stage if that disgusting old man is 
                        anywhere near it.

                                 JAVIER
                        Isabella, come on! I had no idea I 
                        was your father! And to be fair, 
                        you were flirting with me too. I 
                        blew you a kiss and you pretended 
                        to make out with it. Remember?
                                 ISABELLA
                        SHUT UP!!! EITHER YOU FIRE HIM 
                        RIGHT NOW OR I QUIT!

           Penelope leans against the wall. Too detached to hear the 
           words around her.

                                 AVI
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everyone calm 
                        down. There’s no need to yell when 
                        we are having such a great week.

                                 ISABELLA
                        This has been the worst week of my 
                        life.

                                 JAVIER
                        I’m serious, Avi. We need to handle 
                        this now.

                                 AVI
                        Well, if none of you can work 
                        together...then...we’ll 
                        just...have...to...KILL ONE OF YOU 
                        OFF IN THE NEXT EPISODE!!!

                                 SALMA
                        YES!

           Penelope, Javier and Isabella immediately look up, terrified.

                                 AVI
                        NO ONE WILL SEE IT COMING! We can 
                        advertise it like crazy. People 
                        will shake with anticipation!

           Avi and Gabriela exit. Javier and Isabella stare at Penelope 
           with hatred in their eyes.
           INT. SALSA PICANTE STUDIOS - MORNING

           A POP CULTURE HOST, 31, very handsome, very spray tanned, is 
           in the middle of a Spanish version of E! News Daily called 
           Salsa Picante (Spicy Salsa). A photo of a (fictional) 
           telenovela star, LORENA SALZA, is on the screen with an X 
           through her face. The word HERPES is in bold lettering 
           underneath.

                                 SALSA PICANTE HOST (IN SPANISH) 
                        So, if you’ve had sex with 
                        telenovela star Lorena Salza in the 
                        past few weeks, get yourself 
                        checked immediately.

           The photo changes from Lorena to the cast of El Fuego 
           Caliente (Penelope, Javier and Isabella). The word EXCLUSIVA 
           flashes underneath the photo. A terribly cheesy song plays.

           INT. TACOS CACHONDA STUDIOS - CONTINUOUS

           At the very same time, an almost identical host is spreading 
           the “exclusive” on his show, Tacos Cachonda (Horny Tacos). A 
           different photo of Penelope, Isabella and Javier is on the 
           screen with the word “Exclusiva” underneath.

           underneath.

           EXT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - MORNING

           Paparazzi line the entrance of the stages. A ticking digital 
           clock hangs on top of the facade. It reads 00:25:23- twenty 
           five minutes till the live episode begins.

           A group of energetic paparazzi take a million photos of a 
           taxi pulling up to the curb.

                                 PAPARAZZI
                        Penelope!!! Penelope!!! What are 
                        you going to do if you die? Is it 
                        true you tried to commit suicide? 
                        What’s your favorite Katy Perry 
                        song?

           Penelope gets out of the cab and looks miserable. She doesn’t 
           react to any of the questions. All this time she thought this 
           is what she wanted...she was wrong.

           A WHITE BENTLEY rolls up behind the taxi. Out walks Gabriela, 
           looking VERY SEXY in a tight white dress. Paparazzi easily 
           take a series of “up the skirt” photos as she gets out of the 
           car. Behind her, Avi Klauchman holds a bundle of cue cards.

                                 PAPARAZZI (CONT’D)
                        Avi!!! Avi!!! What do the cards 
                        say? Who dies? Why do you only wear 
                        linen pants?

                        TELEUNIVERSO!

           Gabriela opens the door for Avi to walk inside.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - ISABELLA’S DRESSING ROOM - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Isabella looks in the mirror and breathes methodically to 
           calm herself down. Nerves rattled, she rests her hands on the 
           table to stop them from shaking.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - JAVIER’S DRESSING ROOM - 
           CONTINUOUS

           An envelope rests on Javier’s make up table. He tears it open- 
           An old photo of Penelope hugging Javier on the set of 
           Resplandor falls out (the same photo we saw fall out of the 
           picture frame in Penelope’s dressing room at the beginning of 
           the movie). 
           He opens the attached letter- “I take it back. You are not a 
           terrible actor. In fact, you are brilliant. Inside and out. 
           All of this was my fault. I wasn’t ready to have a child and 
           I ruined it for both of us. I’m sorry. I miss you. Penelope” 
           Javier lowers his head. Tears build.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - PENELOPE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope sits in front of her make up mirror. A single tear 
           escapes her eye and falls on her bandaged hands. Rose moves 
           in from behind and talks through the mirror’s reflection.

                                 ROSE
                        Be careful about Avi’s writing. 
                        He’s terrible. Get through those 
                        words as quickly as possible.

           Penelope doesn’t respond.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You are going to be great. There is 
                        no way he’ll kill you off. You’re 
                        too important to the show.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I don’t care.

                                 ROSE
                        Come on, Penelope. I know you are 
                        going through a lot right now but 
                        this could be the biggest moment of 
                        your career. If you ever wanted to 
                        make a name for yourself, tonight 
                        is the night to do it.

           Gabriela knocks on the door.

                                 GABRIELA
                        They’re ready for you, Penelope.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - STAGE 10 - CONTINUOUS

           Just beyond the stage, a NASA like SOUND BOARD is surrounded 
           by TRANSLATORS from dozens of different countries. They 
           settle into their booths and set up their microphones. We 
           hear a cacophony of sound checks in different languages.

                                 TRANSLATORS
                             (in dozens of languages)
                        Check. Check. My baby was stolen! 
                        Check. Check. How are the levels? 
                        Oh no! Someone died! Check. Check.
           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Javier exits his dressing room and walks towards the stages. 
           Isabella joins him in stride. Javier looks over but Isabella 
           doesn’t look back. 

           Penelope joins them with Rose in tow. Penelope looks at her 
           “family” but gets no reaction.

           EXT. MIAMI STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The Cuban stores have all closed. Signs in their windows read- 
           “Closed early for El Fuego Caliente! We love you Javier!”

           The American sports bar right next door is still in full 
           swing, totally unaffected by the show.

           INT. MIAMI APARTMENTS - CONTINUOUS

           A group of good looking Latino women and gay men turn their 
           TVs to TeleUniverso. They stare at the screen which shows a 
           huge photo of our three stars and a digital countdown till 
           airtime.

           INT. EL FUEGO CALIENTE STAGES - STAGE 10 - CONTINUOUS

           Javier, Isabella, Antonio and Penelope are pulled aside by 
           wardrobe and given outfits. They change in designated areas 
           behind the stage.

           Rose paces back and forth near the camera. Avi rolls in.

                                 AVI
                        How much time?

                        Perfect.

           Salma and David enter. Salma taps Avi on the shoulder.

                                 SALMA
                        Avi, I can’t find the wardrobe 
                        person with my Princess outfit.

                                 SALMA
                        NO, NO, NO! You can’t do this to 
                        me!!! I am a STAR!

                        a Mango smoothie with an Immunity 
                        boost.

                                 SALMA
                        DAVID! SAY SOMETHING!

           David stands there, unsure of his next move. He looks at 
           Salma...then at Avi. Decision made.

                                 DAVID
                        Get me a mango smoothie but with a 
                        flax and fiber boost. Can you 
                        remember that or do you want me to 
                        write it down for you?

           Something in Salma SNAPS. She looks POSSESSED. She walks off 
           without saying a word.

           Avi walks over to the two CUE CARD GUYS.

                                 AVI
                        It’s time to make history.

           He hands over the cue cards and positions the men in front of 
           the cameras.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        OK, thirty seconds away!

           A HORSE TRAINER walks a TINY HORSE up to Penelope and 
           Antonio.

                                 PENELOPE
                        Am I supposed to get on that?

                                 HORSE TRAINER
                        Both of you are.

           Penelope sighs and gets on the tiny horse with Antonio.
                                 ANTONIO
                             (excited)
                        This horse makes me look huge!

           Isabella realizes the weight of the situation. After one 
           episode, she is about to act LIVE in front of millions of 
           people.

           She watches the cue card guys set up and reads the first card- 
           RAQUEL SITS NEXT TO GONZALO.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Ten seconds!

           Isabella freaks out.

                                 ISABELLA
                             (to herself)
                        I can’t do this. I’m not ready. I 
                        can’t do this.

           In a moment of panic, Isabella looks to Penelope for help. 
           Penelope looks back, happy to finally make a connection.

                                 PENELOPE
                             (whispers)
                        It’s gonna be OK.

           Isabella nods.

                        I swear to you, it’s...the truth.

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)
                        I don’t believe you. There’s no way 
                        Luz took another man.

           Luz and the Prince ride in on a tiny horse. It is clumsy but 
           Antonio is trying to sell it as hard as he can.

                        new love, the Prince. Right there 
                        on that tiny horse.

                        You promised to wait till I came

                        I thought you were dead.

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)

           Raquel steps in the line of fire. The Prince looks at Avi who 
           gives a thumbs up.

                                 PRINCE (IN SPANISH)
                        So be it.
           The Prince re-aims at Raquel’s breasts when OUT OF NOWHERE 
           SOMEONE PUSHES THE PRINCE OFF THE STAGE! 

           He fumbles and falls onto a water cooler...which drenches his 
           shirt.

           We look up to see the person who pushed the Prince was SALMA! 
           She is dressed in normal street clothes.

                                 GONZALO (IN SPANISH)

           Salma takes out a REAL GUN and shoots the sky. A light falls 
           to the ground. EVERYONE SCREAMS AND RUNS FOR COVER. The cue 
           card guys throw the remaining cards in the air and leave. The 
           cameramen follow right behind. The main cast is frozen with 
           fear. This is real.

                        Don’t tell me what to do!!! I’M 
                        DONE STANDING IN YOUR SHADOW! I

                        WAY THE WORLD WILL SEE THAT...IS IF 
                        YOU DIE!

           Salma points the gun at Penelope’s face. Penelope looks away, 
           praying for her life when...JAVIER STEPS IN THE LINE OF FIRE.

           Salma cocks back the hammer of her gun and points it at 
           Javier. Without anyone noticing, Rose sneaks up from behind.

                                 SALMA (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to enjoy this.

           ROSE JUMPS ON STAGE AND TRIES TO HIT THE GUN OUT OF SALMA’S 
           HAND! But...Salma is too fast. She KNOCKS Rose unconscious.

           While Salma’s back is turned, Isabella TACKLES HER TO THE 
           GROUND!

           BANG!!! BANG!!! Bullets fly everywhere.

           The two fight, gun in hand. They tear each other’s shirts 
           off. Sweat dripping down their breasts, they continue to 
           struggle, moaning with each move. 
           Isabella gets the upper hand and KNOCKS the gun away from 
           Salma. 

           Javier jumps in and PUNCHES SALMA IN THE FACE! She’s out 
           cold.

           Salma, sit at a table. Isabella and Javier hold winning 
           statues.

           The world’s biggest Televenovela star walks on stage.

                                 TELENOVELA STAR (IN SPANISH)
                        And finally we’ve gotten to the 
                        last award of the night. Best 
                        Telenovela of the year.

           One of the buttons on the actor’s shirt pops off. His chest 
           is exposed but he nonchalantly pushes on.

                        And the nominees are.

           The screen shows clips from the nominees.

           Lumbre Caluroso clip- The ghost of Sangrio is having sex with 
           Margarita. The GHOST OF THE HORSE watches outside with angry 
           eyes.

           End of clip

           We cut to the actors at their table, watching with pride.

                        El Incendio Calido (The Very Hot  
                        Blaze)

           El Incendio Calido clip- A priest is in a confessional booth. 
           A man sits and gives his confession.

                                 CONFESSIONAL MAN (IN SPANISH)
                        Forgive me father, for I have 
                        sinned.

                                 CONFESSIONAL PRIEST (IN SPANISH)
                        Go on. What have you done?

                                 CONFESSIONAL MAN (IN SPANISH)
                        I killed you.

           The confessional man clicks a gun and points it in the 
           Priest’s direction. But the priest is too quick. He PUNCHES 
           through the small confessional screen and knocks the man out. 
           Just then a woman’s voice is heard in the adjourning 
           confessional booth.

                                 CONFESSIONAL WOMAN (IN SPANISH)
                        Father, are you OK?

           The Priest walks out.

                                 CONFESSIONAL PRIEST (IN SPANISH)
                        I am now, my love.

           The priest kisses the woman passionately.

           End of clip

           We cut to the actors at their table, watching with pride.

                                 TELENOVELA STAR (IN SPANISH)
                        And finally, El Fuego Caliente.

           The crowd goes nuts.

           El Fuego Caliente clip- They replay the end of the live 
           episode- Isabella and Salma roll on the floor, tearing each 
           other’s shirts off. Javier comes out of nowhere and PUNCHES 
           SALMA IN THE FACE, knocking her unconscious.

           Javier helps Isabella up and puts his jacket on her almost 
           naked torso. It’s over.

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                        Thank you.
           Isabella smiles and hugs her father for the first time. 
           Javier turns around. Penelope joins them.

                                 PENELOPE (IN SPANISH)
                        I love you, Javier. I’ve always 
                        loved you.

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                        I know, my love. I’ve always known.

           They kiss passionately. THE KISS TO END ALL KISSES.

           End of clip

           We cut to El Fuego’s table. Everyone smiles with pride.

           We cut to Lumbre Coluroso’s table.

                                 SANGRIO (IN SPANISH)
                        They stole our line!

           Back to our gorgeous host-

                                 TELENOVELA STAR (IN SPANISH)
                        And the winner is...the highest 
                        rated Telenovela of all time, EL 
                        FUEGO CALIENTE!!!

           Avi jumps out of his seat and walks over to Lumbre Caluroso’s 
           table.

                                 AVI
                        Suck my dick. All of you. Suck it 
                        dry because EL FUEGO CALIENTE IS 
                        NUMBER ONE!

           The group makes their way to the stage.

           INT. JAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Salma watches the awards on a tiny television in JAIL. SHE IS 
           SO EXCITED.

                                 SALMA
                        Ahhhhhhhh!!! Did you see that? That 
                        was me that got punched in the 
                        face!!! I’m a star!

           Nobody is listening.
           INT. TVYNOVELAS AWARDS - CONTINUOUS

           Avi gets to the microphone first and speaks in Hebrew.

                                 AVI (IN HEBREW)
                        EAT MY ASS, DAD! I DID IT! I HAVE 
                        THE NUMBER ONE TELENOVELA IN THE 
                        WORLD! FUCK YOU FOR DOUBTING ME! I 
                        AM AN ISRAELI GOD!!!

           No one understands Hebrew. Some people clap out of politeness 
           but for the most part, the audience looks at the stage 
           confused. Isabella goes up to the mic.

                                 ISABELLA (IN SPANISH)
                        Thank you for the nice 
                        introduction, Avi. This is such a 
                        proud, proud day for all of us. So 
                        many people to thank. First off, of 
                        course, thank you to Avi Klauchman 
                        (said slowly in an American 
                        accent), for his hard work and 
                        wonderful spirit. And to Rose and 
                        David for guiding us through this 
                        crazy experience.

           A beat.

                                 ISABELLA (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        I...I just wish that Penelope could 
                        have been here to see this. She 
                        would have loved it so much.

           Isabella is close to tears.

                                 ISABELLA (IN SPANISH) (CONT’D)
                        But...wherever she is, I want her 
                        to know that her family is thinking 
                        of her.

           Javier gets to the microphone.

                                 JAVIER (IN SPANISH)
                        We love you, Penelope! This one’s 
                        for you!

           THE CROWD GETS ON THEIR FEET! A STANDING OVATION!

           INT. MOVIE TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           Penelope watches the awards show on a television in her 
           enormous trailer. She cries tears of joy. Her phone rings.
                                 PENELOPE (PHONE)
                        Hi baby! I saw! You looked so 
                        beautiful!

           BRAD PITT enters her trailer.

                                 BRAD PITT
                        Penelope, you ready?

                                 PENELOPE
                        Yup. Give me one sec, Brad.

           Brad leaves.

                                 PENELOPE (PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I have to go. Tell Javier I love 
                        him too. Thanks. Love you Isabella. 
                        Bye.

           Penelope hangs up the phone and enjoys the moment. She did 
           it. Her show is a hit and SHE’S STARRING IN A MAJOR AMERICAN 
           MOTION PICTURE WITH BRAD PITT!

           She looks at something on the wall of her trailer. A poster 
           from El Fuego Caliente- Javier, Penelope and Isabella staring 
           at each other passionately...Salma is in the far, far 
           background as a Princess.

           Penelope smiles, touches the poster and exits her trailer.

           We stay on the poster as we...

           FADE TO BLACK
