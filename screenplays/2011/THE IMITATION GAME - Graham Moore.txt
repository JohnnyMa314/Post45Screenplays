           INT. ALAN TURING’S HOUSE - DAY - 1951

           A HALF-DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS swarm the Manchester home of 
           mathematics professor Alan Turing.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        Good. I am going to speak very 
                        quickly, because I prefer to speak 
                        quickly. Things will happen now, 
                        and they will happen more rapidly 
                        than you might like. If you are not 
                        listening carefully, you will miss 
                        things. Important things. You’re 
                        writing some of this down? That’s 
                        good.

           INSIDE ALAN’S HOUSE: There's been a break-in, and the house 
           is a mess - someone has given it a pretty thorough once-over. 

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But I will not pause for you to 
                        catch up. I will not repeat myself, 
                        and you will not interrupt me. I do 
                        not like to be interrupted. If you 
                        ask me a question, I will ignore it 
                        and continue speaking as I please. 
                        If you think me impolite, very 
                        well. You think that because you’re 
                        sitting where you are, and I am 
                        sitting where I am, that you are in 
                        control of what is about to happen. 
                        You’re mistaken. I am in control, 
                        because I know things that you do 
                        not know. 

           PAPERS inked black with mathematical symbols litter the 
           floor. The test tubes and beakers of Turing's chemical work 
           are shattered in the study, CYANIDE and POTASSIUM NITRATE 
           DRIPPING ACROSS THE UGLY CARPET. 

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Everything that happens from this 
                        point forward will happen because I 
                        have decided that it should. Do you 
                        understand me? Nod if you 
                        understand me. Good. 
           It’s an odd place for a robbery. Turing is clearly not 
           wealthy. And nothing appears to be missing. The CONSTABLES 
           EXCHANGE LOOKS: They’re intrigued.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        What I will need from you now is a 
                        commitment. You will commit to 
                        listen to what I choose to tell 
                        you, until I am finished. You will 
                        listen closely, and you will not 
                        judge me. When I am finished — when 
                        I have told you that I am finished 
                        — you are free to think whatever 
                        you like. But now I need your word 
                        that you will listen, and you will 
                        listen carefully, and even though 
                        things will be confusing sometimes, 
                        and even though this story will be 
                        hard for you to understand, you 
                        will trust that everything I’m 
                        saying I am saying for a reason.

           A CONSTABLE PHONES IN the robbery to headquarters —

           — At headquarters, a RADIO GIRL transmits the information to 
           the detectives on duty —

           — And in London, a RADIO OPERATOR in a dark room far below 
           Victoria Street TAKES DOWN AN URGENT MESSAGE —

           — ON THE MESSAGE: Random letters. Gibberish. It’s ENCRYPTED.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And you can judge me when, and only 
                        when, I am finished. If you cannot 
                        commit to this, then please leave 
                        the room now. That’s right, you’re 
                        free to go. But if you choose to 
                        stay, if you choose to listen, 
                        remember this: If things happen 
                        that you do not like, you chose to 
                        be here. 

           The ENCRYPTED MESSAGE is handed to a CRYPTANALYST, who 
           DECODES it —

           — Before the MESSAGE is HANDED OFF and WHISKED through the 
           dim hallways —

           — Until it’s finally deposited on the desk of STEWART 
           MENZIES, the Director of MI-6. British Secret Intelligence 
           Services.
                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You chose to hear these things. I 
                        am telling this story, and you are 
                        choosing to listen to it. What 
                        happens from this moment forward is 
                        not my responsibility: It’s yours.

           Menzies picks up the message: “Alan Turing has been robbed.”

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This will go quite fast now.
                             (laughs)
                        And that is the last time I will 
                        repeat myself. Pay attention.

           EXT. ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - MORNING

           DETECTIVE ROBERT NOCK, 40s, athletic, more interested in 
           football than being a detective, hustles past a few double-
           parked police cars and up the steps and into:

           INT. ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Detective Nock enters to find the same messy crime scene we 
           just saw. He’s addressed by SARGEANT STAEHL.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Bit late, don’t you think?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        The baby. Up all night, hollering 
                        and crying. June says it’s collick.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Sounds wretched.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Price of starting a family. What’s 
                        all this, then?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Turing, Alan. Professor at King’s. 
                        Seems there’s been a robbery. 

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What of?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        That’s just it. Nothing’s missing, 
                        really.
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        No, what’s he a professor of?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                             (consulting notes)
                        Oh. Maths. Or, as he put it, 
                        “ordinal logic, with a dose of 
                        number theory.”

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What on earth does that mean?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I haven’t the foggiest.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What’s he doing in Manchester?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I can’t tell.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Sorry?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Seems he’s here on some sort of 
                        project. At the NPL. Won’t say what 
                        it is, though.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        He’s a bit squirrely then, our 
                        Professor Turing?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        That’s putting it mildly. The man 
                        seems to like talking a lot more 
                        than communicating, if you catch my 
                        drift.

           Sargeant Staehl motions to the next room, and he follows Nock 
           in...

           ... Where they find ALAN TURING, 38. He’s the smartest man in 
           the room, and he knows it. But he doesn’t really care if you 
           do.

           Turing is VERY CAREFULLY sweeping up a pile of WHITE POWDER.

           He’s doing it with a PAINTBRUSH.

           And he’s totally oblivious to the detectives as they enter.
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Professor Turing?
                             (beat)
                        Professor Turing? My name is 
                        Detective Nock. Manchester Police. 
                        Mr. Staehl here tells me you’ve had 
                        a robbery last night.
                             (still nothing)
                        Professor Turing?

           Detective Nock steps closer, peering over Turing’s shoulder 
           at the white powder.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK (CONT’D)
                        Professor —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — I would step back, if I were you.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Pardon me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Step back, and don’t breathe so 
                        much.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Breathe?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You’re breathing heavily and you’re 
                        going to inhale this junk and 
                        you’re going to leave your collicky 
                        daughter without a father.

           Detective Nock stops, and steps back. What in the world?

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Sound carries in this house and I’m 
                        very observant. Pity that you’re 
                        not.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What is that mess?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Cyanide. Undiluted. Wouldn’t take 
                        more than a thimbleful to kill you.

           Turing finishes sweeping the cyanide into a jar, before 
           safely CAPPING IT.
           Turing stands, and for the first time takes a look at 
           Detective Nock. Sizes him up.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Disappointing.

           Detective Knock and Sargeant Staehl exchange a look.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Pardon?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’d hoped for a bit more.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Sargeant Staehl, is it just me, or 
                        do you get the sense that we’re 
                        being insulted?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Awfully certain you’re right, 
                        actually.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (to Nock)
                        You lied to your friend here about 
                        your son, which is just unseemly. 
                        Collick didn’t keep you up all 
                        night. Drink did. You’ve bags under 
                        your eyes the size of strawberries. 
                        Your topcoat reeks of whiskey. 
                        You’re short of breath after 
                        walking 30 paces into my home. And 
                        I believe Man United had a match 
                        yesterday, yes? I could hear the 
                        shouting about it from Simpson’s on 
                        my way home.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                             (caught)
                        ... We won by four. Would’ve been 
                        unseemly not to celebrate.

           Sargeant Staehl SIGHS, embarrassed. 

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Professor. Someone broke into your 
                        home last night. He - or they - 
                        smashed the back window and left 
                        this place a wreck. Your neighbor, 
                        a Mr. Springborn, called to report 
                        the noise. 
                                 (MORE)

                        The Constable says that he spoke to 
                        you earlier this morning, and that 
                        you’ve reported that nothing is 
                        missing. A bit odd, isn’t it, to 
                        have a break-in where nothing is 
                        missing? Now. We’d like to find the 
                        bugger that did this. Would you 
                        mind helping us out?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Gentlemen, I don’t think you could 
                        figure out who broke into my house 
                        if he walked up to you right now 
                        and spit in your bloated face. What 
                        I could really use at the moment is 
                        not a bobby but a good cleaning 
                        lady. So unless one of you has an 
                        apron in your car that you’d like 
                        to put on and lend me a hand, I’d 
                        suggest that you file your reports 
                        and leave me alone.

           Staehl is about to say something — and probably something 
           aggressive, by the look of his face — but Nock stops him.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        ... As you say, Professor Turing. 
                        Best of luck with your cyanide. 

           EXT. ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Detective Nock and Sargeant Staehl walk away from Turing’s 
           house.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I’ll give you a bob if you can name 
                        me a more insufferable sod than 
                        Alan bloody Turing.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Curious, isn’t he?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Oh, you’ve a soft spot for the 
                        bastard ‘cause he called you on 
                        your drink? Which, while we’re on 
                        the subject —

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        — Seemed a bit forced though, 
                        didn’t it?
                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Don’t know what you mean.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        If you didn’t want a pair of 
                        bobbies digging around in your 
                        personal affairs, well, that would 
                        have been a stellar way to see that 
                        they don’t. Tell me you don’t think 
                        this is suspicious.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I don’t think this is suspicious.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Alright then.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I think it’s irritating, and I’d 
                        like to devote my working hours to 
                        pursuing criminals of slightly more 
                        stature than thieves who can’t 
                        manage to actually steal anything.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What about mysterious professors 
                        who won’t admit that something was 
                        stolen from their flats?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        What’re you suggesting?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I’m suggesting that Alan Turing is 
                        hiding something.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. TRAIN - DAY - 1939

           Alan Turing — 11 years younger — sits on train bound for 
           Bletchley Park. Riding with him are HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of 
           SCHOOLCHILDREN.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        Over 800,000 children are being 
                        evacuated from London today as the 
                        city braces for German aerial 
                        bombing. London has been declared 
                        officially “unsafe” for all but the 
                        most able-bodied.

                        Additionally, government reports 
                        suggest that Britain will soon run 
                        out its food supply unless a method 
                        can be devised for getting American 
                        aid to the isle, past the German 
                        fleet. The Prime Minister’s office 
                        denies this...

           Alan watches a SMALL BOY pour over a PUZZLE BOOK. OLDER KIDS, 
           loud and rowdy, TAUNT the Small Boy, who doesn’t look up, 
           he’s so focused on his puzzles.

           Alan watches. Maybe he smiles. Maybe he understands.

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - A FEW HOURS LATER

           A cab drops Alan off outside the imposing front gates of 
           Bletchley Park. An enormous Victorian mansion lies in the 
           center of the grounds, surrounded by empty gardens, and tall 
           iron fences. 

           If the fences won’t keep out intruders, the NAVAL OFFICERS 
           with MACHINE GUNS at the gates certainly will.

           Alan enters the gates cautiously.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - COMMANDER DENNISTON’S OFFICE - LATER

           A few minutes later, Alan sits alone in a cluttered office. 
           He stares ahead blankly at the empty chair behind the desk. 
           Waits.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON (O.S.)
                        The bloody hell are you?

           Alan turns with a start.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The girl told me to wait —

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        In my office? She tell you to help 
                        yourself to a cup of tea while you 
                        were here?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No. She didn’t.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        She didn’t tell you what a joke is 
                        then either, I gather.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Was she supposed to?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        For Christ’s sake — who are you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        My name is Alan Turing.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                             (looking at papers on his 
                              desk)
                        Turing... Let me see... Oh, Turing. 
                        The mathematician.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        How ever could I have guessed?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You didn’t. It was written on your 
                        paper.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        ... You’re a professor. King’s 
                        College, Cambridge. Says here you 
                        were a bit of a prodigy in the 
                        maths department.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m not sure I can evaluate that, 
                        Mr... ?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        How old are you, Mr. Turing?

                                 ALAN TURING

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        How old were you when you became a 
                        fellow at Cambridge?

                                 ALAN TURING
                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        And how old were you when you 
                        published this paper here, that has 
                        a title I can barely understand, 
                        which apparently got you this 
                        fellowship?

                                 ALAN TURING

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        And you don’t think that qualifies 
                        you as a certified prodigy?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Rather depends on how old my peers 
                        were when they did comparable work, 
                        doesn’t it?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        And how old were they?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Newton discovered the binomial 
                        theorem at 22. Einstein published 
                        four papers that changed the world 
                        at 26. As far as I can tell I’ve 
                        barely made par.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        You’re serious, aren’t you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Would you prefer I make a joke?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Not sure you know what those are.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It hardly seems fair that that 
                        would be a requirement for 
                        employment here, Mr...?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Commander Denniston, of the Royal 
                        Navy. All right, Mr. Turing, I’ll 
                        bite. Why do you want to work for 
                        Her Majesty’s government?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh, I don’t, really. 
                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        You’re not a supporter of the war 
                        effort?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Sure.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                             (suspicious)
                        Are you a bleeding pacifist, 
                        Turing?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m agnostic about violence.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        But you realize that 600 miles from 
                        London there’s this nasty chap 
                        named Hitler who’s looking to 
                        engulf Europe in tyranny?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Politics is not my area of 
                        expertise. 

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        I believe you’ve just set a record 
                        for the shortest job interview in 
                        British military history.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Mum says that I can be off-putting 
                        sometimes. On account of being the 
                        best mathematician in the world.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        You’re the best mathematician in 
                        the world?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh. Yes. That’s not on my CV?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        No, it’s — Damn it, SIS always 
                        likes bringing me the difficult 
                        ones. Do you know how many people 
                        I’ve rejected for this program?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.
                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        That’s right. Because we’re a top 
                        secret program. But I’ll tell you, 
                        just because we’re friends, that 
                        last week I rejected one of our 
                        great nation’s top linguists, knows 
                        German better than Bertolt Brecht.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t speak German.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        What?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t. Speak German.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        How the bloody hell are you 
                        supposed to decrypt German 
                        communications if you don’t, oh, I 
                        don’t know, speak German?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m quite excellent at crossword 
                        puzzles.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                             (calling off)
                        MARGARET!

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The German codes are a puzzle. A 
                        game. Just like any other game.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        MARGARET! Where are you?!

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m very good at games. Puzzles. 
                        And I think this is the hardest 
                        puzzle in the world.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        MARGARET!?!
                             (beat)
                        For the love of... This is a joke, 
                        obviously.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m afraid I can’t make jokes, 
                        Commander Denniston.
           And for a split second, Denniston actually smiles.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Have a pleasant trip back to 
                        Cambridge, Professor.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Enigma.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Excuse me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That’s what you’re doing here. The 
                        top secret program at Bletchley. 
                        You’re trying to break the German 
                        Enigma machine.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        What makes you think that?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s the greatest encryption device 
                        in history, and the Germans use it 
                        for all major communications. If 
                        the Allies broke Enigma — well, 
                        this would turn into a very short 
                        war indeed. If I were running a top 
                        secret code-breaking program, 
                        Enigma wouldn’t be my top priority. 
                        It would be my only priority. Of 
                        course you’re working on it. But 
                        you also haven’t gotten anywhere 
                        with it. If you had, you wouldn’t 
                        be hiring new cryptographers out of 
                        university, and I wouldn’t be 
                        sitting here bickering with you. 
                        Simply put, you need me a lot more 
                        than I need you. You asked if I was 
                        a supporter of the war, and I said 
                        no, which is true. I don’t care 
                        about Britain, or the Germans, or 
                        the French, or any of your 
                        political squabbles. I’d just as 
                        easily go work for the Germans, 
                        frankly, but they simply don’t have 
                        anything this good to work on, 
                        because our mathematicians aren’t 
                        as impressive as theirs. With one 
                        significant exception. I like 
                        solving problems, Commander. And 
                        Enigma is the most difficult 
                        problem in the world. 
                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Enigma isn’t difficult. It’s 
                        impossible.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh well that’s even better.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        The Germans think the Enigma 
                        machine is unbreakable. The 
                        Americans think the Enigma machine 
                        is unbreakable. So do the French, 
                        the Russians, the Chinese. But our 
                        dear Mr. Churchill had a piss-poor 
                        secondary school education and 
                        never learned the word “retreat.” 
                        But it can’t be done.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Let me try and we’ll know for sure.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Do you have any idea how this 
                        works, Professor? If you join us, 
                        you give up everything. No more 
                        classes, no more students, no more 
                        faculty meetings and late lunches 
                        with the Dean. Your work will be 
                        top secret. Your entire bloody life 
                        will be classified. You’ll have to 
                        lie to your parents, to your 
                        family, to your friends, to 
                        everyone you ever meet about what 
                        you do. There are fewer than a 
                        dozen men in Britain who know about 
                        this program, and if you become one 
                        of them, you’ll sacrifice your 
                        life, your identity, for nothing.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Not for nothing. For something 
                        impossible.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        I’m not going to hire you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m not leaving this room until you 
                        do.

           The men stare at each other. Neither blinks.
           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - DAY - LATER

           ANGLE ON: A machine. It looks like a typewriter that got left 
           on the set of Blade Runner. Wires running all over it. Extra 
           gears sticking out of the sides. Blinking lights that reveal 
           German characters. Half electrical, half mechanical.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON (O.S.)
                        Welcome to Enigma.

           REVEAL: COMMANDER DENNISTON, 50s, is showing the ENIGMA 
           MACHINE to the NEW RECRUITS.

           They are:

           HUGH ALEXANDER, 30s, Irish, loves women and chess in equal 
           measure.

           JOHN CAIRNCROSS, 30s, Scottish, not the prodigy his 
           compatriots are and knows it.

           PETER HILTON, 20s, a precocious undergrad from Oxford.

           KEITH FURMAN and CHARLES RICHARDS, 40s, both stodgy 
           linguists.

           Stewart Menzies — head of MI-6, who we briefly glimpsed in 
           the opening — stands in the corner, silent and observing. 
           Charming and inscrutable, he didn’t become the head of 
           British Secret Intelligence Services by accident.

           FINALLY REVEAL: ... Alan stands with them, staring at the 
           machine like it’s the Sistine Chapel.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        It’s the crooked hand of death 
                        itself.

           Alan reaches out and touches it lovingly.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON (CONT’D)
                        The German navy encodes every 
                        message they send with the Enigma 
                        machine. The details of every 
                        surprise attack, of every secret 
                        convoy, of every U-Boat in the 
                        bloody Atlantic go into that thing, 
                        and out comes... Gibberish.
           Denniston shows Alan sheets of Enigma messages: PAGE AFTER 
           PAGE OF RANDOM LETTERS.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON (CONT’D)
                        Our WRENs intercept thousands of 
                        radio messages a day. But to the 
                        lovely young ladies of the Women’s 
                        Royal Navy, they’re nonsense. It’s 
                        only when you feed them back into 
                        Enigma that they make sense.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        But you have an Enigma machine. 
                        It’s right there.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Yes. Polish intelligence smuggled 
                        one out of Berlin. 

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        So what’s the problem? Just put the 
                        intercepted messages back in to 
                        Enigma and —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — It’s not that simple, is it? Just 
                        having an Enigma machine doesn’t 
                        help you decode the messages.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Very good, Mr. Turing. To decode a 
                        message, you need to know the 
                        machine’s settings. The Germans 
                        switch settings every day, promptly 
                        at midnight. 

           Alan looks at the machine carefully.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Five rotors. Six plugboard cables.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That’s...

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Five —

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        — thousand million —
                                 PETER HILTON
                        — No no it’s — I’ve got it —

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        — Million, million —

                                 KEITH FURMAN
                        — In the millions, obviously —

                                 CHARLES RICHARDS
                        — Obviously —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — Over one hundred thousand million 
                        million possible settings.

           All eyes turn to Turing: Wow.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        ... Very good. 

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        One hundred fifty nine, if you’d 
                        rather be exact about it.

           Everyone looks at Hugh now.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
                        One five nine with eighteen zeroes 
                        behind it. Possibilities. Every 
                        single day.

           Jesus Christ. Who is this guy?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander. 

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Didn’t you...?

                                 PETER HILTON
                        You mean the...?

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (doesn’t recognize the 
                              name)
                        Who are you?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Mr. Alexander won Britain’s 
                        national chess championship.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Congratulations.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Twice. 

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                             (to Alan)
                        Seems you’re not the only one who’s 
                        good at games around here.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        And you are?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Alan Turing. I’m a fellow at 
                        King’s. 

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Oh. You must know Professor Hardy! 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We’ve met. He runs my program. 

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        He’s a dear friend. How is he these 
                        days?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        He and I don’t... Get on well, 
                        exactly.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Pity. He’s the most accomplished 
                        mathematician at Cambridge.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No he’s not.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Who is?

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (to Denniston)
                        Are we all to work together then? I 
                        prefer to have my own office.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        You’re a team, and you’ll work as 
                        one.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t have time to explain myself 
                        as I go along, and I’m afraid these 
                        men will only slow me down.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (piping up from the 
                              corner)
                        — If you can’t play together, then 
                        I’m afraid we can’t let you play at 
                        all.

           They all stare at him.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Gentlemen, meet Stuart Menzies. MI-

           The team ACKNOWLEDGES Menzies.

                                 CHARLES RICHARDS
                        There are only five divisions of 
                        military intelligence. There is no 
                        “MI-6.”

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Exactly. That’s the spirit.
                             (to Alan)
                        Mr. Turing. Do you know how many 
                        British servicemen have died 
                        because of Enigma?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Three.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        That doesn’t sound like very many.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        ... While we’ve been having this 
                        conversation.
                             (checks his watch)
                        Oh look. That’s four. Rather hope 
                        he didn’t have a family.
                             (to Denniston)
                        Perhaps we should leave the 
                        children alone with their new toy?

           Menzies and Commander Denniston LEAVE.
           The team stands there. With Enigma.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (to Hugh Alexander)
                        Twice?

           Hugh SHRUGS nonchalantly.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Well then. Let’s play.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY - 1927

           The stately manor of a British boys boarding school.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        The problem began, of course, with 
                        the carrots.

           INT. SHERBORNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY

           YOUNG ALAN TURING, 15, sits alone in the dining hall. Other 
           BOYS joke and laugh and tell animated stories at nearby 
           tables, but Alan sits alone, staring intently at his food.

           ON ALAN’S PLATE: Boiled steak. Potatoes. Peas. And carrots.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        The carrots were mushy, which is 
                        good, but they got all mixed up 
                        with the peas. Carrots are orange. 
                        Peas are green. I don’t like it 
                        when foods of different colors 
                        touch, that’s all.

           Alan carefully tries to separate the carrots from the peas. 
           It’s like he’s performing brain surgery.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I was only trying to fix it. I 
                        wasn’t paying attention.

           BEHIND ALAN, a group of BIGGER BOYS approach quietly. One of 
           them holds a TRAY OF BOILED VEGETABLES —
                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t being observant. Please, 
                        if you listen to only one thing I 
                        say, I cannot stress this enough: 
                        Observation is very important. 

           — The Boys try to MUFFLE THEIR GIGGLES so Alan can’t hear 
           them approach —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was a lesson I very much needed 
                        to learn.

           — The Boys DUMP THE TRAY OF VEGETABLES ALL OVER ALAN.

           Alan SCREAMS.

           The Boys LAUGH as Alan SCREAMS and SHAKES and tries to get 
           the peas and carrots and everything else off of him. He’s in 
           hell.

           Alan FALLS DOWN. Still shaking, still screaming.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Carrots are orange! Carrots are 
                        orange! Carrots are orange!

                                 BOY #1
                        What a bloody queer!

                                 BOY #2
                        Poofter!

           Alan CURLS UP INTO A BALL as he shivers.

                                 BOY #1
                        Looks like a football, doesn’t he?

           The Boy playfully KICKS LIGHTLY at Alan’s ribgage, just as a 
           joke.

           Within a few seconds, they’re all KICKING...

           ... Kicking, kicking, kicking, as Alan wails about peas and 
           carrots and the boys laugh and have no idea what he’s talking 
           about...

           INT. COFFIN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           ... Alan is inside a coffin.
           He’s KICKING AT THE WOODEN BOARDS ABOVE and SCREAMING TO BE 
           RELEASED.

           It’s not helping.

           From above, we hear the familiar LAUGHTER OF THE SCHOOLBOYS.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        Nowadays I enjoy observing people. 
                        I’m highly skilled at it, but I 
                        wasn’t always so. It took time. And 
                        lots of practice.

           REVEAL: The “coffin” is make-shift; the Boys have constructed 
           it out of the broken floorboards of a half-finished class 
           room. Alan is buried underground, and they’re nailing him in.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why people like 
                        violence? Because it feels good. 

           The THUMP THUMP of nails entering the boards.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Humans find violence deeply 
                        satisfying. But remove the 
                        satisfaction, and the act 
                        becomes... Hollow.

           FROM INSIDE THE COFFIN: Alan goes silent.

           The Boys pound away, but the silence unnerves them.

                                 BOY #1
                        Alan? Alan?

                                 BOY #2
                        C’mon don’t be such a kike about 
                        it...

                                 BOY #3
                        Leave him to bloody rot.

           The Boys LEAVE.

           There’s still only SILENCE from inside Alan’s coffin.

           Alan breathes slowly. Quietly. Controls his shivering to 
           barely a tremor. He waits.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        I didn’t learn this on my own 
                        though. I had help.
           Suddenly, the boards above him CREAK. Then BEND. Then SNAP.

           Then an ARM REACHES DOWN and PULLS Alan out of the coffin.

           REVEAL: CHRISTOPHER MORCOM, 16, tall, pretty, and charming in 
           ways that Alan will never, ever be.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Jesus Christ, Alan. They might have 
                        killed you.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        It’s not my fault. The carrots got 
                        in with the peas. 
                             (off Christopher’s look)
                        I’m sorry. I won’t let them do it 
                        again.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        And how’re you planning on stopping 
                        them, exactly?

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                             (thinking)
                        I’m smarter than they are.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Yes.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        That’s why they beat me up.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        No, Alan. They don’t beat you up 
                        because you’re smarter. They beat 
                        you up because you’re different.

           Alan is confused.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        So what do I do?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Don’t be different.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        But I am... I mean... I think 
                        sometimes... Mum says I’m just an 
                        odd duck.
                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Well then we’ll have to make sure 
                        that no one ever knows how odd you 
                        really are, won’t we?

           Christopher holds Alan’s hand, and together they leave the 
           deserted school room.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        Christopher helped.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GOVERNMENT RECORDS OFFICE - DAY - 1951

           Detective Nock and Sargeant Staehl exit the imposing 
           government records office.

           They walk quickly.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Bloody classified. What sort of 
                        maths professor has his military 
                        records classified?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Can we go home now?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Alan Turing is a suspect in a 
                        robbery and they won’t share a 
                        thing with the police? 

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        “Suspect” is a rather stark way to 
                        put it. I recall writing his name 
                        next to the word “victim” on the 
                        intake forms myself.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Will?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Yes?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I’m about to do something that 
                        you’re not going to like. And I 
                        want you to know, from the bottom 
                        of my heart, that I’m genuinely 
                        sorry about it. But it can’t be 
                        helped.
                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        What are you —

           — Suddenly, Detective Nock PUNCHES Staehl across the jaw.

           Staehl DOUBLES OVER in shock.

                                 SGT. STAEHL (CONT’D)
                        Bob!? The bloody hell?!? Are you 
                        drunk again —

           — And Nock PUNCHES HIM again. Hard.

           People on the street TURN and STARE.

           Staehl angrily DIVES towards Nock but Nock DODGES and PUSHES 
           Staehl to the ground.

           Nock reaches down and WHISKS AWAY Staehl’s wallet —

           — Before RUNNING back down the street.

           Staehl starts SCREAMING AFTER HIM —

           — And GIVES CHASE —

           — They each DODGE PEDESTRIANS, who are all staring —

           — Until Nock TRIPS and SLAMS INTO A PEDESTRIAN —

           — They both TUMBLE TO THE GROUND.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Stop him! He has my wallet!

           The Pedestrian and Nock SCRAMBLE on the ground.

                                 PEDESTRIAN
                        Police! Police!

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        No need. The police are already 
                        here.

           Nock quickly shows the Pedestrian his BADGE.

           The Pedestrian looks confused.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK (CONT’D)
                        I would move along if I were you. 

           The Pedestrian gets up, and slowly LEAVES.
           Nock stands dusting himself off as Staehl catches up to him —

           — And PUNCHES NOCK IN THE JAW.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK (CONT’D)
                        Oww! Would you stop it?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        You punched me and stole my wallet.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Here, have it back.

           Nock hands a WALLET back to Staehl, who looks down at it.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        ... This isn’t my wallet.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        You don’t say. Whose is it? 

           Very confused, Staehl LOOKS THROUGH the wallet.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Benjamin Marc... Lives in London... 
                        That man you knocked over! You 
                        stole his wallet. He’s — Bob?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Yes?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        He’s MI-6. Secret Intelligence 
                        Services.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        That’s what I was worried about. 

                                 FEMALE PEDESTRIAN
                             (approaching them)
                        — Are you two all right? 

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                             (to Pedestrian)
                        Bugger off.

           She LEAVES, offended.

                                 SGT. STAEHL (CONT’D)
                             (back to Nock)
                        He was following us?
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Yes. Since we left the station.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Why are we being followed by MI-6?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I think I might have an idea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ADMIRALTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY - LATER

           Detective Nock walks up to a SECRETARY.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                             (to Secretary)
                        Pardon me. I’d like to see some 
                        documents, if I may. Naval service 
                        records of a Mr. Turing. Alan.

           He FLASHES THE ID CARD HE JUST STOLE: It reads “Benjamin 
           Marc,” and has the MI-6 logo at the bottom.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK (CONT’D)
                        I’m with the Intelligence Services.

           Off of Nock’s SMILE we 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - DAY - 1940

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        The game was obviously a very 
                        simple one.

           On a small side street in Bletchley, we see a shop front: 
           “FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES” reads the sign above the glass.

           It looks like it’s been abandoned for years.

           People pass by, never giving it a second look.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        One hundred and fifty nine million 
                        million possible settings, every 24 
                        hours. All we had to do was try 
                        them all until we found the right 
                        one. Every single day. 
           But INSIDE THE FRUIT SHOP:

           It’s far from abandoned. Turing and the team have set up here 
           as their covert base for cryptographic analysis.

           PAPERS COVERED IN LONG STRINGS OF LETTERS cover literally 
           every surface in the shop.

           John Cairncross, Hugh Alexander, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman 
           and Charles Richards pore over the sheets. They men ARGUE, 
           JOKE, DISAGREE, PASS EACH OTHER PAPERS, SHOW EACH OTHER 
           IDEAS...

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        However, this presented certain 
                        practical problems. Namely, if we 
                        had 10 men checking one setting a 
                        minute, for 24 hours every day and 
                        seven days every week, it would 
                        take... Well, you tell me. How many 
                        days would it take to check all of 
                        the settings? ... Would you like a 
                        hint? It’s not days. It’s years. So 
                        we simply needed a way to check 
                        settings faster.

           ... But Alan is in the corner. He doesn’t talk with his 
           coworkers. He works quietly, and alone.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                             (sighs)
                        Oh dear, you still haven’t worked 
                        it out, have you? 
                             (beat)
                        It’s 20 million years. Pity you 
                        didn’t pay more attention in 
                        school.

           ON ALAN’S WORK: It’s mechanical. He’s playing with gears, 
           wires, cables, while the others are looking into letters and 
           words.

           John Cairncross approaches Alan’s desk.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                             (to Alan)
                        The boys... We were going to get 
                        some lunch?
                             (Alan ignores him)
                        Alan?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I said we were going to get some 
                        lunch?
                             (Alan keeps ignoring him)
                        Alan?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Can you hear me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I said we’re off to get some lunch.
                             (silence)
                        This is starting to get a bit 
                        repetitive.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What is?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I had asked if you wanted to have 
                        lunch with us.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No you didn’t. You told me you were 
                        getting lunch.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Have I offended you in some way?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why would you think that?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Would you like to come to lunch 
                        with us?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        When is lunchtime?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (calling out)
                        Jesus Christ, Alan, it’s a bleeding 
                        sandwich. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What is?
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Lunch.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t like sandwiches.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Nevermind.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        John was trying to be nice.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Let it go.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        You know to pull off this 
                        irrascible genius routine, you 
                        actually have to be a genius.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Who’s hungry? Let’s go.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Bye, Alan.

           The guys gather their things and walk out...

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m hungry.

           ... They turn.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        What?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Peter asked if anyone was hungry. I 
                        am.
                             (they stare at him)
                        May I have some soup, please?

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - STEWART MENZIES’ OFFICE - DAY

           Unlike Commander Denniston’s office, which was filled with 
           files and war mementos, MI-6 Director Stewart Menzies’ office 
           is completely barren.

           Menzies is on the phone when Alan enters.
                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (into phone)
                        Very well... Excuse me, I have a 
                        visitor... Yes, you know how I like 
                        receiving visitors... Toodles.

           He hangs up.

                                 STEWART MENZIES (CONT’D)
                        Alan Turing.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You should have seen me sooner, 
                        I’ve been requesting this meeting 
                        for weeks. I need something.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        You’re fired.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No, that’s not what I needed.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        According to Commander Denniston. 
                        He says there have been complaints.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        So what? I need parts and equipment 
                        for my machine, so you need to 
                        approve the requisition.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Your fellow codebreakers are 
                        refusing to work with you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh. Well then sack them and use 
                        their salaries to pay for my 
                        machine parts.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Shockingly, Denniston was thinking 
                        it might be easier to fire one 
                        mathematician rather than six.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        My machine is based on the Polish 
                        “bombes”, but more expansive.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Why are you building a machine?
                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s highly technical. You wouldn’t 
                        understand.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Try me.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Enigma is a machine. A very 
                        well-designed machine. Maybe our 
                        problem is that we’re trying to 
                        beat it with men. What if only a 
                        machine can understand another 
                        machine?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        That’s not so complicated.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I did a truly excellent job of 
                        explaining it.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Perhaps you should go back to 
                        Cambridge then, where you can 
                        explain things to your heart’s 
                        content.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I demand to speak to your 
                        commanding officer. I’ll have you 
                        sacked as well.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Very well.

           Silence.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Where can I find him?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (extends his hand)
                        Stewart Menzies. Pleasure to meet 
                        you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Damn.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Sadly, Mr. Turing, you cannot get 
                        to me, and I have absolutely no 
                        authority to help you in any way. 
                                 (MORE)

                        I don’t work for the Navy.
                             (starts writing something 
                              on a slip of paper)
                        But Denniston does. And his 
                        commanding officer, well, perhaps 
                        there’s a man who can help you keep 
                        your job and fund your gadget. You 
                        shouldn’t have too much trouble 
                        finding his address.

           Menzies hands Alan the PAPER.

                                 STEWART MENZIES (CONT’D)
                        Always nice to have a chap around 
                        who isn’t spooked by chain of 
                        command.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (suspicious)
                        What’s MI-6’s role at Bletchley?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Your job is to break Enigma.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Well, my job is to make sure Enigma 
                        doesn’t break you.

           Alan turns and LEAVES.

           Outside the door, Alan UNFOLDS THE PAPER IN HIS HAND.

           On it is printed a name: “WINSTON CHURCHILL.”

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - NIGHT

           Alan works alone in the corner, while Hugh, John, Peter, 
           Keith, and Charles work together across the room.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON (O.S.)
                        TURING!

           Everyone turns: Commander Denniston is standing in the 
           doorway. And he is pissed.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        You won.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Excuse me?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Boys, meet the new head of 
                        cryptography at Bletchley Park.

           He hands them a PAPER with the Prime Minister’s new orders.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Wait wait, no, you’re telling me 
                        Churchill put Alan in charge —

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        — This is a terrible plan —

                                 PETER HILTON
                        — No no no no no no —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — Really? I can give these men 
                        orders now?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Fantastic.
                             (to Keith and Charles)
                        Keith and Charles. You’re both 
                        fired.

                                 KEITH FURMAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 CHARLES RICHARDS
                        What?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You’re mediocre linguists and 
                        positively poor codebreakers.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Alan, you can’t just fire Keith and 
                        Charles.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Relatively certain I can.

                                 CHARLES RICHARDS
                        Go to hell.

           Charles and Keith leave, pissed.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        This is inhuman. Even for you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Remind me of that when I break 
                        Enigma.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Sure, if any of us still work here.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Are you gonna quit, Hugh?
                             (pause; Hugh stays put)
                        I didn’t think so.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Those were human beings. Not just 
                        puzzle pieces in your little game. 
                        They were your friends. Your fellow 
                        soldiers. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t care.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        You want to do this alone? You want 
                        to take on the Third Reich all by 
                        yourself? You’re smart, Turing, but 
                        no one is that smart. You’re a 
                        sodding poof in an ivory tower of 
                        numbers and you’re going to get 
                        good men killed.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Fuck you.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        My rank is unchanged, you know. And 
                        I still run operations here. All 
                        the support staff, the radio 
                        stations, the WRENs, they’re still 
                        mine. You lot are on your own, and 
                        you’ll do as Alan tells you. But 
                        when you need daily intercepts, 
                        when you need translators, when you 
                        need more bloody pencils, you’ll 
                        have to get them from me. And I 
                        will make your life a living hell. 
                        So that’s “Fuck you, Sir.”

           They stare at each other. Nobody blinks.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Fuck you. Sir.

           The tension is brutal.

           Slowly, Denniston leaves.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Popular at school, were you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        So what do we do now?

                                 PETER HILTON
                        We’re short on staff.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We get more staff.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        How?

           Alan holds up a piece of paper: It’s a CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BEGIN BRIEF SEQUENCE:

           INT. FAMILY HOME - MORNING - 1940

           A MAN opens up that morning’s Daily Telegraph, and flipping 
           through the paper, he sees an advertisement.

           ON THE AD: It’s Alan’s crossword puzzle. Below it, the ad 
           copy says — “If you can solve this puzzle in under ten 
           minutes please call 646-2264 for an exciting career 
           opportunity.”

           INT. OTHER LOCATIONS - SAME TIME

           SERIES OF SHOTS: Other people — MEN, WOMEN, STUDENTS, 
           RETIREES — open up their papers and see Alan’s ad. They all 
           try solving the puzzle.

           It’s really, really hard.

           END BRIEF SEQUENCE.
           EXT. MI-6 HEADQUARTERS - LONDON - DAY - 1940

           Establishing shot of MI-6 headquarters.

           INT. MI-6 HEADQUARTERS - LONDON - SAME TIME

           Alan and Stewart Menzies talk in the hallway, outside a 
           closed door.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Who are they?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        All sorts, really. A school 
                        teacher. An engineer. A handful of 
                        students.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        So no one in there is Britain’s 
                        national chess champion, then?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No. They’re just... Normal people. 
                        Smart people. Creative people.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Because they’re good at crossword 
                        puzzles?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Well, they say they’re good. Now I 
                        think we should probably find out.

           Alan leads Menzies into:

           INT. CLASS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alan and Stewart Menzies are in an MI-6 conference room. It’s 
           been set up like a class room: Rows of identical desks, at 
           which sit a COLLECTION OF CROSSWORD ENTHUSIASTS. There are 
           around 20, all men.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Good afternoon. You’re all here 
                        because you’ve said you could solve 
                        the crossword in the Daily 
                        Telegraph in under ten minutes. I’d 
                        like to make certain that that’s 
                        the case.
           Just then, a WOMAN enters. Everyone turns to look... 

           Her name is JOAN CLARKE, 20s, a graduate student at Oxford 
           who’s trying to get as far away from her preacher father as 
           possible, and she’s about to become very important to this 
           story.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        Pardon, Ma’am, this room is 
                        restricted.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Apologies for my tardiness — bus 
                        caught a flat.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (irritated)
                        May I continue, please?

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                             (to Joan)
                        You’re not allowed in here, Ma’am.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I’m only a few minutes late. With 
                        the bombing there’s ten potholes to 
                        each block.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        No, ma’am, the secretaries are to 
                        head upstairs. This room is for the 
                        Bletchley candidates.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        May I please get on with this?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I am a candidate.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        For what position?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        The letter did not say, precisely.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        Yes, so, secretaries are to head 
                        upstairs.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        It said it was top secret.
                                 ALAN TURING
                             (comes over to them)
                        What is going on here? 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        There was a crossword in the paper. 
                        I solved it. I got a letter saying 
                        I was a candidate for some 
                        mysterious job. So here I am. My 
                        name is Joan Clarke.

           She hands the Agent the LETTER.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        Miss, did you really solve this 
                        puzzle yourself? 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        What makes you think I couldn’t 
                        have solved the puzzle myself? I am 
                        quite —

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        — Ma’am I’ll have to ask you —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — Miss Clarke. I find tardiness 
                        unacceptable under any 
                        circumstances. Now take a seat, so 
                        we may continue.

           Joan stares at Alan: Thank you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Apologies again for being late.

           As Joan SITS, the Agent stops Alan as he tries to TALK TO THE 
           GROUP.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                             (whispering)
                        — Sir, not to be rude, but she’s...

                                 ALAN TURING
                        She was only late but a minute.

                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        No no, I mean, she’s...

                                 ALAN TURING
                        A pain in the ass, I’m aware.
                                 MI-6 AGENT
                        Sir, she’s... You know... Don’t you 
                        think she’s... A bit feminine for 
                        this position?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Agent, if you’ve something to say, 
                        please do so.

           The Agent turns to Menzies — who’s been silent thus far — for 
           support. Menzies SHRUGS. 

           The Agent backs down.

           Alan passes out NEW CROSSWORD PUZZLES.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                             (to the group)
                        Now, finally, as I was saying, you 
                        are all here —

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        — Pardon, but before we start, can 
                        you tell me a bit about this 
                        position I’m qualifying for?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh for God’s sake — No.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Don’t you think that’s a bit 
                        unfair?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        It’s just that I’ve a pretty decent 
                        job at the University, and I’d 
                        rather not give it up for something 
                        less interesting.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Miss Clarke. You now have the 
                        distinct honor of having wasted 
                        more of my time than any other 
                        person in this room. Shut up. 
                        Follow my instructions. And soon 
                        enough I will be rid of you 
                        forever.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Must be some position to get you 
                        all worked up.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Gentlemen. And lady. You have six 
                        minutes. Begin.

           SHOTS: EVERYONE FRANTICALLY TRIES TO FINISH THE NEW PUZZLE.

           As they work:

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (whispering to Alan)
                        Six minutes? Is that even possible?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No. It takes me eight. But this 
                        test isn’t about solving crosswords 
                        — it’s about handling the stress of 
                        trying to do something you know is 
                        impossible. Do you quit? Do you 
                        panic? Do you —

           — Suddenly, Joan sits up. She’s finished. Early.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        You’ve finished?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (checking watch)
                        ... 5 minutes, 34 seconds.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You said to do it in under 6.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (to Alan)
                        Seems like some people deal with 
                        the stress by simply doing the 
                        impossible.

           An EGG TIMER GOES OFF. Time’s up.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Pencils down, please.

           One CROSSWORD ENTHUSIAST keeps writing...
           ... Alan comes over to him, looks down at his unfinished 
           puzzle.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        You’re free to go.

           The Enthusiast leaves, dejected.

           Alan walks down the rows of desks, looking at everyone’s 
           puzzles, DISMISSING THOSE WHO COULDN’T FINISH.

           THREE PEOPLE are left when he’s done. Joan is one of them.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen — and lady — 
                        congratulations. You all now have

                        you speak a word of anything I’m 
                        about to show you, you’ll be hanged 
                        for treason. False jobs — pay

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        And what is it that we’re really 
                        doing?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We’re going to break an unbreakable 
                        Nazi code and win the war.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        ... Well that does sound more 
                        interesting than my university job.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHERBOURNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY - 1927

           Young Alan and Christopher sit under a tree, the school in 
           the distance.

           Alan is going through a crossword puzzle, Christopher is 
           reading a book. Their legs are touching affectionately 
           without either even knowing, like two people who are 
           effortlessly comfortable with one another.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        What’s that you’re reading?

           Christopher shows him: “A Guide to Codes and Cyphers.”
                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        It’s about cryptography.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        What’s cryptography?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        It’s complicated. You wouldn’t 
                        understand.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        I’m only fourteen months younger 
                        than you. Don’t treat me like a 
                        kid.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Cryptography is the science of 
                        codes.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Like secret messages?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Not secret. That’s the brilliant 
                        part. Messages that anyone can see, 
                        but no one knows what they mean, 
                        unless you have the key.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                             (confused)
                        How is that different from talking?

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        What?

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        When people talk to each other they 
                        never say what they mean. They say 
                        something else. And you’re supposed 
                        to just know what they mean. Only, 
                        I never do. So how is that 
                        different?

                        Alan, I have a funny feeling that 
                        you’re going to be very good at 
                        this.

           INT. MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - DAY - 1951

           Detective Nock sits with his boss, SUPERINTENDANT SMITH.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        Two questions, really.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Shoot.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        What is this?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Alan Turing’s classified military 
                        file.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        And how did you get it?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Let’s focus on the first question 
                        for now.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        Very well.
                             (displays the file)
                        It’s bloody empty.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Exactly.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        It’s an empty manila envelope.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Yes.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        Well you’ve cracked the case wide 
                        open then, haven’t you?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Alan Turing’s war records aren’t 
                        just classified. They’re non-
                        existent.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        So?
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        That means someone got rid of them. 
                        Erased them, burned them, what have 
                        you.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        And that person broke into his 
                        house and stole... Nothing?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What if Turing wasn’t just a math 
                        professor?

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        You think maybe he also teaches 
                        English lit?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        The Soviet spies?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Burgess and Maclean were 
                        professors, like Turing. They 
                        became radicalized at Cambridge, 
                        joined the Communist Party, and 
                        during the war took positions in 
                        the Foreign Office so they could 
                        leak information to Stalin.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        This was in the papers, wasn’t it? 
                        They vanished a few months ago, 
                        just as MI-5 was about to press 
                        charges.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I spoke with MI-5. They think that 
                        Burgess and Maclean weren’t the 
                        only professor/spies during the 
                        war.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        Turing was a professor, but he 
                        wasn’t in the Foreign Office.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Right. So where was he?
                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        You think Alan Turing might be a 
                        Soviet agent?

           ON NOCK’s FACE: It would explain a lot, wouldn’t it?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - DAY - 1941

           CLOSE ON: A half-built machine. Flashing lights for letters 
           all over it. It’s bigger than Enigma, almost the size of a 
           dining room table — or it would be, if Alan could finish it.

           REVEAL: Alan is struggling to build his cryptography machine. 
           He’s underneath it, covered in grease, fumbling with a 
           soldering iron.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER (O.S.)
                        Alan! Your new minions have 
                        arrived.

           Alan comes out from beneath his machine to see: The TWO NEW 
           GUYS...

           ... But no Joan.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (displeased)
                        ... Where’s Miss Clarke? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLARKE HOUSE - DAY

           Alan sits across from Joan in the den while her MOTHER and 
           FATHER — a local clergyman — putter nervously in the next 
           room, just within earshot.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why aren’t you at Bletchley?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (”My parents can hear us”)
                        So kind of you to visit me in 
                        London, Mr. Turing. Was your trip 
                        pleasant?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Gather your things, pack a bag, and 
                        let’s go. 
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (”They won’t let me come 
                              with you”)
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Turing. I am unable 
                        to accept your offer of employment.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        And why not?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        It is felt — we feel — that a dingy 
                        radio factory in Bletchley is not a 
                        place for a young lady.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That is the stupidest...

           Alan looks in the direction of Joan’s parents.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                             (getting it)
                        ... I see.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        A maid of my age might better spend 
                        her days looking for a good 
                        husband, rather than digging about 
                        amongst... Radio parts.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Indeed.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Perhaps someone in the church. Like 
                        my father.

           Alan thinks.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Miss Clarke, you earned a double 
                        first in mathematics at university.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        But sadly was not afforded the 
                        opportunity to become a Fellow. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I was. A Fellow, I mean.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Congratulations.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        So were many of the men in my 
                        employ at Bletchley. We’ve a 
                        collection of the most esteemed 
                        professors in Britain, who would 
                        all be delighted to meet a woman of 
                        substance.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I would be working among the men?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No no, of course not. Have you 
                        heard of the Women’s Royal Navy? 
                        The WRENs, we call them for short. 
                        We have hundreds of young women who 
                        work for us tending to our clerical 
                        tasks. They even organize social 
                        events at St Martin’s church, down 
                        the road.

           On Joan’s parents: This sounds more promising.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        So I would be a clerk?

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (”No”)
                        Yes.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (”Okay, I’m in.”)
                        Well. I will have to talk this over 
                        with my family.

           As Joan’s parents enter, we

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLARKE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Joan walks Alan out of the front door, finally out of earshot 
           from her parents for a few quick seconds.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Why are you helping me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        This is not going to be easy, and 
                        we have a lot to do. You won’t have 
                        the proper security clearance, so 
                        we’ll have to improvise a bit.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Why are you helping me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        There is only one thing that 
                        matters in this entire world, do 
                        you understand? Breaking Enigma. 
                        And if you think there is anything 
                        I won’t do to accomplish that, any 
                        advantage I won’t abuse, well, 
                        you’ll learn soon enough.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Mr. Turing. Why are you helping me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... It is the very people who no 
                        one else imagines anything of who 
                        do the things that no one else can 
                        imagine.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - WREN’S HUT - DAY - SEQUENCE

           Joan enters an area of Bletchley we’ve never seen before: The 
           compound of the Women’s Royal Navy.

           — She passes row after row of RADIO STATIONS, all operated by 
           women —

           — They wear HEAD PHONES, listening to the pitter-patter of 
           MORSE CODE, taking down everything they hear —

           — Joan TAKES HER SEAT, just one of the hundreds of women 
           working behind the scenes to make Alan’s elite unit function.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - NIGHT

           Meanwhile, in the fruit shop, Alan and the team — Hugh, John, 
           Peter, and the two NEW GUYS — work into the night.

           The team works on fresh Enigma messages, while Alan is off in 
           the corner, struggling to build his cryptography machine.

           Suddenly, a BELL GOES OFF.

           Everyone stops. Sighs.
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        There was a time in my life — I 
                        believe it was called “graduate 
                        school” — when I welcomed the 
                        stroke of midnight. Meant that the 
                        evening was just about to become 
                        fun.

                                 NEW GUY
                        What does it mean now?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        It means that 11 seconds ago the 
                        day’s Enigma settings changed over. 
                        All the work we did today is headed 
                        for the rubbish bin.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        But have no fear: A new day awaits, 
                        with fresh settings to uncover. Or, 
                        more accurately, not uncover. But 
                        the day’s first messages don’t 
                        usually come in till around 
                        daybreak, so we’ve a bit of time to 
                        kill.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        To the pub then?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        The pub? Are you serious? God man, 
                        there’s a war on. Every second 
                        counts. Who could drink at a time 
                        like this?

                                 PETER HILTON
                             (embarrassed)
                        I’m sorry, I just thought... It 
                        might be fun... I mean...

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        ... Christ, Peter, I was just 
                        taking the piss out of you. Let’s 
                        go get bloody sloshed.

           The guys LEAVE with a merry round of back-patting.

           Alan waits silently until he’s left alone...

           ... And then STEALS A PILE OF ENIGMA MESSAGES from Hugh’s 
           desk, and begins FOLDING THEM UP ONE BY ONE.

           He STUFFS THE FOLDED SHEETS INTO HIS COAT POCKETS —
           — INTO HIS PANTS —

           — INTO HIS SHOES —

           — ETC.

           He runs out and locks the door, concealing enough top secret 
           information on his body to have him hanged for treason ten 
           times over.

           EXT. JOAN’S FLAT - MINUTES LATER

           Alan arrives outside of Joan’s new flat.

           Alan sees a light burning on the first floor.

           He CHUCKS A SMALL ROCK at the second floor window...

           ... And Joan OPENS IT.

           Noises from inside the house.

           Joan mouths “BACK WINDOW” and points to its location.

           Alan carefully sneaks around the house, and finds an OPEN 
           BACK WINDOW —

           — On the second floor.

           Damn it.

           He CLIMBS A NEARBY FENCE, and JUMPS FROM THE FENCE TO THE 
           WINDOW —

           — Where Joan GRABS HIM and HELPS HIM INSIDE:

           INT. JOAN’S FLAT - CONTINUOUS

           It’s dark inside...

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (whispering)
                        Could you have made a bit more 
                        noise, Alan? Not sure you woke up 
                        my landlady.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oww.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Oh don’t be a baby. Aren’t you 
                        supposed to be a bigshot spy?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m a mathematician.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I was under the impression that 
                        there wasn’t much difference any 
                        longer.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Could you flip on a light or 
                        something?

           Joan LIGHTS A CANDLE.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        The best I can do. Single women 
                        aren’t permitted to have gentlemen 
                        in their flats after dark, you 
                        know.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I gathered.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        What’d you bring me?

           Alan produces the Enigma messages from every available hiding 
           place on his person.

                        ... Some men try flowers, you know. 

                                 ALAN TURING

                              inside his shirt)
                        These are actual decrypted Enigma 
                        messages, direct from Nazi high 
                        command.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Or chocolates. Girls like 
                        chocolate. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I had Hugh translate, because I 
                        don’t speak Ger... Not the point.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        How do we have decoded messages at 
                        all?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Even a broken clock is right twice 
                        a day. Every now and again we 
                        happen to stumble on the right 
                        settings by sheer blind, stupid 
                        luck. Doesn’t happen often.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (reading)
                        “0600 hours. Weather today is 
                        clear. Rain in the evening. Hail 
                        Hitler.” Well, clearly that vital 
                        information is going to win us the 
                        war.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s the relationship between the 
                        encrypted and decrypted messages 
                        that interests me. Is there a hint 
                        there that we can build into 
                        Christopher to help him find the 
                        settings?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Who’s “Christopher”?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh. He’s my machine.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You named him?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Is that a bad name?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Nevermind.
                             (thinking)
                        But no. What you’re asking is a 
                        logical tautology. The 
                        “relationship” between the 
                        encrypted and decrypted messages is 
                        the very setting you’re trying to 
                        find. It’s like saying, “yesterday 
                        I saw clouds in the sky and then it 
                        rained. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOAN CLARKE (CONT'D)
                        I wonder if there’s a relationship 
                        between seeing clouds and rain.” Of 
                        course there’s a relationship 
                        between clouds and rain, but you 
                        still haven’t a clue about whether 
                        or not it’ll rain next Thursday.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We live in Britain. It’s always 
                        raining.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You made a joke! They told me you 
                        couldn’t do that.

           Alan smiles, proud of himself.

                                 JOAN CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t that funny, calm down.
                             (beat)
                        Look, I have to tell you something. 
                        I misled you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I knew who you were the moment I 
                        walked into the crossword test. I 
                        read your paper in school. The 
                        Universal Machine.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        They’re teaching it already? Good.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        My professor was a bit of a crank. 
                        But you theorize a machine that can 
                        solve any problem. A machine that 
                        doesn’t just do one thing: It does 
                        everything. The machine isn’t only 
                        programmable, it’s re-programmable. 
                        It can be whatever you want it to 
                        be.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        And they’re teaching it well.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Is that part of the idea behind 
                        your — ahem — Christopher?
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes. Human beings can compute large 
                        sums of numbers very quickly. Even 
                        Hugh can do that. I want 
                        Christopher to be... Smarter. An 
                        electrical computer. That can 
                        compute anything.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (trying out the words on 
                              her tongue)
                        An “electrical computer?” Hmm.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Here, let me show you —

           — Alan TURNS, and KNOCKS OVER THE CANDLE...

           ... Which LIGHTS THE ENIGMA MESSAGES ON FIRE.

           Alan and Joan SCRAMBLE TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.

           They make a lot of NOISE in the process, though they do 
           manage not to burn down Joan’s flat.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Jesus.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Are you alright?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m so sorry. 

           They hear more noise from downstairs.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        My landlady. You need to leave.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Right.

           Alan moves to the front door —

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        — No. The window. She’s coming.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (staring at window)
                        Really?
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Go.

           Alan AWKWARDLY CLIMBS OUT THE WINDOW, TRYING NOT TO FALL...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - THE NEXT DAY

           REVEAL: Alan has a BIG BRUISE ON HIS FACE.

           (Climbing is not Alan’s strong suit.)

           Alan walks through the grounds into:

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Alan enters the fruit shop to find a bunch of MILITARY POLICE 
           looking over his desk.

           The team watches silently.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That’s my desk.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON (O.S.)
                        Thank goodness. Be a pity if we 
                        were searching the wrong one.

           Alan turns to find Denniston directing the search.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What are you doing?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        There’s a spy at Bletchley Park.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        There are at least six of them in 
                        this room, if I’m not mistaken.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        A Soviet spy, you stupid prick.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t understand.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Did everyone hear that? Alan is in 
                        fact capable of speaking those 
                        words.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        The Navy thinks there’s a double-
                        agent at the Park, Alan.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why?

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        I don’t have to tell you that. But 
                        let’s just say we have evidence 
                        that someone here — most likely in 
                        this shop — is sending secret 
                        communiqués to Moscow. So what I 
                        was thinking was, we’d arrest that 
                        person, and then we’d hang him for 
                        treason. Sound good?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Sure. Who is it?

           Alan looks at the team. And they look back at him.

           He glances at the MP’s rifling through his desk.

           Oh fuck.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a double agent.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Double agents tend to be isolated 
                        loners, with few attachments to 
                        friends or family. Arrogant. They 
                        think they’re smart enough to get 
                        away with anything. Don’t believe 
                        they owe anything to anybody, only 
                        care about themselves.
                             (beat)
                        Remind you of anyone?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m not... isolated. 
                             (looks to the team)
                        Fellows?

           ON THE TEAM: Silence.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Someone may have taken papers from 
                        my desk. Decrypts. Nothing of any 
                        value, mind you, that’s the odd 
                        part.
                                 PETER HILTON
                        We all went to the pub last night, 
                        Alan. Where did you go?

           The papers are burning a whole in Alan’s pocket right now.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Here. And then home.

                                 MILITARY POLICEMAN
                             (to Denniston)
                        Nothing out of the ordinary, Sir.

                                 COMMANDER DENNISTON
                        Well then. We’ll be around to check 
                        up on you again, Alan. I certainly 
                        hope you don’t have anything to 
                        hide.
                             (to the team)
                        Any of you.

           Denniston and his men LEAVE.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (to the New Guys)
                        Aren’t you glad you joined up just 
                        in time?

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (to the team)
                        Come on, you gents know me. You 
                        know I wouldn’t do something like 
                        this. All right, I’m not friendly 
                        sometimes, or funny, and I know I 
                        can be difficult to work with 
                        because I’m such a brilliant 
                        mathematician, but I’m also a good 
                        person.

           ON THE TEAM: More silence.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Maybe you should take the afternoon 
                        off, Alan. Get some rest. We’ll be 
                        fine here.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PUB - NIGHT

           Alan sits with Joan at a local bar. They can be a bit more 
           relaxed here than at Joan’s flat.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Well no wonder they think you’re a 
                        spy. You’re a bloody creep.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I was hoping for somewhat more 
                        sympathy than that.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Why? You don’t deserve it.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        There are more important things in 
                        life than being liked.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Breaking Enigma?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        What’s the point of breaking Enigma 
                        if you’ve no one to share it with?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That’s a stupid question. I will 
                        have broken Enigma.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Not if you get hanged first.

           Just then, Hugh, John, and Peter enter the bar...

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (seeing the boys)
                        This is not going to help.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Is that your team? Let’s say hi.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (to the boys)
                        Over here!

           They see Joan...

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I believe I told you not to do 
                        that.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I believe you did.

           ... And they approach.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Alan. Didn’t even know you drank.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Hello.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        He doesn’t, really, he just sort of 
                        sips at the foam.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Tell you a secret, Miss...

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        ... Clarke.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Miss Clarke.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Please.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        The foam’s my favorite part too.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Well then, I’ll show you a trick.
                             (to Bartender)
                        Alex! Mind if I take a whirl?

           Joan hops behind the bar and the BARTENDER lets her take over 
           pouring a pint.

           Hugh, John, Peter and Alan all watch.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Alan, are you... On a date?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What? No. Of course not.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Great. Mind if I get her number 
                        then?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m not a double agent.
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Sure. She’s a WREN, right? They’ve 
                        got those badges. And those little 
                        hats. God, I love the little hats.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You have to believe me.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        We do, Alan.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Sort of.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        I take it all back: The stroke of 
                        midnight is about to get a lot more 
                        fun.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Hugh.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        What?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m not a spy.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Oh, Alan, of course you’re not a 
                        spy. Or, if you are, it’s 
                        Denniston’s problem, there’s 
                        nothing I can do about it one way 
                        or another. But I know you stole 
                        the papers from my desk, so will 
                        you please just ask next time? 
                        Thank you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        You stole the decrypts because 
                        you’re secretly working with our 
                        sexy little Miss Clarke here on 
                        your machine.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How did you —

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Because I asked around, all right, 
                        and I put it together. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT'D)
                        Just because you’re so terribly 
                        smart doesn’t mean we’re stupid. 
                        And what you’re doing is highly 
                        illegal, so you didn’t tell us, 
                        which contradicts the “terribly 
                        smart” hypothesis. Let me make this 
                        very clear to you: You are an 
                        irritating boil on my ass and I 
                        despise every minute I am forced to 
                        be in your presence. But if you 
                        think I’d let my personal distaste 
                        for you get in the way of breaking 
                        Enigma, then you’re even dumber 
                        than we’ve established. So unless 
                        you’re actually a bloody double 
                        agent, don’t get caught. If you get 
                        fired we might lose this war, and 
                        if she gets fired I might not get 
                        laid.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Oh. Hugh. I feel I should —

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        — Shut up.

           From the bar, Joan produces PINTS OF GUINNESS FOR EVERY 
           MEMBER OF THE TEAM.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Do you see how the bubbles of 
                        nitrogen in a pint of Guinness 
                        travel downwards, as opposed to 
                        upwards in any other carbonated 
                        drink? Ever wonder why? It’s 
                        because the pint glass creates drag 
                        on the rising bubbles along the 
                        side; but the bubbles in the center 
                        are free to sprint towards the foam 
                        at the top. This creates a current 
                        of rising nitrogen in the middle, 
                        which further pushes down on the 
                        side bubbles. And voila: Guinness. 
                        The official drink of 
                        mathematicians everywhere.

           ON THE PINTS: Joan has etched pi symbols into the foam.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Brilliant!
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        And she has brains, to boot. Be 
                        still my beating heart. Come join 
                        us for a drink.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We’re working.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Fine, Alan can come to.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Thank you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Hugh was being sarcastic.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Really?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        He’s a lost cause, I promise. It 
                        just occurs to me, Miss Clarke, 
                        that I outrank you. And as your 
                        commanding officer, I insist that 
                        you have a drink with us before the 
                        night is out.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        An order is an order. See you in a 
                        bit.

           Joan smiles at Hugh and the team as they head to a separate 
           booth across the pub.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... They like you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You got them to like you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why?
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Because I’m a woman in a man’s job. 
                        I have one strike against me 
                        already, and if I don’t smile and 
                        bat my eyelashes and take a pint 
                        with the boys how far do you think 
                        I’ll get? If they don’t like me, 
                        I’m a frigid bitch. If they don’t 
                        like you, you’re a tortured genius. 
                        Women don’t have the luxury of 
                        being assholes.
                             (beat)
                        And you know what? Neither do you. 
                        Maybe they wouldn’t think you were 
                        a Soviet agent if they actually got 
                        to know you. Are you so committed 
                        to being alone that you’re willing 
                        to let it stop you from breaking 
                        Enigma?

           Alan thinks.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... How do you get people to like 
                        you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - DAY

           Alan enters Hut 8 to find his team hard at work.

           He’s carrying a BAG OF APPLES.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Pardon, Alan. We had to move some 
                        bits of Christopher so we could get 
                        a seat. His arms are over there, 
                        his legs — I honestly can’t 
                        remember.
                             (sees apples)
                        What’re those?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Apples.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        No.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        No, they really are... I... Joan 
                        told me it’d be nice to bring you 
                        all apples.

           Alan takes the apple bag around the room, handing each man an 
           apple.

           They take them. It’s really awkward.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Thanks?

                                 PETER HILTON
                        I like apples.

                        My best to Miss Clarke.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... There are two fellows in the 
                        woods. And they run into a bear. 
                        The first fellow, he kneels down 
                        and starts to pray. But the second 
                        one, he begins lacing up his boots. 
                        The first one says, “my friend, 
                        what’re you doing? You can’t outrun 
                        a bear.” And the second one 
                        responds, “I don’t have to. I only 
                        have to outrun you.”

           Ba dum bum.

           Awkward silence.

                        I’ll be with Christopher if anyone 
                        needs me.

           Alan goes to the corner and CRAWLS UNDER HIS MACHINE.

                        even weirder than usual?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHERBOURNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY - 1927

           Young Alan and Christopher are in math class.
           The TEACHER drones on as the students pretend to pay 
           attention.

           Young Alan and Christopher PASS NOTES —

           — Dropping them by each other’s desks —

           — And snapping them up quickly.

                                 TEACHER
                        Mr. Turing! Passing notes, are we?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No, Sir.

           The Teacher comes over, and grabs the note from his hand.

           ON THE NOTE: “FDFH RG TU HSD PDXT PEJND QERDZX.” 

           It’s encrypted.

                                 TEACHER
                             (holding it up for 
                              everyone)
                        Only Mr. Turing would pass notes 
                        written in gibberish.

           The other students LAUGH as the Teacher drops the note in the 
           trash.

           Alan stews. But he’s safe.

           The BELL RINGS. Class is over. EVERYONE SHUFFLES OUT.

           Alan waits... And grabs the note from the trash.

           Alone, Alan DECRYPTS THE MESSAGE.

           The letters become intelligible, one at a time.

           ON THE NOTE: “MEET ME IN THE PARK AFTER SCHOOL.”

           INT. MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - DAY - 1951

           Detective Nock confers with Superintendant Smith when 
           Sargaent Staehl strides into the room.
                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        The man who broke into Alan 
                        Turing’s house is named Arnold 
                        Murray.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        What makes you say that?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Because Murray’s in the 
                        interrogation room right now.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        And?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I interrogated him. That’s why we 
                        call the room that.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        He confessed?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        He did.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Why?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Because I have him cold on 
                        something much worse. I agreed not 
                        to prosecute him for the robbery, 
                        if he would testify against Turing.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        Testify against Turing for what 
                        charge?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        They’re bloody poofters.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What?

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        You heard me. The kid admitted it. 
                        Bit of a hustler. Hangs around this 
                        pub, men pay him for a go. Turing 
                        is one of the men who paid. Only, 
                        Mr. Murray got the bright idea to 
                        rob Turing’s house after. That’s 
                        what Turing was hiding: He’s a 
                        poof, not a spy.
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        And you want to charge him?

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        This is good, Sargent. This is very 
                        good.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        No, it’s not. I thought we were 
                        going after Turing for something 
                        serious. Not for getting his 
                        jollies with some bloke.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        We can charge a Cambridge don with 
                        indecency, Bob. 

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        It’s a lot more exciting than 
                        robbery. Do it. Arrest Turing. 

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        No. No. This is bloody rubbish. 
                        There is something actually 
                        important happening here, and this 
                        is not it.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        He committed a crime. He broke the 
                        law. And with a bloke, Jesus, it’s 
                        bloody disgusting.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I don’t care if it’s disgusting. 
                        This is not what I signed on for.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        If enforcing the law isn’t 
                        something you’d like to do with 
                        your life, Bob, then I suggest you 
                        leave the CID. ... No? Alright 
                        then.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Let me do the interrogation.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        I already did. He confessed. Here.

           Staehl throws the typed confession at Nock.
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        No. Of Turing. Let me interrogate 
                        Turing. Alone.

                                 SGT. STAEHL
                        Why?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Please.

                                 SUPERINTENDANT SMITH
                        Fine. Now will someone go see a 
                        judge and get a warrant for the 
                        arrest of Alan Turing?

                        Denniston won’t figure us out, I 
                        promise. I’ve been sloppy. Lazy. 
                        It’s inexcusable. But I’ll do 
                        better. I have to.

                        It’s my parents, Alan. My time with 
                        the government hasn’t produced the 
                        fiancé they were hoping for.

                        “I’ll miss you.” That’s what a 
                        normal person might say in this

                        “I’ll write.” That’d work too.

                        It’s impossible! Everyone else in 
                        the world thinks Enigma is 
                        impossible, except for you. Have 
                        you talked to John? Or Hugh? Or 
                        Peter? No, you haven’t, have you, 
                        because you’re too much of an ass 
                        to actually have a conversation 
                        with the only other people in 
                        Britain who know what you’re going 
                        through. They laugh, Alan. They do 
                        their jobs to perfection every day, 
                        and then they drink themselves to 
                        sleep every night and laugh because 
                        they know, deep down, that it’s all 
                        useless. Sorry you’re lonely. But 
                        Enigma isn’t going to save you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Good.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I know.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I mean it.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I know.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Let’s fix this.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re sorry, I’m sorry, done.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I want you to stay because I like 
                        you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I know.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I like talking to you.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I like talking to you, too, Alan.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        So if you need a husband to stay at 
                        Bletchley, let’s get you a husband.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Ha! You have one in mind?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I do.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Hugh is terribly attractive, I’ll 
                        give you that, but he’s really not 
                        the marrying type.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I wasn’t referring to Hugh.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Peter? He’s so quiet...

           Alan stares at Joan. She stares back.

                                 JOAN CLARKE (CONT’D)
                             (getting it)
                        Oh dear Lord.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        This makes sense.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Did you just propose to me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We’d have to keep it a secret, of 
                        course. Romantic relationships 
                        between cryptographers are against 
                        military law.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Too bad we don’t have any 
                        experience breaking military laws — 
                        Alan, what the hell?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We don’t have to do it for real.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        This is ridiculous.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        This is your parents.

           Joan tries to process all this.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I cannot believe this is happening.

           Alan fishes a piece of ELECTRICAL WIRE from his pocket...

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Joan Ca... Wait, is your middle 
                        name Caroline or Catherine? 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Elizabeth.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Joan Elizabeth Clarke, will you 
                        marry me?

           ...  And then FASHIONS IT INTO A RING.

           ON JOAN’S FACE: What’s she going to do?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CLARKE HOUSE - DAY

           A BANNER in Joan’s parents’ den reads “CONGRATULATIONS!”

           Alan and Joan stand in the middle of a genteel ENGAGEMENT 
           PARTY.

           Amongst Joan’s parents and their FRIENDS we find Hugh, John, 
           and Peter sipping champagne.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (grumpy, re: Alan)
                        It’s like he makes it his mission 
                        in life to ruin everything.

           EXT. CLARKE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

           Alan drinks champagne alone in the backyard.

           John looks from inside: Alan is WOBBLING FROM THE ALCOHOL. 

           John comes out and joins him.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        If you need someone to give a toast 
                        at the wedding, I recommend Hugh. 
                        It’d be priceless.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Is this a terribly stupid idea?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Probably.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What should I do?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        The south of France would make a 
                        lovely spot for a honeymoon if it 
                        wasn’t under Nazi occupation.

           Alan BURPS, and wobbles again.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Am I drunk?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Yes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How can you tell?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Alan, you look like you could use a 
                        friend right now.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Would you like me to be your 
                        friend?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I have a secret and I want to tell 
                        someone.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Someone who’s not your fiancée, I 
                        take it?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I’m relatively certain that’s one 
                        of the things they make friends 
                        for.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You won’t tell anyone?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Cross my heart and hope to die.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... I’m a hom... I’m... In my 
                        personal life, you see... I have 
                        certain tendencies... I’m not... 
                        Attracted to Joan.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Because you’re a homosexual?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Correct.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I suspected. You’re not quite as 
                        much of an enigma as you think you 
                        are. Or as much as Enigma is. Ha! 
                        That’s a good one. I have to write 
                        that down.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’ve had affairs with other men.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        So has half the Royal Navy. They’re 
                        just quite good at hiding it.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Should I tell Joan?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        You know, in my admittedly limited 
                        experience, women tend to be a bit 
                        touchy about accidentally marrying 
                        homosexuals. It’s a fake engagement 
                        anyway, yes? So perhaps it’s a 
                        little more fake than Joan 
                        realizes, but that doesn’t change 
                        the gist of the thing. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s illegal. The things I’ve done. 
                        With other men.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        So let’s add this to the 
                        increasingly long list of crimes 
                        you’ve committed about which no one 
                        ever needs to find out.

           INT. STEWART MENZIES’ OFFICE - DAY - 1942

           Alan enters Stewart Menzies’ office.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Do you get sea sick?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You’re sending me somewhere.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Well there aren’t any boats in 
                        Bletchley, Alan, be reasonable. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t have time for this.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Ever heard of the OSS?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Right. So, do you know what I do 
                        for the British government? 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        To be honest, not exactly.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Well, the OSS do the same thing for 
                        the Americans.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        American intelligence wants to know 
                        where we are with Enigma.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        So you’re sending me.
                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Congratulations, Mr. Turing. You 
                        are the new Chief British Technical 
                        Liaison to United States Military 
                        Intelligence.
                             (beat)
                        I should come up with a better 
                        acronym for that.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why me?

           On Menzies’ face: Take a good guess.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        ... You don’t want me to tell the 
                        Americans what I’m working on, do 
                        you?
                             (beat)
                        You want me to lie.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        You don’t think I had Denniston 
                        hire you because of your 
                        mathematical abilities, do you?

           Joan answers the phone in her flat.

                        Hello?

           INT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

           Alan phones Joan from a hotel in New York.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (bad American accent)
                        “Hello, my dear.”

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Ha! That’s the worst accent I’ve 
                        ever heard.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        You have no idea. Americans really 
                        do speak that way.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Tell me about America. Tell me 
                        everything.

           EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT - EARLIER

           Alan roams the streets of New York, watching people.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s such a strange place. Everyone 
                        is shockingly rude. They’re deathly 
                        afraid of silences, did you know 
                        that? If Americans have nothing to 
                        say, rather than simply stay quiet 
                        with their thoughts for a moment 
                        they’ll make these funny little 
                        noises. “Hmm,” “well now,” “huh.” 
                        It’s frightful.

           Alan walks downtown to the rumored and just-forming gay mecca 
           that is Greenwich Village.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Is it everything they say? Decadent 
                        and dirty and beautiful?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I went exploring a bit. Down to the 
                        Village. It was frightening.

           He sees MEN FLIRTING on the streets, TOUCHING EACH OTHER’s 
           HANDS.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Do tell.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I went into a pub.

           Alan approaches the Julius Bar. MEN are smoking outside in 
           small packs.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You did? I can barely get you to go 
                        to the Bull & Butcher back home.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        I wanted to see for myself what 
                        they’d be like. In America.

           Inside, Alan stands awkwardly at the bar, trying to order a 
           drink. Around him, MERRIMENT IS KING.

           A few men even KISS in the corner.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        And?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The people were dressed in garish 
                        costumes. Everyone was loud. And 
                        they laughed. Laughed at everything 
                        that came out of their mouths, but 
                        I didn’t understand any of it.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Aww, did you try to make friends 
                        with the locals?

           A YOUNG MAN starts hitting on Alan. Flirting.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I did.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Without too much success, it seems?

           Alan tries to flirt back, but it doesn’t really work. This 
           place, these people, feel horribly foreign and strange to 
           him.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Their chattering, the 
                        conversation... It was completely 
                        inane. It was as if nothing was 
                        truly important to any of them. As 
                        if nothing mattered in the world.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You tried to talk about math, 
                        didn’t you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Well what else was I supposed to 
                        talk about?

           Upset, Alan leaves the bar.

           Outside the bar, he holds his coat tight against the cold.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        And this is why I love you, Alan. 
                        Wherever you go, you’re always you.

           END INTERCUTTING.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHERBOURNE SCHOOL FOR BOYS - PARK - EVENING - 1927

           Holding Christopher’s now un-encrypted note, Young Alan waits 
           in the park after school.

           The hours drag on.

           Christopher never shows.

           Despondent and confused, Young Alan finally gives up...

           ... When he runs into the PACK OF BOYS who beat him up 
           earlier.

                                 BOY #1
                        Well look. Mr. Turing is all alone.

           Young Alan stands frozen as they come at him, and we

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MANCHESTER POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - 1951

           Detective Nock enters the interrogation room to find Alan 
           Turing seated...

           ... With his eyes closed.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Cup of tea?

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (eyes closed)
                        Thanks, no.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Am I disturbing you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Pardon.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        I have a lot of work to do, 
                        Detective. And my work involves 
                        careful thinking.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Mr. Turing, may I tell you a 
                        secret?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m quite good with those.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I’m here to help you.

           Suddenly, Alan opens his eyes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (re: being in jail)
                        Clearly.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I have to inform you that you’re 
                        under no legal obligation to speak 
                        to me.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I am well aware of my obligations, 
                        legal and otherwise. And I assure 
                        you that what I choose to tell or 
                        not to tell you will be entirely up 
                        to me.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                             (changing tacks)
                        Can machines think?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Oh! You’ve read my published work.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What makes you say that?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Because I’m sitting in a police 
                        station, accused of entreating a 
                        young man to touch my penis, and 
                        you’re asking me whether machines 
                        can think.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Can they? Could machines ever think 
                        as human beings do?
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Most people say no.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        You’re not most people.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The problem is that you’re asking a 
                        stupid question.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        I am?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Of course machines can’t think “as 
                        human beings do.” A machine is 
                        different from a human being; 
                        hence, it would think differently. 
                        The interesting question is, just 
                        because something thinks 
                        differently from you, does that 
                        mean it’s not thinking? Most people 
                        believe that machines are 
                        inherently inferior to human 
                        beings. But what if they’re not 
                        inferior? What if they’re simply... 
                        Different? We allow that humans 
                        have such divergences from one 
                        another. You like strawberries. I 
                        hate ice-skating. You cry at sad 
                        films. I’m allergic to pollen. What 
                        does it mean to have different 
                        tastes — different preferences — 
                        other than to say that our brains 
                        work differently? That we think 
                        differently from one another? And 
                        if we can say that about each 
                        another, why can’t we say the same 
                        for brains made of copper and 
                        steel? Why are we so bloody narrow-
                        minded about who we consider alive?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        That’s... This paper you wrote... 
                        “The Imitation Game.” That’s what 
                        it’s about?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes. The Imitation Game is a test, 
                        of sorts. For determining the 
                        difference between a human and a 
                        machine. Would you like to play?
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Play?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        There’s an interrogator. And a 
                        subject. How would you like to be 
                        the interrogator?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Alright.

           Nock readies his pen and paper.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Are you paying attention?

           INT. BULL & BUTCHER PUB - NIGHT - 1942

           A crowded, late night at the pub. 

           Alan is drinking with Hugh, John, and Peter.

           Meanwhile, Joan is drinking with her friend HELEN — a fellow 
           WREN — across the bar.

           ON JOAN AND HELEN:

                                 HELEN
                        Who’s Alan’s friend?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Hugh? Bit of a cad, actually.

                                 HELEN
                        So my type then?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Here, I’ll introduce you.

                                 HELEN
                        No! Jesus, engaged for a fortnight 
                        and you’ve already forgotten how to 
                        do this? He’ll come over.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Are you sure?

                                 HELEN
                        Yes. I smiled at him fifteen 
                        minutes ago and haven’t looked at 
                        him since.
           ON HUGH, ALAN, JOHN, AND PETER:

           Hugh is looking at the girls.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (re: Helen)
                        Who’s that, then?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Helen? Works with Joan in the 
                        WREN’s hut.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        You do have a point about the 
                        little hats.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        She wants me to come over.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How can you possibly know that?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        She smiled at me awhile back and 
                        hasn’t looked again since.

           ON JOAN AND HELEN:

                                 HELEN
                             (re: Hugh’s glances)
                        And... Got him.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Is it odd that when I was single 
                        this game felt tedious, but now it 
                        seems just dreadfully fun?

           ON THE BOYS:

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (re: Helen’s glances)
                        And... Brilliant. She’s in. Alan, 
                        introduce me.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why me?
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Because you’re her friend’s fiancé, 
                        and there’s nothing like the 
                        engagement of a co-worker to make a 
                        woman want to do something she will 
                        later regret with said fiancé’s 
                        better-looking friend.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        This is harder than cryptography.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Well if you intend to break Enigma, 
                        you should probably practice 
                        breaking the Bull & Butcher first. 
                        Up we go.

           Hugh drags Alan across the pub to Helen and Joan.

           ON JOHN AND PETER:

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Half crown says Alan bullockses 
                        this entirely.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        No bet.

           ON HUGH, ALAN, JOAN, AND HELEN:

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (to the ladies)
                        Alan Turing has a theory.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        He has many.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        He believes that the regulations 
                        against men and women working side-
                        by-side are sound, because such 
                        proximity will necessarily lead to 
                        romance between the genders.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No I don’t —

           Hugh KICKS Alan, who shuts up.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        — However, I disagree. 
                                 HELEN
                        You do?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        I think that if I were working 
                        beside a woman all day long, I 
                        could manage to appreciate her 
                        abilities and intellect without 
                        needing to take her to bed.
                             (to Helen)
                        Pardon, have we met?

                                 HELEN
                        I don’t recall. But let’s assume we 
                        haven’t.

           Hugh looks at Alan for an introduction: Alan is silent.

           Joan picks up the slack:

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        So who do you agree with? Alan or 
                        myself?

                                 HELEN
                        Well, Alan, of course.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m flattered, but this is not 
                        actually —

           Now Joan KICKS Alan, who is still very confused.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        — Rubbish.

                                 HELEN
                        I work beside a man every day, and 
                        I can’t help but have developed a 
                        bit of a crush on him.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Well who is this man, so I can kick 
                        his arse?

                                 HELEN
                        Oh, it’s been chaste, you’ve no 
                        need to worry. We’ve never even 
                        met. He’s a German. 
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Now I really want to kill him.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How is it that you work alongside a 
                        German?

                                 HELEN
                        In my hut, each girl intercepts 
                        messages from a specific German 
                        radio tower. So each of us has a 
                        counterpart on the other side, 
                        who’s tip-tapping out the messages. 
                        Everybody types Morse code a touch 
                        differently; you get to know the 
                        voice of your counterpart. It’s 
                        strangely intimate. I feel as if we 
                        know each other so well. Pity he 
                        has a girlfriend... But that’s why 
                        I disagree with you, Mr. Alexander. 
                        I’m in love with a co-worker, of 
                        sorts, even if we’ve never met. 

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        May I tell you why you’re wrong 
                        over another pint?

                                 HELEN
                        Please do.

           Helen and Hugh walk away...

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (to Alan)
                        That’s what flirting looks like. In 
                        case you were curious.

           But Alan is lost in thought...

           Something is wrong...

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (screaming)
                        HELEN!!!

           Everyone in the room turns and stares at him.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (sighing)
                        He’s with me.

           Helen and Hugh come back over.
                                 HELEN
                        Yes, Alan?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Really, man? You can’t manage one 
                        time where you don’t fuck this up?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Why do you think your German 
                        counterpart has a girlfriend?

                                 HELEN
                        Oh, it’s a stupid joke, don’t worry 
                        about it.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alan doesn’t understand those. 
                        Answer his question.

                                 HELEN
                        Each one of his messages begins 
                        with the same five letters. C-I-L-L-
                        Y. So I figure Cilly must be the 
                        name of his amore. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That’s impossible. The Germans are 
                        instructed to choose five letters 
                        at random to start every message. 
                        It makes them much harder to 
                        decrypt if they begin with 
                        randomness.

                                 HELEN
                        Well, this bloke doesn’t.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Love’ll make a man do strange 
                        things, I suppose. Anyhow —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — In this case, love just lost the 
                        Germans the whole bloody war.

           Alan BOLTS out of the bar —

           — SPILLING BEER ALL OVER HELEN —

           — Who CRIES OUT, and ANGRILY RUNS TO THE RESTROOM —

           — While Joan HEADS OFF after Alan —

           — Leaving Hugh alone, equal parts confused and pissed.
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (to John and Peter)
                        One. Bloody. Time.

           ON JOHN AND PETER:

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Half crown.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        I said no bet!

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - CONTINUOUS - SEQUENCE

           Joan CHASES ALAN across Bletchley Park —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        I exaggerated slightly, of course. 
                        The existence of poor Cilly — and 
                        her immensely stupid boyfriend — 
                        did not single-handedly allow me to 
                        break Enigma. But it made clear how 
                        it could be done.

           — SECURITY GUARDS try to STOP THEM, CHECK BADGES, but Alan 
           and Joan just KEEP RUNNING —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s all quite obvious from this 
                        point forward. I assume you see how 
                        I did it.

           — Guards yell after them as they barrel into the fruit shop —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Really? You don’t get it yet? Very 
                        well. I’ll explain.

           — They start TAPING UP INTERCEPTS to the walls —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Imagine a machine. It’s checking 
                        all of those 189 million million 
                        possible Enigma settings, trying to 
                        find the correct one. But how does 
                        it know that it’s found the right 
                        one? Someone has to look at the 
                        text produced by each setting and 
                        see if it’s readable German, if it 
                        makes sense as a message. 
           — ON CHRISTOPHER: Alan and Joan TEAR OUT PARTS, REPLACE THEM 
           with others, improving it, refining it —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But now imagine that this machine 
                        knew what it was looking for. It 
                        knew what the decrypted message was 
                        supposed to say. It didn’t have to 
                        try every possible setting — it 
                        only had to try the ones that 
                        produced the exact text it knew it 
                        had to find. Like, say, the word 
                        “cilly” at the start of every 
                        message. 

           — The rest of the team (Hugh, John, Peter) go over the 
           intercepts with Alan and Joan —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The number of possible settings 
                        would go down by a factor of one 
                        hundred million. 

           — They’re finding REPEATED WORDS in already decrypted 
           messages —

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And if there was one radio operator 
                        dumb enough to make mistakes, there 
                        would be others.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - NIGHT

           The entire team stands in front of Christopher as he HUMS, 
           processing Enigma intercepts.

           They’re nervous.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (reading same decrypt she 
                              had earlier)
                        “0600 hours. Weather today is 
                        clear. Rain in the evening. Hail 
                        Hitler.”

                                 ALAN TURING
                        They send a weather report at 6AM. 
                        Every day. That means three 
                        repeated words that we know have to 
                        be there, every day. “Weather,” 
                        obviously. And —
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        — “Hail bloody Hitler.”

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Hail bloody Hitler. Turns out 
                        that’s the only German you need to 
                        know to break Enigma.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        It looks like Enigma wasn’t perfect 
                        after all, then.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No, don’t you see? It is. That’s 
                        the whole point. All this time 
                        we’ve been trying to beat the 
                        machine; but we should have been 
                        trying to beat the people who use 
                        the machine. Enigma is perfect. 
                        It’s human beings who are flawed.

           The team stares at Christopher, anxiously awaiting his 
           calculations...

           ... Finally, Christopher PRODUCES a STRING OF PUNCHCARDS.

           The team looks at them: It’s all in BINARY. 1010111001100010, 
           etc.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Can you read that?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        “KMS Jaguar moving to coordinates 
                        plus 56-42, minus 12-81. Hail 
                        Hitler.” 

           The team EXPLODES WITH JOY. 

           LAUGHING, HOOTING, SCREAMING, JUMPING, HUGGING.

           This is the happiest moment of their lives.

           John even starts to TEAR UP, and TRIES TO HUG ALAN —

           — Who just STANDS THERE, limp.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                             (re: Alan)
                        Not a hugger. Probably could have 
                        guessed that.
           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - DAWN

           Dawn rises over Bletchley, and the team has been there all 
           night.

           Joan and Peter are asleep on separate desks.

           Alan feeds every intercept they have into Christopher, while 
           Hugh and John have created a BIG MAP ON THE WALL:

           ON THE MAP: It’s the Atlantic Ocean. Blue pins represent the 
           Allied ships, red ones represent the Axis ships.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        There are five people in the world 
                        who know where every ship in the 
                        entire war is located. They’re all 
                        in this room.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Mate in six.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        What?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        There’s a point in every game of 
                        chess where a player has won, but 
                        the other player doesn’t realize it 
                        yet. It’s just a matter of time. 
                        Checkmate in 5 moves. Checkmate in 

                             (to Alan)
                        You did it.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        God help me, but you did it. How 
                        does it feel?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t know what you mean.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        You just defeated Nazism with a 
                        crossword puzzle. Damn it, Alan, I 
                        want to know what it feels like to 
                        do the impossible.

           ON ALAN’S FACE: How does it feel? He can’t tell.
           Something is bothering him, but he can’t figure out what.

           Joan STIRS, and looks at the big map.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Holy mother of God.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        I don’t think even God, or his holy 
                        mother, has the power that we do 
                        right now.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (getting closer to map)
                        There’s going to be an attack on a 
                        British passenger convoy. There.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        You’re right. Those U-Boats are 
                        only twenty or thirty minutes away.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Civilians. Hundreds of them. We can 
                        save their lives.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        And knock out a whole German fleet 
                        in the process.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        I’ll call Denniston. Have him radio 
                        his admirals immediately.

           Hugh picks up the phone —

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (figuring something out)
                        No.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Is there enough time to save them?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Should be. If we can get a message 
                        to the passenger convoy, she can 
                        turn —

           Hugh DIALS —

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (louder)
                        No. No.
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (into phone)
                        — Commander Denniston’s office —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        NO.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                             (into phone)
                        — This is urgent, top priority —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        NO!!!

           Alan LEAPS ACROSS THE ROOM and GRABS THE PHONE FROM HUGH.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        What the bloody hell?

           Hugh tries to grab the phone back —

           — But Alan pulls away sharply.

           Everyone STOPS. Turns. Looks at Alan. Even Peter gets up.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
                        Are you mad?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No. No. You can’t call Denniston. 
                        You can’t tell him about the 
                        attack.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alan, are you all right? What’s 
                        going on?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        We can have air support over the 
                        passenger convoy in ten minutes.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No. Let the U-Boats sink the 
                        convoy.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Look, this has been a big day, 
                        maybe you’re going through a bit of 
                        shock —

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        — There’s no time for this.
           Hugh tries to GRAB THE PHONE from Alan —

           — but Alan PULLS it away and SMASHES THE PHONE AGAINST THE 
           GROUND.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alan!

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        You are actually insane.

           Hugh can’t take it anymore —

           — He TAKES A SWING AT ALAN —

           — Who CRUMPLES AT THE BLOW ON HIS JAW —

           — Hugh stares down at Alan, who’s bleeding on the floor —

           — Hugh WINDS UP FOR ANOTHER PUNCH —

           — When his arm is CAUGHT MID-AIR —

           — By Joan.

           Hugh is shocked —

           — He SWINGS WITH THE OTHER ARM AT JOAN —

           — WHO DEFLECTS AND SENDS HUGH’S FACE INTO A TABLE.

           Hugh and Alan are both bleeding on the floor now.

           Joan stands above them.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (to Hugh)
                        I had two older brothers, but the 
                        one my dad really liked to use his 
                        belt on was me. If you hurt him, 
                        you will just barely live to regret 
                        it.

           Silence. Just the sounds of panting.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Everyone stop. Please. Calm down.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        The attack is in minutes. We don’t 
                        have time to calm down.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Do you know why people like 
                        violence, Hugh? Because it feels 
                        good. 
                             (wipes blood from his 
                              nose)
                        It would feel good to blow those U-
                        Boats out of the Atlantic. But 
                        sometimes we can’t do what feels 
                        good. We have to do what’s logical.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        What’s logical?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The hardest time to lie is when the 
                        other person is expecting to be 
                        lied to.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                             (getting it)
                        Oh my God.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        What?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        If they’re waiting for a lie, you 
                        can’t just give them one. 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Oh my God. Fuck. Alan’s right.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        What?!?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What will the Germans think if we 
                        destroy those U-Boats?

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Nothing. They’ll be dead.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                             (getting it)
                        No. No. You can’t be right.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Am I the only one who’s still not 
                        getting this? 
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Suddenly our convoy veers off 
                        course and a fleet of RAF bombers 
                        magically descends on the location 
                        of a pack of U-Boats? What will the 
                        Germans think?

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Hugh?

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        ... The Germans will know we broke 
                        Enigma. 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        They’ll put a halt on radio 
                        communication by noon. And they’ll 
                        have the design of Enigma changed 
                        by the weekend.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Two years of work. Everything we’ve 
                        done here. It’ll all be for 
                        nothing.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        There are 500 people in that 
                        convoy. Civilians. Women. Children. 
                        We’re about to let them die.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Our job wasn’t to save one 
                        passenger convoy. It was to win the 
                        war.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        Our job was to break Enigma.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Done. Now for the hard part: 
                        Keeping it a secret. Forever.

           Peter looks at the map...

                                 PETER HILTON
                        It’s the Carlisle.

           They all look at him.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        What?
                                 PETER HILTON
                        The convoy you’re about to... 
                        It’s... The HMS Carlisle is one of 
                        the ships.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The Carlisle is a light cruiser, 
                        Peter. It’s not very important.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        We can’t act on every piece of 
                        intelligence? Fine. We won’t. Just 
                        this one. The Germans won’t find us 
                        out if we stop one attack.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        What’s gotten into you, Peter?

                                 PETER HILTON
                        ... My brother. Phillip. He’s on 
                        the Carlisle. Gunnery ensign.

           Silence. Fuck.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I didn’t know you had a brother.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        I HAVE A BROTHER. And in a few 
                        minutes I won’t anymore if you 
                        don’t pick up that bloody radio and 
                        save his life.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Who the hell do you think you are? 
                        This is my brother. My big brother. 
                        He was the only one — Look, he was 
                        there after my mum — He’s my big 
                        brother, alright, and you have a 
                        few minutes to call off his murder.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s not my fault.

           Peter DIVES for Alan —

           — But John stops him.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Alan is right. We can’t.
                                 PETER HILTON
                        AND WHY THE BLOODY HELL NOT?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        The Royal Navy will get suspicious. 
                        They’ll know.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        THEY’RE THE BRITISH ROYAL NAVY I 
                        THINK WE CAN TRUST THEM WITH OUR 
                        CODE -

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — No, no, we can’t. We can’t trust 
                        anyone. It’s just us, Peter. It’s 
                        us. The people in this room. We 
                        make the decisions. We figure out 
                        who lives and who dies. We’re the 
                        only ones who can. And we keep the 
                        secret. Whatever else we do, we 
                        keep the secret. 

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Is your secret more important to 
                        you than my big brother Phillip’s 
                        life?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        You’re a monster.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m sorry.

                                 PETER HILTON
                        I am begging you. Alan. Joan. Hugh. 
                        John. Please. I am begging you. 
                        Just this once. Just one time. The 
                        Germans won’t get suspicious just 
                        because we stopped one attack. It’s 
                        one time. No one will know. I’m 
                        asking you. As your friend. If I 
                        mean anything to you. Please.

           Silence. This is the hardest thing anyone in this room has 
           ever had to do.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.
                                 PETER HILTON
                        You’re not God, Alan. You don’t get 
                        to decide who lives and who dies.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Yes, I do. 

                                 PETER HILTON
                        Why? Why you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Because no one else can.

           Everyone is quiet.

           Christopher WHIRS and Hugh picks up the decrypts he produces.

           Alan walks to the map and takes down the BLUE PIN marked 
           “CARLISLE.”

           He crumbles it up, and throws it on the floor.

           INT. STEWART MENZIES OFFICE - DAY

           Alan and Joan speak to Stewart Menzies in his office.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        ... Why are you telling me this?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Because when you want to keep a 
                        secret, you don’t go to an amateur. 
                        You go to a professional. We need 
                        your help to keep this from 
                        Denniston. The Admiralty. Army. 
                        RAF.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        That’s going to be very difficult.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We’ll keep decoding messages. Every 
                        day. We’ll develop a system for 
                        determining which intelligence to 
                        act on. Which attacks to stop, 
                        which to let through. Statistical 
                        analysis. We can even use 
                        Christopher to run the numbers. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALAN TURING (CONT'D)
                        We’ll figure out the minimum number 
                        of actions it’ll take to win, but 
                        the maximum number we’re able to 
                        take before the Germans get 
                        suspicious.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re going to trust this all to 
                        statistics? To math?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct. And then MI-6 can come up 
                        with lies to tell the rest of the 
                        military. We’ll need a plausible 
                        alternate explanation for every 
                        movement we want them to make. Can 
                        you do that?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Maintain a conspiracy of lies 
                        through the highest levels of our 
                        government? Yes, that sounds right 
                        up my alley.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Excellent. So we’re settled.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (beaming)
                        Alan, I so rarely have cause to say 
                        this in my life. But you are 
                        exactly the man I always hoped you 
                        would be.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - FRUIT SHOP - DAY

           As the John, Hugh, and Peter work silently at their desks, 
           Alan hands each member a COLORED FOLDER.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’ve sectioned you off into 
                        theatres. Red is continental ground 
                        forces, green is Luftwaffe, orange 
                        is Africa, blue is the Atlantic. 
                        It’ll make tracking movements 
                        easier.

           Silence. No one wants to talk to Alan.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Alright?

           BUZZ. The alarm indicating that it’s midnight goes off.
           No one moves.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Does anyone... We can go to the 
                        Bull & Butcher... It’s okay... If 
                        anyone wants a pint?

           The just stare at him. No one wants to go.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Joan finds Alan alone in the Bletchley mess hall.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re avoiding me.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        If so, it would appear I’m not 
                        doing a very good job of it.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re trying to keep something 
                        from me.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Such as?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I don’t know. It hasn’t exactly 
                        been an easy week.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m sorry, would you like me to 
                        cry? Would that make you feel 
                        better?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        When was the last time you slept?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That depends on what day it is.
                             (thinking)
                        What day is it?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Go home. Rest. I’ll manage Hugh and 
                        John, and you can patch things up 
                        with Peter when he gets back.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        This is not a time to — Gets back? 
                        From where?
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        He’s visiting his brother in the 
                        hospital.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You didn’t hear? The California was 
                        escorting lend-lease supplies to 
                        Murmansk when the Soviets 
                        redirected it to the wreckage of 
                        the Carlisle. Amazing coincidence. 
                        The survivors, including Hilton, 
                        are at some godforsaken Soviet 
                        monstrosity of a hospital as we 
                        speak.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... How did the Soviets know about 
                        the Carlisle?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        They didn’t have to know. Happy 
                        accident.

           Alan’s brain is going faster than one of his machines...

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Denniston was right. There’s a 
                        double-agent...

           ... He DROPS HIS TRAY...

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alan!

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... And I know who it is.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - LATER

           Alan stands on the steps outside the main building.

           He tries to smoke a cigarette, but his hands shake too much.

           Finally, John Cairncross comes down the steps.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You’re a Soviet spy.
                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Excuse me?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You leaked the location of Peter’s 
                        brother to Moscow.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I think the stress is addling your 
                        brain.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (holds up blue folder)
                        Look familiar?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        That’s my folder of decrypted — Oh 
                        my God, Alan, you’re brilliant.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How much are the Soviets paying 
                        you?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        You gave us each different folders 
                        with different messages in them. 
                        The Soviets acted on intelligence 
                        derived from the blue folder. 
                        Intelligence that only I had.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        It was better than that, actually.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        ... You faked the intelligence! You 
                        included randomized fake data into 
                        each folder, and waited to see 
                        which one the Soviets would act on.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        The Soviets came at the Carlisle 
                        from the south. Why? Because they 
                        were avoiding a wolf pack to the 
                        north. Only —

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        — No wolf pack. The only reason 
                        they would have come from the south 
                        is because you handed me a fake 
                        intercept yesterday about a 
                        fictitious German fleet.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        Correct.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Wait, all of us got bogus data? 
                        Even Joan?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Everyone. 

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Don’t trust anybody, do you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How much are the Soviets paying 
                        you?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Christ, they’re not paying me, 
                        Alan. I’m doing this for us. For 
                        Britain.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You’re killing your own countrymen.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        How can you be so smart about maths 
                        and be so daft about politics? 
                        Helping the Soviets against the 
                        Germans is good for Britain. 
                        Churchill hates Stalin too much to 
                        share intelligence with him, and 
                        it’s harming the war effort.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        That’s not your decision to make.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        Oh, you’re one to lecture me about 
                        who’s allowed to make what 
                        decisions. It’s just us, remember? 
                        There’s no one else.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        And you decided you might as well 
                        help Peter while you were at it?

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        He’s our friend. Just like the 
                        Soviets are our friends. You’re 
                        supposed to help your friends. And 
                        you wouldn’t do anything for him, 
                        so I had to. 
                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’m telling Menzies.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        No you’re not. I’m going to get 
                        away with it, and you know exactly 
                        why: If you tell anyone who I am, 
                        and I’ll tell everyone who you are. 
                        Your “tendencies.” Mutually assured 
                        destruction. All right?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... God damn you.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        I think what’s pissing you off is 
                        that I’m a better person than you 
                        are, and I’m a bloody double agent.

           John walks away.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS (CONT’D)
                        Comrade.

           REVEAL: SOMEONE — a man, 40s — has been watching this 
           exchange from far away. Alan is being followed.

           INT. JOAN’S FLAT - NIGHT

           Alan enters Joan’s flat — through the front door this time.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        One nice thing about being engaged 
                        is that I’m finally allowed to —

           It’s dark. He FLICKS ON THE LIGHT...

           REVEAL: The room has been ransacked.

           Clothes, books, papers scattered everywhere.

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        — Joan?!?

           He quickly moves through the flat: What happened here?

                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Joan, are you okay? Where are you?

           Runs to the back bedroom, where he finds...

           ... Stewart Menzies. Calmly looking over some papers.
                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Joan?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Military prison.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What have you done? 

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                             (holding up papers)
                        Decoded Enigma intercepts. A stack 
                        of them under her nightstand.

           ON ALAN: Fuck.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I gave those to her. A year ago. 
                        When she was with the WRENs I was 
                        giving her decrypts so she could —

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        — Yes yes yes, I’m sure you did. 
                        That’s terrific. But Denniston has 
                        been looking for a Soviet spy, and 
                        he’s been looking for one inside 
                        the GCCS, and he just found a 
                        cryptographer, recent hire, no 
                        military background, with a stack 
                        of decrypts in her flat that she 
                        didn’t have permission to see, let 
                        alone remove from the premises. So 
                        Joan Clarke is going to jail.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No. You can’t.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        What do you want me to do? She’s 
                        the double agent. She’s going to 
                        jail, and then she’s probably going 
                        to be hanged.

           They stare at each other: Is Alan going to tell him about 
           John Cairncross?

                                 STEWART MENZIES (CONT’D)
                        Or shot. Did you see they’ve 
                        brought back the firing squad for 
                        treason? 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No.
                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Beheading is still on the books as 
                        well. Haven’t used it in a bit, but 
                        it’s legal. If the crown prosecutor 
                        wants to make an example of Ms. 
                        Clarke —

                                 ALAN TURING
                        — John Cairncross is the spy. He’s 
                        been feeding information to the 
                        Soviets for years. And I can prove 
                        it.

           Menzies SMILES.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Well why didn’t you say so before?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Because Cairncross knows something 
                        about me too. He knows that I’m a 
                        homosexual. And he threatened to 
                        tell everyone about me, if I told 
                        about him.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        All right, Professor. That’s all I 
                        needed to know. Thank you.

           Menzies starts to leave, quite pleased. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What are you doing?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        I have everything I need from this 
                        conversation, Alan. Thanks for your 
                        time.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        WHAT THE HELL?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Oh for God’s sake, are you having 
                        trouble following along? Of course 
                        Cairncross was the bloody spy. I’ve 
                        known Cairncross was a Soviet agent 
                        since before he got to Bletchley. 
                        Why do you think I had him placed 
                        here, Alan? You said yourself he 
                        was a piss-poor mathematician. 
                                 ALAN TURING
                        You placed a Soviet agent at 
                        Bletchley?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Well, yes. It’s quite useful to be 
                        able to leak whatever we like to 
                        Stalin. It started out with us 
                        feeding him false things, things we 
                        wanted Stalin to believe. But then, 
                        after awhile, we realized that 
                        leaking true things to Stalin could 
                        be just as useful. Things Churchill 
                        was too paranoid to disclose.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I can’t imagine why Churchill was 
                        so paranoid about his intelligence 
                        services.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Cairncross had no idea we knew, of 
                        course. Like you said, not the 
                        brightest bulb. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        And then you launched a fake hunt 
                        for the double-agent, even though 
                        you knew it was John the whole 
                        time. He would have expected a 
                        witch-hunt, so you gave him one.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        God, I wish you had been the Soviet 
                        agent, rather than Cairncross. 
                        You’re so much better at this than 
                        he is.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        So you arrested Joan to see if I 
                        knew. And if I did, to see what 
                        John had on me.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        I must admit, I’d been curious 
                        about what you were hiding for 
                        awhile. So now I know, and 
                        obviously, the same rules apply: 
                        You breathe a word of this to 
                        anyone, I have you arrested for 
                        being a homosexual, etcetera 
                        etcetera. Deal?
                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... Deal.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Wonderful. I’ll Ms. Clarke released 
                        right away.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        What do I do with her? Now?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Oh, right, your secret engagement! 
                        I always forget about that. Seems 
                        so silly, doesn’t it? Do what you 
                        like. It’s not my concern. But as 
                        your friend, I’ll tell you: You’re 
                        mine now. And you’re never getting 
                        out. So if you value her safety, 
                        and her precious “innocent” little 
                        conscious, I would keep her as far 
                        away from you as possible.

           And with that, Menzies leaves.

           INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - JOAN’S FLAT - DAY

           Alan and Joan sit in her flat.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        We can’t be engaged anymore, Joan.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        My parents... I’ll have to leave 
                        Bletchley.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You’ll work it out.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I have... Homosexual feelings.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alright.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        For men, Joan. Instead of women.
                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alright.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Do you understand? I’m sorry.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        So what?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I just said...

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Oh Alan, you have homosexual 
                        tendencies? So? I’ll bet so do half 
                        the blokes here, they’re just not 
                        honest with themselves about it. 

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I’ve acted on these tendencies. In 
                        the past. 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I know it wasn’t a real engagement, 
                        but we care for each other don’t 
                        we? I care for you. A lot.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        ... I’ve been having affairs. With 
                        other men. Here, and in America 
                        while I was there. I’ll never be 
                        true to you, Joan. And I can’t 
                        pretend any longer.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        After all this time, I mean so 
                        bloody little to you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I don’t care about you. I never 
                        did. I needed you to help me break 
                        Enigma, and now I’ve done that. 
                        Thank you.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        They were right. John. Hugh. Peter.

                        You wanted to see me, Sir?

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Master Turing. Sit down.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Is something the matter?

                                 HEADMASTER
                        You and Christopher Morcom are 
                        quite close.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        I wouldn’t say that.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        No?

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        We’re friendly.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Your mathematics professor says you 
                        two are positively inseparable.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        We’re the best students in the

                                 HEADMASTER
                        He caught you passing notes the 
                        other day.

                                 YOUNG ALAN 
                        Cryptography. To pass the time. The 
                        class is too simple.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        You and your friend solve math 
                        problems during math class because 
                        math class is too dull?

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        He’s not my friend.
                                 HEADMASTER
                        I’ve been told he’s your only

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Who said that?

                        Alan, I want you to trust me.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Of course.

                        Something has come up. About Mr.

                        Christopher is dead.

                        ... I don’t understand.

                        His mother sent word this morning. 
                        The family was on holiday, you see.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        I don’t understand.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        He had bovine tuberculosis, as I’m 
                        sure he told you. This mustn’t be a 
                        shock, but all the same, I’m sorry.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        You’re mistaken.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Did he not tell you? He’s been sick 
                        for a long time. Knew this was 
                        coming soon, but he had a stiff 
                        upper lip about it. Good lad.

           ON ALAN’S FACE: Christopher never told him.

                                 HEADMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Are you all right, Mr. Turing?
                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Yes. Of course. As I said, I didn’t 
                        know him well.

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Ah. Very well then.

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        May I leave, Headmaster?

                                 HEADMASTER
                        Of course. Oh, but Mr. Turing?

                                 YOUNG ALAN
                        Yes, Sir?

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: Alan, Joan, John, Hugh, and Peter all work 
           together decrypting messages. Moving pins on the big map.

                        The war dragged on for another two 
                        solitary years. Every day we stood 
                        there, pressed shoulder to shoulder 
                        as we performed our blood-soaked 
                        calculus. We held our secrets 
                        tight, from the world and from each 
                        other.

           From their demeanor, you’d never tell that Alan and Joan had 
           been engaged. Or that John was a spy, and Alan knew.

           They do their jobs politely and distantly, as if nothing ever 
           happened.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Joan barely spoke to me. Peter 
                        never did. John pretended that he 
                        liked me. Hugh was too tired to be 
                        mean.

           Alan makes improvements to Christopher. His machine.

                        Every day we decided who lived and 
                        who died. And every day we led the 
                        Allied armies to victory without 
                        anyone knowing. Stalingrad? The 
                        Ardennes? Normandy?  We were there. 
                        None of those victories would have 
                        been possible without the 
                        intelligence we produced.

                        tyranny. Armies of millions 
                        bleeding into the mud, fleets of 
                        ships that weighed down the oceans, 
                        packs of airplanes that dropped 
                        bombs until they blotted out the

                        That’s how the game works. I 
                        answered your questions. You know 
                        my story. That’s the point of the

                        something. Imitating something. 
                        Someone. And we are no more, and no 
                        less, than what we can convince 
                        other people that we are. So tell 
                        me: What am I? Am I a real person, 
                        like you? Or am I...

                        maximum sentence. Two years in 
                        prison.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Detective, I knew all of that from 
                        the moment you came into my house 
                        four days ago. I knew we’d end up 
                        here from the second I laid eyes on 
                        you.
                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Why didn’t you stop it?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Because none of this matters. 
                        Arrest me. Convict me. I have my 
                        work. I have Christopher.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Can we get someone to testify for 
                        you? Friends? Family? Anyone you’re 
                        close to?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - HUT 3 - NIGHT - 1945

           The cryptography team is assembled before Stewart Menzies.

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        On May 8th, the Allied governments 
                        saw fit to accept Germany’s 
                        unconditional surrender. 
                        Congratulations on a job 
                        exceedingly well done.

           Nobody looks like they want to celebrate much.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        What happens now? Back to the 
                        university for us? Back to real 
                        life?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Yes. You’ve only one thing left to 
                        do before your service to your 
                        government is concluded.

                                 JOHN CAIRNCROSS
                        What’s that?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        Burn everything.

                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        What?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        We told you when you started that 
                        this was a top secret program. Did 
                        you think we were kidding?
                                 HUGH ALEXANDER
                        But the war is over.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        This war is over. But there will be 
                        more. And we know how to break a 
                        code that everyone else thinks is 
                        unbreakable. Why would MI-6 let 
                        anyone else in on the secret?

                                 STEWART MENZIES
                        A step ahead as always, Alan. 
                        Alright. Tear it down, light it up, 
                        sweep away the ashes. None of you 
                        have ever met before. None of you 
                        have ever even heard the word 
                        Enigma. Have a safe trip home. 
                        Behave, and with a bit of luck none 
                        of you will ever see me — or one 
                        another — again in your lives.

           INT. JOAN’S HOUSE - 1951

           Joan sits at a formal Sunday tea with her HUSBAND, MOTHER-IN-
           LAW, and FATHER-IN-LAW.

                                 MOTHER-IN-LAW
                        Well the new house is just lovely.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Thank you. I think the room in the 
                        back will make a good home-office.

                                 FATHER-IN-LAW
                        Office?

                                 HUSBAND
                        Yes, Father. Joan likes to take her 
                        maths home, on the weekends.

                                 FATHER-IN-LAW
                        You intend to continue working, 
                        then?

                                 HUSBAND
                        Please.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Jim. It’s fine.

                        I like my work, and I’m going to 
                        continue with it. The government is 
                        always in need of good 
                        mathematicians, and I’m one of 
                        them. 

                                 MOTHER-IN-LAW
                        It’s just that the light back 
                        there, it’d be a shame to waste it 
                        on some dusty old books.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’d prefer I turn it into a 
                        greenhouse, then?

                                 HUSBAND
                        More tea, anyone?

           Joan’s Husband pours tea for the group, and deposits 
           NEWSPAPERS on a coffee table.

           Something on one of the newspapers catches Joan’s eye...

           ... She picks it up, stunned.

           ON THE NEWSPAPER: “CAMBRIDGE PROFESSOR SENTENCED FOR 
           INDECENCY”

           Joan shivers. Drops her tea cup.

                                 HUSBAND (CONT’D)
                        Joan?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        ... Excuse me.

           She races out of the room without a word of explanation.

           INT. ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - DAY - 1951

           Joan enters Alan’s house to find him hunched over his 
           machine.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You never wrote.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Did you have a pleasant trip to 
                        Manchester?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You never called.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        The trains have been a mess of 
                        late.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I had to find out in the papers.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Cup of tea?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Bloody stop it, Alan. I would have 
                        come. I would have testified.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        And what would you have told them? 
                        That I wasn’t a homosexual?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I would have said anything you 
                        wanted me to say. Anything that 
                        would have stopped this from 
                        happening.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        How would your husband have felt 
                        about that?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Jim would understand.

           Alan twitches. His hands shake as he tries to focus on the 
           machine.

                                 JOAN CLARKE (CONT’D)
                        Are you all right? What’s 
                        happening? What’s wrong?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I have chamomile. Earl grey.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re twitching.

                                 ALAN TURING
                             (twitching)
                        No I’m not.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Alan, tell me what’s going on this 
                        very second so I can help you.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        It’s probably just the injections.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Injections?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        I have to go in for weekly estrogen 
                        injections. At the hospital. 
                        There’s a lovely young nurse who 
                        administers them.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        What are they doing to you?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        They gave me a choice. Two years in 
                        prison. Or chemical castration.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Oh my god.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Of course I chose the castration. 
                        It was an easy decision.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Oh my god, Alan, oh my god, you 
                        chose chemical castration over 
                        prison so you could work on your 
                        machine.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Well I couldn’t build him from 
                        jail, now could I?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        Oh my god. All right. This is what 
                        we’re going to do. I’m going with 
                        you to the hospital. I’m going to 
                        speak to your doctors. We’re going 
                        to figure out a way out of this.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        You seem awfully concerned for my 
                        well-being now that there isn’t a 
                        Nazi code to break.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        That’s not fair.
                                 ALAN TURING
                        What precisely would constitute 
                        “fair” at this point? A St Steven’s 
                        day parade? My own Channel Island?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re still the misunderstood 
                        genius then? This is the part you 
                        still want to play?

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Misunderstood? Christopher grows 
                        smarter and smarter by the minute. 
                        I’m not naive. I know that he’s a 
                        machine. I know that he’s not a 
                        person. But that didn’t make him 
                        any less real. Because I understand 
                        Christopher. And he understands me. 
                        When people — like you — when 
                        people say that machines can’t 
                        think, don’t they really mean that 
                        we can’t understand how machines 
                        think? Don’t they really just mean 
                        that people only understand other 
                        people? And only machines can 
                        understand machines?

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re a human being, Alan. You’re 
                        allowed to live like one.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        Funny. It was my impression that 
                        both you and Her Majesty’s 
                        government felt otherwise.

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        You’re angry. Very well. Take your 
                        anger out on me if it helps. But I 
                        didn’t do this to you.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        No one “did this.” 

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        I don’t want you to be alone.

                                 ALAN TURING
                        But that’s the whole point. I never 
                        have been.

           He looks lovingly at Christopher.
                                 ALAN TURING (CONT’D)
                        What are you offering me right now? 
                        Forgiveness? Pity? Bullshit. You 
                        can keep your privileged sympathy. 
                        You want my regrets, don’t you? You 
                        want me to say that I’m sorry, and 
                        you want to absolve me with your 
                        easy tears. Well how about this: I 
                        have no regrets. Do you like the 
                        dress you’re wearing? Do you like 
                        your life? Your caring family, your 
                        challenging career, your sleepy 
                        Sunday coffee? They’re mine. I gave 
                        them to you. And I would do it all 
                        again. So don’t tell me you’re 
                        sorry. Tell me, “thank you.”

                                 JOAN CLARKE
                        And you saved a million lives, you 
                        miserable bastard. The world needs 
                        people like you, Alan. But dear god 
                        do I never want to be you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ALAN TURING’S HOUSE - DAY - 1954

           A familiar scene: A HALF-DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS swarm the 
           Manchester home of (former) mathematics professor Alan 
           Turing.

           Detective Nock passes the double-parked police cars and 
           ascends the front steps of Alan’s house. 

           Remembers the first time he was here.

           INT. ALAN TURING’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Hello?

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Detective. Morning.

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        What’s this, then?

                                 CONSTABLE
                        Suicide, pretty clean. Upstairs.
           The Constable leads Detective Nock upstairs into Alan’s 
           bedroom.

           ON THE BED: Alan Turing is dead.

                                 CONSTABLE (CONT’D)
                        Half-eaten apple next to the bed. 
                        Some sort of white powder all over 
                        it. 

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        Cyanide.

                                 CONSTABLE
                        How can you be sure?

                                 DETECTIVE NOCK
                        You’ll find a tub of it downstairs.

                                 CONSTABLE
                        How do you know that?

           Detective Nock approaches the bed, and stares into the 
           lifeless face of Alan Turing.

           Even Nock couldn’t describe what he’s feeling right now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY - 1927

           Young Alan stands before the grave of his only friend. The 
           stone reads “CHRISTOPHER MORCOM.”

           Wipes his tears. Girds himself up. He will never cry again in 
           his life.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLETCHLEY PARK - NIGHT - 1945

           Alan and the team BUILD A BONFIRE in the center of the Park.

           Every document, every slip of scratch paper, every piece of 
           evidence that they were ever there is BURNT UP IN THE MASSIVE 
           BONFIRE.

           TITLE: Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954.
           TITLE: His machine was never perfected, though it     
           generated a whole field of research into what became 
           nicknamed “Turing Machines.” Today, we call them “computers.”

           The smoke from the fire rises to the stars.

           TITLE: In 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown officially 
           apologized on behalf of the British government for Turing's 
           treatment. “We're sorry,” concluded the Prime Minister's 
           statement. “You deserved so much better.”

           TITLE: The logo of Apple Computer - an apple with a bite 
           taken out of it - has long been rumored to be a silent 
           tribute to Alan Turing. These rumors have never been 
           confirmed.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.)
                        Well then.

           ON ALAN’S FACE: He watches the flames.

                                 ALAN TURING (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Any questions?

                                                                 BLACK.
