                                 Jonathan W. Stokes

          AGENCY: UTA

          MANAGEMENT: ENERGY
           EXT. THE SUN– DAWN

           A blazing inferno of sunspots and fiery tornadoes.  The 
           burning star slashes the horizon of the world with red and 
           golden daggers of light.

           EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAINS – PAKISTAN - DAWN

           Grey dawn breaks in the borderlands.  Barren bluffs and rocky 
           tundra mark the lawless mountain country between Pakistan and 
           Afghanistan.

           It looks like hell after the fire’s gone out.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN BASIN - SAME

           A militant encampment supports a network of caves tucked into 
           the saddle of two peaks.  BEARDED TRIBESMEN slumber on 
           sleeping mats, their cooking fires burnt down to embers.

           Crude earthworks shelter off missile attacks.  The palisades 
           bristle with command posts, checkpoints, and machine gun 
           nests.

           EXT. ROCKY OUTCROPPING - SAME

           CHARLIE COLCORD, 75th Ranger Regiment, 1st Battalion, US Army 
           lies belly-to-rock overlooking the pass.  Colcord has the 
           calloused, sunburnt look of a farm boy.

           His right hand grips his trigger guard and his right eye 
           scopes a worn path between two boulders, leading down to the 
           encampment.

           Colcord’s M21 sniper rifle is painted desert multi-cam.  On 
           his belly in the rocky scree the young soldier is but a 
           shadow in the shifting sands.

           EXT. RIDGE - SAME

           U.S. SPECIAL FORCES surround the encampment.  They crouch 
           alongside AFGHAN ALLIANCE SOLDIERS who wear frayed, baggy 
           shalwar and scratch at their tangled, gnarled beards.

           Charlie Colcord watches with heightened senses.  A COMBAT 
           CONTROLLER whispers into his radio.
                                 COMBAT CONTROLLER
                        Virgil, Eagle.  Coordinates are 
                        north 3465472, east 0720347, 
                        elevation 11,369 feet.

           The Combat Controller turns to his SPECIAL FORCES SPOTTER 
           with a thumbs up.

                                 SPECIAL FORCES SPOTTER
                        Bombers in two minutes.

                                 COMBAT CONTROLLER
                        Light her up.

           The SF Spotter turns on a LASER DESIGNATOR, TARGETING THE 
           AMMO DEPOT below.  Afghan Alliance soldiers sit tensely, 
           gripping their Soviet-era machine guns.

           EXT. ROCKY OUTCROPPING - SAME

           Charlie Colcord’s SERGEANT MAJOR crawls into position next to 
           him.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Intel says Mahmoud Ahman al-Wahiri 
                        is in that nest.

           Charlie turns white and his voice catches in his throat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s at the top of our list.

           At 10,000 feet of elevation, Colcord’s heart beats double and 
           his breath comes in fast and quick.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Son, do you know what a BLU-82 is? 

           Charlie shakes his head.

                                 SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        15,000 pounds of bad news.  It’s 
                        what the US Army drops on guys who 
                        blow up embassies.

           The Sergeant cocks a finger toward the ancient footpath 
           wending its way between boulders and out of the encampment.

                                 SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        In two minutes flat militants are 
                        gonna come running out here madder 
                        than a box of frogs.
           Colcord scopes the pass and marks the wind direction.

                                 SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        Now you’re about the best natural 
                        shooter I’ve laid eyes on and I’m a 
                        gawddamn US Ranger sayin that.  You 
                        just breath easy and pick ‘em off 
                        as they come.

                                 COLCORD
                        Any rules of engagement?

                                 SERGEANT
                        Kill anything that moves.  Unless 
                        it's Mahmoud Ahman Al-Wahiri.  
                        Intelligence needs him alive.  
                        Could save a lot of lives.

                                 COLCORD
                        Yessir.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Any questions?

                                 COLCORD
                        When everybody comes out shooting, 
                        how do we know who's Al-Wahiri?

                                 SERGEANT
                        You got a inklin it might could be 
                        Al-Wahiri, shoot 'em below the 
                        knees.  E'ry body else - shoot 
                        above.

           Colcord nods.

                                 SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        And don’t sit here and reason with 
                        ‘em.  Those boys’ll stomp shit 
                        outta you an then smear it on your 
                        face.

                                 COLCORD
                        Yessir.

           The Sergeant Major is about to move off down the line of men.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Sergeant, this feel right to you?

                                 SERGEANT
                        How’s it supposed to feel?
           Colcord examines the basin.  It rises up behind them and 
           funnels their troops down below.

                                 COLCORD
                        I just feel like a rabbit hoppin 
                        into the stew pot.

           The Sergeant studies the kid, seeing if he’s got jitters.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Private, what is the Ranger Creed?

                                 COLCORD
                             (rattling it off)
                        I will always endeavor to uphold 
                        the prestige, honor, and high 
                        esprit de corps of the Rangers.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Whatever comes up out that hole, 
                        don’t run, you’ll just die tired.

                                 COLCORD
                        Yessir.

           The Sergeant claps Colcord on the back hard enough to jostle 
           the scope.  The Sergeant moves on down the line.

           EXT. RIDGE - SAME

           The Afghan Alliance Fighters eye each other nervously, 
           breathing on their gun hands to warm their trigger fingers.  

           The Combat Controller sticks one index finger in his ear, 
           listening to radio chatter from the B-1 Bomber.

                                 COMBAT CONTROLLER
                        T-minus one minute.

           The SF Spotter turns to the US Army Rangers camouflaged about 
           the ridge.

                                 SPECIAL FORCES SPOTTER
                        We’re dropping a daisy cutter.  
                        Keep your mouth open or the 
                        concussion will blow out your ear 
                        drums.

           Charlie Colcord nods and opens his mouth.  He turns to the 
           Afghan Alliance fighters embedded on his flank.
                                 COLCORD [IN BROKEN PASHTO]
                        Fatala ant fam aw fawada ant 
                        dimagh.

           The Afghans pop their mouths open as well.

           All the soldiers sit there waiting, mouths open.

                                 COMBAT CONTROLLER
                        Thirty seconds.

           EXT. BASIN - SAME

           AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE BREAKS OUT IN THE BASIN.

           High in the mountains the GUN POPS sound hollow like wood 
           blocks.

           EXT. RIDGE - SAME

           All U.S. soldiers look east to the basin.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Who’s shooting?

           Charlie Colcord shifts his scope around the rock face but 
           can’t get an angle on the basin.

           The SF Spotter crawls to the ridge on his belly to sight the 
           battleground below.

                                 SPECIAL FORCES SPOTTER
                        It’s Alpha Team in the basin.  
                        They’re getting ambushed!

                                 SERGEANT
                        Bullshit!  How’re they getting 
                        ambushed on top a mountain!

           Colcord scrambles to his feet.

                                 COLCORD
                        We gotta back ’em up!

                                 SERGEANT
                        Get back in position!  You hold 
                        this pass!

                                 COLCORD
                        Yessir.

           The SF Spotter peers out over the palisade.
                                 SPECIAL FORCES SPOTTER
                        It’s the Afghans!  They’re firing 
                        on our men!

                                 COMBAT CONTROLLER
                        What Afghans?

           Charlie Colcord looks to the Afghan Alliance fighters dug in 
           next to the Rangers.  Just in time to see --

           EXT. RIDGE - AFGHAN ALLIANCE FIGHTERS

           -- turn their soviet-era guns on the Special Forces and OPEN 
           FIRE.

                                 SERGEANT
                        It’s a trap!

           THE SF SPOTTER

           takes AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE TO THE CHEST, his body gyrating.

           THE COMBAT CONTROLLER

           brings his Glock up quick, but not quick enough.  Machine Gun 
           fire SPRAYS ACROSS HIS CHEST AND FACE.

           THE SERGEANT MAJOR

           turns his M4 on Alliance Fighters even as his shoulder and 
           chest are TORN APART BY BULLETS.

           ALLIANCE FIGHTERS

           are RATTLED WITH RETURN FIRE.  And in that moment --

           EXT. SKY - THE DAISY CUTTER

           -- the largest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal splits the 
           heavens, detonating 38 inches above the ground, opening a 250 
           FOOT CRATER IN THE MOUNTAIN.

           The world turns red, then black, a MUSHROOM CLOUD of fire and 
           dust blocking out the sun.

           A SHOCK WAVE OF HEAT sucks the oxygen out of the mountain 
           pass, incinerating all things living or dead.
           EXT. ROCKY OUTCROPPING - CHARLIE COLCORD

           his world silent for a few beats as he clutches his head, his 
           ears ringing from the bomb’s concussion.  SOUNDS slowly fade 
           in.

           GUNS AND SCREAMING whisper from the darkness.  Colcord is in 
           a world of BLACK CLOUDS - he cannot see the ground.

           COLCORD’S POV

           his hearing coming in and out.  The new landscape of the 
           world emerges out of smoke.  Everyone is dead or dying 
           horrifically.

           COLCORD

           starts to get up and then sits back down to hold his 
           position.  More SCREAMS AND GUNFIRE emerge from the dark hole 
           of hellfire.

           And then, out of the black smoke, a dark figure appears in 
           the pass...

           ...MAHMOUD AHMAN AL-WAHIRI.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - AL-WAHIRI

           The Pashtun warlord scans the high country, his fiery eyes 
           alert for any sign of life.  He does not see Colcord 
           flattened against the rocks.

           COLCORD’S POV

           his grip trembling with the fierce warrior cross-haired in 
           his sites.

           AL-WAHIRI

           his head crowned in a black turban ringed with sweat salt and 
           mountain dust.  A Kameez tunic fans out to his thighs; a rust 
           brown vest and tan dupatta scarf drape his shoulders.

           Al-Wahiri is a vision of the 7th century.

           COLCORD

           centers his cross hairs on al-Wahiri’s chest.  He lets his 
           air out slowly, dropping his heart rate to steady his aim.

           AL-WAHIRI
           sits his horse.  Ammunition belts drape the muzzle brake of 
           his wooden-stocked AK-47, the black magazine curved forward 
           like a boar's tusk.

           The warrior rides a Pakistani bay.  A Baluchi with fine legs 
           and ears curved back so they touch at the poll.

           COLCORD

           squints into his scope and grimaces.

                                 COLCORD
                             (under his breath)
                        ...I will always endeavor to uphold 
                        the prestige, honor, and high 
                        esprit de corps of the Rangers.

           The boy drops his sights to al-Wahiri’s gun and TAKES THE 
           SHOT.

           AL-WAHIRI’S AK-47

           flips through the air end-over-end fully twenty-five feet 
           before CLATTERING IN THE DIRT.  The skittish mare takes four 
           uncertain steps backward.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - COLCORD

           steps into view, the veins standing out in his neck as he 
           levels his rifle at Al-Wahiri.

                                 COLCORD
                        Put up your hands!  Put them where 
                        I can see them!  UdRegee ganey 
                        dazey ba daRbandey okRam!

           Colcord circles the warrior, blinking his reddened eyes 
           against the billowing clouds of smoke.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are not going to shoot me.

                                 COLCORD
                        The hell I aint!

           Al-Wahiri speaks in clipped, accented English.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        If you were going to shoot me, you 
                        would already have done so.

           Al-Wahiri steps down off his mare.  Colcord shrieks with the 
           uncontrolled rage of combat.
                                 COLCORD
                        Get down on your knees!  Zamoong 
                        hokam oomana!

           AL-WAHIRI

           ignores the boy and moves to retrieve his Kalashnikov.

           COLCORD

           circles, pressing the rifle barrel into Al-Wahiri’s chest.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        I said stop!  Get on the ground!

           The proud warrior looks at Colcord with disdain.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You have never killed a man before.  
                        I can see it in your eyes.

           AL-WAHIRI

           pushes past the young soldier and strides toward his AK-47 
           lying in the dust.

           COLCORD

           levels his gun sights on al-Wahiri’s back.  He does not have 
           orders to kill the man, but he can shoot him in the leg.  
           Colcord grits his teeth and

           NO-SCOPES AL-WAHIRI IN THE RIGHT CALF. 

           AL-WAHIRI’S LEG

           sweeps out from under him - the fighter CRASHING TO THE 
           GROUND on his back.  The Pashtun clutches his wounded calf 
           muscle.

           The warrior does not scream.  HE HISSES LIKE A COYOTE IN A 
           TRAP.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - COLCORD

           shoulders the rifle and catches the Baluchi by the hackamore.  
           He stands up in the stirrup and swings a leg over.

           Colcord SPURS THE BAY and rides her around in a circle, 
           searching for an exit from the mountain pass.

           PASHTUN FIGHTERS
           close in.  They are invisible in the billowing smoke of the 
           basin.  But the warlike  “lilili” of their falsetto 
           zaghareets pierce the ROAR OF THE FLAMES.

           COLCORD

           turns the bay back, stomping and snorting.  Colcord’s 
           commanders lie dead on the ground, some with skin burnt off 
           their faces.

                                 COLCORD
                        God almighty.  Good God almighty.

           AL-WAHIRI

           struggles in the dirt.  The warrior crawls for his gun.

           COLCORD

           jumps down from the bay, sets his rifle on the ground, and 
           grabs a catch rope off the horse.

           He ties a honda in one hand and pays the slack through to 
           form a lariat.  Charlie rummages a piggin string from the 
           mochila and sets that in his teeth.

           AL-WAHIRI

           reaches a hand for his gun.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - COLCORD

           gets his catch rope spinning and lassos al-Wahiri around the 
           neck, JERKING IT UP TAUT.  The Mujahideen rolls onto his 
           side, clutching the noose with clawed fingers.

           Colcord jumps on al-Wahiri’s back, pulling up the Pashtun’s 
           arms and tying him down like a heifer.

           The two fighters WRESTLE IN THE DUST.

           COLCORD CALF-ROPES THE PASHTUN, bundling wrists to ankle with 
           the piggin string held in his teeth.  He squats over the 
           Mujahideen backward and half hitches the catch rope around al-
           Wahiri's feet and wrists.

           EXT. BASIN - CIRCLING PASHTUN FIGHTERS

           grow louder in the cliffs below.  Their SHOOTING AND SHOUTING 
           close in from all sides.
           EXT. ROCKY PASS - AL-WAHIRI

           struggles in the dirt, his neck growing red about the noose.

                                 COLCORD
                        Quit pulling it you dumb shit, 
                        you'll strangle yourself.

           Al-Wahiri pulls his leg forward, tightening the lariat, his 
           face bulging grotesquely.  Charlie realizes al-Wahiri is very 
           deliberately trying to kill himself.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Sumbitch.

           EXT. BASIN - PASHTUN FIGHTERS

           rally in the encampment below, firing submachine guns into 
           the mummified bodies of burnt Americans.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - COLCORD

           grabs his M21 in both fists and BASHES AL-WAHIRI in the crown 
           of the head, stunning him still.  Colcord grabs the Jambiya 
           from al-Wahiri’s scabbard and SLASHES THE CATCH ROPE.

           The Pashtun’s feet collapse on the ground and AIR RETURNS TO 
           THE FIGHTER’S LUNGS.  Colcord tosses the dagger aside and 
           DRAGS THE WARRIOR THROUGH THE DUST by the piggin string.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - THE BALUCHI MARE

           stomps and rolls her eyes in the smoke and echoing gunfire.  

           Colcord dallies the catch rope around the saddle horn, 
           looping the slack around the pommel.

           AL-WAHIRI

           blinks his eyes, clearing his head.  He begins shouting in 
           Pashto.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Elif air ab tizak!  Elif air ab 
                        denikh!

                                 COLCORD
                        Save it for someone who gives a 
                        damn.
           EXT. ROCKY PASS - COLCORD

           pulls al-Wahiri up by his collar and plugs the man’s nose.  
           The Pashtun’s mouth shoots open.  Colcord stuffs it with the 
           balled up end of al-Wahiri’s chadar.  He wraps the slack of 
           the shawl around al-Wahiri’s head, GAGGING HIM TIGHT.

           The warrior lies on the rock face, BOUND AND GAGGED.

           Colcord walks around in a circle.  Even in the cold mountain 
           air he is covered in sweat.

                                 COLCORD
                        Holy shit.  Holy sonuva shit.

           The SF Spotter’s satellite phone rests clutched in the dead 
           man’s hands.  Colcord snatches it up.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Virgil, eagle!  Virgil, eagle 
                        respond...

           COLCORD

           feels mangled plastic in his palm and turns the phone over.  
           The battery is shot clean out of it.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - PASHTUN FIGHTERS

           crest the ridge, FIRING AUTOMATICS in all directions.

           EXT. ROCKY PASS - COLCORD

           lifts al-Wahiri over his shoulder in a fireman’s hold and 
           tosses him over the horse’s withers.  The frightened horse 
           stamps and rolls its eyes, ears flattened.

           Colcord gets one hand on the hackamore and pats the mare on 
           her neck.

                                 COLCORD
                        You aint never heard American 
                        before, have you?

           The horse stomps and blows.  Colcord pets the horse on its 
           muzzle, talking her down in Pashto.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Salam, Hisan. Jamila shaabba. 
                        Sakin, sakin.

           COLCORD
           bites the catch rope in his jaws.  One hand on the pommel and 
           one hand on his rifle he catches a foot in the stirrup and 
           swings onto the bay with the horse ALREADY ON THE GO.

           The young soldier jerks the hackamore and digs in his heels.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Yalla!  Yalla!

           BULLETS CROWD THE AIR like Texas mosquitos as Colcord cantors 
           the horse down the near-vertical slope and ESCAPES BEHIND AN 
           EMBANKMENT.

           Tribesmen shake their guns in the air and PUT HEEL TO FLANK.  
           ONE DOZEN HORSEMEN CHARGE FOR THE EMBANKMENT.

           Charlie Colcord GALLOPS DOWN A SWITCHBACK with Mahmoud Ahman 
           al-Wahiri hog-tied and draped across the horse like a saddle 
           blanket, bouncing every step of the way.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN SLOPES - SAME

           Colcord SPRINTS THE MARE directly downhill at a 45 degree 
           angle, dodging scrub pine and gooseberry.  The Baluchi 
           gallops for her life, desperate to keep from somersaulting 
           forward.

           Needled pine boughs and mulberry branches WHIP THE YOUNG 
           SOLDIER’S FACE.  He grips the scruff of al-Wahiri’s shirt 
           with his left hand and sticks his rifle arm straight out for 
           balance like he’s riding a rodeo bull.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPES - PASHTUN FIGHTERS

           crest the ridge like water breeching a waterfall.  The 
           SCREAMING TRIBESMEN gallop their horses after the boy, FIRING 
           THEIR AUTOMATICS.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPES - COLCORD

           flattens himself closer to the Baluchi’s neck with each SALVO 
           OF GUNFIRE.  The mare is wall-eyed and breathing hard.

                                 COLCORD
                        We on the wrong side of the 
                        mountain, girl.  You’re taking me 
                        into Pakistan.  These are tribal 
                        territories.  Can’t nobody rescue 
                        us in here!
           The Baluchi don’t pay him no never mind.  Colcord ducks 
           LASHING PINE BRANCHES and leans the galloping mare out over 
           rocky bluffs and down into a combe.

           STACCATO BULLETS punctuate the beating of the horse’s hoofs.  
           Colcord crouches low over the Baluchi’s back and they VANISH 
           BEHIND A DRAW.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROCKY BLUFF - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheltered by towering spires of rocky crags, Colcord reins 
           the lathered bay.  Al-Wahiri slides to the ground, crumpling 
           in the dust.

           Colcord leaps off the horse, GRABBING BOTH SIDES OF THE 
           PASHTUN’S GAG IN HIS FISTS.

                                 COLCORD
                        You even think about hollerin 
                        you’ll wish you been ate by a bear 
                        and crapped off a cliff.  You hear 
                        me?

           The fire-eyed mujahideen nods.  Charlie RIPS OFF THE GAG.

           Al-Wahiri spits, coughs, and spits some more.  The Mujahideen 
           fires off a string of Pashtun cusses.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Yebnen kelp!  Elif air ab tizak!  
                        Elif air ab denikh!  Waj ab zidik!
                        Ebn el matnakah!

           Charlie SLAPS HIM, and the warrior quiets down.

                                 COLCORD
                        That’s alright.  I’d be pissed off, 
                        too.

           Charlie unclips the canteen from his belt and takes a swig, 
           surveying the high country before them.  Tall pine and 
           spindly deodar reach all the way to the rocky timberline 
           before giving way to snow caps disappearing into fog.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are the son of a goat and the 
                        brother of a pig.  A curse on your 
                        religion.  A curse on the religion 
                        of your family.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT'D)
                        A curse on your children and the 
                        cousins of your children.  A curse 
                        on your father and grandfather!

           Al-Wahiri runs out of wind and gasps for breath.

                                 COLCORD
                        You could just charm the dew right 
                        off a honey suckle.

           Al-Wahiri spits and coughs some more.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Why did you shoot me in the leg?

                                 COLCORD
                        Trying to save you the trouble a 
                        gettin shot in the head.

           Pashtun gunmen fan out in the plains below, a dust cloud 
           kicking up behind their black Marwari horses.

           Charlie wipes the lid of his canteen on his shirt cuff and 
           holds it out to the Pashtun.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Drink it.

           The warrior refuses with a jerk of his head.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You want to do me a favor?  You 
                        should kill me.

                                 COLCORD
                        That a fact.

           The young soldier rolls up the blood-stained leg of the 
           Pashtun’s baggy shalwar. The 7.62 bullet’s shot clean through 
           the calf.  Blood is seepin out thick and dark like sap from a 
           maple tree.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Kill me.

           Charlie strips off his nylon web belt and wraps it around al-
           Wahiri’s leg twice, cinching it tight around the saphenous 
           veins.

           Al-Wahiri bucks and kicks.  Charlie sits on the warrior’s 
           foot and holds on tight.

                                 COLCORD
                        Like tying a bowtie on a alligator.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        The faithful are not afraid to die.

                                 COLCORD
                        Bullshit.

           Al-Wahiri’s eyes burn white hot like a farrier's iron.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Untie me and fight me like a man.

                                 COLCORD
                        Seems we already done that.

           Colcord sheds his army combat shirt, doubling it up and 
           knotting it around the Mujahideen’s wound.

           Al-Wahiri angrily spits out his words.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                             (in a rage)
                        You deny me my death in battle, you 
                        dishonor me.

           The warrior gnashes his teeth in frustration.

                                 COLCORD
                        If dying's what you really want, 
                        seems a purdy good reason to keep 
                        you living.

           Charlie tightens a surgeon’s knot around the fighter’s calf.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Get up.

           The Pashtun’s eyes smolder like hot coals.  He quotes the 
           holy book.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Those who kill and are killed in 
                        Allah's name, their return is the 
                        garden of paradise.

           Colcord moves to the Baluchi and watches the rising dust 
           cloud of the riders on the plain.

           The mare knickers, blinking its long, lazy eye lashes as 
           Colcord pets her neck, calming her down.

                                 COLCORD
                        You a smart old horse.  You been 
                        puffin up your belly when they 
                        cinch your girth.
           Colcord cinches the latigo up a billet hole and tests the 
           saddle with the heel of his palm.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                             (pretty girl)
                        Jamila shaabba.

           The young soldier gets one boot in the iron and swings the 
           other leg over the saddle.  He wraps the catch rope around 
           the pommel pays out slack to al-Wahiri.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Ud-Regee!  Waqafa!  Stop!

                                 COLCORD
                        Hyah!

           Colcord kicks the horse off at a trot.  Al-Wahiri stumbles 
           forward, yanked by the rope around his wrists, jogging to 
           keep from falling.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        May God destroy your house and the 
                        house of those that gave birth to 
                        you!  A curse on your mother’s 
                        father!  A curse on your father’s 
                        father!  A curse on your cousins 
                        and uncles!

           Al-Wahiri descends into Pashto, cursing to raise the dead.  
           The young soldier guides the bay down the switchbacks and 
           into the canyon.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CANYONS – DAY

           Gorges steep into flat-walled ravines.  The bay picks its way 
           down a narrow passage with jagged edges.  Limestone walls 
           drip with runoff, ferns clinging to razor-thin crevices.

           Colcord shields his eyes from the sun to mark the Pashtun 
           horsemen.  They’re not but a half-mile off now.

                                 COLCORD
                        They’re moving faster than we are.

           On foot, Al-Wahiri is bent over double, sucking air.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                             (angrily)
                        They have horses.
                                 COLCORD
                        We’ll make that arroyo, directly.  
                        Be near about difficult for them to 
                        get a clean shot.

           Colcord spurs the Baluchi forward.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PLAINS - DAY

           Pashtun tribesmen sprint their black Marwaris across the 
           plain, AK-47’s lying flat across their pommels.

           The warriors show no signs of flagging.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ARROYO - DAY

           Colcord reins the Baluchi at a creek trickling through the 
           crag of a dry arroyo.  He sets his helmet in the creek to 
           stop up the water, fills his canteen, and offers it to the 
           Pashtun.

                                 COLCORD
                        Drink.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        No.

                                 COLCORD
                        Suit yourself.

           Charlie drinks deeply, wiping the salt from his forehead with 
           the back of his hand.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Set me free.  I will tell my 
                        countrymen to give you safe passage 
                        back to Afghanistan.  I swear on 
                        it.

           The young soldier’s forehead wrinkles up as he scans the lid 
           of the basin.  They’re as exposed as two eggs in a frying 
           pan.

                                 COLCORD
                        You as good as your word?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Yes.
                                 COLCORD
                        Then your word aint no good to me.

           Charlie lifts his helmet out of the cool creek to water the 
           horse.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Where are you taking me.

                                 COLCORD
                        Gonna bring you to trial.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Why not just kill me.

                                 COLCORD
                        I reckon you can't testify too good 
                        if yer dead.

           The Baluchi lifts its dripping muzzle and listens, one ear 
           forward, one ear back, to the distant gallop of approaching 
           riders.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        We won the battle.  Your countrymen 
                        are dead.

                                 COLCORD
                        Yeah.  My countrymen are dead.  But 
                        the mission idn’t.  I figure I got 
                        a duty to those men to see that you 
                        hang.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Why go to the trouble of parading 
                        me through your system?

                                 COLCORD
                        Cause that's the way we do things I 
                        guess.

           Colcord tosses his flack helmet into the scrub.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Barbarians.

                                 COLCORD
                        You can say this about my country.  
                        You may be the biggest scoundrel in 
                        the world but you’ll still get a 
                        army of lawyers lining up happy to 
                        take your part.
           Colcord unbuttons his multi-cam field jacket and lays it flat 
           on the ground.

           The boy shreds off the sleeves with his leatherman.  Then 
           slices the outseam, strips the jacket in half, and lays out a 
           straight piece of fabric six feet long. 

           Colcord doubles up the fabric and begins wrapping it around 
           his head.  He studies the Pashtun closely, fashioning the 
           cloth into a turban.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        A trial might delay it six months, 
                        but I'll still end up dead.  Why 
                        not just kill me now.

                                 COLCORD
                        Man.  You get a hold of a bone and 
                        you just keep chewin it.

           Al-Wahiri gets right in the soldier’s face, yellow teeth 
           bristling.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are a coward!  Why not just 
                        kill me now!

           Colcord snaps, his voice breaking.

                                 COLCORD
                        Cause killing you's too easy!  
                        Blowing up a embassy and women and 
                        kids!  There's a lotta families 
                        prolly wanna see that you suffer.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        And you, cowboy.  Do you want to 
                        see me suffer?

           The young soldier controls his rage.

                                 COLCORD
                        I reckon I aint got a lot of say in 
                        what happens to you.  But a lotta 
                        soldiers died to bring you in and I 
                        intend to see that job through.

           Colcord wraps the trailing end of his turban around his face 
           to block off the dust of the road.  At any distance, he now 
           looks more like a Pashtun.

           Al-Wahiri spits in the grey dust.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Some sand is clearly white, some 
                        sand is clearly black, but to the 
                        foreigner the desert is one color.

           Colcord sets a foot in the stirrup, mounts up, and kicks in 
           his heels.

                                 COLCORD
                        Yalla!

           The Baluchi sets off at a trot, al-Wahiri stumbling behind.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOOTHILLS – DAY

           Cackling finches and prattling mocking birds cavort high 
           above where blue pines raise their arms to salute the sky.

           Colcord sits the horse where the trees thin out and studies 
           the wide swath of the Kalaam valley, pierced by the white 
           jagged line of the Swat River.

           ENEMY HOOFBEATS approach in the distance.

                                 COLCORD
                        Well, Jamila.  We got to cross a 
                        half-mile of open ground to make 
                        that river.

           Colcord wipes the froth from the mare’s neck with his hand.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Horse like you, a half mile 
                        shouldn’t take but one minute.

           Colcord has al-Wahiri on the saddle in front of him.  He 
           LASHES THEIR BODIES TOGETHER with the slack of the catch 
           rope.

           BULLETS whistle through the trees as Colcord spurs the horse.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KALAAM VALLEY – DAY

           The young soldier leans over the mare at a DEAD SPRINT.  
           Millet grass and saffron fly beneath them in a blur of green 
           and yellow.
           DOZENS OF PASHTUNS sprout from the forest like a swarm of 
           bees.  A quarter mile distant, their GUNS CRACK a second 
           after their MUZZLES FLARE.

           The Baluchi’s sides heave like a blacksmith’s bellows.

                                 COLCORD
                        C’mon, girl!  Jamila shabba!

           Bullets whistle through the air, trailing LOW PRESSURE WAKES 
           fast enough to make Colcord’s ears pop.

           The earth bows toward the Swat River.  The Pashtuns 
           momentarily lose their angle on the Soldier, their BULLETS 
           CATCHING DIRT IN THE RIDGE.

           EXT. SWAT RIVER - DAY

           Colcord unravels the catch rope and dismounts the Baluchi, 
           taking al-Wahiri with him.

           GUNSHOTS POUND THE RIVER BANK.

           EXT. SWAT RIVER - COLCORD

           leads horse and captive through the mud to the river’s edge.

           AL-WAHIRI

           glares at the RAGING WHITE WATER of the Swat River.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Once we get in, how are we going to 
                        get out?

                                 COLCORD
                        One thing at a time!

           Colcord steps one all-terrain boot in the water and snatches 
           it back.  The river is melted snow off the mountains, NEAR 
           ABOUT FREEZING.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Almighty.

           EXT. SWAT RIVER - PASHTUN RIDERS

           crest the ridge.  BULLETS STRIKE THE WATER.

           COLCORD
           wades in with the catch rope, rifle over his head.  The 
           SURGING TIDE SUCKS HIM IN, taking al-Wahiri and the horse 
           after him.

           INT. SWAT RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Colcord struggles to keep his head above the surf.  His lungs 
           seize up from the cold - he fights panic.

           THE BALUCHI

           swims hard, the whites of its eyes showing terror.

           MORE BULLETS

           strike water, kicking up a spray.

           AL-WAHIRI

           seizes his moment.  Hands bound behind his back, he hooks his 
           left arm around Colcord’s neck.  He squeezes hard, CHOKING 
           OFF THE BOY’S AIR.

           COLCORD

           thrashes and kicks.

                                 COLCORD
                             (choking)
                        You idiot!  You kill me, we both 
                        drown!

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        This is why you can never defeat 
                        us!  You are too fond of living!

           COLCORD

           sucks water and GAGS.  He BEATS AL-WAHIRI WITH HIS RIFLE 
           BUTT, striking the Pashtun in the head.

           AL-WAHIRI

           sinks in the raging surf, arms tied behind him.

           COLCORD

           lunges for Al-Wahiri against the rush of white water.  He 
           LOSES HIS HOLD ON THE BALUCHI.
           INT. SWAT RIVER - UNDERWATER

           Colcord ducks under water and clutches the lead rope, 
           snatching it in a last DESPERATE, FLAILING GRASP.

           His body is SLAMMED AGAINST ROCKS, he’s taking in water.

           EXT. SWAT RIVER - COLCORD

           comes up at last - lungs burning, face streaming with 
           freezing water.

           He’s carried fast downstream.

           PASHTUN RIDERS

           silhouette the gorge, furiously keeping pace on horseback, 
           before gradually receding into the distance.

           COLCORD’S BOOTS

           strike ground on the opposite shore.  He hauls himself up, 
           clothes heavy with water, DRAGGING AL-WAHIRI to the shallows 
           with the last of his strength.

           EXT. BANKS OF THE SWAT RIVER - SAME

           Freezing water streams off the bay, her muzzle emitting a 
           cloud of steam with each breath.

           Colcord, gasping, collapses on shore.  Water drips from the 
           bore of his M21.  He squints up at al-Wahiri, silhouetted 
           against the white sky.

                                 COLCORD
                        Boy, you are nuttier ‘n squirrel 
                        crap.

           Mahmoud Ahman al-Wahiri stands tall, feet apart, dripping and 
           steaming.  Colcord sits, one elbow on the gravel, looking up 
           warily at the Pashtun and catching his breath.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Retie my turban.

                                 COLCORD
                        Go screw yourself.

           Colcord scans the horizon for riders but there are none.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                             (again)
                        Retie my turban.

           Colcord shivers violently.  He uses the blade of his hand to 
           skim water from his face and arms.  A light rain begins to 
           fall.

                                 COLCORD
                        Got other things on my mind 
                        presently.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Retie my turban.

           Colcord gets up and reties the warrior’s turban.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOOTHILLS – NIGHT

           Colcord looks out at the crackling lightning flashing on the 
           open grassland far below.  Al-Wahiri sits behind him on the 
           horse.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You will never make it back to 
                        Afghanistan.  They will track you.

           Colcord sits the horse and twists hisself around to consider 
           their backtrail across the brittle salt flats, cracks spread 
           out for miles in the tessellated pattern of a jigsaw puzzle.

                                 COLCORD
                        The hound ain't been born that can 
                        track us across a salt bed in a 
                        rainstorm.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You can not hide in this land.  It 
                        is written in Hadith, "the hour 
                        shall come, when the non-believers 
                        shall hide behind rocks and trees, 
                        and the rocks and trees shall 
                        betray them, calling out: There is 
                        a non-believer hiding behind me!  
                        Come and kill him!"

           Rainwater mats down Colcord’s hair, streaming down his face 
           like tears.  He rests the rifle on his thigh, muzzle angled 
           forward to keep out the rain.
                                 COLCORD
                        Tell you what.  You make them rocks 
                        and trees start talking and I'll 
                        convert right here on the spot.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CANYON SCREE - NIGHT

           Colcord has a fire going in a red slate dugout wind-worn into 
           the escarpment.  He hobbles the horse and loosens the latigo, 
           speaking gently in Pashtun.

                                 COLCORD
                        Salaam jamila, salaam...

           Al-Wahiri sits his back against the scarp, legs splayed out.  
           He’s bled through the combat shirt tourniqueting his leg.

           The young soldier squats down next to Pashtun and looks him 
           over.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        You been rode hard and put away 
                        wet.

           Al-Wahiri quotes the holy book.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Allah is with those who persevere.

           Colcord unscrews his canteen and offers him water.  The 
           warrior shakes his head.

                                 COLCORD
                        I aint risking life and limb, 
                        dragging you clear across a 
                        mountain range, just to see you die 
                        a thirst.

           Colcord sticks the canteen under al-Wahiri’s nose.

           But al-Wahiri refuses, turning his head.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Devil take you.

           Colcord straddles al-Wahiri, unwraps his own turban and 
           clamps it over al-Wahiri’s mouth and nose.  He splashes water 
           on the cloth, WATERBOARDING THE FIGHTER.  Al-Wahiri THRASHES 
           AND CHOKES.
           Colcord whips away the cloth and POURS WATER IN AL-WAHIRI’S 
           OPEN MOUTH.

           Al-Wahiri coughs and sputters but he drinks...

           And drinks...

           The warrior pants, catching his breath.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        The devil take you, too.

           Colcord unwraps al-Wahiri’s leg.  It is bruised and seeping.  
           The soldier grimaces.

                                 COLCORD
                        That bleeding ain’t stopped and 
                        you’re liable to gangrene.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You deny me my death, you deny me 
                        my place in heaven.

           Charlie takes his M21 and leans the stock in the fire ring, 
           letting the muzzle brake grow red hot on the stones.  Al-
           Wahiri eyes this warily.

                                 COLCORD
                        You think you’re going to heaven?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        In fair gardens the righteous shall 
                        dwell in bliss, rejoicing in what 
                        their Lord will give them. 
                        Reclining there upon soft couches, 
                        they shall feel neither the 
                        scorching heat nor the biting cold. 
                        Trees will spread their shade 
                        around them, and fruits will hang 
                        in clusters over them.

                                 COLCORD
                        Boy, you give a fifty cent answer 
                        for a nickel question.

           Al-Wahiri’s eyes are locked on the night sky, fierce and 
           fearless.  Charlie takes the rifle stock from the flames, the 
           muzzle GLOWING RED LIKE A BRANDING IRON.

           Charlie holds the Pashtun by the shoulder and PRESSES THE 
           STEEL RIFLE BARREL TO FLESH, holding it there steaming.

           Charlie wrinkles his nose against the smell of cauterized 
           meat.  Al-Wahiri does not utter a sound.
           Charlie tosses the rifle away and grabs his wet turban, 
           squeezing water onto the wound.  Washing out the dead flesh.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        The righteous will be among 
                        fountains of clear-flowing water. 
                        And they will sit with bashful, 
                        dark-eyed virgins, as fair as 
                        corals and rubies.

           Biting his lip, Charlie works quickly, wiping the wound clean 
           and dressing it.

                                 COLCORD
                        So if you die in combat, you go 
                        straight to heaven.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        That depends...
                             (clenching his teeth from 
                              pain)
                        ...On if I am fighting for the 
                        right side.

                                 COLCORD
                        How do you know which side is 
                        right?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Whichever side God is on.

           Tears stream down al-Wahiri’s face but he still has not 
           uttered one noise of complaint.

           Colcord wraps the shirt tight around al-Wahiri’s leg and sits 
           back on his heels and wipes the sweat out of his eyes.

           Then Colcord just sits there breathing until his hands stop 
           shaking.

                                 COLCORD
                        You got a hard bark on you.  I’ll 
                        give you that.

           Al-Wahiri breaths heavily.  His eyelids lower.  He watches 
           Colcord through narrow slits.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what.  If I close my eyes 
                        for a tick, you gonna kill me in my 
                        sleep?

           The warrior says nothing.
                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        That’s about what I figured.

           Charlie gets up, wiping his hands on his fatigues.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Where are you going?

                                 COLCORD
                        The horse don’t need but two hours 
                        sleep a night, neither should we.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. KALAAM VALLEY - NIGHT

           Charlie leads the horse by the hackamore.  Mahmoud Ahman al-
           Wahiri slumps in the saddle.  The rain clouds dissipate.

           Stars are sprayed across the sky like buckshot.  They spin 
           around Polaris until rosy-fingered dawn glows red in the 
           east.

           And Charlie and Mahmoud enter the badlands.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROCKY PROMONTORY - DAY

           The horse crops crab grass on the sparse edge of a hillock.  
           Colcord lies flat on his belly on a limestone saddle 
           overlooking the Swat Valley.

           Al-Wahiri crouches beside him staring bleakly at the forlorn 
           world.

                                 COLCORD
                        All we got to do is get you through 
                        to Jalalabad.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are out of your mind.

                                 COLCORD
                        I’d love to leave you here dead but 
                        then I’d lose the satisfaction of 
                        seeing you hang.

           Charlie chews on a sprig of millet and squints through his 
           sniper scope at a range of hills to the south.  The Hills of 
           Tatara.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are thinking we follow the Silk 
                        Road and take the Khyber Pass 
                        through the mountains to 
                        Afghanistan.  This will not work.  
                        Is an awful idea.

           Charlie slowly looks up from the sniper scope.

                                 COLCORD
                        Boy, you could start a argument in 
                        a empty house.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Anyone with the sense of a goose 
                        will tell you, you must head North 
                        into the Safed Koh.

           The young soldier spits millet seed out the side of his mouth 
           and rubs his tired eyes.

                                 COLCORD
                        I aint ask your opinion on the 
                        matter.  We make Landi Kotal at the 
                        Khyber Pass and the silk road drops 
                        us down into Jalalabad.  There’s a 
                        army post there and then I wash my 
                        hands of you.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                             (scoffing)
                        South is death.  Landi Kotal is a 
                        smuggler’s town.  A child like you 
                        who barely shaves a beard?  You 
                        will not make it through alive.

                                 COLCORD
                        That should suit your purposes just 
                        fine.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        If you would like my advice - 

           Colcord snaps.

                                 COLCORD
                        - I heard you kidnapped them 
                        journalists that got their necks 
                        slit.  I heard you blew up a police 
                        barracks in Kandahar - killed 70 
                        new recruits!  I don’t take advice 
                        from murderers!
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        And you, Cowboy?  Have you never 
                        committed violence?  If you are a 
                        pacifist - why don’t you let me go!

           Colcord creeps backward off the edge of the hillock, shaking 
           his head.  He quotes from scripture.

                                 COLCORD
                        A hot-tempered man stirs up 
                        dissension, but a patient man calms 
                        a quarrel.

           Colcord pats the dust from his fatigues and moves to fetch 
           the Baluchi.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PASTURE LAND - DAY

           The mare cuts a path through unclaimed pastures, Colcord 
           surveying the strange new landscape.

           The fields are dotted with the black and grey tents of 
           NOMADS. Camels graze the sparse vegetation. BAREFOOT CHILDREN 
           tend scrawny flocks of sheep and goats.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CIENEGA - DAY

           Charlie waters the horse in a natural spring.

           SMILING WOMEN AND GIRLS beat laundry against the rocks 
           downstream.  They are nomadic tribeswomen with maroon shawls 
           draped across their shoulders.

           Charlie watches them.  Mahmoud watches the soldier watching 
           them.

           Charlie respectfully looks away, his eyes marking their trail 
           east.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BADLANDS – DAY

           Charlie and Mahmoud trudge forward on no sleep, nothing but 
           flat mesa for miles.
           The young soldier catches movement and JERKS UP HIS RIFLE 
           SCOPE.

           Mahmoud instinctively DUCKS TO THE GROUND.

           COLCORD’S POV

           as he lands cross hairs on a jackrabbit at 500 yards.  It’s 
           so far off it appears grainy and shaky in his sights.

           Charlie takes his eye off the scope and looks around the 
           canyons warily.

                                 COLCORD
                        Shot’s going to echo like a bitch 
                        out here.

           Mahmoud squints at the far off speck of a rabbit.  It’s at 
           least a quarter mile.

                                 AL-WAHIRI

                                 COLCORD
                        I don’t know about you, but I’m 
                        hungry.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You’re wasting bullets.

                                 COLCORD
                        Tell you what.  I make this shot, 
                        will you turn yourself in?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Absolutely.

                                 COLCORD
                        You as good as your word?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        May Allah strike me down.

           Charlie wraps the reins around the pommel and sights the 
           jackrabbit.  It hops behind a cairn of rocks.

           Al-Wahiri laughs.

           CHARLIE’S POV

           as his cross hairs find a crack in the rocks.  Just a 
           triangle of light.  It darkens as the jack rabbit passes 
           behind it.
           It’s a thousand-to-one shot.  Charlie holds the gun dead 
           level and squeezes the trigger.

           The GUN SHOT REVERBERATES ACROSS THE PLATEAU like a clap of 
           thunder.  The Baluchi shies at the report, rolling its eyes, 
           Charlie REINING HER IN.

           The rabbit VAPORIZES IN A RED SPRAY OF MIST.

           Al-Wahiri crinkles up his brow and spits.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        Lucky shot.

           Charlie ejects the shell and pockets it.

                                 COLCORD
                        I guess.

           Al-Wahiri studies the young soldier’s profile cast in 
           vermillion by the long shadows of dusk.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

           Charlie makes camp in the north face of a chasm sheltered 
           from the wind.  The jack rabbit slow-cooks on a spit.  There 
           aint but half of it that survived the 7.62 sniper round.

                                 COLCORD
                        Eat some.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        No.

                                 COLCORD
                        You could use the protein.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Me and my people, we are used to 
                        going without food.

                                 COLCORD
                        Helluva thing to be proud of.

           The rabbit’s turned a golden brown, its fatted skin crispy 
           and running with juice.  Charlie removes it from the spit, 
           setting it to cool.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I own these mountains, cowboy.  And 
                        you will never make it through here 
                        alive.

                                 COLCORD
                        So you aim to get rescued.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I am as good as free.

                                 COLCORD
                        You best get to eating then.  Don't 
                        want your men rescuing a skeleton.

           Charlie saws off a thin strip of meat with his leatherman and 
           offers it on the tip of his knife.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        That's it?

                                 COLCORD
                        Moren you'd a given me.

           Mahmoud takes the bite and chews.

           Charlie eats as well, studying the shadows of the crag-
           clefted cliffs leaping and jumping in the orange flames.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        We’re in your tribe’s land right 
                        now, aint we.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Afridi.

                                 COLCORD
                        Is that why our alliance soldiers 
                        turned on us in the mountains?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Afridi will not kill other Afridi.

           Colcord nods.

                                 COLCORD
                        But you and I make the Khyber Pass 
                        we’ll cross over into Shinwari 
                        land.  And the Shinwari hate the 
                        Afridi.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        The feeling is mutual.
                                 COLCORD
                        Even though you’re both Pashtun?

           Charlie saws more meat from the carcass.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        When I was young I had a dream my 
                        son would be the man to end our 
                        thousand year war with the 
                        Shinwari.  But now all my sons are 
                        dead.  If I could see the blood run 
                        freely from Husayn Abdullah’s neck 
                        I could die a happy man.

           Al-Wahiri shrugs.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        And so I keep fighting.

                                 COLCORD
                        And nobody drops it?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Cowboy, a man's only possession is 
                        his honor.  Defend it with your 
                        life.

           The boy nods.  He hands Mahmoud another strip of meat and 
           feeds it to him with his own hand.

                                 COLCORD
                        And what does Allah think of all 
                        this?

           Mahmoud closes his eyes and shakes his head - it is futile to 
           grasp at the infinite.  He quotes the holy book.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        No vision can grasp Him, but His 
                        grasp is over all vision. God is 
                        above all comprehension, yet 
                        comprehends all things.

           Mahmoud opens his eyes and quotes again.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        God knows the promptings of a man’s 
                        soul and is nearer to him than the 
                        vein of his neck.

           Colcord chews and swallows.

                                 COLCORD
                        You mean the jugular?
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Yes, God is nearer to a man than 
                        his own jugular.

                                 COLCORD
                        You shore hold up your end of a 
                        conversation.

           Charlie feeds Mahmoud the last of the rabbit meat.  He holds 
           the dripping meat out of Mahmoud’s beard as the warrior chews 
           it into his mouth.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        O Prophet! Make war on the non-
                        believers. Their ultimate abode is 
                        hell, a hapless journey's end.

           Charlie wipes Mahmoud’s mouth with the trailing edge of the 
           fighter’s turban.

                                 COLCORD
                        Whose God do you reckon is winning 
                        right now, mine or yours?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        God sent the British against us, 
                        and we fought them out.  God sent 
                        the Soviets against us, and we 
                        fought them out.  Now God sends 
                        your people.  We have won every 
                        test.  We will win this one.

           Charlie kicks more wood onto the fire with his boot and sits 
           down against the hollowed out bank of the washout.

                                 COLCORD
                        Seems to me, if you think there’s 
                        one God, and I think there’s one 
                        God, then we must be talkin’ about 
                        the same guy.

           Charlie sits the rifle on his thigh and rests the barrel 
           against his shoulder.  He dallies Mahmoud’s catch rope around 
           his forearm, tucks his makeshift turban low over his brow, 
           and closes his eyes to sleep.

           Mahmoud watches the young soldier, the fading firelight 
           flickering in his dark eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. RAVINE – DAWN

           Charlie sleeps, chin to his chest.  His catch-roped arm is 
           slowly pulled off his lap.  Charlie wakes up with a start, 
           SEIZING HIS M21 RIFLE.

           Al-Wahiri sits in the pre-dawn light, on his knees, bowing 
           into the red glow of the east.

           He sings in a low voice, the Fajr, the morning prayers.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Ihdinas siraatal mustaqeem. 
                        Siraatal ladheena an 'amta' alaihim 
                        Ghairil maghduubi' alaihim 
                        waladaaleen.  Aameen.

           Charlie sits still and listens.

           The eerie chromatic semitones of the falling melody echo in 
           the cliff walls.  The ancient red light of dawn backlights 
           the prostrate man.

           Mahmoud stops singing, suddenly aware Charlie is awake.  The 
           tribesman speaks over his shoulder.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        Aslaamo aleykam, cowboy.

                        No, I aint been awake but a minute.

           Charlie stretches in the pre-dawn light.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        You sure pray a lot for a stone 
                        cold killer.

           Mahmoud bows once more to the east, forehead to the ground, 
           then rises to his feet.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        This is the morning prayer.  Is 
                        very beautiful.

           The young soldier washes his mouth with water from the 
           canteen, brushing his teeth with his finger.  He swashles the 
           sulfurous water in his cheeks and spits.
                                 COLCORD
                        Sounds like a stray cat in a fan 
                        belt.  But you aint asked my 
                        opinion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SWAT RIVER VALLEY - DAY

           Charlie and Mahmoud set out across the valley, the sun rising 
           quick and hot.

           Charlie watches Sahiwal cattle driven by a boy with a stick.  
           He appraises the steers with a rancher's eye.  Their reddish 
           brown coats, darkening toward the haunches where they’re 
           showing their moult.

                                 COLCORD
                        You raise cattle in this country?

           Al-Wahiri looks up at Colcord like he’s dumber than a box of 
           rocks.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Of course.  My father raised 
                        cattle.  My grandfather raised 
                        cattle.  My great-grandfather.

                                 COLCORD
                        This is good country for cattle.

           Colcord looks at the land approvingly.  He rests both hands 
           on the pommel.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn't of taken you for a 
                        rancher's son, Mahmoud.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        When I was eight years old I went 
                        off to fight with the Mujahideen.

                                 COLCORD
                        Eight years old?  What kind of gun 
                        they give you, a water pistol?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Kalashnikov.

                                 COLCORD
                        You could lift that?
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I balanced it on a rock.  All I had 
                        to do was pull the trigger.

           Al-Wahiri walks alongside the bay, living in his memory.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        Soviets.

           Colcord nods.

                        The book tells us, "Make war on 
                        them until idolatry is no more and 
                        God's religion reigns supreme."

           Colcord gives Mahmoud a look.  He’s getting used to these 
           outbursts.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        There is an expression here in the 
                        mountains, “bandooq hay zaywar ka 
                        aadmi.”  The gun is the jewel of a 
                        man.

           Colcord watches a hunting hawk turning serene circles in 
           eddies of arid air.

                                 COLCORD
                        I was five when I first shot a gun.  
                        A 28 gauge Winchester.  Pheasant 
                        hunting with my daddy.  But I ain't 
                        seen combat until this year.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        And how does it suit you?

                                 COLCORD
                        Not sure I understand what y'all 
                        are fighting so much for.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        We want the invaders off our lands.  
                        We want to govern our people 
                        according to the laws of our 
                        religion.

                                 COLCORD
                        What about freedom?

           Mahmoud gestures to the air around them.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        This is freedom.  We are wild and 
                        free.

           The young soldier plucks a sprig of foxtail millet as the 
           horse parts a path through the crop field.  He chews 
           thoughtfully on the bitter stem, one hand on the pommel as 
           the rugged world rocks gently side to side around him.

                                 COLCORD
                        My country is free.  But it aint 
                        wild no more.  Not like it used to 
                        be.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOOTHILLS – DAY

           The colored sediment of red-walled buttresses show the eons 
           like the stripes on a layer cake.  Dry desert succulents 
           pimple the arid land.

           Colcord sharply reins in the mare and studies the rough 
           ground ahead of him.

           HUMAN CORPSES ARE BURIED UP TO THEIR NECKS IN THE DIRT ROAD.

           Skulls stick straight up out of the sand like autumn gourds.  
           Some skulls lie crushed and toppled over on their sides like 
           clay pots.  Clinging strands of scalp hair idly point the 
           direction of the wind.

                                 COLCORD
                        Who did this.

           Mahmoud leans over and spits, the dry earth sucking in the 
           moisture.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        The Shinwari.

                                 COLCORD
                        The hell happened here.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        These men were buried alive in the 
                        road and left overnight for the 
                        vermin to come and eat their faces.

           Colcord wrinkles up his nostrils.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        It is an old Mongol trick.
           Colcord scans the horizon for signs on Shinwari.  Scattered 
           clumps of honey mesquite and yellow-flowered creosote sit 
           cattywampus on the slopes.  There are no other signs of life.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        It is said the rodents start by 
                        eating the softest flesh.

                                 COLCORD
                        Alright.  Let’s get moving.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Aren’t you curious what the softest 
                        flesh on the face is?

                                 COLCORD
                        What is it?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        ...The eyes.

           Charlie scowls and spurs the Baluchi.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        You are in Shinwari land, cowboy.

           Charlie squints into the afternoon light and guides the horse 
           southwest.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD - DAY

           The Baluchi bows its neck in a plodding gait along the dirt 
           road.  Charlie holds the catch rope with Mahmoud trudging 
           behind.

           They approach a row of shelled-out buildings overlooking a 
           granite quarry.

           Charlie sits the horse and studies the buildings by the road.

                                 COLCORD
                        What do you make of this, Mahmoud?

           Mahmoud studies the low buildings, full of blind spots, and 
           says nothing.

           Charlie looks north and south.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        I kindly don’t like it.
           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD - BUILDINGS

           The hot wind whistles through the smashed windows of the red 
           clay shanties.

           As if on cue, a SINGLE GUNSHOT rings out, echoing in the 
           surrounding ravines.

           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD - THE SKITTISH MARE

           prances sideways, COLCORD REIGNING HER IN.

                                 COLCORD
                        Christ almighty...

           A MAN’S VOICE shouts from the copse of buildings.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        That was your warning shot!  Put 
                        your hands in the air!

           COLCORD’S EYES

           scan the rooftops and windows for rifle scopes.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I said put your hands up!

           Charlie raises his hands high and speaks low to Mahmoud.

                                 COLCORD
                        They speakin English to us.  That’s 
                        a good sign.

                                 AL-WAHIRI

                        Private Military Contractors.  You 
                        should have kept off the main road, 
                        cowboy.

                                 COLCORD
                        When I want your opinion, I will 
                        shorely ask for it.

           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD - BUILDINGS

           FOUR ARMED WHITE MEN step out from hiding places, carrying M4 
           assault rifles.

           Their leader, MILLER, steps forward.
           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD - MILLER

           lowers his aim to Colcord’s feet and scratches his head.

                                 MILLER
                        Well I’ll be a monkey’s uncle.  You 
                        American?

                                 COLCORD
                        Yessir.

           Crewcut with wrap around shades, MILLER IS A BRICK SHITHOUSE. 
           He stands a full head taller than Charlie.

           Miller studies the boy’s turban, his dirty fatigues, his 
           rifle.

                                 MILLER
                        You on the wrong side of the border 
                        for a jarhead.

                                 COLCORD
                        I know it.

           The Private Military Contractors fan out across the 
           embankment, surrounding the boy.

           Miller shifts his squint from Charlie to Mahmoud.

                                 MILLER
                        That who I think it is?

                                 COLCORD
                        Depends.

           Miller unbuttons his chest pocket, unfolds a mug shot, and 
           considers it.  He squints at Al-Wahiri and whistles through 
           his teeth.

                                 MILLER
                        On a silver platter.

           Miller folds up the bounty and buttons it back in his pocket. 

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Boy, your parents even know you’re 
                        out here?

                                 COLCORD
                        They passed on.

           Miller grimaces.  He turns and spits.
                                 MILLER
                        Where’s the rest of your unit?

                                 COLCORD
                        Dead.

                                 MILLER
                        And yet you still walking on the 
                        north side of the dirt aint you?

           Colcord eyes the Mercs circling to his flanks and keeps his 
           mouth shut.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Well I’ll be a monkey’s uncle.

           Miller scratches at the sunburn peeling on the back of his 
           neck and squints up at Colcord.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        I think we’re gonna take this 
                        burden off your hands.

                                 COLCORD
                        I gotten him this far.

                                 MILLER
                        Son, you know how many men, women, 
                        and children this man’s killed?  He 
                        set off a car bomb in Kabul killed 
                        17 people. Filled the trunk with 
                        nails and set it off outside a 
                        school.

           The Mercs hold their guns 45 degrees to the ground and eye al-
           Wahiri.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        You thinking Mahmoud Ahman al-
                        Wahiri’s gonna let you tow him all 
                        the way to Afghanistan just like 
                        walking your dog to the park?  Boy, 
                        he aint a Pomeranian.

           Charlie shrugs.

                                 COLCORD
                        I reckon he aint got a lot a say in 
                        the matter.  Matter a fact, I 
                        believe the same could be said 
                        about you.

           Charlie eyes his M21 rifle, buttoned into the leather 
           scabbard fitted to the cantle behind him.
                                 MILLER
                        Son, you know what 25 million 
                        dollars is?

                                 COLCORD
                        You gonna tell me or you gonna make 
                        me guess.

                                 MILLER
                        25 million dollars is how much I'm 
                        willing to bet you don't make it to 
                        Jalalabad with Mahmoud Ahman al-
                        Wahiri tied to your catch rope.

           The Mercs are slowly sidestepping, fanning out, moving 
           upground on Charlie’s flank.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        We on the same team, boy.  Want to 
                        see al-Wahiri incarcerated and 
                        brought to justice.

                                 COLCORD
                        You aint on my team.

           Charlie looks at the Merc darkly, eyes black beneath the 
           folds of his Lungee.

                                 MILLER
                        Breath easy, boy.

           Miller keeps stepping slowly forward.

                                 COLCORD
                        My team died in them mountains 
                        bringing him in.  You aint on that 
                        team.

           Miller takes up the Baluchi’s hackamore.

                                 MILLER
                        They aint but two ways to do this.  
                        Hard way or the easy way.

           Miller’s FLANK MAN draws Charlie’s M21 rifle from the saddle 
           scabbard.

           The Flank Man takes Mahmoud by the catch rope and JERKS HIM 
           FORWARD.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are the son of a scorpion and 
                        the wife of a goat!
                                 COLCORD
                        You let me do the talking, Mahmoud.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are not doing a good job of it.

           Two Mercs keep M4’s trained on Charlie.  Charlie keeps his 
           hands in the air behind his head.

                                 COLCORD
                        I’m a soldier of the US Army.

           Miller slides Charlie gently down off the Baluchi.

                                 MILLER
                        Your army’d want it this way.  Best 
                        to insure this man gets to prison.

                                 COLCORD
                        It aint that you’re concerned with.

                                 MILLER
                        Believe me.  They’ll thank us.

                                 COLCORD
                        You got exactly 25 million other 
                        priorities ahead of seeing this man 
                        get justice.

           The Flank Man pushes Charlie down to kneel in the dirt.  
           Miller takes up Charlie’s M21, slides the bolt, and puts it 
           to his cheek.

                                 MILLER
                        This a helluva rifle, son.  You any 
                        good with it?

           Charlie just squints and looks mean.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I figured.  Best hold 
                        on to this.

           Miller hands Charlie’s rifle back to the Flank Man.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                             (to Charlie)
                        Stay there.

                                 COLCORD
                        You wouldn’t shoot a US soldier.
                                 MILLER
                        You’re in the tribal lands.  Not 
                        even the Pakistani army’ll come in 
                        here.  There’s no law here but 
                        tribal law.

                                 COLCORD
                        You said we was on the same team.

                                 MILLER
                        You on the wrong side of the 
                        border, boy.  Government won’t even 
                        admit ch’yer here.

           Charlie watches the Mercs PULL A BLACK SACK OVER MAHMOUD’S 
           HEAD and wrestle him toward their Humvee.  Mahmoud CUSSES TO 
           SCARE THE DEVIL.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        You think the Army’s going to send 
                        in a forensic team, figure out who 
                        shot what bullet?

           Behind Miller, Charlie sees the Merc’s PUNCH MAHMOUD HARD in 
           the stomach to double him over, then roll him onto the 
           tailgate.

           Mahmoud curses their graves in Pashto.  The Merc’s SLAM SHUT 
           THE DOORS OF THE HUMVEE.

           Charlie looks from the M21 barrel to Miller’s eyes.

                                 COLCORD
                        You aim to keep Mahmoud alive?

           Miller shrugs.

                                 MILLER
                        Price is the same, dead or alive.

                                 COLCORD
                        That an answer?

           Miller scratches his chin.

                                 MILLER
                        I aim to do whatever’s necessary to 
                        get him through the border cross 
                        without my crew getting shot to 
                        shit.  He don’t provoke he might 
                        could make it.

                                 COLCORD
                        He got a helluva mouth on him.
                                 MILLER
                        So do you kid.

           Colcord surveys the Warsak-Peshawar road.

                                 COLCORD
                        You gonna leave me in this country 
                        with US fatigues on and no gun?

                                 MILLER
                        I can take your fatigues, too, if 
                        you think it’ll help.

                                 COLCORD
                        You aint gotta have my life on your 
                        head, too.  Leave my gun 100 yards 
                        down the road.

                                 MILLER
                        Like hell.

                                 COLCORD
                        The gun is the jewel of a man.

           Miller looks at Colcord quizzically, then glances down to 
           admire the rifle.

                                 MILLER
                        Alright, son.

                                 COLCORD
                        You better.

           Miller pronounces an ‘h’ in front of his ‘w.’

                                 MILLER
                        Or what?

                                 COLCORD
                        Hell will come find you.

           Miller grins broadly, backing up with his hands raised.  He 
           climbs up into the humvee and guns it.

           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD - COLCORD

           watches the humvee SPEED AWAY DOWN THE ROAD, spiraling dust.  
           One hundred yards.

           ...Then two hundred yards...

           Three hundred yards and the Humvee makes a bend in the trail 
           AND IS GONE.  Mahmoud, rifle, and all.
           Charlie spits out the side of his mouth.

                                 COLCORD
                        Dayum.

           The young soldier scans the country.  Nothing but arrow weed, 
           mesquite, and miles of relentless sun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WARSAK-PESHAWAR ROAD – DAY

           Charlie trots the horse alone through harsh country.  The sun 
           scorches directly overhead, the sandy road burning bone white 
           in his eyes.

           Mud houses stand in the shade of mulberry trees. Wild olives 
           dot the hillsides in wide-grown clumps.

           Charlie passes a DEAD MAN HANGING BY HIS NECK from a walnut 
           tree, his body squirming with maggots.  A bald condor 
           stretches its wrinkled neck from a branch above.

           TRIBAL HORSEMEN in bright lunghees canter up the road ahead.

                                 COLCORD
                        Don’t pay them no never mind, 
                        Jamila.

           Charlie salutes the riders.  They gallop on without stopping. 

           The young soldier sighs with relief and urges the bay 
           forward.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SWITCHBACKS - DAY

           Charlie guides the Baluchi off road down treacherous slopes.

           The Warsak-Peshawar road cuts back and forth through wide-
           looping switchbacks but Charlie makes up time trotting the 
           horse directly down the gorge.

           The young soldier leans way back in his saddle against the 
           decline and wipes the sweat that drips from his hair.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. JAMRUD – DAY

           Charlie follows Humvee tracks south to Jamrud, a near ghost 
           town on the Warsak-Peshawar road.

           GUN RUNNERS and HEROIN ADDICTS squat in the shade of shelled-
           out buildings and roast naan over cookfires.  They use sewage 
           grates as grill tops and feed scraps to foraging stray dogs.

           Charlie spots the Humvee parked outside a tavern.

           INT. TAVERN - SAME

           Miller and his Mercs enjoy a celebratory drink.

           They toast the Mullagori bar-keeper who eyes them darkly and 
           does not touch alcohol.

           EXT. JAMRUD - MAIN STREET - SAME

           On foot, Charlie inches along the side of the Humvee.  He 
           quietly tests the passenger-side door.

           IT’S OPEN.

           INT. HUMVEE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie checks under the seats and comes up with an ice 
           scraper with a red plastic handle.

           He checks the glove box and finds a pair of Omega Series 
           night vision binoculars.

           EXT. HUMVEE - SAME

           Charlie cracks open the tailgate...

           ...And there he discovers Mahmoud Ahman al-Wahiri.

           Charlie pulls off Mahmoud’s black hood.  Mahmoud blinks in 
           the light.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Cowboy!  I thought you ran home 
                        crying!

           Colcord notes the fresh bruises on Mahmoud’s face.
                                 COLCORD
                        How many times I gotta save your 
                        life before you thank me.

           INT. TAVERN – SIMULTANEOUS

           The Merc’s order up a second round.  As they toss back their 
           shots, they hear their Humvee REV AND TAKE OFF, wheels 
           spinning.

           EXT. JAMRUD - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The Mercenaries race outside, cocking their weapons.

                                 MILLER
                        He’s got us firing on our own damn 
                        truck!

           Miller and his men take positions in the street and OPEN 
           FIRE.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF PESHAWAR - DAY

           The Humvee veers right, off-roading through a gully.

                                 MILLER
                        Stop him!

           THE MERCS

           spray the armored truck with their ISRAELI-MADE UZIS.  

           VILLAGERS

           carrying baskets of fruit on their heads drop their loads and 
           RUN FOR COVER.

           MILLER

           takes aim with Colcord’s M21 sniper rifle, drawing a bead on 
           the rear tire.  He FIRES.

           THE HUMVEE TIRE

           EXPLODES.  The metal wheel rim SHOOTS SPARKS AGAINST THE 
           GRANITE SCREE.

           THE HUMVEE

           careens over rocks and FLIPS OVER, FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. 
           THE SUV CRASHES HARD ON ITS ROOF, wheels still spinning as 
           the ENGINE ROARS.

           EXT. GULLY - MILLER

           waves the blade of his hand for a wedge formation, signaling 
           his team to circle the vehicle.

           THE MERCS

           FAN IN HARD AND FAST, taking secure positions surrounding the 
           truck.  They brace their gun barrels on the backs of rocks 
           and await command.

           EXT. GULLY - THE HUMVEE

           upsidedown, WHEELS RACING, the engine ROARING USELESSLY IN 
           THIRD GEAR.

           MILLER

           plants cross hairs on the driver side door and pumps his fist 
           for the team to move in.

           MILLER’S FLANK MAN

           scrambles into position, crouching next to the driver side 
           door, wedged into the dirt.  He grabs the handle with both 
           hands and YANKS IT OPEN.

           MILLER

           aims his gun inside, sweeping left to right.  He squats to 
           one knee, fanning the gun to the passenger side and rear of 
           the truck.

                                 MILLER
                        Clear.

                                 FLANK MAN
                        What the hell?

           THE HUMVEE IS EMPTY.

           Miller reaches inside the vacant driver side and grabs a RED 
           HANDLED ICE SCRAPER wedged between the seat and the 
           accelerator.

           He yanks it out and the engine WINDS DOWN, the wheels 
           slowing.

           THE MERCS
           scan the surrounding ridges, aiming their gun sights into the 
           distant foothills of Peshawar.

           MILLER

           stands up, looking mean.  He tosses aside the ice scraper. 

                                 MILLER
                        Find me that jarhead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF PESHAWAR - DAY

           Charlie Colcord, galloping hard.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Waj ab zidik!  Ebn el matnakah!

                                 COLCORD
                        C’mon, it wadnt that bad.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Herded here, herded there – I am 
                        not cattle!

                                 COLCORD
                        Price you pay for being popular.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        And you, too!  Elif air ab tizak!

                                 COLCORD
                        Keep mouthin off like that, I will 
                        make you git down and walk.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAIDU SHARIF ROAD - DAY

           Sure enough, Mahmoud is walking.  Colcord pays out more slack 
           on the catch rope.  The Baluchi ambles forward on the uneven 
           road.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        If you had brains under that turban 
                        you would stay off the main roads.

                                 COLCORD
                        I’ve a mind to, directly.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        They will find us.

                                 COLCORD
                        They prolly shot the tires off 
                        their own damn truck.  That’ll give 
                        ‘em something to work on.

           Colcord scans the road behind him and sees nothing to concern 
           himself with.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        As long as we’re making good time, 
                        we’ll kindly stay on the road a 
                        piece.

           Mahmoud balks, heels dug into the ground, stalling Colcord 
           and the horse.

           Colcord jerks the rope.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        C'mon. You’re near about as 
                        stubborn as a blue-nosed mule.

           Mahmoud still balks.  Charlie follows Mahmoud’s eye line.  He 
           quits jerkin the catch rope,  drops down to the ground, and 
           squats to his heels.

           The young soldier lowers his gaze and watches how the sun 
           catches the dirt on the road.  He takes a deep breath and 
           blows on the dust.

           The dust parts, REVEALING METAL.

           Charlie tilts his head, shifting his focus down the road a 
           piece.  Pock marked depressions hopscotch the road left to 
           right.  And suddenly Charlie sees them.

           IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.  EVERYWHERE.

           Charlie looks back up at Mahmoud who looks away, not making 
           eye contact.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Well, Mahmoud.  I do believe you 
                        just saved my life.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I saved my life, cowboy.

                                 COLCORD
                        Thought you didn’t care about 
                        living.
           Charlie takes the horse by the fiador and leads her onto the 
           embankment, giving the mines a wide berth.  They safely exit 
           the road and head into the back country.

           Charlie turns to Mahmoud, pointing a finger to where the 
           Khyber Pass cuts the spur of the range.

           a brush fire.
           On foot, Charlie removes his turban and ties it around the 
           mare’s head, covering her eyes in the blind.  He leads the

                        be killed by Shinwari!

           That is enough for Charlie.  He grabs the Baluchi’s hackamore 
           and trots it after Mahmoud.

           GUNSHOTS RING OUT.  BULLETS RICOCHET against rocks.  The 
           tribal fighters’ aim is not perfect in the dark shadows of 
           the boulders.

           EXT. ROCKY COMBE - CONTINUOUS

           Mahmoud leads Charlie into a gash in the cliff and KICKS 
           SAVAGELY at a cairn of rocks.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Every rock in this mountain!

           Charlie pushes the rocks and dirt aside with his hands.  
           Buried in the earth is A WOODEN CRATE.

           Mahmoud kicks at it with his rawhide chaplay shoes.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        Faster!

           GUNFIRE DRAWS CLOSER.

           Charlie pries the lid off the crate, revealing KHYBER GLOCKS 
           PACKED IN STRAW.

           EXT. CLIFF FACE - SAME

           Mountain fighters surround the combe.  They sound off with 
           low whistles, circling into position.

           EXT. ROCKY COMBE - SAME

           Charlie smashes open a box of ammunition and UNCLIPS A GLOCK.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Faster, cowboy, faster!

           The whistles of fighters signal in some cryptic code.

                                 COLCORD
                        How many you make ‘em?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Five.

           Colcord desperately SQUEEZES BULLETS INTO THE CLIP.  The 
           rusted magazine spring making this patient work.

                                 COLCORD
                        Two...Three...

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                             (screaming)
                        Faster you fool!  If I had hands, I 
                        could shoot them all by now and 
                        still have time to strangle you!
           EXT. CLIFF FACE - SHINWARI FIGHTERS

           burst as one from their cover in the rocks.  They bare their 
           weapons, SCREAM, AND CHARGE.

           EXT. ROCKY COMBE - COLCORD

           drives a fifth bullet into the clip.

                                 COLCORD
                        Five.

           Colcord slams the clip home, RACKS THE SLIDE, and rises to 
           his feet, spinning as

           EXT. ROCKY COMBE - THE FIRST SHINWARI

           leaps over the lip of the combe, AUTOMATIC FIRING.  Colcord’s 
           first bullet splits a wedge in the Shinwari’s neck - JUGULAR 
           EXPLODING IN A FINE MIST and

           COLCORD

           spinning, firing as

           TWO MORE SHINWARI

           guns blazing, take IDENTICAL SHOTS TO THE HEAD - each of 
           their RIGHT EYES IMPLODING as their brains vomit out the 
           backs of their skulls.

           We’ve never seen what Charlie can truly do with a gun until 
           this moment --

           COLCORD’S EYES

           sighting the fourth Shinwari even as he kills the third as

           THE FOURTH SHINWARI

           touches down in the combe, dropping to one knee to aim a 
           grenade launcher - YES, A GRENADE LAUNCHER - as Colcord’s 
           bullet paints a Japanese flag on his rib cage and

           THE FIFTH SHINWARI

           with plenty of time to cross hair Colcord with his 
           Kalashnikov is STILL TOO SLOW - Colcord tagging him high 
           enough in the throat to SEVER THE SHINWARI’S SPINAL CHORD.

           The Shinwari drops in a quivering, twitching mess.  Not quite 
           dead, but no good at living.
           Colcord LOWERS THE SMOKING GLOCK, out of bullets.

           Five men down in three seconds...

           BUT THERE AREN’T FIVE SHINWARI.

           There are six.

           INT. COMBE - THE SIXTH SHINWARI

           rises from the boulders, directly behind Colcord, RAISING HIS 
           AUTOMATIC.

           COLCORD

           sees it too late.  And understands.  He is a dead man.

           THE SIXTH SHINWARI

           squeezing the trigger --

           AL-WAHIRI

           -- charging him, SMASHING HIM TO the ground --

           THE SIXTH SHINWARI

           -- belted off his feet.

           AL-WAHIRI

           his hands bound behind his back, fighting with his teeth.  He 
           SINKS FANGS into the Shinwari’s gun arm.

           THE SIXTH SHINWARI

           screaming.

           AL-WAHIRI

           showing the whites of his eyes, GROWLING LIKE A BEAST.

           THE SIXTH SHINWARI

           taller and stronger than Mahmoud, getting his gun up toward 
           Mahmoud’s belly --

           INT. COMBE - COLCORD

           -- snaps out of his near death moment, his brain catching up 
           to what his eyes are seeing.  Charlie tosses his empty Glock 
           and snatches up an AK-47 from a dead Shinwari.
           AL-WAHIRI

           struggles for his last second of life.

           COLCORD

           aims the AK-47 point blank at the SIXTH SHINWARI AND FIRES.  

           A three second burst from the AK-47 fills the Shinwari’s head 
           with TWELVE 7.62 COM-BLOCK BULLETS.

           Charlie grimaces.  Blood and skull everywhere.

           INT. COMBE - AL-WAHIRI

           releases the Shinwari’s forearm from his jaws and rolls over 
           onto his back.  Mahmoud is bathed in Shinwari blood.

           Charlie breaths heavily, adrenaline coursing through his 
           body.  He searches for something to say.

                                 COLCORD
                        You said there were five.

           Mahmoud turns and spits the Shinwari blood from his mouth.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        It’s the one you don’t see that 
                        gets you.

           Mahmoud struggles to his feet.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        They’re coming for us now.

                                 COLCORD
                        I know it.

           Mahmoud trudges downhill.  The horse following Mahmoud’s 
           lead.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Mahmoud.

           The Pashtun turns to look uphill at the young soldier, 
           backlit by moonlight.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PRECIPICE - NIGHT

           Mahmoud favors his left leg, limping heavily on the right.

           Charlie leads the Baluchi mare by the fiador until they reach 
           the wind-blown edge of the cliff.  Due south, a path leads to 
           switch backs cut in the mountain.

           Due north is a thousand feet of scree at a deadly drop off.

           Charlie looks north and south.

                                 COLCORD
                        Well, Mahmoud.  You said you know 
                        every rock of these parts.  Do we 
                        take the scenic route or the short 
                        cut?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        The mountain path is too long.  The 
                        sun will rise and point her finger 
                        at us while we are exposed against 
                        the cliffs.

                                 COLCORD
                        So we glissade down the ravine.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        That path is too treacherous.  We 
                        shall be shredded like wheat 
                        through a thresher.

                                 COLCORD
                        Well, which is it?  You can't ride 
                        two horses with one ass.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        If you insist on my opinion, I 
                        prefer we return to Pakistan.

                                 COLCORD
                        Mahmoud you are a barrel of laughs.  
                        You ought to take your act on the 
                        road and sell tickets.

           FIGHTERS VOICES ECHO from the slopes.  They WHISTLE to one 
           another from surrounding hills, closing in fast.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        I guess we take the short cut.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are out of your mind.
           Charlie scans the hill, darkened by the setting moon.

                                 COLCORD
                        So are they.  Now get a move on.

           Mahmoud confronts the edge of the ravine.  An 80 degree drop 
           of grey silt and gravel.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        No!  I have no hands, cowboy!  I 
                        cannot stop myself from a fall.

           THE WHOOPING ZAGHAREETS OF SHINWARI FIGHTERS grow closer.

                                 COLCORD
                        C'mon, sweetheart.  Grousing about 
                        it won't make it any better.

           Charlie SWATS THE MARE on the rump to get her moving.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        You a mountain horse, you are bred 
                        for this.

           The timid bay begins skittering down the scree.

           Charlie tucks his fatigues into his boots and turns to 
           Mahmoud who shakes his head emphatically.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        May Allah curse you!  May Allah 
                        smite you down!

           Charlie gets an arm around Mahmoud and pulls him toward the 
           lip of the ravine.  The HOOFBEATS OF TRIBAL HORSEMEN sound 
           down the rocky promontories above as shouting fighters circle 
           in.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        Upon my faith I put a curse upon 
                        you and all your works!

                                 COLCORD
                        I thought they say Islam means 
                        peace.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        No, you fool!  It means surrender.

                                 COLCORD
                        To who?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        To God.
                                 COLCORD
                        Who's fighting God?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are.

                                 COLCORD
                        I got no quarrel with the man that 
                        I recollect.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You are fighting God's design every 
                        step of your journey.

                                 COLCORD
                        I have not been aware of that fact.

           GUNFIRE ECHOES in the mountains.  The first BULLETS WHISTLE 
           BY.  Their aim is wide but draws tighter.

           CHARLIE WRESTLES MAHMOUD TOWARD THE DROP OFF.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        It was Allah's will that I perish 
                        in the mountains of Pakistan.  You 
                        thwarted Allah's design and now you 
                        will incur Allah's wrath!

                                 COLCORD
                        I believe it is my wrath you should 
                        be concerning yourself with.  Now 
                        git!

           Charlie SHOVES MAHMOUD OVER THE EDGE.  The warrior GLISSADES 
           DOWN THE RAVINE.  Charlie leaps after him, quickly falling to 
           his backside and spinning END OVER END ON THE LOOSE SHALE.

           EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

           The two men whoop and holler, PLUMMETING HUNDREDS OF FEET, 
           clothes shredded by gravel.

           Charlie grabs at handfuls of moss, roots, and scrub but 
           nothing will slow his descent.

           The young soldier narrowly passes sharp boulders or the 
           jagged roots of long desiccated trees.

           BULLETS sound further in the distance and at last Charlie 
           slides to a stop.

           Mahmoud lies still.
           Charlie crawls to him.

           EXT. BASIN - SAME

           Charlie shakes Mahmoud.  The Pashtun opens his eyes, wincing.

           Charlie rolls up the leg of Mahmoud’s shalwar and unwraps the 
           tourniquet.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        You have used me up, cowboy.

           Mahmoud’s gunshot wound is infected.  The flesh is bruised 
           and purple but the cauterized hole is green and black.

           Charlie bites his lip and fights a gag.

                                 COLCORD
                        I seen worse.

           Charlie feels Mahmoud’s forehead with the back of his hand 
           and it comes away hot.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        When I die I will see my father and 
                        my mother, my wife, and my sons.  
                        It will be the happiest day I have 
                        known.

           Charlie splashes the wound with water from his canteen and 
           reties the bandaging.

                                 COLCORD
                        We aint but one day from Jalalabad.  
                        We get you into base tomorrow and 
                        the best doctors in the world will 
                        be fixing you up.

           Charlie stands up and scans the terrain.  He spots the 
           Baluchi cropping scrub not fifty feet away, none the worse 
           for wear.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Damn but that is a fine horse.

           Charlie looks down at the wounded fighter.

           Mahmoud closes his eyes and moves his lips in prayer.  It 
           does not look well for him.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        C'mon.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I cannot go on.

                                 COLCORD
                        Don't you give me no lip, boy.  
                        You'll wish you was in hell with 
                        your back broke.

                        Give me some water.

           The young soldier kneels to the warrior and feeds him water.  
           Mahmoud drinks.

           Charlie wipes the dribble from the man's bearded chin.

                                 COLCORD
                        C'mon Mahmoud.  We can't be but 20 
                        clicks from Jalalabad.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Jalalabad, Jalalabad.  All you care 
                        about is Jalalabad.

                                 COLCORD
                        Mahmoud, you best believe it.  I 
                        will walk into Jalalabad high as a 
                        kite and doing a tap dance.  The 
                        army won't know whether to pin a 
                        medal on me or throw me in the 
                        looney bin and I won't care two 
                        licks.  I make Jalalabad I won't 
                        know what to do with myself.  
                        Anything else in my life will seem 
                        like a let down.

           SHINWARI SIGNAL WHISTLES sound from the rocky eyries above.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Now lets get moving or the Shinwari 
                        will have their way with you.

           Charlie walks south to gather up the horse.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Husayn Abdullah, this warlord who 
                        blew up your embassy.  If I bring 
                        you his Shinwari head on a silver 
                        platter, will you let me go then?

                                 COLCORD
                        I have my orders, Mahmoud.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Allah take your orders!

           Charlie saddles up.

                                 COLCORD
                        You can take it up with Allah when 
                        we get to Jalalabad.  Now get a 
                        move on!

           Charlie reins the horse east.  Mahmoud rises wearily to his 
           feet and stumbles after him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAFED KOH MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

           The two warriors move throughout the night, glissading down 
           rocky washouts and urging the mare across rocky precipices.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE CAVES - NIGHT

           Charlie and Mahmoud pick their way along cliffs into an 
           encampment of militant caves cut into limestone.

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE CAVES - COLCORD

           holds his AK-47 at eye level and POINTS AND SWEEPS HIS WAY 
           HARD AND FAST through the cave network.  The caves appear 
           abandoned.

                                 COLCORD
                        It’s all clear.

           Mahmoud slumps to the ground, exhausted.  The Pashtun tilts 
           his head back to the sky.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Heaven, take me now.

           Colcord scavenges the refuse in the caves.  Sleeping mats, 
           notebooks, videotapes, scraps of clothing.

                                 COLCORD
                        You really believe you're going to 
                        heaven, don't you?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Where else would I go?  Kabul?
           Charred cook fires lie strewn with crude implements.  Charlie 
           tests a finger in the coals but they are days cold.

           A few CORPSES stripped of boots and uniforms are stacked like 
           firewood by the trash pile.

                                 COLCORD
                        I’ll warrant y’all believe in a 
                        heaven.  But don't y'all believe 
                        there’s a hell?

           Mahmoud closes his eyes to summon his strength and quotes 
           from the holy book.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        We have prepared the doom of Hell 
                        and the penalty of torment. They 
                        shall wear garments of fire!  
                        Scalding water will be 
                        poured upon their heads melting 
                        their skin!

           Charlie finds a full AK-47 magazine amongst the litter and 
           switches out his clip.

           Mahmoud continues...

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        ...They will be tortured with 
                        hooked rods of iron and whenever 
                        they try to escape they will be 
                        dragged back to hell and told: 
                        ‘Taste the torment of the 
                        conflagration.’  Evil shall be 
                        their drink, dismal their resting-
                        place.  Punishment will never be 
                        lightened, and they shall be 
                        speechless with despair.

                                 COLCORD
                        I will take that for a yes.

           Charlie refills his canteen against a line of runoff 
           trickling down a cave wall.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Most certainly.  There is a hell 
                        for the non-believers.

                                 COLCORD
                        What about sinners?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        They are the same thing.
           Charlie screws the cap on his canteen and eases himself down 
           on a rock, stretching his sore legs.  He looks out at the 
           rock strewn horizon and the endless vacuum of space beyond.

                                 COLCORD
                        I'm talking about men who kill 
                        women and kids.  Blowing up 
                        civilians with bombs filled with 
                        rusty nails.  Do you believe they 
                        pay for their sins?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I do not pretend to judge for 
                        Allah.

           Colcord sets his jaw.  The muscles cord up in his temples.

                                 COLCORD
                        Do you know why I joined the Army?

           Mahmoud listens quietly.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        I got in a fight and hurt a kid 
                        real bad.  He had to go in the 
                        hospital for a long time.  When I 
                        stood up in the court the judge 
                        told me he would drop all charges 
                        if I joined the Army and reformed 
                        myself.

           Charlie takes a swig off the canteen and wipes his mouth with 
           the back of a sleeve.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        My book says "judge not lest you be 
                        judged" and I aint saying I'm one 
                        lick better nor worse than anybody.  
                        But dammit, Mahmoud, to hear you 
                        tell it, if a martyr kills a bunch 
                        of women and kids he goes straight 
                        to heaven no questions asked.  And 
                        where I'm from, a man kills women 
                        and kids he goes straight to hell 
                        just as quick. 

           Colcord wipes the road dust from his gun barrel and presses 
           fresh bullets into his spare clip.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        We can't both be right, so which is 
                        it?  If killing women and kids 
                        don't get you sent to hell, I can't 
                        rightly think of what would.
           Mahmoud wearily lifts the lids of his eyes and levels his 
           stare on the young soldier.  The Pashtun’s eyes glower with 
           an inward light like the opalescent eyes of a wolf.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        When I was eight the Soviets came. 
                        They knocked on the door of our 
                        house while my mother was at the 
                        market.  They butchered my brothers 
                        because they were almost old enough 
                        to fight.  They used my sister the 
                        way you use a slave girl.  I hid in 
                        the hay with the goats and when I 
                        came out, my house was covered with 
                        blood and my brothers were gone.  
                        They killed my mother that same 
                        day.

           Mahmoud gestures for water.  Charlie obliges him, tipping the 
           canteen to the warrior’s lips.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        For eight years I fought them, 
                        sleeping in the mountains under 
                        rocks like a fox.  How hard did we 
                        fight?

           Mahmoud cocks his chin toward the grey slopes in the 
           distance.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        The Hills of Tatara were once a 
                        beautiful forest and now not a 
                        single tree remains.

           Mahmoud takes one more sip of water.  Then he spits and rises 
           to his feet.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        You ask what a man must do to enter 
                        hell?  I was born into it.  I have 
                        lived my life in it.  I have done 
                        unimaginable things, yes!  Truly 
                        Allah honors an honest man!  What 
                        blood has stained these hands in 
                        the name of my tribe!  What blood 
                        has stained my soul in the name of 
                        my family!  And if Mohammed says 
                        that a man may enter heaven by 
                        dying in battle - that his whole 
                        slate shall be wiped clean by that 
                        glory - then I will gladly seek my 
                        death at the hands of my enemies.
           Mahmoud stomps the dust off his boots and rejoins the 
           mountain foot path, trailing his catch rope.  The Baluchi 
           nickers and follows him.

                                 COLCORD
                        Live by the sword and die by the 
                        sword I guess.

           Mahmoud turns to face the young soldier.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Cowboy, you will learn that in this 
                        life of hell all we have is our 
                        honor.

           Mahmoud continues up the trail.  Colcord dusts off his 
           fatigues and follows after him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAFED KOH MOUNTAINS – PREDAWN

           The two men skitter and slide down the western face of the 
           slopes, the mountains blocking the red light of dawn.

           The sky grows brighter above them, swallowing stars.  The 
           western shadow of the mountains races toward them across the 
           foothills as the eastern sun grows stronger at their backs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SAFED KOH MOUNTAINS – AFGHANISTAN – DAWN

           Charlie sits the horse high in the foothills and looks west 
           at the new land before them.

                                 COLCORD
                        Afghanistan!

           The young soldier looks out at the rugged moonscape of rock 
           and tundra.  A battle-scarred land denuded of trees.  Fifty 
           foot craters from BLU-82s scoring the earth like a bingo 
           card.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Never thought I’d be so happy to 
                        see this place.

           Charlie breathes deeply of the new air.  Mahmoud eyes the 
           land warily and says nothing.
           Charlie follows the snaking brown line of the Jalalabad-Kabul 
           highway and cocks a finger to red lights in the west.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        There.  Jalalabad.  Right?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Yes, there it is.

           Charlie smiles broadly.  He’s almost laughing he’s so happy.

                                 COLCORD
                        I make it about ten miles.

           The mare jerks and begins sinking to the ground a moment 
           before Charlie hears the FIRST GUN REPORT.

           THE DYING BALUCHI COLLAPSES UNDER HIM, Charlie barely 
           scrambling off the mount in time.

           EXT. SAFED KOH MOUNTAINS - GUNMEN APPEAR

           from all four points on the compass.  From every rock and 
           every ridge.

           THE BALUCHI

           bellows and kicks, blood pouring from the bullet wound in her 
           chest.

           COLCORD AND AL-WAHIRI

           scramble behind the fallen horse, curling their bodies 
           against the horse’s belly.

                        Bastards.  You senseless bastards.

           Colcord presses his hands to the gaping wound in the horse’s 
           chest but the blood wells up and runs through his fingers.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Jamila, Jamila...

           Hot blood bubbles out with every beat of the Baluchi’s great 
           heart.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Leave it.

           COLCORD
           rolls over and pulls up his Khyber gun, resting the muzzle 
           brake against the horse’s ribs and looking for the shot.

           There is none.  The gunmen have vanished behind rocks.

                                 COLCORD
                        How many you make ‘em?

           Mahmoud raises his voice and shouts to the gunmen.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Dazey onakRee!

           Gunmen’s voices call out in Urdu around the valley and from 
           all directions.

                                 GUNMEN
                        Khpala wasla laandey kigdee!

                        Ud-Regee!

           COLCORD’S EYES

           strafe the country looking for a shot, voices echoing 
           strangely, impossibly across the chasm.

                                 EAST GUNMEN

                        Khpala wasla laandey kigdee!

           Charlie looks frantically in all directions.  The bay’s sides 
           heave beneath his muzzle brake.

           EXT. SAFED KOH FOOTHILLS - GUNMEN

           appear all at once, from behind every boulder.  They are like 
           ants.

           One minute there’s none, the next minute they’re everywhere.
           EXT. SAFED KOH FOOTHILLS - COLCORD’S POV

           Gunmen above him on the hill.  Gunmen below.  To the front 
           and back and on both flanks.

           EXT. SAFED KOH FOOTHILLS - COLCORD AND AL-WAHIRI

           Forty gunmen advance.  Khyber rifles drawn.

                                 COLCORD
                        What is this?

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                             (grimly)
                        Shinwari.

           The Shinwari gunmen close in, tightening their cordon.

           Mahmoud turns to Charlie with a fierce look in his eye.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        Cowboy.  Do not let me die by the 
                        hand of the Shinwari.

                                 COLCORD
                        I won’t.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Are you as good as your word?

           Charlie nods.

                                 COLCORD
                        I am.

           EXT. SAFED KOH FOOTHILLS - SHINWARI GUNMEN

           The Shinwari Commander signals his fighters, surrounding the 
           dying horse.

                                 SHINWARI COMMMANDER
                        Khpala wasla laandey kigdee!

           Mahmoud stands up and Charlie does the same.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Za da Khudalo da paaRa sa na laRam.

                        Khpala wasla laandey kigdee!

           Mahmoud turns to Charlie.
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Put down your gun.

                                 COLCORD
                        Like hell.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        What choice have you got?

           Charlie leans the AK-47 against the gasping horse.

                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Zamoong hokam oomana.

           Charlie puts his hands behind his head and interlaces his 
           fingers.

           The Shinwari Commander studies Charlie with curiosity.

           With a nod of the Commander’s head, the fighters grab Mahmoud 
           by his arms and lead him roughly away.

                                 COLCORD
                        He's mine.  I brought him across 
                        the mountains.

           The Shinwari Commander gazes at Colcord with black eyes under 
           a dark brow.

                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Men do not belong to other men.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHASM - DAY

           The Shinwari Fighters march Charlie and Mahmoud through an 
           endless series of rocky gorges.

           Charlie’s hands are bound at the wrist with hand-woven rope.  
           Salty sweat runs off his brow, stinging his eyes.

                                 COLCORD
                        I thought you knew every rock in 
                        these mountains.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        I do.

                                 COLCORD
                        Then how in the hell’d we get 
                        surprised by forty Shinwari?
                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        Because I led us right to them.

           The young soldier glares at Mahmoud.  The fighter just grins 
           wickedly.

           Charlie loses his footing and stumbles to the ground.  A 
           Shinwari fighter SLAMS THE BOY IN THE RIBS with a rifle butt.

           Charlie clenches his teeth against the pain and struggles to 
           his feet.

           Mahmoud is jerked forward on his catch rope.  He smiles at 
           Charlie.

                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT’D)
                        See how you like it, cowboy.

           Charlie does not have strength to retort.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GULLY - DAY

           The Tribesmen pause to water their horses in the trickling 
           creek of a dry arroyo.  

           Charlie and Mahmoud drop to their knees in the mud and 
           greedily lap up the brown water like dogs.

           Charlie pants for air.  His strength is sapped.

                                 COLCORD
                        I should have listened.  I should 
                        have listened to you, Mahmoud.

           Mahmoud turns to him, glassy-eyed and flushed.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        My son will be the one to end the 
                        war with the Shinwari.

                                 COLCORD
                        Your sons are dead.

           Mahmoud’s eyes are ablaze, his parched voice a fervent, reedy 
           whisper.

                                 AL-WAHIRI
                        But you are alive.  When I saw you 
                        shoot that rabbit in the desert, I 
                        knew Allah sent you to me.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AL-WAHIRI (CONT'D)
                        I was going to kill you that night 
                        but I did not.  You are my son.  
                        You are the son in my dream.

           The Shinwari Commander SAVAGELY KICKS MAHMOUD with the heel 
           of his boot.

                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Silence!

                                 COLCORD
                        He’s running a fever.  He needs 
                        help!

           The Shinwari Commander puts his boot on Charlie’s neck, 
           pressing the boy’s face into the mud.

                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Silence.

           EXT. SHINWARI  ENCAMPMENT – NIGHT

           Forty Shinwari fighters march Charlie and Mahmoud into camp 
           at gunpoint.

           The camp is a few scattered mud and timber shacks surrounded 
           by earthwork battlements topped with barbed wire.

                                 COLCORD
                        Where are you taking us?

           The Shinwari Commander BELTS COLCORD IN THE KIDNEY with the 
           wooden stock of his Khyber rifle.  Colcord stumbles forward, 
           coughing and gasping for breath.

           The gunmen march him toward a wooden shack.

           INT. SHINWARI BARRACKS – NIGHT

           Charlie stoops in the low-ceilinged shack.  Four Shinwari 
           stand at the opposite wall, rifles pointing toward him. 

           Charlie looks to the window to see Mahmoud out in the yard--

           EXT. SHINWARI BARRACKS - SAME

           --Gunmen march Mahmoud around by his catch rope like a dog on 
           a leash.  Dozens of fighters laugh and jeer, belting Mahmoud 
           with rocks and sticks.
           INT. SHINWARI BARRACKS - SAME

           Charlie lies down on the floor, exhausted.  His lips are dry 
           and cracked.  His tongue thick from dehydration.

           Charlie’s head slowly sinks to the floor.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHINWARI BARRACKS - MORNING

           THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Charlie’s guards stand at stiff 
           attention.  Head reeling, Charlie rises slowly to his feet.

           THE SHINWARI WARLORD enters.  He wears long flowing robes 
           like a Mullah and his chest is crossed with ammunition belts.

                                 COLCORD
                        You in charge here?  You speak 
                        American?

           The Warlord examines Colcord with curiosity.

                                 WARLORD
                        I am Husayn Abdullah.

           Charlie looks up at him with weary eyes.

                                 COLCORD
                        I hear you bombed an embassy.

                                 WARLORD
                        You must have heard that from an 
                        Afridi.

                                 COLCORD
                        What are you doing with Mahmoud?

           The Warlord motions to the guards.  THEY BELT COLCORD IN THE 
           BACK OF THE LEGS.  Charlie sinks to the ground on his knees.

                                 WARLORD
                        What happens to the oath-breaker is 
                        not your concern.

                                 COLCORD
                        You’re damn right it’s my concern.  
                        My whole unit gave their lives in 
                        them mountains hunting him!

           The Warlord nods to his men who BEAT COLCORD DOWN WITH THE 
           BUTTS OF THEIR RIFLES.  
           The stab away at the young soldier’s ribs, head, and chest 
           until the Warlord finally stays them with the sweep of his 
           hand.

                                 WARLORD
                        Your comrade’s fate is not your 
                        fate.

                                 COLCORD
                        The hell does that mean.

                                 WARLORD
                        Men fight together, but they die 
                        alone.

           Charlie looks up at the Warlord’s battle-scarred face.  

           Charlie’s wrists are bruised blue and rope-burned.  He 
           breaths heavily, blood sputtering from his lips.

                                 COLCORD
                        How did you know to look for us?

                                 WARLORD
                        Your countrymen told us you’d be 
                        coming through.

                                 COLCORD
                        What countrymen?

           The Warlord snaps his fingers and a guard opens the door to 
           the shack.

           MILLER AND HIS THREE MERCENARIES crowd into the room, 
           grinning.

           Miller still proudly wears Charlie’s M21 Sniper Rifle over 
           his shoulder.  He hooks his thumbs in his belt and stares 
           down at the beaten soldier.

                                 MILLER
                        Hello, Jarhead.

           Colcord lifts his eyes to fix Miller with a stare.

                                 COLCORD
                        “Jarhead’s” a Marine, dumb ass.  
                        I’m a US Army Ranger.

                                 MILLER
                        You’re all jarheads to me.

           Colcord spits a wad of blood on the wooden floor.
                                 COLCORD
                        You got the same haircut I do.

                                 MILLER
                        What was that, boy?

           The Shinwari Warlord cuts Miller off.

                                 WARLORD
                        What was the price we agreed upon?

           Miller relaxes and faces the Warlord.  Miller is so tall he 
           must duck the ceiling joists in the wooden shack.

                                 MILLER
                        Even split of twenty-five million.

           The Shinwari Warlord crouches down to the ground to face 
           Colcord.

                                 WARLORD
                        What do you think, Jarhead?  Your 
                        countrymen sold you out.  Should I 
                        give them a fair split?

           Colcord says nothing.

           The Warlord nods to his guards.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Give it to them.

           SHINWARI GUARDS

           put finger to trigger, SPRAYING MILLER AND THE MERCS WITH 
           BULLETS.  The sound is deafening in the tiny room.

           Charlie shuts his eyes, his face spackled with other men’s 
           blood.

           The Mercs bodies TWITCH AND MOAN.

           THE SHINWARI COMMANDER

           enters the shack with his rifle cocked.  The warrior walks 
           matter-of-factly from one body to the next, finishing each 
           life with a BURST TO THE HEAD.

           He has done this before.

           MILLER

           is left alive, shaking spasmodically.  He crawls on his 
           bleeding belly, reaching feebly for the M21 rifle.
           THE SHINWARI COMMANDER

           kicks the M21 out of Miller’s reach.

                                 COLCORD
                        Finish him.

                                 WARLORD
                        No.

                                 COLCORD
                        He’s suffering.

                                 WARLORD
                        Exactly.

           The Warlord turns and leaves the shack.  Miller rolls his 
           eyes up toward Colcord.

                                 MILLER
                        It’s him you shoulda been trying to 
                        kill.

                                 COLCORD
                        I got no orders on that.  Can’t go 
                        killing every tribal leader in the 
                        country - we’d have no allies.

           Miller turns and spits blood.

                                 MILLER
                        Your intel ain’t worth shit.  It 
                        was Abdullah who blew up that 
                        embassy.

                                 COLCORD
                        You mean al-Wahiri.

                                 MILLER
                        Al-Wahiri was five hundred miles 
                        away in Peshawar.

           With each exhalation red air bubbles SPUTTER AND POP from the 
           hole in Miller’s lung.  Colcord’s hands are bound and he can 
           do nothing but watch.

                                 COLCORD
                        If Abdullah blew up that embassy, 
                        why you doing business with him?

           Miller grins, his body shivering violently, bleeding out.
                                 MILLER
                        You know what I was, before I was a 
                        PMC?

           Colcord watches the hot blood pool and drip through the 
           knotted grain of the floor boards.

                                 COLCORD
                        You were a jarhead.

                                 MILLER
                        5th Regiment.  Back when we were 
                        allied with the Afridi against the 
                        Shinwari.

           Miller clutches his chest, fighting the convulsions of his 
           body.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        You stay here long enough boy, 
                        you’ll do business with everybody.

           Miller’s body SHAKES VIOLENTLY.  He reaches for one of 
           Colcord’s bound hands and presses it tight.

                                 COLCORD
                        Semper fidelis.

           Miller smiles grimly.

                                 MILLER
                        Not always.

           Miller’s eyes stop tracking and turn to glass.  The red 
           pulsing of his blood slows to a trickle.

           EXT. SHINWARI ENCAMPMENT – DAY

           The sky is grey white on the barren slopes.  Guards march 
           Charlie outside to a mass grave.

           Charlie stands there waiting, his hands bound tight.

           THE SHINWARI GUARDS

           carry the dead Mercs from the barracks and stack the bodies 
           up by the freshly dug pit.  They wordlessly tug off the 
           Mercs’ boots and sort through their weapons.

           The fighters check the Mercs’ pockets for money and remove 
           watches and jewelry.

           COLCORD
           watches in disgust as the Shinwari Guards check the insides 
           of the Mercs’ mouths for gold teeth.

           EXT. SHINWARI ENCAMPMENT - THE GUARDS

           two-man the dead Mercs by the shoulders and feet to swing 
           them into the pit.

           COLCORD’S EYES

           dart right to left.  His breathing is coming in fast and 
           short.

           THE GUARDS

           kick at Charlie’s legs, forcing him to his knees beside the 
           grave.  THEY POINT THEIR GUNS AT HIS HEAD.

                                 GUARDS
                        Darbandey orkam!  Zamoong hokam 
                        oomana!

           THE SHINWARI COMMANDER

           aims his Khyber Rifle point blank at Colcord’s forehead.  He 
           gestures the other guards out of the way, clearing the path 
           of his shot.

                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Zamoong hokam oomana.

           COLCORD

           squeezes his eyes shut.

                                 COLCORD
                        Our father, who art in heaven, 
                        hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom 
                        come, thy will be done, in heaven 
                        as it is on earth...

           THE WARLORD

           approaches.  He is eating figs and spitting out the seeds.

                                 WARLORD
                        Poz waslawaal saRee US Army qatala.

                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Darbandey orkam.

                                 WARLORD
                        Qatala US Army mawt dam.
                                 SHINWARI COMMANDER
                        Da khatar ilaaga!  Charaba dam min 
                        jabal!

           The Warlord reaches his hand inside Colcord’s t-shirt and 
           pulls out the boy’s dog tags.

                                 WARLORD
                        Adreega qatala US Army Rangers.

           The Warlord finishes his last fig and wipes his hands on his 
           dupatta.  He picks seeds from his teeth with his dirty 
           fingers.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Stand up.

           Charlie stands up.  The Warlord examines the young soldier.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Waslawaal sa-ree US Army Ranger, 
                        chab.

           He pats the young soldier on the cheek and addresses his men.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Intaha fili ra-da chab uhbala 
                        Mahmoud Ahman al-Wahiri!

           The guards smile and laugh.  The Warlord points to Mahmoud 
           across the yard.

           EXT. YARD - AL-WAHIRI

           stands waist-deep in a pit, tied to a stake.  Gunmen fill the 
           hole with dirt and pack it down hard with the backs of their 
           shovels.

           Mahmoud cannot budge.

           EXT. YARD - THE WARLORD

           turns to face Colcord.  The Warlord places a hand on 
           Charlie’s shoulder.

                                 WARLORD
                        You delivered this man to us.

                                 COLCORD
                        I’m delivering this man to see 
                        justice.
                                 WARLORD
                        And he shall have it.

           The Warlord points south to where the steep foothills break 
           and descend to the valley.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Walk to that ridge and do not look 
                        back.

                                 COLCORD
                        Mahmoud didn’t bomb that embassy, 
                        did he.

                                 WARLORD
                        Walk to that ridge.

                                 COLCORD
                        What about Mahmoud.

           Gunmen pat the dirt around Mahmoud with the backs of their 
           shovels, leveling it smooth.

                                 WARLORD
                        This is not your fight.  This was 
                        never your fight.  Even if your 
                        armies were never here, even if al-
                        Wahiri had never killed your 
                        people, this would still be our 
                        fight.  This is not about you.  It 
                        is about the honor of one tribe 
                        against the honor of another.

                                 COLCORD
                        I reckon that’s what this is for 
                        me, too.

                                 WARLORD
                        What is your tribe?  Where are they 
                        now?

                                 COLCORD
                        They’re all dead!  Bringing in him!

                                 WARLORD
                        And did they fight for honor!

                                 COLCORD
                        You’re damn right!

                                 WARLORD
                        And you, boy.  Is that what you 
                        fight for?  Is that why you come 
                        here?
                                 COLCORD
                        I reckon so!

                                 WARLORD
                        No!  You are just a child.

           The battle-wizened Warlord moves to Colcord, his hot breath 
           in the young soldier’s face.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Honor is not something you live 
                        for, it is something you die for.

                                 COLCORD
                        Cut me free.

                                 WARLORD
                        Are you begging me?

           Colcord says nothing.

           The Warlord nods to the Commander who saws the ropes from 
           Charlie’s wrists with a curved, steel Jambiya.

           Charlie looks to Mahmoud buried in the pit.  He looks back to 
           the Warlord, eyes hot with anger.

                                 COLCORD
                        I say you’re a thief.  A common 
                        thief.

                                 WARLORD
                        Walk to that ridge.

                                 COLCORD
                        What about my horse?

                                 WARLORD
                        That was not your horse.

           Charlie’s hands are balled into fists.

                                 COLCORD
                        Well this here’s my gun.

           Charlie reaches for his M21 Rifle, piled amongst scavenged 
           ordnance on the lip of the mass grave.  Shinwari guards 
           immediately raise the automatics at their hips.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Bandooq hay zaywar ka aadmi!

           The Warlord slowly smiles and one by one the Shinwari laugh.
                                 WARLORD
                        Yes, the gun is the jewel of man.

           Colcord lifts his M21 by the strap and shoulders it.

           Shinwari guards stand hipshot, training their Khyber rifles 
           at Colcord’s back.

                                 WARLORD (CONT’D)
                        Walk to that ridge.

           Charlie looks to Mahmoud one last time, the Pashtun’s mouth 
           balled around a gag.  Mahmoud looks at the boy, his dark eyes 
           defiant even in death.

           The young soldier turns and walks for the ridge.

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - SAME

           The Shinwari fighters slowly circle Mahmoud Ahman al-Wahiri.

           Mahmoud chews on his gag, his catch rope tied to a stake. He 
           is buried in the ground up to his waist.

           The tribesmen wrap the ends of their turbans around their 
           mouths, covering their faces except for the eyes.

           THEY PICK UP ROCKS FROM THE GROUND...

           EXT. HILLSIDE - SAME

           Charlie Colcord slowly plods away from the encampment.  
           Heading south.  Gunmen train their weapons on him, marking 
           his progress.

           Even at a distance, Colcord hears the first stones as they 
           strike.

           Colcord keeps walking.

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - SAME

           The tribesmen stone Mahmoud.

           Their rocks are sorted into piles.  Piles of small stones, 
           piles of medium stones, and piles of big stones.

           They draw from the small stones first.
           EXT. RIDGE - COLCORD

           A half mile off.  Charlie reaches the ridge and turns back.

           In the distance, sixty gunmen surround Mahmoud in ancient 
           ritual.

           The stones fall QUICKER AND HARDER.

           The young soldier looks to the west, to Jalalabad.  He looks 
           back to the encampment, Mahmoud in black, half buried in the 
           earth.

           Charlie wipes his eyes with the back of his sleeve.

                                 COLCORD
                        Almighty.

           Charlie squats down, belly to the earth.  He steadies the M21 
           against the rocky outcropping.

           EXT. RIDGE - CHARLIE’S POV

           he finds Mahmoud in the scope, bloodied with stones, but his 
           eyes still fierce with the pride of a fighter.

                                 COLCORD
                        Mahmoud, you got us caught by 
                        Shinwari to set up this shot, I 
                        know you did.

           Colcord settles his cross hairs on Husayn Abdullah.  The tall 
           Warlord circles Mahmoud with stones in his hands, his black 
           shalwar flapping like a top sail in the wind.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        You dreamed I was your son.

           Colcord slows his breathing, steadies his cross hairs, and 
           FIRES.

           The Warlord’s neck VANISHES IN A PLUME OF RED MIST, his tall 
           body wilting to the earth.

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - SHINWARI GUNMEN

           return BLIND BURSTS OF AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE into the surrounding 
           cliffs.

           EXT. RIDGE - COLCORD

           squinting as clumps of dirt EXPLODE AROUND HIM, followed by 
           the distant POPS OF GUNFIRE.
           Charlie blinks away tears and returns his eye to the scope.  
           A raging wind buffets the mountainside.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                        Almighty.

           Charlie licks a knuckle and tests the wind.

           A half mile of distance is a one-in-a-million shot.  Too hard 
           for any man to make twice.  Charlie aims the rifle high and 
           into the wind.

                                 COLCORD (CONT’D)
                             (again)
                        God almighty.

           CHARLIE FIRES.

           The gunshot echoes on the ridge for a long time.  The way a 
           gull can find an eddy in the wind and seem to hang there 
           forever.

           The gunshot lingers long after Charlie ducks down behind the 
           embankment and disappears.

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - SAME

           Mahmoud Ahman al-Wahiri’s body lies slumped to the end of his 
           catch rope, his body quiet.

           Sixty armed fighters crouch to the earth, searching the 
           surrounding ridges for the glint of a scope.

           They turn in circles, slowly, almost religiously.

           Piles of pale stones lie discarded on the parched ground like 
           shattered teeth.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FLATLANDS - DAY

           A soldier finds a ground spigot in an abandoned equipment 
           yard by an empty highway.

           He turns the tap valve and lets the brown water gurgle and 
           sputter until it runs clear.

           The soldier drinks for a long time.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. JALALABAD–KABUL HIGHWAY - DAY

           The long day settles into night, the last rays of the 
           smoldering sun dying in the west.  A soldier walks along the 
           side of the highway.

           His face is spotted with the dried blood of other men.  His 
           clothes are ragged and torn.  And he could benefit from a 
           shower.

           A convoy of AFGHAN TRANSPORT TRUCKS, smuggling all manner of 
           contraband from Pakistan, rumbles past.  The soldier walks 
           backward, thumb outstretched, but none stop for him.

           The soldier’s shoulders hunch against the chill winds as he 
           wraps the dangling end of his turban across his face to 
           shield from the sands.

           His boots trudge along the cracked and gutted road.

           The outskirts of a town open wide before the soldier on the 
           road.  The first outpost of civilization.

           A highway sign announces the town’s name in Arabic.

           And below that, in English...

           Jalalabad.

                                 THE END
