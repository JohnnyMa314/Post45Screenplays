                                   DEAD OF WINTER

                                    Sarah Conradt
           CLOSE ON - A WOMAN'S FACE, BETH

           exhausted, lids heavy - she has no lashes.  Her skin is so 
           pale and bloodless, it's almost translucent.  The SOUND of 
           her breaths in staggered, wheezing draws.  She's dying. 

                                 JO (V.O.)
                        She said she'd always be there.

           Beth swallows.  Her lips part.  She wants to speak.

           But the breath that leaves her now is her last.  

           All intention abandons her face.  

           She's dead.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY (FROM ABOVE)

           Beth lies in bed below us, bald and emaciated.  Her night 
           stand is topped by a pharmacy of MEDS.  An IV is threaded 
           into her arm.  This is not a hospital room, but a large 
           upstairs bedroom with floor-to-ceiling picture windows 
           looking out on SNOW.

           An 11 year-old GIRL sits beside Beth.  They've been holding 
           hands, but the girl lets go now. 

                                 JO (V.O.)
                        I guess it's just something mothers 
                        say.  

           A MAN enters the room.  He checks for Beth's pulse - and then 
           slumps to the bed, turns to the girl, reaches for her hand - 
           but the girl just gets up and LEAVES the room.  We float to 
           the window and OUTSIDE...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - DAY (FROM ABOVE)

           The girl emerges from the house into the endless white of NEW 
           SNOW, her footprints trailing her into the yard.  She stops 
           here.  Sinks to her knees.  Lies back in the snow.

           And we see her face for the first time --

           JOSEPHINE ASH

           Sorrow and disappointment tinge the beginnings of an 
           accessible, homegrown beauty.  She's already wearing her 
           letdown like a mask.

                                 JO (V.O)
                        She lied to me.  
           Jo fans her arms and legs in slow, wide sweeps until A SNOW 
           ANGEL emerges beneath her.   

           She rolls off and lies beside it.  Turns to face it.  Draws 
           her knees up like a small child.  And places her hand where 
           the angel's hand might be.

                                 JO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They all do.

                                                           WHITE SCREEN

           EXT. SKY - DAY 

           Gradual fissures in the WHITENESS reveal a winter cloudy sky 
           as we BREAK THROUGH the clouds to --

           EXT. ALPINE WILDERNESS (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 

           A fairy-tale perfection to this winter wonderland studded 
           with snow-capped evergreens and unmarred fields of white.  
           SKIMMING above the treetops, the only trace of civilization 
           below is a winding, TWO-LANE HIGHWAY snaking its way through 
           the snow-covered peaks and valleys.  

           Following the curves of the road, we FIND A LONE SUV.

           PUSH IN on the SUV until we come upon A BACK WINDOW --

           JO'S FACE 

           14 now - braces gone, too much black eyeliner and black nail 
           polish - leaning against the glass, listening to an IPOD and 
           TEXTING on her cell phone.  A yellow LAB beside her - RUFUS.

           INT. SUV - DAY

           DIANE - 30s, everyday pretty and happy in love - is craned 
           around from the front passenger seat, LIPS MOVING, tongue 
           wagging at Jo - but all we HEAR is Jo's MUSIC.  

           CLOSE ON PHONE SCREEN: "help stepmonster wnts 2 tlk"

           REPLY: "cn u ditch?"

           Jo punches the keys.

           CLOSE ON PHONE SCREEN: "trapd - drvN"

           REPLY: "u poor thng"

           Jo reluctantly tugs out her earbuds.  Looks at Diane.  
                                 JO
                        What?

                                 DIANE
                        I was just saying, I'm so glad I 
                        finally get to see this place I've 
                        heard so much about.  

           The man we saw at Beth's side - DR. CAM ASH, late 40s - 
           drives.  A man of practicality and determination, he goes to 
           great lengths not to show the cracks in the foundation.  

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        When we get there, I'm hoping 
                        you'll show me the ropes?

                                 JO 
                        Sure.  No problem.  
                             (deadpan)
                        And after that, I'll show you the 
                        bed my mom died in.

           Awkward.

           Jo pets Rufus.

           CAM'S EYES IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR meet Jo's.  Reprimand.

           Diane faces front and ignores the slight.  Her hand finds 
           Cam's knee - it's okay, let her be.

                                 DIANE
                        This trip will be good for us.   

           Jo rolls her eyes.  Earbuds back in.  Thumbs punch, texting.

           CLOSE ON PHONE SCREEN: "It's oficial. I'm n hell."

           Jo sends the message.  A beat later: "No Signal"

           In THE REFLECTION of her window, Jo sees the GLINT off 
           Diane's WEDDING RING, and her heart breaks a little bit more.  

           She looks OUT THE WINDOW, anywhere but at that ring.

           JO'S POV - A "FOR SALE" SIGN ALONG THE ROAD

           an abandoned vacation home.  And another...  The recession 
           has hit this place hard.

           And then - a glimpse of SOMETHING THRASHING in the snow.  

                                 JO 
                        Dad!  Stop!
                                 CAM
                        What's wrong?

                                 JO
                        Just pull over!

           Cam pulls the SUV to the shoulder.  Even before the tires 
           stop moving, Jo is out and running back down the highway.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Jo stops at the DITCH where a DOE is struggling to get up, 
           hind-legs crushed and useless.  BLOOD rivers from her snout 
           staining the white snow red.

           Cam and Diane rush up beside Jo.  Rufus BARKS from the SUV.

                                 CAM
                        What the hell are you doing? 

           Then he sees.  Softens.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Jo listen, they jump out in the 
                        road all the time up here.  

           Snow tumbles down the hillside, making them all look up.

           THE DOE'S FAWN 

           darts back and forth in panicked bursts above them, 
           distressed, bleating out a PLAINTIVE CALL.

                                 JO 
                        We have to do something.  
                             (off Cam's reluctance)
                        You're a doctor.  Dad - please! 

           Cam relents, goes to the car, pops open the hatch, rifles 
           through the bags and groceries and Christmas packages, tugs 
           out his MEDICAL BAG - and returns to the ditch.

           He approaches the doe cautiously, sliding down the embankment 
           as she flails in fear.  Jo follows, hopeful.

                                 CAM
                        Go back to the car, Jo.

                                 JO
                        But, I want to help.

                                 CAM
                        Go.  Please.
                                 JO 
                        What are you going to do?  

                                 CAM 
                        She won't make it.    

           Cam removes A SCALPEL from his bag.  It registers.

                                 JO
                        You're going to kill her?  

                                 CAM
                        Jo, go back to the car.

           Jo hesitates - then reluctantly climbs back up to the road.  
           Diane extends her arms in sympathy, but Jo steps around her - 
           Don't touch me! - and turns to stare daggers at her dad.

                                 JO 
                        I should've known I couldn't trust 
                        you to save her. 

           Cam feels the weight of his daughter's words.  

           Jo gets back in the SUV and slams the door.  

           THE FAWN bleats another frightened cry...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN DRIVEWAY - EARLY EVENING

           The SUV chugs up a rutted, snow-packed driveway until it 
           meets with a huge FALLEN TREE blocking the way and stops.  Jo 
           gets out of the car with her backpack and marches away INTO 
           THE WOODS.  No looking back.  Rufus follows.   

           Diane climbs out, CALLS after her.

                                 DIANE
                        Jo, wait!

           Cam collects the bags.  No patience for the long-suffering.

                                 CAM
                        Let her go.  She knows the way.

                                 DIANE 
                        This is hard for her, Cam.

                                 CAM
                        She's making it harder than it has 
                        to be.

           Diane watches Jo and the dog disappear through the trees.
           EXT. WOODS - EARLY EVENING 

           Jo's IPOD is BLASTING.  She marches beneath winter-bare 
           branches, fighting the snow tugging at her boots.  Fighting 
           everything.

           UP AHEAD - THE GLIMPSE OF A LARGE CHALET-STYLE HOUSE

           barely discernible through the trees.

           Jo turns the other way.  Won't look at it.  She just can't.  
           She hikes UP THE MOUNTAINSIDE.  Stumbles.  Picks herself up 
           and keeps climbing until the house is far behind her.

           A SPLIT RAIL FENCE 

           Jo rips out her earbuds, leans into the rail, tears imminent.

           Stillness.   

           A ROBIN chortles and tuts on a branch overhead.

           Nothing else makes a sound.  Until -- 

           A THUNDERING, a pounding and rumble as something large and 
           powerful CAREENS into the fence right where Jo stands.  Stops 
           there.  Looms.  Blowing STEAM...

           A HORSE.

           Jo reaches up and grips the halter with both hands, pressing 
           her lips to the big black Percheron's muzzle.  An old friend.

                                 JO
                        Missed you too, Gunther.  How 'bout 
                        you and me run away together?  

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
                        Josephine Ash?  Is that you?

           Jo peers around Gunther's enormous head, but hides there too.  
           LOIS, 70s - stout and bull-headed with a heart of gold - 
           slogs her way down from the stable.  

                                 LOIS
                        My God look at you.  The spitting 
                        image of your ma.  
                             (this poor kid --)
                        How you gettin' along, darlin'?  

                                 JO
                        I'm, you know, fine I guess.  

           Rufus wags and jumps up and smothers Lois with kisses.  
                                 LOIS
                        Lord, it's nice to see a familiar 
                        face.  Been so quiet on this 
                        mountain the past couple years.  No 
                        one comes up anymore, everyone's 
                        selling.  Even my grand-daughter 
                        Maya moved out.  You remember Maya - 
                        she used to watch you when your 
                        folks were building the house?

           Jo remembers.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Just me and Gunther now.  And the 
                        occasional check-in from our 
                        neighborly park ranger.  

           Jo nuzzles Gunther, avoids Lois's penetrating gaze.  Beat.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        This is your first trip back since 
                        your ma died, ain't it?
                             (a nod from Jo)
                        Your dad just remarried I heard.  
                        You like her?

           A sneer.  Oh what Jo would say if she dared.  

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Gotta be something worthwhile about 
                        her if your dad picked her out of 
                        all the other fish?

                                 JO
                        She's a school counselor.  I think 
                        he's hoping she'll fix me.  

                                 LOIS 
                        Who says you're broke?

           Jo just strokes Gunther's muzzle.  Lois smiles sympathetic.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Been down that road.  Maya's always 
                        been a magnet for trouble.  Finds 
                        that girl wherever she is, never 
                        once had to go looking for it.  

           Lois's hand moves to Jo's - a pat, a squeeze.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Listen, I know what it feels like 
                        to lose someone.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Your heart just doesn't wanna go 
                        there ever again, I know.  But in 
                        the end, the honest to God truth?  
                        People need people.  It's just the 
                        way we're made.

           Jo suddenly wants out of this conversation.  

                                 JO
                        Well, I should probably go now, so.  

           Jo and Rufus turn back down the mountain.  Lois CALLS out --

                                 LOIS
                        Give it time, Jo.  

           Jo's eyes well...  but no, damn it!  She won't cry.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - EVENING

           All timber beams and stone and picture windows with snow 
           spread like frosting on the sharp peak of the roof.  It sits 
           nestled between the woods and an endless white valley with a 
           view of forever.  Idyllic.

           JO'S POV - FROM THE WOODS

           shadowing CAM AND DIANE as they trudge up the driveway on 
           foot - weighed down by bags and supplies.  Cam backtracks to 
           help Diane with her load.

           Diane stops, breathless - looks up at the impressive house.

                                 DIANE
                        This is no little cabin in the 
                        woods, Cam.

           Cam steps up on the porch - takes in the position of a bench, 
           a padlocked storage box...  Something's off.

                                 DIANE (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 CAM
                             (covering)
                        Nothing.  Just been a long time.

           Jo watches them go inside.  She looks up at the -- 

           UPSTAIRS PICTURE WINDOWS

           -- where a FLOCK of passing BIRDS is reflected in the glass. 

           THE CLOUDS are threatening.  
           Jo holds out her hand.  A SNOWFLAKE lands in her palm...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - FOYER - EVENING

           High beam ceilings, open spaces and WALLS OF WINDOWS inviting 
           the trees inside.  OPEN STRING STAIRS from the foyer rise 
           above the kitchen, leading to A CATWALK framing the floor 
           below.  This is a tree-house all grown up and showing off.

           KITCHEN

           Diane sets down a bag of groceries.  DUST plumes up from the 
           counter.  Cam swipes at a cobweb.

                                 CAM
                        I'm sorry, I should have come up 
                        first and taken care of all this.  

           Diane brushes a string of cobweb from his hair.  Smiles.

                                 DIANE
                        Four months ago I made a promise - 
                        it includes cobwebs.  We're in this 
                        together now, remember? 

           Cam remembers.  They hold each other, kiss - and mean it. 

           ABOVE THEM - JO is visible through the slats between the 
           stairs, stealing her way up.  They hear her, look up.   

                                 CAM
                        We could use some help down here. 

                                 JO
                        I'll be down in a minute.  

           But, she won't.  She knows it.  They know it.  She takes the 
           remaining steps up in two's.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - EVENING

           Jo walks down the corridor, slows - approaching A BEDROOM 
           DOOR midway down.  Stops.  We notice her GNAWED PAINTED BLACK 
           NAILS tugging at the seam on her jeans.  Nervous.  

           JO'S POV - MASTER BEDROOM 

           The picture windows.  The bed.  The night stand.  This is the 
           room where her mother died.  Jo can't look long.  Walks on.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BATHROOM - EVENING

           Jo draws a BATH.  The water runs RUSTY at first, then clears.  
           Waiting for the tub to fill, she's drawn to THE HUTCH.  Her 
           fingers pass over the dusty jars of bath-salts and bottles of 
           perfume, an old silver hair clip - her mother's things.  

           INSIDE THE HUTCH - jars of old nail polish, lipstick - and 
           OLD BOTTLES OF PILLS.  Dozens of them - sedatives, pain-
           killers, sleep-aids - all prescribed to "ELIZABETH ASH".  

                                 BETH (OS)
                        You're my angel. 

           JO'S VISION - BETH

           now sitting in the tub, wan, smiling at Jo through the pain.  

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        I remember when it was me taking 
                        care of you.  How I loved washing 
                        your hair when you were little.  

           Jo looks at her mother with a heavy heart.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        You'd lay your head back in my hand 
                        - do you remember?  But you were 
                        always so afraid I'd let go.  Did I 
                        ever let go, Josey?  Ever once?  

           Jo reaches for the faucet and turns off the water.  The tub 
           is full now -- and empty.

           THE LIGHTS FLICKER.  SNOW flurries against the glass.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON - A HANDPRINT IN DUST

           not immediately recent, but more so than the dust around it.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - NIGHT

           Cam stares at the shelf, at the handprint - looks at the 
           floor - clods of old DRIED MUD off someone's boots...

                                 JO (OS)
                        So what did you want help with? 

           Cam turns and walks out of the pantry past her.

                                 CAM
                        It's all been done.
           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           A FIRE pops in the commanding stone fireplace, dancing 
           shadows across a collection of ANTIQUE STEEL JAW ANIMAL TRAPS 
           adorning the walls.  Jo and Cam eat at the big table.  Jo 
           reacts to the impossibly high WINDOWS shuddering in the WIND.

                                 JO
                        Did you bother to check the weather 
                        reports before we left home?

                                 CAM
                        Sometimes life throws curve balls, 
                        Jo - and all we can do is take our 
                        best swing.

                                 JO 
                        So that would be a no.  

                                 CAM
                        Tell you what - tomorrow, we'll go 
                        out and cut down our Christmas tree 
                        like we used to, okay?

           Jo shrugs.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        I remember when you loved coming 
                        here.  You never wanted to leave.

                                 JO
                        That was a long time ago.

           Cam knows it was.

           Jo glances at the unattended place-setting across the table.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Where is she, anyway?

                                 CAM
                        She has a name.   

           Jo rakes a fork through her meal.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        I wanna hear you say it.  Diane.   

           Jo takes a bite.  Chews.  Won't be bossed.  

           Cam stares right through her.  

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Shame on you.
           Jo feels this.  To the core.

           Cam looks down at his plate, eats.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Diane was tired and went up to bed.  
                        You need to start helping out more.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo sits on the edge of her bed.  A PHOTO OF BETH on the night-
           stand when she was beautiful, holding baby Jo.  Jo reaches 
           out - and LAYS IT FACE DOWN.  Doesn't want to look at it. 

           The WIND HOWLS outside.  The storm is in full swing.

           The LIGHTS SPUTTER.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Cam sits alone at the table with a near-empty bottle of wine.  
           The fire is dying.  As he drinks, his eyes are riveted on a 
           shelf in the kitchen... 

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Cam approaches the shelf and pulls down the object he's been 
           fixated on - A BLUE MUG.  He turns it in his hand - "World's 
           Greatest Mom".  Stares at it a beat longer, affected.

           And then tucks it way in the back, out of sight. 

           The BACK DOOR rattles in the wind.

           Cam checks THE LOCK twice - uneasy about something...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON - THE ROBIN

           tittering from its morning post on a snow-heavy branch.  WIND 
           whips.  The branch sways.  ICICLES clatter...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MORNING

           SNOW DRIFTS that weren't here yesterday reach up the exterior 
           walls of the house, swallowing up lower windows and the front 
           door where a path has recently been shoveled.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Jo stands at the mirror in her underwear, applying her 
           trademark black eyeliner.  She needs more light.  FLIPS the 
           SWITCH - the bulb only pulses a buzzing low light.
                                 JO
                        Great.

           The OS WHINE of a CHAIN SAW...

           Jo moves to THE WINDOW.  Peers out.  

           JO'S POV - ROAD UP TO HOUSE 

           Through the BLOWING SNOW, CAM slices into the fallen tree.  

           Something in the distance CATCHES JO'S EYE.  

           JO'S POV - VALLEY

           A SMALL, DARK SPECK moves through the storm, through the 
           otherwise BOUNDLESS WHITE a mile out.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - STAIRCASE LANDING - MORNING

           Jo grabs up the BINOCULARS from the window ledge and sits on 
           the stairs, watching out the window - still in her underwear.

           BINOCULARS POV - VALLEY

           The small dark speck is SOMEONE APPROACHING on foot - hooded 
           in a dark coat - flinging each snowshoe ahead with 
           exhaustion, not walking as much as throwing himself forward.   

                                 JO
                        Someone's out there.

           GREAT ROOM

           Diane sits on the floor with a TRUNK OF DECORATIONS, 
           unsnarling garlands from a mix of all things Christmas - 
           frees an ornament from the tangle, and looks up.

                                 DIANE
                        Who?  

                                 JO
                        A man, I guess.  Hard to tell.

           Diane walks up to Jo on the landing.  Peers out.  

                                 DIANE
                        Anyone you know?

                                 JO
                        Not likely.

                                 DIANE 
                        Can I see?
           Jo passes Diane the binoculars.  

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        Looks like he's headed this way.

           Diane SHIVERS.  Returns the binoculars to Jo.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                             (off Jo's scant attire)
                        Maybe you should get dressed?

           Jo ignores Diane, re-affixing herself to the binoculars.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - MORNING

           Cam shuts off the chain saw and stops for a break.  A sip 
           from his thermos.  Gazes out over the vast white valley.

           CAM'S POV - VALLEY

           The MAN is nearer, maybe half a mile now, movement more 
           staggered.

           EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

           The man's SNOWSHOES trudge through the deep, new snow.  He's 
           fatigued, working hard, head down, face concealed beneath his 
           hood.  He COUGHS, pushing on with everything he's got.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - MORNING

           A beat as Cam observes the man's approach.  Then Cam sets the 
           saw down and heads back up to the house, fighting the wind, 
           sinking knee deep in the snow with each step forward.

           EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

           -- the man keeps treading onward.  At intervals, sprayed 
           amidst his snowshoe tracks - BLOOD.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - STAIRCASE LANDING

           Jo's fingers shift on the binoculars...

           BINOCULARS POV - VALLEY

           The man plows up and over the rise from the valley.  
           Stumbles, struggles, hauls himself up, determined to keep 
           moving.  His face never lifting.  Just driving forward.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MORNING

           Cam and the man intersect in front of the house.  Cam stops.  
           The man doesn't.
                                 CAM
                        Hello?  

           THE EMBLEM ON THE MAN'S COAT: U.S. PARK SERVICE.

           The ranger lumbers past Cam as if he hasn't even seen him.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Hey - you all right?

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - STAIRCASE LANDING - SAME TIME

           Jo dashes up the stairs.  The SOUND of her door shutting.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MORNING

           Diane opens the front door.  The ranger moves onto the porch 
           and falls at her feet - not a single step more.

           Cam rushes to his side, holds him upright.

                                 CAM
                             (to Diane)
                        Help me get him inside.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - MORNING

           Cam and Diane usher the ranger to a chair near the fire.  
           He's wiped out, SHUDDERING.  Diane quickly grabs a blanket 
           from the sofa and drapes it over him.

           Cam notices the spray of BLOOD on the ranger's pants.

                                 CAM
                        Where are you hurt?  

           The ranger looks up, haunted, as if he inexplicably thought 
           he was here all alone.  Gradually, he takes in the room, the 
           blood on his pants, Cam and Diane...  

           Cam pushes back the ranger's hood.  Surprisingly, he's young - 
           20s, distressed, traumatized, with a BLOODY NOSE - and 
           handsome.  Arrestingly so. 

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                             (to Diane)
                        Could you get me my bag?  It's in 
                        the closet.

           Cam moves in to get a better look at the bloody nose.  The 
           ranger JOLTS back.  
                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        I'm a doctor.  I just wanna take a 
                        look.

           The ranger eases down enough for Cam to peer at the CAKED 
           BLOOD around his nostrils.  Diane delivers the MEDICAL BAG 
           and Cam tugs on surgical gloves, reaches to the ranger's 
           face, sees him struggling to stay alert.  

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        What's your name?

                                 RANGER/ANDY
                             (barely audible)
                        Andy.

                                 CAM 
                        You were pushing yourself pretty 
                        hard out there, Andy. 

           Cam prepares a swath of gauze with an antiseptic wash and 
           dabs it to ANDY's nose.

                                 ANDY
                        It's bad...

                                 CAM
                        What's bad - the pain?

                                 ANDY
                        The station...  

                                 CAM
                        The ranger station?  What happened?

                                 ANDY
                        Dug myself out.  I left them...

           Andy's eyes close, he's fading.

                                 CAM 
                        Andy?

           His eyes open.  He looks at Cam.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        What happened at the station?  You 
                        left who?  Were there others up 
                        there with you? 

           But, Andy is too weak now.  His eyes close again, his head 
           lolls, so much more than just fatigued - depleted.  He's out. 

           Cam looks at Diane, at the RATTLING WINDOWS, at the STORM...
           Jo stands on the stairs now, dressed, made up.

                                 JO
                        What's wrong with him?

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BASEMENT DEN - MORNING

           A big room with a sofa, wet bar, books, games, storage...

           Cam and Diane lower a torpid Andy to the sofa.  Cam peels off 
           Andy's damp shirt - and A CELL-PHONE tumbles to the floor.  
           Diane picks it up and slips it into the breast pocket of 
           Andy's coat.  Bundles him in a blanket, pillow under his head.  

           He MUMBLES something senseless in his stupor.

           Cam leans close, tries again.

                                 CAM
                        Andy?  Can you hear me?  Are there 
                        others up there who need help?

           Nothing.

           Jo watches from a distance.  Nothing more Cam can find out 
           right now.  He leaves Andy to sleep and ushers Jo upstairs.

           Before Diane follows them up, she tucks a second blanket 
           around Andy, it's cold.  Sets his boots neat and tidy at the 
           foot of the sofa - and looks up to find his eyes on her.

           Then his lids fall again and he sinks back into a deep sleep.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - MORNING

           Diane comes up from the basement and pulls the door partly 
           closed, Andy just visible at the base of the stairs.

           Cam is in THE PANTRY, Jo still watching him.  

                                 JO 
                        What are you doing?

           Cam emerges a beat later with A SHOTGUN - checking to see if 
           it's loaded.  Looks at Diane.

                                 CAM 
                        Ever use one of these?

                                 DIANE
                        You're kidding...  right?

           The look on Cam's face - there's her answer.
                                 JO 
                        What do we need that for?

                                 CAM
                        Someone's been here.  Don't know 
                        how long ago and probably nothing 
                        to worry about, but just in case, I 
                        want you to keep this on hand.

                                 JO
                        Dad, you're scaring me.

                                 CAM
                        Which is why I didn't say anything 
                        earlier.

                                 DIANE
                        Cam, I'll let you know right now I 
                        won't be shooting anybody.   

                                 CAM
                        Some things can't be talked 
                        through, Diane.  

           Cam puts the shotgun in Diane's hands and pulls on his coat.  

                                 DIANE
                        Where are you going?  

                                 CAM
                        He said he left them.  We both 
                        heard it.  

                                 DIANE
                        Who knows what he meant.  He was 
                        out of it.  

                                 CAM
                        Look, if there are others up there, 
                        they probably need help.  I have to 
                        check it out.

                                 JO
                        Why can't we just call somebody?  
                        Why do you have to go?

                                 CAM
                        We have no cell reception.

                                 JO
                        But what about Lois' radio?  Why 
                        can't we just have her call out?
                                 CAM
                        I wouldn't know what to tell them 
                        yet, Jo.  I'm not gonna ask anyone 
                        to come 40 miles from town in this 
                        weather without good reason.

                                 DIANE
                        How far is the station?

                                 CAM 
                        Only about two miles.  I'll take 
                        the old Ski-Doo in the shed.  Won't 
                        take me long.

           Cam pulls two WALKIE-TALKIES from a drawer behind him, 
           depresses the buttons on both - charged.  

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        These only have a short range, but 
                        should be enough to keep us 
                        connected.

           He hands one to Jo.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        I'll let you know what I find up 
                        there and if need be, you can hike 
                        up to Lois' place and radio out.

           Cam tugs on his hat.  His scarf.  Gloves.

                                 DIANE
                        I don't think this is a good idea.

                                 CAM
                        And I don't think I have a choice.

           Cam collects his MEDICAL BAG.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Generator's running, but use power 
                        sparingly.  We're low on propane. 

           A kiss to Diane.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        I'll be back in an hour at the 
                        most.
                             (to Jo)
                        Curve balls, remember?  

           And he exits.
           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           ICICLES tremble like fangs on bare swaying branches...

           A JACK RABBIT twitches in the wind and snow - listening, the 
           pounding of its little heart making its whole body tremble...

           The OS SOUND of a SNOWMOBILE ENGINE roaring past...

           EXT. VALLEY - MORNING

           The moving SPECK that is Cam on his snowmobile coasts across 
           the wide expanse of valley and slips into the white.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - MORNING

           Diane fumbles with the shotgun like it might bite her at any 
           second.  She manages to open the chamber and pop out the TWO 
           SHELLS, placing them and the shotgun on a high shelf, wanting 
           nothing to do with it.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - MORNING

           Jo shuffles around the room, bored, blowing dust off this, 
           repositioning that - drawn closer with each diversion to THE 
           BASEMENT DOOR.  She sneaks a glance inside.

           JO'S POV - ANDY

           asleep on the sofa, blanket down around his waist now, bare 
           skin.  Body like fine art.

           The fire POPS.  Jo jumps.

           Diane is standing there behind her, holding an OLD PHOTO 
           ALBUM - watching Jo watch Andy...  Jo moves to the hearth and 
           pokes the fire.  Something to do.  Diane approaches with the 
           album.

                                 DIANE
                        I found this in the Christmas 
                        trunk.  I was thinking we could go 
                        through it together.

                                 JO
                        What for?

                                 DIANE
                        I'd like to know more about your 
                        time with your mom.

           Jo jabs at the logs.  Sparks fly.  
                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        You're angry.  I can see that.

           Jo stills the poker - not one to be so obvious.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        It's okay, you know.  You can be 
                        angry at me, at your dad.  You can 
                        even be angry at your mom.  
                        Feelings are never wrong, Jo.

                                 JO
                        Tell me you're not doing that.  

                                 DIANE
                        What am I doing?

                                 JO
                        Talking to me like I'm some psycho 
                        the principal sent to your office.

                                 DIANE
                        Jo, this family means everything to 
                        me now.  You must know that?

           Jo gets up and takes the photo album from Diane.

                                 JO 
                        What I know is that this has 
                        nothing to do with you.  

           She sets the album on the coffee table and heads upstairs, 
           leaving Diane to wonder how the hell she's going to connect.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jo sinks onto the bed with her cell phone.  Tries texting.

           ON PHONE SCREEN: "RU there??"

           REPLY: "No signal."

           Jo stares at the ceiling.  Slips in her earbuds.  MUSIC 
           BLARES.  

           Her breath PLUMES in the cold.  

           A COBWEB billows from the head of an old toy horse... 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MORNING

           A CLOUD SHADOW pulls up and over the chalet like a shroud... 
           EXT. MOUNTAIN - MORNING

           Cam hikes up a steep incline.  Snow TUMBLES in his wake to 
           the base of the mountain.  He stops to catch his breath, 
           looks back.

           CAM'S POV - THE SNOWMOBILE parked beneath a crooked tree.  

           Cam looks ahead.  A hard climb, but he's close.  Sees it --

           THE STATION

           above him, built of logs and shingles, suffocated under a 
           deep layer of snow and perched on the ridge like a dare.  

           There's been A SLIDE.

           Trees pierce through the snow nearly parallel to the shifted 
           hillside above it, some were taken out in the slide and are 
           clustered now against the backstop of the station.  THE ROOF 
           sinks where it should peak. 

           Cam resumes his climb.  Fifty more yards to go.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - DAY 

           Jo pulls a sweater around herself.  Pads down the hallway in 
           her slippers.  Stops at the BATHROOM - but it's occupied.

           The OS SOUND of Diane RETCHING from inside.  The toilet 
           FLUSH.  Jo hesitates - then heads downstairs...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BASEMENT DEN - DAY

           Andy twitches in his sleep.  Rolls over... 

           EXT. RANGER STATION - DAY

           Snow and broken trees and logs and bits of shingled roof -  
           none of it makes much structural sense.  Like a child's set 
           of Tinker Toys shoved aside for another game.

           THE STATION DOOR is blocked open by an accumulation of snow.  
           Cam pushes his way inside... 

           INT. RANGER STATION - DAY

           Toppled chairs, overturned tables, books and cooking utensils 
           and all manner of things strewn from one end to the other in 
           the dim light - all beneath a ceiling folded in on itself 
           like a house of cards.  The place is in ruins. 

           OVERHEAD - the storm-dark SKY through a hole in the roof.
                                 CAM
                        Hello?  Anyone here?

           Cam waits, listens.  Nothing.  He moves carefully, ducking 
           against the low ceiling and navigating the snow mounds - 
           until something at his feet gives him pause.

           EXT. UNDER THE RANGER STATION - DAY (FROM BELOW)

           The station looms ABOVE...  Icicles weep from the crossbeams 
           where several floorboards have broken free to reveal --

           A GAPING HOLE IN THE FLOOR ABOVE THE CLIFF

           CAM - visible inside, looking down at us... 

           INT. RANGER STATION - DAY

           Cam eases back.  Every step measured now.  Sidles along the 
           periphery of the room...  SOMETHING FLAPS past him.  A CROW.  

           Startled, he's nearly knocked off balance, dangerously close 
           to the hole in the floor.  The crow flutters out through the 
           roof.  Cam steps to the wall and pulls out his WALKIE-TALKIE.

                                 CAM
                             (into radio)
                        Jo?  It's Dad.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - DAY 

           Diane emerges from the BATHROOM and hears CAM'S VOICE.

                                 CAM (OS)
                        Jo?  Diane?  

           She hurries downstairs.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - CLOSE ON WALKIE-TALKIE

           on the table, red light flashing... 

                                 CAM (OS)
                        You there?  Diane?  Jo?

           Jo beats her stepmother to it, snatches up the radio.

                                 JO
                        Dad.  You get up there okay?
           INTERCUT:

                        Yeah, I'm here.  Place is in bad 
                        shape.  Avalanche.  Roof is gone.

                        You find anybody yet?  

           Cam stoops down to RETRIEVE something from the rubble. 

           A SKELETON KEY - a pink beaded tassel hanging from it.

           STATIC - the radio hisses.  

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Dad?  You there?  

           Cam studies the key, the mess around him.  Troubled.

                        Yeah, I'm here.  Nobody yet, Jo.

           Diane takes over the radio.  More STATIC.

                                 DIANE
                        Cam, I don't like this.  It's not 
                        safe for you to be up there.

           Jo moves to the fire - despises the intimacy between them.

           Cam looks up, concerned.  WIND lashes through the open roof.  

                                 CAM
                        I'm starting to think you're right.
                             (more STATIC)
                        Sounds like we're about to lose 
                        reception.  I'm gonna head back 
                        now.  If we lose contact, don't 
                        worry.  It's just the storm.  

           Cam stares at the skeleton key.  Something about it...

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        But, Diane --

           STATIC.
                                 DIANE
                        I'm here.
                             (more STATIC)
                        Cam?  

           No response.

           Diane sets down the walkie-talkie, looks out the huge WINDOWS 
           at the falling snow and waits.  

           Jo pulls her sweater tighter and walks slowly past the 
           BASEMENT DOOR again.  Another glance down at Andy inside.  
           She lingers this time.  Diane turns, sees this, doesn't like 
           it... 

           INT. RANGER STATION - MAIN ROOM - DAY

           Cam brings the radio closer, nothing now but the HISS of 
           static.  Damn.  

           The OS SOUND of something moving from the LOW CORNER of the 
           room - from BEHIND A DOOR forced partly closed by the spill 
           of snow.  Something thumping. 

                                 CAM 
                        Hello?  Someone there?

           Cam carefully works his way around the perimeter of the room.  
           The station CREAKS, shifting.  He moves a little faster, 
           reaches THE DOOR, pushes - it's OBSTRUCTED by something.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        I'm a doctor.  

           No response.  Just the thwap, thwap-thwap from within.

           Cam SHOVES the door, putting all his weight behind it.  By 
           degrees, it shimmies open enough to reveal what's blocking 
           it...

           A MAN - in only underwear, face down on the floor, stiff and 
           colorless.  Cam kneels, rolls the man over.  

           A KNIFE - embedded in the man's neck.

           Cam bolts to his feet.  Looks around at the decimated space - 
           all of it more sinister now.  BLOOD on the wall and --  

           THE SATELLITE RADIO - smashed.  Intentionally.

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        What the hell happened here...?

           Thwap, thwap-thwap.  
           The SOUND is coming from deeper inside the room. 

           INT. RANGER STATION - BUNK ROOM - DAY

           Cam steps over the dead man.  Two bunks protrude from the 
           wall into a narrow space forced tighter by the swell of SNOW 
           tumbled in through the open roof.  One small crank window 
           spills a bit of daylight onto the floorboards.  Otherwise, 
           it's dark as pitch.

                                 CAM
                        Hello?  

           Something MOVES under the second bunk - thwap, thwap-thwap.  
           Cam tugs out his FLASHLIGHT and aims.

           A WOMAN'S ARM 

           caught in the spotlight, reaching out from beneath the bed, 
           out into Cam's path, JERKING and TREMBLING, BATTING up 
           against the wood - no other part of her visible.  

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Hold on.  I'm coming.

           Cam navigates around the MOUNDS OF SNOW and reaches the bunk.  
           A blanket hangs over the side of the bed.  The woman SHUDDERS 
           behind it.  Why doesn't she answer?

           Cam grips the blanket and pulls it back to reveal THE WOMAN'S 
           FACE - battered and swollen, fixed gaze, eyes clouded.  Clear 
           FINGER-MARK BRUISES around her neck.  DEAD.

           A LOW GROWL - there's something under there with her.  

           Cam lifts the blanket higher, shines the light in --

           CAM'S POV - UNDER THE BED

           -- beady little eyes, bloody little fangs - 

           A WOLVERINE 

           - gorges possessively, TUGGING at the dead woman's carcass.  
           Her whole body heaves with each yank of her flesh.  

           Cam stumbles back against the wall.  

                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        Christ!

           The floor QUAKES.  
           Boards overhead bend to the snow on the roof, one gives 
           way...  The place is heading for collapse. 

           Cam scrambles over the dead man's body by the door.  TRIPS.  
           The WALKIE-TALKIE jettisons from his grip --  

           MAIN ROOM

           -- and SLIDES across the floor, catapulting over the edge --

           THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR 

           -- pitching end over end down the snowy ravine, flinging over 
           the BLUFF - catching air - until it finally settles.

           Cam looks up.  The walls swell...

           EXT. RANGER STATION - DAY

           Wind rages.  Snow blows sideways.  The mountainside CRUMBLES.

           EXT. UNDER THE RANGER STATION - DAY (FROM BELOW)

           CRACK!  The floor gives and the station deflates.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

           ON CAM - sliding in the flurry of plummeting debris down the 
           ravine, toppling, grabbing at rocks, at branches, anything he 
           can to stop the descent.

           CAM'S HEAD - collides with a rock.  Rolling, tossing, 
           flailing...  Until he slides to a precarious STOP on the edge 
           of the bluff.  An inch more and he would have gone over.  

           A thunder of LOGS pin Cam's legs.  What's left of the station 
           skids to a stop directly above him, perched there like a 
           beast ready to strike.

           Cam's head bleeds.  He's groggy, disoriented, can't move.  
           Meets eyes with THE DEAD WOMAN - hooked on a tree two feet 
           away, staring at him.  And he PASSES OUT.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - DAY

           Diane stirs a pot on the stove.  The SOUND of a SHOUT behind 
           her makes her jump.  She turns, moves to the basement door...

           DIANE'S POV - ANDY IN BASEMENT DEN

           Tossing and turning, agitated, talking in his sleep.
                                 ANDY
                        Wasn't my fault...  Damn you...   
                        No.  No.  NO!

           Diane is troubled.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - WOOD PILE - DAY

           Jo battles the elements, tugging off logs from the stack 
           against the side of the house and tossing them into a sling.  
           It's hard to move out here in the blowing snow...

           THE BASEMENT WINDOW

           catches her eye.  She crouches down, can't help being 
           curious.  Carefully digs away the mound of snow blocking it 
           and SWIPES her glove through the snow-dust on the glass.

           Peers in --

           ANDY'S FACE

           -- stares up at Jo from inside.

           Jo YELPS and stumbles back, startled.

           But wait, he's trying to tell her something.  Gesturing.  She 
           peers inside again.  

           JO'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW

           Andy JABS his finger toward the door behind him.

                                 ANDY
                             (muffled from inside)
                        It's locked.  The door is locked.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - DAY

           Clodding through the kitchen in her boots, Jo marches past 
           Diane at the stove straight for the basement door.  

                                 JO
                        He got locked in by accident.

           Diane moves between Jo and the door.

                                 DIANE
                        Not by accident.

           A beat - and Jo looks at Diane in utter shock.

                                 JO 
                        You locked him in?  
                                 DIANE 
                        Until your dad gets back, I think 
                        it's a good idea.

                                 JO
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DIANE
                        He's obviously been through an 
                        ordeal.  He's unstable right now.

           BANGING from behind the basement door.  

                                 ANDY (OS)
                        Can someone let me out?  Please?

                                 JO
                             (to Diane)
                        Are you out of your mind?  He's a 
                        ranger!  You can't just lock him in 
                        our basement!

           Jo reaches for the knob.  Diane lays her hand on the door.

                                 DIANE
                        Jo.  Trust me.  Please.

           Diane's resolve unnerves Jo.  For a beat, Jo reconsiders.

           But then Jo twists the lock - and opens the door.  

           Andy emerges, wrapped in the blanket, SHAKING and perturbed.  

                                 ANDY 
                        Freezing my ass off down there.

           Andy moves to the window, PEERS OUT - this way, then that - 
           oddly NERVOUS.  Then goes to the lapsing fire to warm up.  

           Jo crosses the room to haul the logs to the hearth.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Let me do that.

           And Andy takes over.  Chivalry.  Jo glares at Diane - see?

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - AT TABLE - DAY

           Andy wears one of Cam's sweaters, shoveling food into his 
           mouth like he hasn't eaten in days.  He notices Diane and Jo 
           watching him.  Pauses mid-spoonful. 
                                 ANDY
                        Sorry.  Been a long time since I 
                        tasted food this good.

                                 DIANE
                        Looks like you're feeling better.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks to you.  

           Andy catches Jo's gaze.  The exchange is charged.  Jo 
           blushes, looks away. 

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I didn't catch your name earlier.  

                                 JO
                        Me?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.  You.

                                 JO
                        Jo.

                                 ANDY
                        Short for?

                                 JO
                        Josephine.

                                 ANDY
                        That's nice.  Old fashioned.  And 
                        how old are you, Josephine?

                                 JO
                        Jo. 

                                 ANDY
                        Jo.  Let me guess - 18?  19?

                                 DIANE
                        She's 14.

           Andy picks up on Diane's advisory tone - back off.

                                 ANDY
                        Whoa.  Okay, Mom.  Just asking.

                                 JO
                        She's not my mom.

           This one, Diane feels to the bone.  Jo almost regrets it.
                                 ANDY
                        Ah.  I see how it is, now.  

           Diane watches the silent exchange between Andy and Jo.  

                                 DIANE
                        So where are you headed, Andy? 

           Andy turns to THE WINDOWS - SNOW falls.  WIND blows.

                                 ANDY 
                        Actually, I was hoping to wait out 
                        the weather here - if that's okay?

                                 DIANE
                        Wait too long, you'll lose daylight.

                                 ANDY
                        Maybe the doc will loan me a 
                        flashlight.  

                                 JO
                        My dad's not here.

           Diane shakes her head at Jo - too late.  Cat's out of the 
           bag.  They're alone.

                                 ANDY
                        Where'd he go?

                                 JO 
                        Up to the ranger station.

           ANDY'S FACE - the whole gamut of emotions flashes beneath the 
           surface - settling on anger.  

                                 ANDY
                        Why did he do that?

                                 JO
                        He thought they might need help.

                                 ANDY 
                        They?  Who?  I never said there was 
                        anybody up there. 

                                 JO
                        Don't you remember?  You said --

                                 ANDY
                             (cuts her off)
                        No!  Do not do that!  Do not take 
                        my words apart to make your point!  
                        I hate that.  
           Andy is struck by the look of alarm on Jo's face.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Damn it - I'm sorry.  Jo.  Diane.  
                        I'm really sorry.  
                             (a breath, evens out)
                        It's just not safe up there is all.  
                        He's gotta be careful. 

           Jo SHIVERS.

           Andy gets up and drapes HIS RANGER COAT around her shoulders.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Friends?

           Jo nods - still a little rattled.  

           Diane doesn't trust him and it shows.

                                 DIANE
                        He'll be back soon.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - DAY

           Diane does dishes, glances at the clock: 12:15.  Where is Cam?

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - DAY

           Jo watches Andy as he moves about the room, sometimes 
           glancing out the window while he looks at things in the 
           house, touches things, opens things, admires...  Always one 
           eye outside. 

                                 ANDY
                        Bet Dad built this place, am I right?

                                 JO
                        We all did.  My dad, my mom and me.

           Andy laughs, looks at Jo sideways.

                                 ANDY
                        You?  Little Jo?  You helped build 
                        this house?  I don't believe it.

           Jo retrieves the PHOTO ALBUM from the coffee table.  Brings 
           it to Andy.  FLIPS through.  Lands on the page she's looking 
           for and presents it to him.

                                 JO
                        Proof.
           CLOSE ON PHOTO - sweet little pig-tailed Jo, no more than 
           five, clutching a hammer and straining under the weight of 
           her daddy's tool belt.  IN THE B.G. - the unfinished house.

                                 ANDY
                        This is you?

                                 JO 
                        Once upon a time.

                                 ANDY
                        I stand corrected.  Looks like you 
                        even knew how to swing that thing.  
                        You were cute.

                                 JO
                        Thanks - I think?

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry - are.  Cute.  Present tense.

           Jo smiles, blushes.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - DAY

           Diane watches Jo share with Andy what she wouldn't with 
           her... 

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - DAY

           Diane slips in with the WALKIE-TALKIE and pulls the door 
           closed behind her.  Finds a flashlight, switches it on, sets 
           it on a shelf and tries calling Cam.  

                                 DIANE
                             (into radio)
                        Cam?  Can you hear me?

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

           The SOUND of DIANE'S VOICE stirs Cam.  He opens his eyes.  
           Strands of blood and saliva have FROZEN his cheek to the 
           board beneath him.  When he lifts his head, the spittle 
           cracks and shatters.

                                 DIANE (OS)
                        Are you there?  

           CLOSE ON - THE WALKIE TALKIE

           a hundred and fifty feet too far away to reach - down the 
           mountain, RED-LIGHT flashing in the snow - Diane's voice 
           ECHOING up the walls of the ravine.
                                 DIANE (OS) (CONT'D)
                        Cam?   

           Cam tries to pull himself up, but HIS LEGS ARE TRAPPED.    

                                 DIANE (OS) (CONT'D)
                        Cam, please hurry back.

           He puts all his strength into wrenching free but to no avail.  
           The structure above him groans.  If it gives, it will tumble 
           over the bluff and take him with it.

                                 DIANE (OS) (CONT'D)
                        I think there's something off about 
                        Andy.  

           Cam YELLS in vain - frustrated, helpless.

           The DEAD WOMAN just stares at him.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - DAY

           Andy looks up at the architecture.  Impressed.

                                 ANDY
                        I'd stay with my uncle sometimes 
                        when I was a kid, when things got 
                        bad at home.  He had this old 
                        farmhouse with lots of rooms, lots 
                        of secret places to hide.  This 
                        seems like the kind of house that 
                        would have those, too.   
                             (looks at Jo)
                        Secret places?

           Jo deliberates for some reason.  And in the end - shrugs, 
           shakes her head "no".  Her response seems to make Andy tense.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - DAY

           Diane tries once more --

                                 DIANE
                             (into radio)
                        Cam?  

           Nothing but STATIC.  She leans against the shelves, defeated. 

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - DAY

           Andy pages through the PHOTO ALBUM.

           CLOSE ON PHOTO of Beth and little Jo standing in front of a 
           small fir tree in the snow.
                                 ANDY 
                        This must be your mom?

           Jo nods, reluctantly.  Doesn't look at the photo for long.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Apple sure doesn't fall far from 
                        the tree.  She's pretty like you.

                                 JO
                        Was.  Pretty.  Past tense.  She 
                        died three years ago.

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry.  That's rough.    

           Jo shrugs again.  Doesn't want to talk about it.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        This is all wrong.

           Andy looks long and hard at Jo.  She starts to squirm, then --

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        If I'm not mistaken, it's Christmas 
                        Eve.  We gotta get you a tree.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - DAY

           Diane emerges from the pantry and sets down an arm load of 
           OIL LANTERNS.  Looks into THE GREAT ROOM.  No one there. 

                                 DIANE
                        Jo?  

           Peers down into the BASEMENT DEN.

           Only silence.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S ROOM - DAY

           Diane pushes open the door, looks inside --

                                 DIANE
                        Jo?

           Nobody here.  Diane's dread grows.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY 

           Snow blows sideways.  Jo, Andy and Rufus bend into the wind, 
           navigating the stands of trees.  Andy leads with the axe.
                                 ANDY
                        We could never afford a decent tree 
                        when I was growing up.  

                                 JO
                        That's the beauty of these.  No 
                        charge.  

           Andy stops and looks up.

           ANDY'S POV - TREES OVERHEAD

           majestic as they bow against the wind.  

                                 ANDY 
                        They really are something, aren't 
                        they?  Makes me kinda wanna leave 
                        them be.

           He's moved.  Jo notices.  

                                 JO
                        We don't have to cut one down.  We 
                        can hang the ornaments in the 
                        window or something.

           Andy turns and looks at her.  Smiles. 

                                 ANDY
                        Sweetest thing you did right there, 
                        Jo.  A compromise.  On my behalf.

           Jo blushes.  Shrugs.  I guess.

           Andy sucks back emotion, turns away - spots a young tree.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        But this is about making sure you 
                        you get a proper Christmas - and I 
                        think I just found your tree.

           THE AXE 

           as it BORES into the green flesh of the sapling...

           Andy swings again and again.  What is it that's fueling him?  
           The tree FALLS.  Andy and Jo stare at it for a beat.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        It's okay, you know.

                                 JO
                        I know.  There are a lot more where 
                        it came from.
                                 ANDY
                        No, I mean - don't beat yourself up 
                        for keeping your distance from her.  
                        You're right.  She's not your mom.  
                        I know all about people coming into 
                        your life and claiming they give a 
                        damn.  No law says you have to give 
                        a damn back.

           Hallelujah, someone finally gets it.  But, the silence that 
           follows - and the way Andy looks at Jo - a little too 
           intimate.  She's uncomfortable.  Until Andy scoops up a 
           handful of snow.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        On the other hand, I hear there is 
                        one that says you gotta give a damn 
                        about your local park ranger, and 
                        if you don't --

           He suddenly PELTS Jo with a snowball.  

           Jo reacts, runs off, laughs.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - DAY

           Diane clutches herself, forging against the wind and snow 
           toward the woods, just out of earshot.  Calls out --

                                 DIANE
                        Jo?  Jo!

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Jo makes her own snowball and SLAMS it back at Andy.  It's 
           war.  BOMBS OF SNOW hurl back and forth through the wind - 
           laughter, screams, Rufus barking - Jo ditching this way, Andy 
           darting that way.  Until he gets the upper hand, hammering Jo 
           with a steady stream of ammunition.  

           Jo drops to the ground.  Andy pins her.  Rufus BARKS.

                                 JO
                             (laughing)
                        Okay, okay!  I give a damn!  I give 
                        a damn!  I like you!

           Andy is perched above Jo.  Breathless.  Jo considers what 
           she's just said.  And bravely --

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I like you.

           A SNAP nearby.  Andy reels around.
                                 ANDY 
                        Sshhh! 

           He peers intently through the maze of trees.

                                 JO
                        What is it?

           Andy snatches up the axe, takes a few steps into the woods 
           and listens with his whole being - axe at the ready.  Only 
           the SOUND of WIND and swaying branches...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - DAY

           Diane crosses back the other way, searching, distraught.

                                 DIANE
                        Jo!  

           Rufus bounds up and JUMPS on Diane, wags, kisses - as Diane 
           spots Andy lugging the Christmas tree to the front porch.  

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        Where's Jo?

                                 ANDY
                        Can I give you a little advice, 
                        Stepmom?  You're going about it all 
                        wrong with that girl.

           Andy shakes snow off the tree.  Diane is incredulous.

                                 DIANE
                        Excuse me?

                                 ANDY
                        See, you can't force your own 
                        agenda.  You gotta let trust happen 
                        naturally.

           Andy finishes picking the tree clean.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        It's all about the trust.

                                 DIANE 
                        Where the hell is my daughter?

           Just as Jo emerges around the corner.  She heard this, stops.

                                 ANDY
                             (to Jo)
                        She was just worried about you.
           Jo pauses for a beat off Diane's expression, confused, 
           rattled - and then continues inside.  Andy grips the tree and 
           follows her in.  Turns back, looks at Diane.  Smiles.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Comin'?

           The audacity - Diane seethes.

           UNKNOWN POV - INTO BIG WINDOWS OF GREAT ROOM

           where Rufus wags happily and Jo helps Andy get the tree in 
           place - giving directions, poking fun, laughing.  If we 
           didn't see DIANE'S APPREHENSION, we'd see a Hallmark moment 
           here - just another happy family trimming the tree...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

           Bitter WIND, flurries of dry snow streaming off the surface.  
           Gusts tug at BOARDS holding what's left of the station 
           together. Cam DIGS, channeling out the snow under his legs 
           with a broken board.  The dead woman's gaze remains fixed on 
           him.

           A BLAST of wind.  The rickety structure CREAKS.  

           Cam paws at the snow, no time to waste.  Reaches deep under 
           the boards, burrowing out the snow at his ankles, at his 
           feet.  Strains to move -- at last, his legs SHIFT.  Progress.

           He tosses the board aside, throws his arms out to grab the 
           dead woman's tree and pulls himself to it, inch by hard-won 
           inch.  

           The ghost of the station quivers and shifts.  SNOW DUST skips 
           over the bluff.  Cam wraps himself around the tree and HEAVES 
           his legs out from under the beast.

           A SHUDDER AND RUMBLE - the shell of logs and beams COLLAPSES 
           into itself and shimmies over the bluff, pulling everything 
           in its path down with it.  Cam bows his head and CLEAVES to 
           the tree against the deluge of snow and debris.  

           THE DEAD WOMAN is jostled free from the branch, drops and 
           hooks herself on Cam's shoulder, her weight working to pull 
           his grip loose.  His fingers SLIPPING - until her rigid arm 
           dislodges, releasing him.  

           She spills over the bluff and plunges out of sight.  Cam 
           won't soon forget HER FACE.  Neither should we.

           EXT. BELOW BLUFF - DAY

           Craggy rocks overhead and a DARK SKY full of weather.
           And CAM - peering over the edge.  Holy shit.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY (FROM ABOVE)

           Cam sits under a tree, assembling SPLINTS out of gauze from 
           his bag and whatever boards he can find in the rubble...

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON - JO'S LIPS

           a slow draw across tender skin from a tube of RED LIPSTICK...  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BATHROOM - DAY

           Still in Andy's coat, Jo contemplates her reflection.  
           Practices a little - a shy smile, a blush...  She's alluring - 
           she sees it, too.  She'll be a woman soon.  

           A KNOCK on the door startles her - Jo the girl resurfaces.

                                 JO
                        I'm in here.

                                 DIANE (OS)
                        Can I talk to you?

           Jo hesitates.  Knee-jerk response - wipe the lips clean?  No - 
           instead, she opens the door, wearing that lipstick like a 
           badge of honor.  Diane notices - but not this battle, not 
           now.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        Your dad should've been back by 
                        now.  I want you to go up to the 
                        neighbor's and radio for help.

                                 JO 
                        Now?  In this storm?

                                 DIANE
                        Now.  Tell them about the slide.  
                        Have them send someone up there.

                                 JO
                        But --

                                 DIANE
                        Now, Jo.

           Diane turns away, conversation over - but not for Jo --

                                 JO 
                        You don't like him, do you?
                                 DIANE
                        What?  

                                 JO
                        Andy.  

                                 DIANE
                        This is about your dad.  Let's just 
                        get him back in one piece, okay?

           Diane heads downstairs.  Jo simmers.

           CLOSE ON - CAM'S FACE

           smiling, for some reason.  It's A PHOTOGRAPH.  Cam, Beth and 
           Jo in the snow framed in gold - AN ORNAMENT on the tree...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Daylight is waning, the STORM is worsening.  Shadows reach up 
           past the TREE standing there like history in the middle of 
           the room, draped with balls and trinkets and TINY WHITE 
           LIGHTS pulsing yellow on the low generator power.  

           Jo, cocooned for the cold, stares at the tree.  At her 
           memories...  Then shuffles to the front door.  

           ANDY emerges from the basement, out of breath for some 
           reason.  Spots Jo heading out.

                                 ANDY
                        Where you going?

                                 JO
                        To use the neighbor's radio.  We 
                        were waiting for my dad, but he's 
                        been gone too long. 

                                 ANDY 
                        You can't see two feet in front of 
                        you out there.

                                 JO 
                        It's okay.  I know the way.
                             (calls for the dog)
                        Rufus!  Come on, boy.  

           Rufus lopes up wagging and Jo reaches for the door.  But Andy 
           steps in front of her, BLOCKS the way.

                                 ANDY
                        I radioed this morning about the 
                        slide, before I headed down here.  
                        I'm sure they're up there by now.
                                 JO
                        Oh.
                             (considers - then)
                        But what if they miss him?  What if 
                        he needs help and --

                                 ANDY
                        What if, what if, what if.  Have a 
                        little faith, Jo.

           Jo isn't convinced.  Andy can see that.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        This Stepmom's idea?  What's she 
                        thinking sending you out there on 
                        your own?  You're just a kid.

           This is a trigger for Jo - she stands up to it.

                                 JO
                        I'm not a kid.  

           Andy PRESSES HIS THUMB gently to Jo's LOWER LIP, drawing it 
           through the lipstick.  She's unnerved - and a little stirred.

           Andy checks his thumb.  And SUCKS it clean of lipstick.

                                 ANDY
                        No.  Maybe you're right.  

           DIANE is suddenly between them - shielding Jo.

                                 DIANE
                        You need to step aside and let her 
                        go now.

                                 ANDY
                        I really can't do that.

           Diane raises THE SHOTGUN - pointing it at the ceiling.  

                                 DIANE 
                        Let her go.

                                 JO
                        Oh my God - Diane!  Are you crazy?

           Andy steps aside.  

                                 ANDY
                        I was only looking out for her.  

                                 DIANE
                        That's not your job.
                                 ANDY
                        I was going to go so she wouldn't 
                        have to.

                                 JO 
                             (to Diane)
                        You are in serious need of help.   

                                 ANDY
                        Diane, look - apparently I've done 
                        something to upset you --

           Suddenly, Rufus starts BARKING.  He's heard something 
           outside.  Andy whips around.

           The SOUND of BOOTS THUMPING just outside the front door.

           And Andy springs back to the wall - oddly terrified.

                                 DIANE
                        Thank God!  It's Cam.

           Diane YANKS the door open.  

           LOIS

           stands on the other side in red plaid flannel, eyes blinking 
           over the top of her scarf.  She holds A BOTTLE out to Diane.

                                 LOIS
                        Merry Christmas!

           Diane veils her disappointment as best she can.

           AT THE HEARTH 

           Lois unwraps herself accessory by accessory fireside.  

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Homegrown cheer in that bottle.  
                        Old family recipe.  Can't tell you 
                        the proof, but I can tell you not 
                        to drink it and light a match at 
                        the same time.  

           A glance at Diane standing there, clutching the shotgun, 
           clutching the bottle, still discomposed by the earlier clash 
           with Andy.  Lois warms her hands and holds one out to Diane.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Lois, your one and only neighbor.  
                        I come in peace - 
                             (off shotgun)
                        - no need for that.  
           Diane registers the gun still in her grip - god, what is 
           wrong with me?  Sets it down and takes Lois' hand.

                                 DIANE
                        Sorry - Diane.  Good to meet you.

                                 LOIS
                        Likewise.  I'm sure glad to see 
                        someone has stepped up to take care 
                        of my favorite family.

           A pat and squeeze to Jo's shoulder.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Known this girl since she was knee-
                        high to a jack rabbit.  

           Jo smiles, self-conscious, a glimpse in Andy's direction - 
           enough to make Lois turn and see him there at the wall. 

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh.  Hullo.  

                                 JO
                        This is Andy.  Wait - you two know 
                        each other, I guess.

           Lois shrugs - puzzled.  

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Your neighborly park ranger?

                                 LOIS
                        You mean Henry?
                             (shakes her head)
                        That's not Henry.

           Jo looks at Lois, Diane at Jo, and they all look at Andy - no 
           idea what to think.

           Until Andy steps forward and takes Lois' hand, a firm shake.  

                                 ANDY
                        Heard a lot about you, Lois.  Henry 
                        told me to check in on you now and 
                        then before he left.

                                 LOIS
                        Oh?  Where'd he go?

                                 ANDY
                        Spending Christmas with his family.  
                        My first week up here - hell of a 
                        week, too.
           Lois mulls on this for a beat - then buys it. 

                                 LOIS
                        'Bout time.  I've been nagging that 
                        man to have Christmas dinner with 
                        his wife and kids for years!  

                                 ANDY
                        He said they think you're some kind 
                        of Santa's helper now for getting 
                        him to finally come home.

           They both laugh - hitting it off.  Jo eases.  Diane doesn't.

                                 DIANE
                        We need you to radio out.

                                 LOIS
                        Oh?

                                 DIANE
                        There was a slide at the station.  
                        Cam went up there and the walkie-
                        talkies cut out.  He should've been 
                        back by now.  

                                 LOIS
                        Well, why didn't you say something 
                        sooner?  

           Lois tugs all her accessories back on.

                                 ANDY 
                        You just got here.  I'll go.

                                 LOIS
                        That's thoughtful, but no.  The 
                        radio's old and finicky, just like 
                        me.  You gotta tweak us both just-
                        so to keep us operational. 

           Lois heads for the door.  Diane follows.

                                 DIANE
                        Thank you.  

                                 LOIS
                        What are neighbors for?

           At the open door, Lois puts her arm around Diane's shoulder 
           and pulls her close for a hug.
                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        You're gonna take good care of 
                        them, I can tell.
                             (sotto, re: shotgun)
                        That thing loaded?

           Diane is thrown for a beat - then --

                                 DIANE 
                        No...

                                 LOIS
                        Well load it and keep it close.  
                        Henry's a bachelor and a Jew.  
                        Whoever this guy is, he's lying.  

           Lois pulls away and smiles back at Andy.

                                 LOIS (CONT'D)
                        Save me some of that grog.  I'll be 
                        back down to enjoy it with you all 
                        in a little bit.
                             (to Diane - intent)
                        I'll make that call.

           And Lois exits.  Jo looks at Andy.  He's still unhinged.

                                 JO 
                        Who did you think it was?

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 JO
                        When you heard Lois out there, you 
                        kind of freaked.

           Diane waits for the answer, too.  

                                 ANDY
                        Just startled me is all.

           Andy goes to the fire and pokes the logs with too much force - 
           they split, tumble, flames dissipate and dwindle.  Only one 
           more log in the bin.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        We're out of wood.  I'll get more.

           Andy goes to the door - grabs THE AXE - and exits.

           Jo shivers, sits on the hearth, buries her hands in the 
           pockets of Andy's ranger coat.  
                                 DIANE
                        I want you to keep your distance 
                        from him.

                                 JO
                        What does that mean?

                                 DIANE 
                        It means you're right.  I don't 
                        like him. 

                                 JO
                        He's a federal employee - who you 
                        threatened with a shotgun.  When 
                        they find out, you'll be lucky if 
                        they don't put you in jail.

                                 DIANE
                        I'll take my chances.

                                 JO
                        So will I.

           Diane is fed up - no more mollifying this girl. 

                                 DIANE
                        This is not a game, Jo!  I forbid 
                        you to go off with that man again.  

                                 JO
                        You forbid me?

           No, that won't work.  Diane adopts a different approach.  

                                 DIANE
                        Look, I know you're drawn to him.  
                        Believe it or not, I've been there 
                        myself.

           She sits on the hearth beside Jo.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        I remember what it felt like to be 
                        14, to have an older guy pay 
                        attention to me.  I remember how 
                        much more exciting he seemed than 
                        the boys my own age.  

                                 JO
                        Who was he?   

           Diane is encouraged - they're talking.
                                 DIANE
                        He lived on the corner.  My dad 
                        would pay him to help with odd jobs 
                        around the house.  If dad wasn't 
                        home when he showed up, we'd talk 
                        and drink Coke while he waited.  I 
                        still remember the way he smelled - 
                        like metal and cinnamon.

                                 JO
                        So whatever happened between you?

           Diane pulls each word out like a splinter in her flesh -- 

                                 DIANE
                        He raped me.

           Jo's eyes go wide.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        I said "no" and he shoved his 
                        bandana in my mouth so no one could 
                        hear me scream it.  I know Andy 
                        makes you feel things you haven't 
                        felt before.  I know he makes you 
                        feel stronger, smarter, prettier 
                        just by the way he looks at you.  I 
                        remember all that, Jo, I do.  But, 
                        it's just not right for a man his 
                        age to take such an interest in a 
                        girl your age.

                                 JO
                        I'm sorry about what happened to 
                        you, Diane, I am - but this isn't 
                        like that.  Andy gets me.

           Diane puts her arm around Jo.  

                                 DIANE 
                        Oh, I know it feels that way.  But, 
                        sweetie - 
                             (looks Jo in the eye)
                        - you're wrong.  

           All that progress disintegrates.  Jo goes rigid, shrugs 
           Diane's arm off, the look she gives her firm and unforgiving.    

                                 JO
                        Feelings are never wrong, remember? 

           Diane is angry.  Gets to her feet, steps away, turns back. 
                                 DIANE
                        Listen to me - you think you know 
                        it all, but you're not even close!  

                                 JO
                        And you're not my mother.  Not even 
                        close.

           SMACK! - Diane SLAPS Jo across the face.

           As ANDY ENTERS - covered in snow, sling bulging with wood.

           He DROPS the wood and flies at Diane, SHOVES her away from Jo 
           with so much force, she stumbles and BANGS HER LIP.

                                 ANDY
                        You don't lay a hand on her!

           Diane is stunned.  So is Jo.  But Jo is also just a little 
           bit enchanted - Andy is her knight in shining armor.

                                 JO
                        Andy - it's okay...  

                                 ANDY
                        No.  It's not.  She's got no right.

                                 JO
                        I'm fine.  It was nothing.  

           But Diane isn't fine.  She dabs at her lip - BLEEDING.  

                                 ANDY
                        I apologize for the shove, Diane.  
                        But you had it coming.   

           He offers Diane the BANDANA from his pocket.  She wouldn't 
           touch it with a ten-foot pole.  

           Diane picks up the shotgun and looks at Jo - uncompromising.

                                 DIANE 
                        I'm here.  I'm watching.  

           Diane moves into the kitchen, just out of earshot, 
           maintaining a clear view of Jo.

           Andy collects the scattered logs and pitches a few into the 
           fire.  Jo watches him tense up again, notices BLOOD sprayed 
           on his sweater, just a little.

                                 JO 
                        Your nose bleeding again?
           Andy quickly wipes at his nose.  No blood there, but --

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.  Guess so.

           Jo buries her hands in the pockets of the borrowed coat - and 
           suddenly JERKS BACK.

                                 JO 
                        Ow!

           Something pricked her.  She pulls it out.  

           A PIN - a National Park Service NAME BADGE: "HENRY AZAROFF".

           Jo stares at it.  Confused...  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           CAM shambles down the dark mountain on MAKESHIFT CRUTCHES, 
           every nudge forward on his shattered legs agonizing.  The 
           FLASHLIGHT swings from his neck sending SHADOWS to play in 
           the bare branches overhead.  He's looking for something in 
           his path...

           Spots it - a faint RED GLOW under the snow.

           Cam braces himself on one crutch and uses the other to dig up 
           the WALKIE TALKIE.  The red light flickers.  Batteries dying.

           He tries to bend to pick it up, but his legs refuse.  So he 
           THROWS himself to the snow, stabbing pain.  Grabs the radio.

                                 CAM
                        Diane?  Jo!  Can you hear me?

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Diane is dabbing her lip with a kitchen towel when she hears 
           it -- CAM'S VOICE, very faint, from behind the PANTRY DOOR.

           She glances at Jo and Andy by the fire - they didn't hear it - 
           and she slips quickly into the pantry... 

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - NIGHT

           Diane closes the door behind her and seizes the SPUTTERING 
           walkie-talkie from the shelf where she left it.

                                 DIANE
                        Cam!  Thank God you're all right!

           STATIC - and just the hint of Cam's VOICE.
                                 CAM'S VOICE (OS) 
                             (through the radio)
                        Diane?  Jo?

                                 DIANE
                        It's Diane.  I'm here!  

                                 CAM'S VOICE (OS)
                        ...get help...  in danger...

                                 DIANE
                        You're breaking up.  

                                 CAM'S VOICE (OS)
                        If you can hear me...

                                 DIANE
                        I can hear you.  I'm here!
                             (her heart sinks)
                        But, you can't hear me...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo holds the pin out to Andy.

                                 JO 
                        Why do you have Henry's name badge?

           Andy - damage control. 

                                 ANDY 
                        Can I trust you?

           Jo's nod is so slight, we barely catch it.  

           Andy gently takes the name badge from Jo and slips his hand 
           into the pocket of the coat, burying it there, returning the 
           pin to where Jo found it.  His hand lingers in her pocket.  
           Leaning very CLOSE.  His lips at her ear.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I'm not the ranger. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           Cam hears only STATIC through his end of the radio.  SHOUTS.

                                 CAM
                        If you can hear me - get up to 
                        Lois's place and have her radio the 
                        police.  Tell them there are two 
                        people dead at the station.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAM (CONT'D)
                        It wasn't the avalanche that killed 
                        them.  Do you read me?  They were 
                        murdered!  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo's lip trembles.  Andy slips his hand out of the pocket - 
           the withdrawal almost sexual.  

           Jo's eyes meet his and hold.

                                 ANDY 
                        I'm in trouble.  Someone's after 
                        me.  Someone very angry.  He won't 
                        stop 'til I'm dead.  Or he is.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - NIGHT

           Diane clutches the radio, listening intently through the 
           STATIC, trying to make sense of Cam's garbled words. 

                                 CAM'S VOICE (OS)
                             (through radio)
                        Lois...  police...  dead...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo's eyes are wide as she listens to Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        Some people don't want other people 
                        to be happy, Jo, and they'll do 
                        whatever they can to see to it that 
                        we're all as miserable as they are.

                                 JO
                        How do you know he's out there?

                                 ANDY
                        He showed up at the station and...
                             (can't say it, instead --)
                        He's a very violent man.

           It sinks in for Jo.  

                                 JO
                        Henry didn't go home for Christmas, 
                        did he?

           Andy shakes his head "no", lays his finger across Jo's lips.  

                                 ANDY 
                        Better if we keep this between us.  
                        Stepmom would be pretty upset.  
           Jo agrees, nods - and it all comes together.

                                 JO 
                        That's what you meant when you said 
                        my dad had to be careful.  And me, 
                        going out there...

                                 ANDY
                        I won't lie to you, Jo - the guy's 
                        a loaded pistol with an itchy 
                        trigger.  He's out there somewhere. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           The red light FLICKERS out to nothing.  Batteries are dead.

                                 CAM 
                        I'll be there soon.  I promise...  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - NIGHT

           Diane whispers into the radio.

                                 DIANE
                        Cam?  

           The response is only STATIC.  

           Diane looks at THE SHOTGUN leaning there against the shelf.  
           Deliberates - but not for long.  All bets are off now.  

           She climbs up on the STEP-LADDER, clutching the shotgun in 
           one hand, desperately POKING around in the dark between boxes 
           and cans with the other, looking for something...  Finds it.

           THE CARTRIDGES

           She grabs them - and the FULL BOX nearby.  Climbs off the 
           step-ladder, fumbles with the cartridges, the gun - doesn't 
           have the first clue how to load it.  Frantic.  The box SLIPS 
           from her hand and cartridges CLATTER to the floor...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy and Jo look up at the OS SOUND.  Andy speaks a little 
           faster, a little more will to his words.

                                 ANDY 
                        Where's a good place to hide in 
                        this house? 

                                 JO 
                        What?  
                                 ANDY
                        Someplace no one would ever find 
                        you.  Think now, Jo.  Think!

           Andy's intensity is too much pressure for Jo.  She's scared.

                                 JO
                        I don't know!  

           Andy moves away, frustrated.  Tries to shake it off.

                                 ANDY
                        Then we've got no choice.  We gotta 
                        get him before he gets us.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - NIGHT

           Andy leads Jo down the corridor toward THE MASTER BEDROOM...

                                 ANDY
                        I saw the big windows up here from 
                        a mile away, they've got a good 
                        view of the valley.  You sit up 
                        here and watch.  You let me know if 
                        you see him coming.

           For a beat, Jo just stands there at the threshold.

           JO'S POV - MASTER BEDROOM

           The WHITE GLOW from Jo's kerosene lantern blasts the walls 
           and beams, the bed - confronting her in the enormous dark 
           windows with its REFLECTION, and her own, like an apparition. 

           All her will - and at last, Jo steps forward into the room.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo moves to the windows, the LIGHT from her lantern swinging 
           like a swollen firefly.  Her silhouette in the REFLECTION - 
           and Andy's in the doorway behind her.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You yell out if you see him.

           Andy lingers a beat longer - then leaves.

           JO'S HAND draws across the bed's footboard.  Her fingers move 
           over the textured comforter...  She sets down the lantern and 
           sits on the bed.  

           She looks OUT THE WINDOW. 
           JO'S VISION IN THE REFLECTION - BETH

           lying there in bed, little life left - just enough to turn 
           and look at her daughter.  Jo's hand moves ever so slightly 
           toward her mother - her fingers creeping nearer to Beth's... 

           She turns from the window, looks at the bed - empty. 

           Jo wraps herself in the blanket from the foot of the bed and 
           slides to the floor, dwarfed by the massive windows.  Inserts 
           her earbuds, turns on the IPOD.  Her face to the glass.  
           Watching.  Waiting.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Clothes, books, stuffed animals FLYING out of the closet and 
           littering the room as Andy rummages through to THE WALL at 
           the back.  Lays his palm against the boards, moves it slowly 
           one way then the other, feeling for something.

           A SHADOW over his shoulder and Andy whirls around, startled - 
           confronted by the nose of the SHOTGUN Diane aims at his back.

                                 DIANE 
                        This time, it's loaded.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo's face at the window - breath FOGGING the glass.  Darkness 
           beyond the cascade of SNOWFLAKES.  Rufus lies nearby.  Jo 
           pets him, sees a STACK OF DIANE'S BOOKS next to the bed, the 
           one second from the top.  Jo reads the title --

           "What to Expect When You're Expecting"

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy stumbles over the clutter at his feet as he moves out of 
           the closet at gunpoint.

                                 ANDY
                        Look, Diane - we definitely got off 
                        on the wrong foot.

                                 DIANE
                        Just step on out of the room.

                                 ANDY
                        You've got it all wrong.  If I were 
                        the guy you think I am, you wouldn't 
                        be the one holding the gun.

                                 DIANE
                        I said out!
           Andy does as he's told.  Diane backs up to give him room.  

           ON THE CATWALK,

           Diane guides Andy with the shotgun.

                                 DIANE
                        Downstairs.

           He notices - HER HANDS ARE TREMBLING.

                                 ANDY 
                        That gun goes against your nature, 
                        Diane.  You're not the type.  

                                 DIANE
                        You don't know the first thing 
                        about what type I am.

                                 ANDY
                        So let's talk.  Tell me about it.

                                 DIANE 
                        I'm all talked out.  

           They move past the MASTER BEDROOM.  Jo - immersed in her iPod 
           and Diane's book - doesn't see them.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Diane and Andy descend the stairs.

                                 DIANE
                        Get in the basement.

                                 ANDY
                        I'll freeze down there.

                                 DIANE 
                        Plenty of blankets.  Go! 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo puts the book back and rests her arms on the window sill.  
           Peers outside, still listening to her iPod.  Can't hear a 
           thing going on downstairs...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy eases toward the basement door - Diane right behind him.

                                 ANDY
                        Diane look - I'm sorry I lost my 
                        temper earlier.  
                                 DIANE
                        So am I.  Move!  

           Then Andy just STOPS.  Stands there in front of the basement 
           door.  His hands come down.  

                                 ANDY
                        Thing is --
                             (turns to Diane)
                        I'm pretty sure I'm not in any 
                        danger here.

           Diane swallows hard, keeps the shotgun aimed.

                                 DIANE
                        Keep moving.  

                                 ANDY
                        You could never do it. 

           Diane's shaking hands, trembling lips - can't hide it.  She's 
           terrified.

           Very slowly, carefully, Andy reaches for THE NOSE of the 
           shotgun, wraps his fingers around it - and gently pulls it to 
           his stomach.  PRESSES it against his own flesh.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Moment of truth.  

           Perspiration on Andy's upper lip - not entirely convinced...  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           THE WINDOW in front of Jo's face suddenly QUIVERS with the 
           impact of something somewhere else in the house.  She doesn't 
           hear it, but FEELS it - right through the wood of the sill.  

           RUFUS sits up - on the alert.  Jo tugs out her earbuds - what 
           was that?  Only silence now.  She gets to her feet guardedly.

           OS SOUND of FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs...

                                 JO 
                        Diane?

           Rufus WHINES and quivers, the dog's stare fixed on the open 
           bedroom door.  Jo slips her fingers around his collar.  HOLDS 
           on tight.  The OS approach continues, floorboards CREAK.

           Jo pulls Rufus close, HIDES behind the bed.
           REFLECTION IN WINDOW - A SHADOW

           moves into the doorway...  

           Jo grips the dog by his fur - too hard.  Rufus YELPS.  Jo 
           looks up -- and finally breathes.  

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I didn't know it was you.  

           ANDY

           stands in the doorway.

                                 ANDY 
                        Didn't mean to scare you.

           Andy moves to the window, looks out.  He's different.  More 
           intense.  Whole body tight enough to snap.  Jo notices.  
           Climbs up to sit on the bed.

                                 JO
                        I thought maybe that guy got in.

                                 ANDY 
                        Well then that would mean you 
                        hadn't done your job, wouldn't it?

           Jo pets Rufus.  Pause.  Then --

                                 JO 
                        What happened downstairs?  The 
                        windows shook.

                                 ANDY
                        Must've been the door slamming when 
                        Diane left. 

                                 JO
                        She left?

                                 ANDY
                        Went up to see if the old lady got 
                        through on the radio.

           Jo stops petting the dog, grappling with this new 
           information.  Andy turns from the window to look at her.   

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I'll look after you.

           Sits beside her.
                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Listen, people turn their backs on 
                        us all the time in this world.  The 
                        ones who are supposed to be there, 
                        the ones we need the most - they 
                        always let us down.  I've been 
                        there. 

           He draws his hand to Jo's face, gently cradles her cheek.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        But, I won't leave you, Jo.   

           Jo leans into his palm.  Eyes lift to his.  Her face all 
           innocence, fear - and desire.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Would it be okay - if I kissed you?

           Jo can barely breathe, let alone form words - but, she does.  
           Just one --

                                 JO
                        Yes.

           Andy leans forward -- and KISSES Jo, his lips just brushing 
           against hers.  Tender, the kind of kiss a girl never forgets.

           But Jo is the one to break away.  Flushed.   

                                 ANDY
                        What's the matter?

                                 JO
                        I just - what if someone walks in?

           Andy's fingers thread through Jo's - pressing her hand down 
           on the bed.  Holding her there.  

                                 ANDY 
                        I'm the only one here for you.

           Andy's other hand strokes down Jo's hair, following the curve 
           of her shoulder, her collarbone...

                                 JO
                        We probably shouldn't.

                                 ANDY
                        Shouldn't what?

                                 JO
                        You know...
                                 ANDY
                        Maybe I do, maybe I don't.  Maybe 
                        you should say it just to be sure.

           Jo is uncomfortable, her eyes dart away from Andy.  He 
           notices.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You're not gonna tease me now - are 
                        you, Josephine?

           Andy leans in close, grazing Jo's neck with his lips, 
           WHISPERS something inaudible in her ear.  She's not ready for 
           this, turns away...

           OUT THE WINDOW - A LIGHT IN THE VALLEY

           moving closer.  The DISTANT SOUND of a whining engine.  A 
           SNOWMOBILE headed this way.

                                 JO 
                        My Dad!

           Andy turns, sees the light.  And suddenly, aggressively, 
           PUSHES away and bolts out of the room.  Jo is confused.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

           Against the biting pain, Cam pulls himself to his feet with 
           the help of his makeshift crutches.  Hobbles forward, 
           battling the wind and the dark...   Peers ahead.  And stops 
           dead in his tracks.  

           THE CROOKED TREE

           The snow has been dug out - SKIDOO TRACKS into the veiled 
           distance...  Someone has stolen his snowmobile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JO'S POV - MOUNTAIN VALLEY 

           The SKIDOO LIGHT stops moving.  Switches off.  Darkness.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy throws on a coat and grabs the shotgun.  Jo stands at 
           the base of the stairs.  

                                 JO
                        It's not my dad, is it?

                                 ANDY
                        No.
                                 JO 
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 ANDY 
                        I'll tell you what I'm not gonna 
                        do.  I'm not gonna let this bastard 
                        rob me of the only chance I've ever 
                        had for a life worth something.

           Rufus SCRATCHES at the basement door - WHINING, agitated.

           Andy KICKS the dog away.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Knock it off!

           Rufus YELPS.  Jo reaches for the dog, but he cowers.

                                 JO
                        What did you do that for?

                                 ANDY
                        Couldn't hear myself think.
                             (off Jo's pained 
                              expression)
                        The dog is fine.  It's me you 
                        should be worrying about.  

           Andy moves forward, grabs Jo's arm.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I need to know you're with me, 
                        Josephine.  Can I count on you?

           It's not immediate - but a beat later, Jo NODS.  

           Satisfied, Andy turns for the kitchen and Jo goes to the bin 
           beside the front door - but what she's looking for isn't here.

                                 JO 
                        Where is it?

           Andy turns.

                                 ANDY
                        What?

                                 JO
                        The axe.  

           Andy's anger tightens his face - eruption just below the 
           surface.  He fights to keep it in check. 
                                 ANDY
                        What do you need the axe for?

                                 JO
                        In case he gets in.

                                 ANDY
                        He's not getting in, Josephine.

           Andy storms to the back door.

                                 JO
                        Andy...

           He stops, doesn't turn this time.  It's all he can do to hold 
           it together.  His back is to Jo.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I'm scared.

           Andy hesitates - then pulls open the back door and exits in a 
           flurry of wind and snow.

           Jo spots the FIREPLACE POKER and snatches it up.  Rufus 
           WHIMPERS his way into lying down.  Jo creeps to the window by 
           the front door and crouches just out of sight, gripping the 
           poker with white knuckles.  And waits.

           Rufus HEARS something.  Sits up.  GROWLS at the window.  Jo 
           follows the dog's gaze.

           OUT THE WINDOW - A MAN'S SHADOW

           cast in the BLUE LIGHT from the generator shed, moving over 
           the snow out front.  The man's shadow changes directions - 
           SWELLS LARGER - and disappears around the side of the house.

           Jo scrunches up as small as she can and peers across the 
           room, watching as the man steals past one window.  Then 
           another...  He's circling the house, nearing the front door.

           Jo leaps up, PINS herself against the door, raises the poker.  
           The DOORKNOB RATTLES.  He's trying to get in.  Jo holds her 
           breath - trembling, terrified. 

           And the rattle STOPS.  All is still.  

           Jo cranes around to look outside. 
           JO'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW

           Battling the wind, THE MAN - BEARDED, half-frozen, clothes 
           covered in snow and ice - slithers off the porch and moves 
           behind a tree, fixed on something off-screen.  He reaches 
           inside his coat - and pulls out A HAND-GUN...

           POW!  

           Jo jumps back, startled.  

           JO'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW

           The man falls forward onto the snow.  

           ON JO - ashen.

           She finds her breath, hesitates - then carefully unlocks the 
           door and opens it.  Peers into the whipping snow - is he 
           dead?  

           Rufus bounds from the house, charging at the man's body, 
           BARKING.  Jo can't wrap her mouth around the words to call 
           the dog.  She CLUTCHES the door frame, the poker, staring.

           JO'S POV - ANDY

           as he emerges like an illusion through the shroud of blowing 
           snow, smoking shotgun slung over his shoulder.  As he leans 
           over the man, as he picks up the hand-gun - and FIRES twice 
           more at close range.  Definitely dead.  CLICK!  Out of ammo.

           And Andy chucks the hand-gun.  No use to anyone now. 

           He moves up onto the porch, bangs the snow off his boots and 
           heads inside.  STOPS in the doorway.  Takes Jo's face in his 
           hands.  Another KISS - this one hard and fast and triumphant.  

           And he walks into the house.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - NIGHT

           RUFUS frantically circles the body.  Approaches, tentative.  
           And begins to LICK AT THE BLOOD on the man's back...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Jo is mortified, steps out, waves the poker at the dog.

                                 JO 
                        Rufus!  No!

           But Rufus pays no mind.
                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Rufus!  Stop it!

           Still, the dog licks...

           Jo turns to look behind her, back into the house.

           JO'S POV - ANDY IN THE KITCHEN

           opening LOIS' BOTTLE OF HOOCH - pouring himself a drink.

                                 ANDY
                             (his best Bing Crosby)
                        "But baby, it's cold outside!"

                                 JO
                        You're just going to leave him?

                                 ANDY
                        Come inside and shut the door, 
                        Josephine.  

           Jo turns back to look at Rufus cleaning the man up - she 
           can't bear it.  She steps down off the porch.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - NIGHT

           Pelted by SNOW and WIND, Jo approaches Rufus.

                                 JO
                        Rufus!  

           She reaches for the dog, but he DARTS away and runs inside.  
           Her eyes lock on the dead man's coat.  Something spills from 
           the pocket, something ROUND AND SHINY.

           Jo nudges it closer with the toe of her boot.  Picks it up.

           A BADGE.

           The man is a U.S. MARSHAL.  Was.  

                                 ANDY'S VOICE (OS)
                        Josephine?

           Jo turns to see Andy standing in the open doorway.  Reality 
           hits her hard - crashes into her like a Mack truck.  The 
           badge falls to the snow.

                                 ANDY
                        You should come in now.
           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo stands in the middle of the room SHIVERING.  Andy pours 
           another drink and holds the glass out to Jo.

                                 ANDY 
                        Have some.  I won't tell your 
                        folks.

           Jo doesn't take the glass.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Death is just part of the cycle.  
                        You of all people should know that.

           Jo finds her voice.

                                 JO
                        He was a U.S. Marshal.

                                 ANDY
                        Point being?

           Rufus is sniffing at the basement door again.

                                 JO
                        You said --

                                 ANDY
                             (cutting her off)
                        What?  What did I say?  Did I lie?
                        Did I tell you he wasn't?  I said I 
                        was in trouble.  I said someone's 
                        after me.  I said he was angry.  
                        All true.  

           Rufus CLAWS at the basement door.  Jo looks at the dog, at 
           the door - what's he after?

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Josephine?

           Jo looks back at Andy.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You said I could count on you.  Was 
                        that a lie?

           Andy steps forward - and Jo steps back.  SHUDDERS.

           And the change in Andy is like a kick to the gut - sudden and 
           sickening.  In the next beat, he's removed.  Mechanical.
                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You're cold.  I'll get more wood.

                                 JO
                        I'll go.

           Too quick, too much intention.  Andy steps in front of Jo.

                                 ANDY
                        No.  I'll go.  And when I get back, 
                        we'll have ourselves a little talk.

           Jo watches Andy head out.  Watches the front door close.  
           Stands there - what the hell does she do now?  

           Rufus is BARKING now at the basement door.  Frantic, panting, 
           worked up with worry.  Jo watches him - DREAD grips her and 
           won't let go.  What's behind that door?

           She approaches the BASEMENT DOOR.  Rufus WHINES as she places 
           her hand on the knob.  The dog can barely contain himself.

           Jo unlocks the door, opens it - and Rufus charges down the 
           stairs into the dark basement.  

           The SOUND of someone GASPING in pain...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BASEMENT DEN - NIGHT

           Jo grabs at the FLASHLIGHT hanging on a peg just inside the 
           door, switches it on - barely works.  Yellow stuttering light 
           leads her DOWN THE STAIRS.  

                                 JO
                        Rufus...?

                                 A WHISPER (OS)
                             (very faint)
                        Jo...

           Jo stops on the stairs.  Throws the light into every corner.

           The room has been turned INSIDE OUT.

           Every cupboard and closet door hangs open, its contents 
           SPILT, scattered and tossed about with abandon.  Shelves have 
           been cleared, a topple of books and collectibles on the 
           floor.  Trunks have been flung open and pillaged.  The 
           cushions on the sofa are all overturned. 

           Finally, Jo's flashlight finds Rufus.  He's wagging, licking 
           at something - someone - on the floor...  DIANE.
           Jo scrambles down the stairs to Diane.  Sinks to her knees.  
           Can't fathom what she's seeing - Diane's BRUISED AND SWOLLEN 
           face, the terror in her eyes.  Freezing, teeth chattering.

                                 JO
                        What happened...?  

           Diane grips Jo's arm as she helps her to the sofa.

                                 DIANE
                        Where is he?

                                 JO
                        What?

                                 DIANE
                        Andy - where is he right now!

                                 JO
                        Outside.   

                                 DIANE 
                        Get help.  Run to Lois before he 
                        comes back in.

                                 JO
                        What are you saying - Andy did this 
                        to you?

                                 DIANE
                        He's looking for something and 
                        we're in his way.  Go before it's 
                        too late.

           Jo starts to move away, but Diane is still holding her.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        Your dad - he's okay, Jo.  He 
                        called again.  He'll be here soon.
                             (then --)
                        Now go.

           Jo stumbles back, DROPS the flashlight, fumbles to pick it up 
           and the LIGHT SWINGS to the WINDOW --

           ANDY

           peers in from outside at the wood-pile, watching them.  

           Jo SCREAMS.

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        Go!
           Jo BOLTS for the stairs, but stops - looks back at Diane.  

                                 DIANE (CONT'D)
                        GO!

           Jo launches up and out of the basement.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo darts for the front door - just as Andy enters - blocking 
           her way out.  

                                 ANDY
                        Time for that talk.

           Jo turns and sprints for the kitchen.  Andy dashes after her, 
           his hands snatching and missing.  Jo flies across the 
           kitchen, TRIPS on the loose SHOTGUN SHELLS spilled outside 
           the pantry door.  She falls - scrambles to get up...

           Andy throws himself at Jo - GRABS her ankle.  

           Pulls her down again.

           Jo lashes out with her foot...  

           THWACK!  Kicks Andy in the mouth, wrenching her ankle free.

           She gets up, leaps for the back door.  It's locked.

           Fumbles with the bolt - yanks the door open.

           Andy's hands grab for her...

           RIP!  He tears a pocket off her coat.

           And Jo is out the door, RUNNING...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - NIGHT

           KNEE-DEEP SNOW - adrenaline propels Jo forward.  Wind sheers 
           snow sideways, blurring her path.  She can't see more than a 
           few feet ahead.  She looks back.

           ANDY - braced in the door frame.

                                 ANDY
                        Thought you liked me, Josephine.

           Jo pushes on.  Yanks up her hood, shields her mouth and nose 
           from the freeze.  Holds those tears at bay.  

           BEHIND HER - the glow of the house dissolves into the storm's 
           dark slur.
           AHEAD - SOMETHING PROTRUDING from the snow...

           THE AXE HANDLE

           Jo wants it.  Moves faster.  Trudges up and grasps the 
           handle.  It won't budge.  Uses both hands.  TUGS.

           She lurches back and falls.  

           She SCREAMS.

           LOIS' RED PLAID FLANNEL COAT 

           yanked up from beneath a layer of new snow.  The axe - 
           embedded in the flannel - buried in THE OLD WOMAN'S BACK.  

           Lois is DEAD.

                                 ANDY'S VOICE (OS)
                        Josephine...

           And Jo is on her feet, boots SLAMMING into the snow, RUNNING.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Trees bow in the wind, branches WHIP and SNAP.  Bitter cold.  
           Every lunge forward takes more and more out of Jo.  She's 
           exhausted.  Ice has begun to form on her eyelashes.  

           She peers into the fierce wind ahead.  Can't see a thing.  
           Her legs fail her.  She can't go on.  Falls. 

           And there in front of her - THE TOP OF THE SPLIT-RAIL FENCE.  
           She knows where she is now.  She's close.

           Very faint in the distance behind -- ANDY'S VOICE CALLING...

           Jo rallies everything she's got left and gets up.  Hoists 
           herself over the fence.  Treads up the hill...  

           A PORCH LIGHT

           stuttering through the whipping snow and ice...

           EXT. LOIS' CABIN - NIGHT

           Jo plunges to the front porch.  She's made it.  A beat to 
           catch her breath.  She barrels up the steps to the front door 
           and throws it open.

           INT. LOIS' CABIN - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo shoves her weight into the wind and closes the door.  Her 
           hand slams at the BOLT, locking it.  
           She slaps at the light-switch.  The bulb in the ceiling 
           fixture sizzes out a DULL, THROBBING GLOW.  Generator's low 
           here, too. 

           Jo takes in the murky room around her.  A LOFT overhead.  A 
           few EMBERS blushing in the wood-stove.  CLUTTER in all 
           directions - books, stacked furniture, photographs, 
           keepsakes, animal carcasses STUFFED and MOUNTED, things that 
           will never be used and things that were used up long ago.  

           And then Jo sees it - THE RADIO.

           A dinosaur machine - massive and covered in switches.  The 
           desk where it sits is piled high with newspapers and photos 
           and maps.  Jo SWIPES her arm through it all to make way, 
           seizing up the RECEIVER MIC and flipping switches.

                                 JO 
                             (into mic)
                        Hello?  Anybody out there?  Please, 
                        I need help!  Come in!

           STATIC splutters.  Jo throws more switches.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                             (into mic)
                        Come in!  Come in!  I'm about forty 
                        miles north of Severton on the west 
                        border of the Sappatch Wilderness --

           The SOUND of BOOTS THUMPING on the porch.  Jo whips around.

           THE DOORKNOB turns, rattles.  The bolt holds.

           ANDY'S FACE in the window - swollen where Jo kicked him.

                                 ANDY
                             (muffled through the 
                              glass)
                        Let me in, Josephine.  I just wanna 
                        talk to you.

                                 JO 
                             (into mic)
                        Help me.  Please.

           Andy's rage is palpable.  He ducks away for a beat and then -- 

           CRASH!  A hunk of firewood SMASHES through the window.

           GLASS SHATTERS and flies in all directions.  SHARDS launch 
           toward Jo.  She turns away - but, too late.  A CHUNK OF GLASS 
           pierces through the coat she's wearing (still the ranger's) 
           and EMBEDS itself in her arm.  She DROPS the radio mic, CRIES 
           OUT in pain and grabs at her arm.
           WIND tosses Lois' clutter around like anger.

           Andy CRANES his arm inside, reaches for the door, urgently 
           sweeping his hand up and down for THE BOLT.  Just REACHES it.  
           Shreds of glass in the window frame snag his sleeve.  HIS 
           FINGERS work the bolt.

           CLICK!  He's got it.

           Jo YANKS out the glass shard from her arm.

           Looks up just in time to see Andy throw the door open.

           She lunges for the LADDER to the loft and clambers up.  

           Andy is on Jo, grabbing at her from behind.  Jo kicks, her 
           boot CRUSHING again into Andy's face.  He staggers, then 
           claws at her, YANKS her down a rung.  They grapple, snatching 
           and flinging arms.

           Andy latches hold of the ranger's coat and jerks.  Jo claws 
           her way up the ladder and twists, coming out of the coat as 
           Andy TUGS, pulling it inside-out.  Jo RIPS her arms out of 
           the sleeves and as Andy falls back on the floor, still 
           clinging to the coat --

           THE CELL-PHONE 

           is expelled from the breast pocket and slides into a corner.  
           We notice, but they don't.

           Jo scales the last few rungs and hurls herself to the loft.

           LOFT

           More of the same CLUTTER.  Everywhere.  Jo desperately scans 
           her immediate vicinity, looking for something - and spots AN 
           OLD PITCHFORK.  That'll do.  Seizes it.

           MAIN ROOM

           Andy gets up, grabs for the ladder and propels himself up.

           WHOOSH!  The pitchfork zings past his ear.  

           Jo waves her weapon with abandon - but, the pitchfork is 
           unwieldy and the injury to her arm zaps her strength.

           Andy clings to the ladder with one hand and snatches out with 
           the other, trying to snag the rusted tines as they whip 
           within inches of his head.  His fingers LATCH ON.

           The radio SPITS AND HISSES.  And then --
                                 MAN'S VOICE (OS)
                             (through the radio)
                        I copy you, Sappatch Wilderness.  
                        This is Iron Eagle.  Come in.   

           Andy spins to look at the radio.  Jo sees her chance and 
           takes it.  One hard JAB, FLINGING Andy off the ladder.

           The pitchfork GRAZES his cheek as he careens back into a 
           tower of Lois' amassed hoard.  Books tumble, vases smash, 
           stiff and dusty animal carcasses plummet all around him.

           JO'S POV - FROM THE LOFT

           Andy prostrate, unmoving, in the pile of junk on the floor.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                             (through the radio)
                        Sappatch Wilderness, do you copy?  
                        Did I hear you right?  You need 
                        help?  Over.

           JO'S POV - THE RADIO MIC 

           Can she make it?

           No time to deliberate.  Jo swings her legs back onto the 
           ladder and begins her descent, one eye on Andy.  Her boots 
           are cumbersome, hard to maneuver on the narrow rungs.  Her 
           arm is useless.  She SLIPS.  Catches herself.  Halfway there.  

           MAIN ROOM

           ANDY moves.

           Jo stops.  Holds her breath.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (OS) 
                             (through the radio)
                        Sappatch Wilderness, do you read 
                        me?  What is your exact location?  
                        Over.

           Andy touches his cheek - blood on his fingers.  Sits up, 
           shakes it off.  And notices Jo perched there above him.

           Jo bolts back up the ladder --  

           LOFT

           -- and scrabbles to pick up the pitchfork again, aiming it at 
           Andy like it's loaded.
           MAIN ROOM

           Andy pulls himself to his feet.  Struggles to stand.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (OS) 
                             (through the radio)
                        I repeat, what is your exact 
                        location?  Over.

           Andy staggers through the debris to the desk.  

           JO WATCHES over the edge of the loft as Andy wrenches up the 
           radio mic and YANKS.  THE WIRES jerk free.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                             (through the radio)
                        Sappatch Wilderness, come in!

           And Andy grasps the radio with both hands, heaves it up off 
           the desk - and HURLS it across the room.  The metal box 
           strikes the iron stove and BLASTS APART into a scatter of 
           irreparable parts.

           Jo's hope disintegrates.  

           Andy turns and looks up at her.

                                 ANDY 
                        You let me down, Josephine.  

           Andy leans down to collect the ranger coat.  And stops.  A 
           PHOTOGRAPH on the floor in a crushed frame draws him.  He 
           picks it up.  Gazes.  

           ON PHOTO - A YOUNG WOMAN smiling, sitting on Gunther.

           We might recognize her...

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Where you gonna go?

           Andy stands the photo in its broken frame on the desk.  And 
           heads for the front door.  

           As he passes the loft, he abruptly KICKS THE LADDER AWAY.  It 
           clatters against the wall and slides to the floor, Jo's only 
           way down.  

           Andy stops at the door, stands there a beat, his back to Jo.

           Without a word, he SLAMS HIS FIST into the wall.  

           And exits.
           LOFT

           Jo crumples in despair, SHIVERS without a coat.  Pushes back 
           against the wall in the dark favoring her cut arm, tucks in 
           her knees, and cradles herself.  Just a frightened kid.

           AN ELECTRONIC PINGING...

           Jo doesn't hear it at first - until she does.  She slowly 
           looks up.  Sits up.  Peers around.  Follows the sound. 

           JO'S POV - THE CELL PHONE

           down in the corner of the room amongst all that clutter.   

           Jo crawls from one end of the loft to the other, looking for 
           a way down.  A ten-foot drop, too far to jump.  The top of A 
           RICKETY BOOKCASE swollen with junk is her only option. 

           On her stomach, Jo worms her way back, legs dangling over the 
           edge, heavy snow boots threatening to pull her over.  Her 
           foot jabs in search of the top shelf.  Contact.  The bookcase 
           JOSTLES.  A ceramic horse shimmies off a shelf and SMASHES on 
           the floor.

           Jo works her way down from one sagging shelf to the next - 
           but the bookcase is precarious.  It LEANS with her weight.  
           TIPS too far.  No stopping it - the thing is coming down.

           Jo LEAPS off to the side as all those bloated shelves PITCH 
           down and explode in a mess on the floor. 

           She lands hard.  It takes a beat to find her breath.  She 
           staggers to the corner and snatches up the cell-phone. 

           CELL-PHONE - CLOSE ON PHONE SCREEN

           PING - "Low Battery".  

           Jo frantically punches in "911"... Still NO SIGNAL.

                                 JO
                        No!  Please!  Please!

           ON PHONE SCREEN-SAVER

           a blurred VIDEO STILL of a YOUNG WOMAN'S FACE.

           Jo is compelled - what is this?  She selects "PLAY"...

           ON SCREEN - the woman's face suddenly snaps to life, though 
           we can't make out the details.  By the way the video swings 
           around the room, we know she's the one holding the phone.   
                                 WOMAN (OS)
                        You can't manhandle him like this!  
                        That's excessive force!    

           U.S. MARSHAL'S FACE - THE BEARDED MAN

           aggravated, moving past the camera and shoving Andy into a 
           chair.  They've recently come in from outside - snow on their 
           clothes.  Andy has been roughed up.  

           In background - the interior of the RANGER STATION, intact.

                                 U.S. MARSHAL
                        Ma'am, I'd advise you to keep your 
                        distance.  This man is a fugitive.  
                        If you continue to interfere with 
                        his arrest, I'll arrest you, too.

           The Marshal attempts to slap hand-cuffs on Andy, but Andy 
           resists.  The Marshal STRIKES him, chugging his fist into 
           Andy's nose.  Hard.  Andy's NOSE BLEEDS.

                                 WOMAN (OS) 
                        I'm getting this.  All of it.  
                        We'll sue your ass!  

           A man approaches from behind the Marshal to help - RANGER 
           HENRY - we know him, the dead man on the floor. 

           The Marshal tosses Ranger Henry a second pair of hand-cuffs.

                                 U.S. MARSHAL
                        Cuff her, too.  

           Ranger Henry, out of his element and rattled, approaches the 
           camera.  A brief SCUFFLE - and the video plummets end over 
           end until coming to a JARRING STOP on the floor.  

           It's still recording...

           LOOKING UP NOW - pixelized, the picture murky, strange and 
           incomplete angles - bodies hurl past, GRUNTS, SOUNDS of flesh 
           being pummeled, the woman SCREAMING and --

           THUD!

           A beat later - Andy moves past, dragging the badly-beaten and 
           UNCONSCIOUS Marshal.

           The OS SOUND of a door slamming shut.

           Movement just off-screen - injured Ranger Henry stumbles into 
           frame, reaching for A KNIFE in the sheath on his belt, moving 
           for THE RADIO.  Just as his hand grips the mic --
           -- Andy explodes into frame, SHOVING him off-screen.  The 
           radio mic dangles...  THWACK! off-screen.  Then silence.

           ABOVE US NOW - the woman's legs, her arms gripped around her 
           waist.  Stunned.  

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
                        Oh my God...  You killed him?

                                 ANDY
                        He was gonna radio out, baby.  I 
                        had no choice.  I'm not going back 
                        to prison.  

           Andy rakes a hand through his hair - and without warning, 
           flies at the woman.  FIERCE.  Not just angry - ENRAGED.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You said they wouldn't be there!  You 
                        said they never come up to that house 
                        anymore.  That's what you said!

                                 WOMAN (OS)
                        Don't yell.

                                 ANDY 
                        How hard could it be to hide it?  
                        Ten-thousand acres of wilderness 
                        out here and you plant it in a 
                        goddamn house full of people!

                                 WOMAN (OS)
                        Don't yell! 

                                 ANDY
                        Just tell me where you hid it!

                                 WOMAN (OS)
                        You're hurting me! 

           CRACK! - THE WOMAN'S FACE 

           as she slams against the wood floor planks right in front of 
           us.  Now we know her.  The dead woman at the station.  The 
           woman on the horse in the photo --  

                                 JO
                        Maya...?

           MAYA's head bleeds.  She gasps, can't catch her breath.  Her 
           hand appears in frame, moves to her neck, MARKS FROM ANDY'S 
           FINGERS are starting to bruise.  And slipping from her hand --
           THE SKELETON KEY 

           with the pink beaded tassel...

           A DEEP RUMBLING - the video VIBRATES.  Things tumble from the 
           walls, off the table, slide across the floor, the ceiling 
           splits -- AVALANCHE...

           And the video abruptly CUTS OUT.  Battery's dead.

           Jo digests all she's just seen.

           She looks at the PHOTO OF MAYA riding Gunther...  And 
           something brews, her hopelessness melting into a new resolve.  
           We see it on her face.  She has an idea.  A good one.

           And she's up and on her feet.  Scrambles through the rubble, 
           snatches one of Lois' coats at the door - and exits.

           EXT. LOIS' CABIN - NIGHT

           Jo forges her way through the storm to the BARN...

           INT. LOIS' BARN - NIGHT

           Gunther dozes in his stall.  Looks up at the sound of someone 
           approaching - Jo.  A WHINNY of recognition...

           EXT. LOIS' BARN - NIGHT

           The gargantuan horse BURSTS from the barn with Jo clinging to 
           his back.  Each thrust forward through the deep snow is an 
           effort, but this horse is powerful and willing.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Jo rides Gunther through the tangle of winter trees, down 
           hill, cleaving to him for dear life.  His sheer size makes it 
           hard to stay on.  Jo slips, rights herself, clings.  Brutal 
           wind and snow buffets her face. 

           JO'S POV - MOUNTAIN CHALET

           up ahead, glowing dim through the murk.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - NIGHT

           Jo rides Gunther past the house, not intending to stop.

           The SOUND of Rufus' distressed BARKING from inside. 

           Jo looks back.  
           JO'S POV - BIG WINDOWS THROUGH THE TREES

           IN THE GREAT ROOM, Andy SHOVES Diane into a chair.

           Jo yanks back on Gunther's reins.

                                 JO
                        Whoa!  

           The horse reluctantly comes to a halt, antsy to keep going.  

           JO'S POV - BIG WINDOWS

           Diane wavers to her feet, but Andy shoves her down again.  
           Rufus is going crazy.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy whips off his BELT and wraps it around Diane's arms, 
           securing her to the chair, CINCHES it tight. 

                                 ANDY
                        I want you where I can see you.

           Rufus suddenly charges forward and SNAPS at Andy, GRAZING him 
           with his teeth.  A warning.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Ouch!  Son of a bitch!

           Andy reaches for the shotgun --

                                 DIANE
                        Andy, no!  Please!  

           Andy is affected - an ounce of decency?  Reconsiders.  Grabs 
           Rufus by the collar and drags him SNARLING across the floor, 
           TOSSES him into the basement den and SLAMS the door closed.

           All is quiet. 

           Until Andy starts violently RANSACKING the room.  SWEEPING 
           his arm across tables, launching lamps into mid-air, RIPPING 
           open boxes and drawers. 

                                 ANDY 
                        Where the hell did she hide it!

                                 DIANE
                        Tell me what you're looking for.
                                 ANDY
                        You'd like that, wouldn't you?  So 
                        you could hoard it for yourself.  
                        You're all liars and snakes!

                                 DIANE
                        Andy, I've never lied to you.

           He SURGES at Diane, KICKS her chair over.  Her arms are bound, 
           she can't break her fall.  Her face SMACKS hard on the floor.

                                 ANDY
                        Shut up!  Just shut up!  

           Andy KICKS the chair again and again, each thrust of his boot 
           like a sledgehammer to Diane's spine.  She can't breathe.  

                                 JO'S VOICE (OS)
                        STOP!

           Andy turns, startled out of his rage.

           JO stands there behind him, half-frozen and wild-eyed. 

                                 ANDY
                        Well, look who couldn't live 
                        without me after all.

           Diane clutches her belly and SOBS. 

           Andy advances on Jo.  Jo holds her ground.

                                 JO 
                        I know what you're looking for.  

           And she tosses Andy his CELL-PHONE.  

           Andy grabs at his sweater, suddenly remembering, patting 
           himself down, searching - but of course, it's not there... 

           And Jo notices BLOOD blushing through DIANE'S jeans.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                             (to Andy)
                        I'll help you find it.  But you 
                        have to let me help her first.

           Andy follows Jo's gaze to the blood...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Jo helps her stepmother up the stairs, a lantern on one arm, 
           Diane on the other.  Diane is in pain, doubled-over, clutching 
           her stomach, leaving SPOTS OF BLOOD on the wood underfoot.
           Andy stands at the base of the stairs, clenching the shotgun, 
           watching them climb.

                                 ANDY 
                        What's wrong with her?

           Jo doesn't turn, doesn't miss a beat.

                                 JO
                        She's pregnant.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jo cranks on the tub faucet.  Diane leans against the sink - 
           exhausted, but grateful for Jo's kindness.  Surprised by it.

                                 JO
                        Water probably won't get as hot as 
                        it should with the low generator.

                                 DIANE
                        How did you know?

           Jo helps Diane undress.  Awkward.  Jo still guards herself 
           with a certain irreverence.

                                 JO
                        I heard you puking.  And I saw the 
                        book.

                                 DIANE
                        We only just found out.  We wanted 
                        to tell you when the time was 
                        right.  We thought coming up here, 
                        to your favorite place...

                                 JO
                             (snaps)
                        Is that what my dad told you?  That 
                        this is my favorite place?

           Diane - no adequate response.  Jo shifts gears.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Girl or boy?

           Diane stands naked, exposed and vulnerable.  

                                 DIANE
                        Neither.  Anymore.  I'm losing it.

           A moment of connection - LOSS.  Something they share now.
           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy paces at the base of the stairs, glancing up at each 
           pass under the thunder of the water pipes.  Uptight.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Diane lowers herself into the bath.  The water goes PINK.

           Jo kneels beside the tub, hands Diane a washcloth, speaking 
           quietly under the ROAR of the faucet.

                                 JO
                        Lois is dead.

           Diane reacts.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        And the radio - Andy busted it 
                        before I could get to anybody.

           Diane's hopelessness takes over.  TEARS well.

           THUD THUD THUD! Sudden banging on the bathroom door.

           Jo whips around.

                                 ANDY (OS)
                        What are you doing in there?

                                 JO
                        Diane's taking a bath.

                                 ANDY (OS)
                        Open the door.

                                 JO
                        What?  No!  

           Jo jumps up and anchors her weight against the door.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I told you, she's in the bath.

                                 ANDY (OS)
                        And I told you, open the door!

           CRUNCH!  Something slams up against the door.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Open.
                             (THWACK!)
                        The damn.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                             (CRASH!)
                        Door!

           Wood splinters and the door crashes off its hinges.  Andy 
           stands on the other side, panting, shotgun over his shoulder.

           Jo stares.  Diane shields her breasts and stares.

           Andy spots the pink bath-water and turns away.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        No secrets.

           He walks off.  They HEAR him creaking down the stairs.  Jo 
           looks at Diane, at her despair.

                                 JO 
                        I have a plan.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo moves to THE CLOSET.  This is hard.  She deliberates.  
           Then lugs the doors open.  By the light of her lantern --

           HER MOTHER'S IV STAND

           her mother's hospital gowns, her mother's worn SLIPPERS... 

           Memories Jo wasn't prepared for.  She can't move for a beat.  
           But, she rallies.  Pushes aside the sick-wear to the sweaters 
           and jeans at the back.  Tugs down a cold-weather outfit.

           A small DOOR IN THE WALL at the back of the closet with a 
           WARDED LOCK - built for a skeleton key.  Jo eyes it...   

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo reaches under her bed, way at the back, as far as her arm 
           can stretch.  Where is it?  A little further...  JO'S FINGERS 
           finally locate a small velvet box.  She grabs it, slides it 
           out, opens it.

           INSIDE BOX - a skeleton key was here once, the indentation in 
           the velvet still visible.  All that's left behind are a few 
           tiny PINK BEADS...  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jo sets HER MOTHER'S CLOTHES on the edge of the sink.  

                                 JO
                        These should fit.  You're about the 
                        same size.  
           Diane is moved by the gesture.  And suddenly, PAIN.  Diane 
           folds over, trying to breathe through it.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        How bad is it?

           Diane can't even answer.

           Jo turns and digs through the hutch beside the tub - rifles 
           through her mother's OLD MEDS.  Finds the bottle she's 
           looking for, pops the cap and offers Diane TWO PILLS.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        They're old, but it's better than 
                        nothing.

           Diane takes the pills and Jo fetches her a glass of water.  
           Jo reaches to return the bottle to the hutch - but 
           reconsiders.  Tucks it in her coat pocket just in case.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        You're going to have to climb out 
                        the window and down the roof-line.  

                                 DIANE
                        I don't know if I can do that.

           The water's turning RED.  Jo is desperate.  Adamant. 

                                 JO 
                        You have to!  

           Jo digs a HAIR PIN out of the hutch and bends it into a HOOK.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I'll be out as soon as I can.

                                 DIANE
                        Why aren't you coming with me now?

                                 JO
                        Because he's not going to let us go 
                        until he gets what he wants.  

           Jo heads out.

                                 DIANE 
                        Jo?

           Jo turns at the door.

           BETH 

           sits in the tub.  Smiles.
                                 BETH 
                        I'm proud of you.

           Jo swallows hard and exits.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - NIGHT

           Jo moves silently to the railing and looks over, down into 
           THE GREAT ROOM.  She can't see Andy, but she can HEAR him - 
           SOUNDS of things being moved and thrown aside downstairs...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo returns to her mother's closet.  Sinks down to her knees.  
           Crawls to the door at the back - and inserts the bent hairpin 
           into the warded lock.  Digs, turns --

           CLICK!  The door pops open.

           One long breath.  Jo braces.  And pulls the door open.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

           By the light of Jo's lantern - a 5x5 foot little girl's 
           SHRINE to her beloved mother.  Photos, drawings, trinkets, 
           flowers in a vase dried by time, a lovingly-made and dusty 
           pillow embroidered with "Mom", an unopened Christmas present -
           "To Mom from Josey".  This space is loaded.

           Jo chokes on the emotion.   

           It takes every ounce of resolve she has to pull the place 
           apart in search of what Maya must have hid here - opening 
           music boxes, photo boxes, slipping her hand behind milk 
           crates full of dolls and toys and keepsakes...

           Behind a drawing on the wall scrawled in crayon years ago - 
           "JO AND MAYA - FRIENDS 4-EVER!"... 

           Under A BLANKET - and Jo finds it.

           A BLACK, VINYL BAG.

           Jo pulls the bag into her lap.  Tugs the zipper back.  

           HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.  Too many to count.

           The SOUND of crashing and smashing directly beneath her.

           Jo pushes aside the blanket to reveal A TRAP DOOR IN THE 
           FLOOR, LIGHT fingering its way up through the GAPS in the 
           boards.  She presses her eye to the gap, peers down.
           JO'S POV - THE PANTRY BELOW

           glimpses of Andy gutting the shelves, flinging everything to 
           the floor.  Nearing rabid.

           Jo sits up and clutches the bag of money, inching her way 
           back and out of the secret room...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - NIGHT

           Andy chucks a box to the floor and suddenly stops.  The SOUND 
           of floorboards CREAKING overhead.  He looks up - notices THE 
           DOOR IN THE CEILING.

           He props up the step-ladder and climbs to the top rung.  
           Pushes into the trap door over his head.  It gives.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy throws open the trap door and discovers Jo's shrine.  
           The thrill of finding what he's been looking for - his 
           obsession finally within reach.  Intoxicated by it.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo barely makes it out in time.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

           Andy hoists himself up and starts digging through it all. 

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - NIGHT

           Jo moves past the door-less BATHROOM on her way to the 
           stairs.  Stops there.

           JO'S POV - DIANE

           dressed and just climbing out the window.  Diane turns, looks 
           back at Jo.  A moment of shared fear and determination.

           Jo turns and hurries down the stairs.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - JO'S SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

           There's nothing else for Andy to eviscerate.  It's not here.

           THE DOOR TO THE CLOSET - slightly ajar.

           Andy notices.  Infuriated.  He bounds for the door.

                                 ANDY
                        Jo!
                                 JO (OS)
                        Andy?

           Andy halts.  Jo's voice came from downstairs.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - PANTRY - NIGHT

           Andy slips down out of the trap door.  Kicks his feet to find 
           the step-ladder - misses.  And plummets to the floor.  Pulls 
           himself to his feet and exits the pantry.  Pissed.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo stands at the fireplace.  In her hand, the POKER.  At the 
           end of the poker - THE BAG OF MONEY dangling over the FLAME.

           Andy freezes in place.  Shit.

                                 JO
                        I set the money on the hearth, you 
                        let us walk out of here, and we all 
                        get what we want.

                                 ANDY
                        "We" huh?  So what - you and 
                        Stepmom are soul sisters now?

                                 JO
                        Do we have a deal or not?

           A beat - Andy chews on it.  Finally --

                                 ANDY 
                        You're judging me, Josephine.  I 
                        can see it on your face.  You don't 
                        know what I had to go through to 
                        get that money.

           Andy moves forward a step - not part of Jo's plan.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Born with a silver spoon in your 
                        mouth.  You don't know what it's 
                        like to be me. 

           A few more steps...

                                 JO
                        Stop.  Right there. 

                                 ANDY 
                             (ignoring her)
                        My whole life, nothing but nothing 
                        to show for it.   
           Jo shoves the poker closer to the flames.

                                 JO
                        Come any closer and it's going in, 
                        Andy.  You'll still have nothing. 

           Andy stops.

                                 ANDY
                        I thought maybe Maya was the one.  
                        I thought maybe for once I had 
                        someone I could trust.  Turns out, 
                        she was just stringing me along.  A 
                        lot like you. 

           Jo has no choice but to tip the bag into the flame.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I'm not going back to prison, 
                        Josephine.  I'll die before I let 
                        that happen.

           The vinyl on the bag starts to CONSTRICT AND MELT.

           Too close.  Andy can't take it.  He throws up his hands.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  Okay.  You win.  You win.

                                 JO
                        We're walking out of here.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.  Just - you're burning it.  
                        Don't burn it.

           Jo swings the poker out of the flames.

           The bag SMOKES.

           She lowers the bag to the hearth, glances at the front door 
           behind her, assesses the distance, the probability...

           And TOSSES THE BAG INTO THE FLAMES.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        NO!  

           And she RUNS.

           Andy dives at the fire as Jo bounds out the front door.
           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CARPORT - NIGHT

           Jo rounds the corner to find Diane dangling from the eaves, 
           clutching the roof-line, flanked by BLADES OF ICICLES.  Jo 
           rushes in to help.  Positions herself directly beneath Diane, 
           icicles poised like deadly sabers over their heads.

                                 JO
                        Let go.  I've got you.

                                 DIANE 
                        I can't!

           Gunther snorts and stomps, spooked, ready to move.

                                 JO
                        Let go!

           Diane peers down at Jo, closes her eyes - and lets go.  Jo's 
           got her, maneuvering Diane safely to solid footing.

           An ICICLE plummets to the ground, missing Jo by an inch.

           Diane clutches her stomach - the pain almost too much to 
           bear.  Jo wraps an arm around her stepmother and together 
           they scrabble across the snow and ice to the huge horse.  

           Diane stops - stares at Gunther in disbelief.

                                 DIANE
                        A horse?

                                 JO
                        The car's buried and he's not.  
                        Come on!

           Diane is terrified - but she rallies and climbs up with Jo's 
           help, slipping on the logs until Jo threads her arm through 
           hers and hoists her onto the horse.  

           Jo follows Diane up, leans over Gunther's neck, unties the 
           reins from the post, barely getting them unfastened before 
           the horse is off and running.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Gunther charges toward the road, boring into the snow, every 
           muscle straining for speed against snow so deep his legs 
           disappear with each stab forward.

           Jo and Diane hang on.

           POW!
           The horse suddenly buckles beneath them.

           Jo and Diane are flung headlong into the snow.  

           Gunther's immense body collapses, pinning them.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - NIGHT

           Andy stands on the front porch - and lowers the shotgun...  

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Jo shoves Gunther, trying to free her legs - but the horse 
           isn't responding.

                                 JO
                        I can't move him!

           Diane garners all her strength and joins Jo, both pushing 
           their weight against the titanic beast - everything they've 
           got.  Shoving, rocking, straining...   Jo sidles her way 
           loose.  Then Diane.  And they're free.

           Jo crawls through the snow to Gunther's head.  Coaxes.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Get up, Gunther.  Come on, boy.

                                 DIANE
                        He's gone, Jo.

           The SOUND of boots CRUNCHING through the snow.

           They look up to see ANDY APPROACHING, reloading the shotgun.  

           Jo is inconsolable.

                                 JO
                        How could you?  You bastard!

           Diane grabs Jo by the arm and yanks her to her feet - and 
           they RUN.  Stumbling and dragging in the deep snow, back 
           through the maze of trees, back toward the house. 

           Andy pursues them - but he's in no rush.  Every footfall 
           deliberate, unhurried.  All the time in the world...  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jo and Diane fling themselves in through the back door, 
           breathless, slamming it shut behind them.  BOLTING it. 

           Jo flies across -- 
           THE GREAT ROOM

           -- to the front door and SLAPS THE BOLT into place.  

           She leans back against the door.  Diane braces against the 
           counter, doubled-over in pain.  They stare at each other from 
           one end of the room to the other.  For a beat, they just 
           breathe.   

           At last, Jo moves into the disarray of the room, stumbling 
           over the broken and battered remnants of Andy's search - and 
           throws herself into a chair with her back to the windows.  
           Her head falls into her hands.  Exhausted.

           Diane suddenly goes pale.

                                 DIANE
                        Jo, get away from the windows.

           Jo looks up and follows Diane's gaze over her shoulder.

           ANDY

           stands just on the other side of the enormous windows.  THE 
           SHOTGUN RAISED and aimed directly at Jo.

           Jo jumps to her feet but freezes there.  Too scared to move.

           Andy mouths the word "BANG!".  Smiles.  Lowers the gun.

                                 JO
                        You have your money!  What more do 
                        you want?  

           Andy raises his finger and definitively POINTS at Jo - "YOU".

           Jo snatches up a vase and CHUCKS it at the window, SCREAMING 
           in frustration, in anger.  Bad idea.  As the vase strikes, a 
           CRACK fissures the length of the glass - and stops.  It 
           doesn't shatter - yet.  Matter of time.

           Andy shakes his head in mock disapproval and walks away.

           Jo is keyed up.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Where's he going?  

           She rushes to the window and presses her face to the 
           compromised glass, peering in the direction Andy headed.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I can't see him.  Where is he?
           Diane edges Jo back from the window - aware that it could 
           implode at any second.  Jo breaks free from Diane, runs to a 
           side window.  Peers out.

           JO'S POV - ANDY

           plodding his way through the snow to THE GENERATOR SHED.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        He's not gonna let us go, is he.

           Jo begins to sink into the worst kind of despair - until her 
           gaze draws up the wall in front of her to --  

           THE STEEL JAW ANIMAL TRAPS.

           Aged and rusty antiques, but vicious.  Merciless.

           Jo is inspired.  Drags a chair to the wall and climbs up.

                                 DIANE
                        What are you doing?

                                 JO
                        Just keep an eye on him.  

           Diane moves to the window - one eye on the shed, one on Jo.

           Jo unhooks one heavy foothold trap from the wall.  And 
           another.  Loaded down, she stumbles off the chair.

                                 DIANE
                        You know what you're doing with 
                        those things?

                                 JO
                        No.

           Jo moves to the front door and unlocks it. 

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Yell if you see him coming.

           She tugs the front door open and grabs the shovel, leaves one 
           trap behind and slips outside with the other.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Jo works fast - digging a hole in the snow at the top of the 
           porch steps.  She lays the trap in the hole and measures out 
           the CHAIN.  Wraps the chain around the porch railing, 
           snatches the open padlock from the storage box, and hooks it 
           through, clamping it locked.
           She handles the trap - doesn't have the first clue how to set 
           the thing.  Determined, she tugs.  The jaws give slightly.  
           She's got it.  She hooks her fingers over the jaws and pulls, 
           strains, until they lie at 180 degrees.  CLICK!  It's set.

           She pushes the snow back over the hole, smooths it out.  No 
           one would ever know.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo throws the front door closed behind her, bolts it again.  
           Shoulders the shovel, picks up the second trap and SPRINTS 
           for the back door.  Diane glances as she passes...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BACK STOOP - NIGHT

           Jo DIGS.  From this angle, she can SEE the GENERATOR SHED.

           JO'S POV - ANDY'S SHADOW

           moving inside the buzzing light of the shed.

           Jo works faster, securing the trap chain around the leg of a 
           heavy propane grill.  Lays the trap in the hole.  Sets it.  
           Covers it.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN

           Jo flies in, locks the door.  A beat to catch her breath.

           THE CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS suddenly brighten.  Full blast.  A 
           lamp in the living room comes to life.  A BURNER on the stove 
           glows up, smokes.  Jo rushes over and turns it off.

                                 JO
                        He's powered up the generator full 
                        blast.  We'll burn out of fuel.   

           Jo goes to a window and peers out.

           JO'S POV - THE GENERATOR SHED

           Andy emerging, on his way back to the house.

           Diane joins Jo at the window.  Jo pulls away to snatch up the 
           fireplace poker.  Keeps it close.

                                 DIANE 
                        Jo, if something should happen to 
                        me and you're alone with him --

                                 JO
                             (cuts her off)
                        Nothing's going to happen to you.  
                                 DIANE
                        Listen - Andy wants to trust you.  
                        He wants an ally.  You have to play 
                        along while he waits out this 
                        storm.  He won't hurt you as long 
                        as he thinks you're on his side.  

                                 JO
                             (adamant)
                        Nothing's going to happen to you! 

           Suddenly - THWACK! 

           The SOUND comes from just outside the back door.  The trap 
           has been triggered.  A YELL of anguish from OUTSIDE.  He's in 
           pain.  Jo and Diane stare at each other.  Now what?

           Jo goes to the back door and cautiously spies out the inset 
           window.  But snow blows up against the glass in the dark, she 
           can't see a thing.  Her hand clenches around the door knob.  

                                 DIANE
                        It might be a trick.

           UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE STAIR LANDING

           on Jo and Diane huddled at the back door...

           MOANING outside.  

                                 JO
                        We could just - leave him.

           They contemplate.

                                 ANDY'S VOICE (OS)
                        Oooo - that's cold, Josephine.

           Jo and Diane whip around to see -- 

           ANDY 

           -- descending the stairs.  

                                 ANDY
                        But thanks for leaving the window 
                        open up there.  That, on the other 
                        hand, was very thoughtful.

           Jo's face suddenly loses all color.

                                 JO
                        Oh god...
           She throws back the lock and yanks the door open.

           CAM

           lies in the snow, one splinted leg snagged in the trap.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Dad!

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - BACK STOOP - NIGHT

           Cam's face is besieged with BLISTERS AND FROST-BITE.  He's 
           listless, frozen, barely present.  Jo flies to her father's 
           side and drops to the snow, desperate to help, her hands 
           flitting and darting around Cam's shattered leg.  

                                 JO
                        I don't know what to do!  I don't 
                        know how to get this off!

           Jo looks up for Diane's help, only to find Andy standing in 
           the doorway behind Diane, the shotgun barrel PRESSED across 
           Diane's neck.  She can't move.

                                 ANDY
                        We could just - leave him.

           Jo grabs hold of the trap's steel jaws and forces them open.  

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Wasn't a question, Josephine.

           Jo ignores Andy, straining to hold the trap open.

                                 JO
                             (to Cam)
                        Pull, Daddy.  Pull!

           But Cam is in too much pain, too weak to make any progress.

           A sudden BLAST from the shotgun sends Jo reeling back.  The 
           BULLET strikes the snow inches from her leg.  The trap 
           SPRINGS from Jo's grip and clamps back onto Cam's leg, 
           cracking the makeshift splint to pieces.

           Cam SCREAMS in agony.

           Jo catches her breath and looks at Andy as he brings the 
           barrel of the gun back to Diane's neck.  The metal is HOT, it 
           burns Diane's flesh.  She yelps. 

           Jo is livid.  YELLS at Andy.
                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        What is wrong with you!

                                 ANDY
                        I'll tell you all about it inside.  
                        We can start with my childhood and 
                        work our way up to all of tonight's 
                        betrayals.  Oh, sorry - was that a 
                        rhetorical question?

           Jo stumbles back to Cam, grabs at the trap again.  Now it's 
           Andy who's livid.  He dives forward and SNATCHES Jo by the 
           hair, his grip never loosening on Diane - and HURLS them both 
           back into the house.

           From the doorway, Andy peers at Cam lying there like a dying 
           animal.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You never did me any harm, Doc.  
                        I'm not gonna pull the trigger.

           A glance at the weather, at the trap, at Cam's predicament. 

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Looks like Mother Nature will take 
                        care of that.

           Andy closes the door and bolts it.

           Cam is left alone to die in the bitter cold and dark...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Diane COUGHS the air back into her lungs, her neck RAW where 
           the searing gunmetal burned her skin.  

           Jo flies at Andy, fearless, tries to yank away the shotgun, 
           beats on him with her fists.

                                 JO
                        I won't just leave my dad out there 
                        to die!

           Andy is barely fazed.  When Jo tries to get around him to the 
           back door, he holds her off with one arm.  She's exhausted, 
           weak, no match for this man.

           Andy pushes Jo and Diane to the sofa, hundred dollar bills 
           wagging out of his coat pockets like living things.  

           The minute she's pushed down, Jo jumps back up.
           Andy FLINGS her down again with force and aims the shotgun at 
           her head.  Diane grabs Jo's hand - it's all she can do.

                                 ANDY 
                        Never had to be like this, ladies.  
                        I would've been in and out.  You'd 
                        be missing me by now. 

           He pushes the gun to Jo's flesh.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        But you had to go and lie to me, 
                        Josephine.  Why'd you do that?

           Jo won't look at him, won't answer.  Buries her hands in her 
           pockets.  Insolent.

           Infuriated, Andy GRABS Jo by the hair and YANKS her head 
           back.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Why'd you tell me there was no 
                        goddamn secret room?

           Jo's face is all defiance.  She doesn't whimper, doesn't cry, 
           doesn't speak - just STARES hard right back at Andy.  He's 
           affected by that look.  No denying the animosity in her eyes.

           Andy releases her.  Gets up.  Switches gears.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        In case no one noticed -- 
                             (gestures at wall clock)
                        Merry Christmas.

           He smiles at Jo.  At Diane.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        You're stuck with me til daylight.  
                        Might as well make it a jolly time.

           He walks over to the old record player. 

           Jo looks at Diane trembling beside her, drained, no longer 
           fighting.  And slowly, carefully, pulls her hand out of her 
           pocket.  In Jo's palm - THE BOTTLE of painkillers.  Something 
           brews, another plan.  She slips the bottle back in her 
           pocket.

           All at once, the room fills with the SOUND of Bing Crosby and 
           Doris Day singing "Baby It's Cold Outside".  Loud.

           Andy turns and grins.
                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        I love this song.

           Jo's face twitches - and finds its way into a SMILE back.  

                                 JO
                        So do I.

           Andy double-takes.  Did she just smile at him?

           Jo stands and heads for the kitchen.  Andy YANKS her back.

                                 ANDY 
                        Where do you think you're going?

                                 JO
                        To make us some cocoa.  Like you 
                        said, it's Christmas.

           Andy considers - then releases her.  

                                 ANDY
                        Well hallelujah.  Make mine leaded.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jo sets the kettle on a burner.  She looks at the back door, 
           then at ANDY singing and dancing with himself in THE GREAT 
           ROOM.  It's written all over Jo's face - this is war and she 
           intends to win.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           THE KETTLE WHISTLING...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jo pours boiling water into three mugs - two red, one blue - 
           "World's Greatest Mom".  Powdered cocoa dissolves, the 
           contents of the mom mug BUBBLES and HISSES...  Jo adds some 
           of Lois' hooch to the mug and stirs quickly.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo hands Andy a RED MUG. 

                                 JO
                        So.  Merry Christmas.

           Andy watches Jo place the other red mug in front of Diane and 
           take blue for herself.  Watches her raise it to take a sip.  

                                 ANDY
                        I want yours.
                                 JO
                        What's wrong with yours?

                                 ANDY
                        Let's just say I have trust issues.

           Jo hesitates, plays it out - then reluctantly trades mugs.

           Andy raises the mom mug --

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        Deck the halls.

           -- lifts it to his lips under Jo's furtive gaze, and --

           THUD!  Something thumps up against the BACK DOOR.

           Andy lets the MUG FLY as he throws the butt of the shotgun up 
           against his shoulder.  Ceramic fractures all over the floor.  

           Jo looks down at the shattered mug, at "Mom" in pieces, at 
           her shattered plan and the tainted cocoa as it seeps down 
           between the floorboards... 

           ANDY FIRES.

           A HOLE blasts through the back door.  

           Diane SCREAMS and lunges at Andy.

                                 DIANE
                        No!  It's Cam!  You'll kill him!  

           Andy chucks Diane aside --

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           -- and approaches THE BACK DOOR.  Yanks it open.

           RUFUS THE DOG bounds away and out of sight.

           POW!  Andy FIRES again.  Misses.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - NIGHT

           Rufus runs past the BROKEN BASEMENT WINDOW...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Andy peers into the dark behind the house.  Grabs a 
           FLASHLIGHT from the counter.
           ANDY'S POV - OUTSIDE IN THE FLASHLIGHT GLOW

           the empty trap - Cam is gone.

           Andy quickly tries to reload - too late.

           CAM 

           is right behind him.  Sliding along the wall for support, 
           with the very last ounce of strength he's got - Cam raises 
           THE FIRE POKER and THRUSTS it into Andy's back, spearing him.

           Andy spins around as he's falling and the butt of the shotgun 
           CRACKS into Cam's head.  The two men go down - ANDY'S SKULL 
           SMACKING the corner of the counter, knocking him unconscious.   

           Jo and Diane scramble to Cam.  Diane takes stock of his 
           weather-ravaged face.  Jo checks for signs of life.

                                 JO
                        Dad?  Daddy, can you hear me?

           Cam GROANS.

           Jo looks at Andy on the floor nearby, face down, poker 
           protruding from his back.  He's out - but not for long.  

                                 DIANE
                        I saw a rope in the basement.  

                                 JO
                        Get it.   

           Andy makes a GARBLED SOUND from deep in his throat.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        Hurry!

           Diane bolts for the basement.

           Jo reaches up and grabs a kitchen towel from the counter, 
           rolling it and tucking it under Cam's head as a cushion.    

           She turns to Andy.  The SHOTGUN is within her reach, but it's 
           lodged under Andy's arm.   

           Jo summons all her courage with a deep breath - and slowly, 
           carefully, leans for the shotgun.  Her FINGERS wrap around 
           the barrel and she gently tugs it toward her.  Andy's body 
           LURCHES.  Jo stops.  Waits.  No further movement - she pulls 
           again, drawing the shotgun out from under him.  She's got it.
           She collects a handful of the spilled CARTRIDGES off the 
           floor, scrabbles to her feet, and now it registers - Andy's 
           body is stretched across the entryway.  The only way out of 
           this room is to step over him.

           He's coming-to slowly with burbles and murmurs...

           Clutching the shotgun like a last hope, Jo LEAPS over Andy --

           ANDY'S HAND

           DARTS OUT and knocks Jo off-balance.  She falls with a SMACK, 
           knocking the wind right out of her.

           Andy pulls himself up off the floor and grabs at the poker 
           lodged through his back.  Can't reach it - fingers crawling, 
           writhing up to his shoulder-blade, craning to grasp the iron 
           rod.  He HOLLERS OUT in pain.

           Jo catches her breath.  Staggers to her feet.  Tries to load 
           the shotgun, but her hands are shaking.  She DROPS the 
           cartridges on the floor...

           Andy's fingers loop around the poker handle.  And he YANKS...

           Jo scoops up the cartridges as fast as she can...

           Andy throws the poker aside and turns to face Jo.

                                 ANDY
                        This is gonna have a goddamn happy 
                        ending, Josephine.

           No time to reload.  Jo clutches the cartridges and the 
           shotgun and runs for the stairs.  Andy is right behind her.

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - STAIRS - NIGHT

           Jo hauls up the stairs in her boots.  Trips.  The shotgun 
           slips from her grip and clatters through a slat between the 
           steps.  Her arm jabs out, snatching the shotgun back just in 
           time.  Back on her feet and running.

           Andy thunders up behind her, but pain is slowing him down.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You got it all wrong, Josephine.  
                        You don't have to run from me.  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - CATWALK - NIGHT

           Jo races to the end of the catwalk and scrambles to load the 
           shotgun - but she can't get the chamber open.  
           Andy is at the top of the stairs now... 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        We like each other, remember?

           Jo backs up against the wall in the far corner of the 
           catwalk, strains to snap the shotgun open.  Andy keeps 
           advancing on her.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Oh wait, I forgot - you lied.

           Andy is right on top of Jo, now.  

           Without bullets loaded, the shotgun is only as good as a bat - 
           so Jo SWINGS.  Andy throws his arm out, deflecting the blow 
           and grabs hold of the barrel.  Jo isn't about to let go. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Give me the gun, Josephine.

           Jo sees DIANE creeping up behind Andy with the bloody POKER 
           raised over her head.  

           Andy catches the shift in Jo's gaze and turns just as the 
           steel poker WHACKS against his skull, sending him hurling 
           over the railing.

           On his way past Jo, he manages to snatch at her coat, snags 
           it - and PULLS her over with him, the shotgun tumbling out of 
           Jo's grip and onto the floor of the catwalk. 

           Jo CATCHES the lower rung of the railing and dangles there as 
           Andy plunges down to the floor below, HITTING hard, landing 
           with his leg bent unnaturally beneath him.

           Diane drops the poker and dives for Jo, grabs her at the 
           wrists - and tugs.  Jo's legs swing until her feet make 
           contact with the catwalk.  Diane pulls and Jo climbs, until 
           she's back up and over the railing.

           Together, they slump into an exhausted heap on the floor.

                                 DIANE
                        You alright?

           Jo nods.

           The lights suddenly FLICKER and start pulsing down.  The 
           MUSIC SLOWS to a creepy, tuneless moan - and then it stops.

           Jo and Diane are now sitting in absolute DARK and SILENCE. 
           Jo scrambles for the shotgun and cartridges, feeling around 
           on the floor until she finds them.  Snatches them up, fumbles 
           in the dark - still can't figure out how to load this thing.  

           Diane takes over, a whole new confidence, new momentum.  
           SNAPS the gun open, POPS in the two cartridges, and snaps it 
           shut again.  Jo is impressed.

           Diane looks over the catwalk railing, but it's too dark 
           downstairs.  She can't see a thing.

                                 DIANE (CONT’D)
                        Andy?

           No response.  Jo and Diane look at each other...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Diane descends the stairs slowly, silently, shotgun leading 
           the way.  Jo is right behind her with the poker...

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

           Diane approaches the spot where Andy landed.  Peers into the 
           dark.  Moves closer - looks left, right.  No sign of him.

           The SOUND of Cam MOANING from the kitchen floor...

           Diane heads in that direction.  Jo doesn't.  She's listening, 
           HEARS something.  A RUSTLING right behind her.  Jo spins 
           around - and Andy's hands are suddenly all over her.  She 
           SCREAMS and blindly THRUSTS the poker in terror. 

           A YELP.

           They weren't Andy's hands at all - but only RUFUS jumping up.  

           The dog slumps to the floor.  Jo drops the poker, devastated.

           The SOUND of a THUD! and SCUFFLE from the kitchen.

           Jo whips around.  Through the darkness, she can see body 
           shapes negotiating for control of the shotgun.  The SKY 
           behind them is starting to lighten...  

           INT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN

           Andy shoves Diane against the counter, tugging at the shotgun 
           in her grip.  But he's weak, his injuries taking a toll.  She 
           battles to aim the gun at him, but he's just strong enough to 
           deflect it and knock it out of her hands to the floor.  

           Andy's hands fly to Diane's neck and CHOKE, his fingers 
           digging deep into her flesh.  
           Jo bolts to the kitchen - this ends now.  

           She sees the shotgun is out of reach on the floor beside 
           Andy.  Knows she has to act fast.  Looks for a weapon.  
           Anything...  Spots a lantern, MATCHES -- 

           -- and the BOTTLE OF LOIS' BREW.

           Diane's legs are giving out, she won't last much longer.

                                 JO
                        Andy!

           Andy turns, grip still firmly locked around Diane's neck.

           Jo raises the bottle of Lois' high-octane concoction --

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Join me in a drink?

           -- and she flings the alcohol with a vengeance, drenching 
           Andy's clothes.

                                 ANDY
                        What the hell? 

           Andy lets go of Diane who collapses on the floor, GASPING for 
           air, filling her lungs.  He looks at his clothes, at Jo - 
           confused, growing more infuriated by the second.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        That's it, Josephine.  That's the 
                        end of it.  

           He limps around the kitchen counter - his twisted leg 
           flinging uselessly as he approaches Jo, jaw set, furious.

           Jo STRIKES A MATCH.

                                 JO
                        Cheers.

           And she FLINGS the match at Andy - FLAME leaping from the 
           match to his liquor-drenched clothing, his skin, crawling up 
           his chest, his neck, across his face - IGNITING Andy in a 
           ball of fire.

           Andy spins, flails, arms flapping and grabbing at his clothes 
           - but to no avail.  He's engulfed.

           BURNING BILLS waft from his pockets as he blindly swings his 
           way across THE GREAT ROOM, HOWLING in pain, slamming into the 
           enormous WINDOW.  The fissure in the glass spreads like a web 
           and --
           CRASH!

           -- the window explodes, Andy bursting through in a blizzard 
           of flames and flying glass, throwing himself on the SNOW.

           Jo scrambles to Diane. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Diane sits up with Jo's help, coughs, nods.

           Cam is just stirring.  Jo goes to his side, threads her 
           fingers through his.  Those TEARS she's been holding at bay 
           finally come.  She CRIES.  Cam looks up at her.

                                 CAM
                        I'm sorry, Josey.  I should have 
                        been here for you.  

                                 JO
                        You're here now.

           They hold each other.  It's been a long time coming.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        I miss her so much, Dad.  

                                 CAM
                        I know, sweetheart.  I know.

           Diane moves past them, clutching the shotgun, heading for the 
           obliterated floor-to-ceiling window.  As she walks, a BREEZE 
           ruffles her hair, the house now open to the elements. 

           Jo and Cam look up.

                                 JO
                        Diane...?

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - DAWN

           Andy sizzles flat on his back in the snow.  The flames have 
           been snuffed, but his hair, skin and clothing are CHARRED and 
           still smoking.  He's hideous.  Alive, but only barely.

           ANDY'S POV - LOOKING UP

           a dark silhouette moves into frame.  DIANE.  Shotgun in hand.  
           She stands over him.  Doesn't speak.
           Andy licks his cracked lips.  A blistered hand moves slow and 
           stiff into his coat pocket, feebly retrieving a clutch of 
           smoldering HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.  He holds them raised in his 
           fist for a beat.  Then opens his hand and releases them.  

           The breeze carries the blackened bills churning and useless 
           across the snow.  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

           DRIP!  A drop of water strikes Andy's forehead.  And another.

           Andy looks up.  Diane looks up.

           THE RISING SUN 

           glints off a band of mammoth, sparkling, dagger-like ICICLES 
           affixed to the roof-line directly above Andy.

           Diane looks back down at him.  DRIP!

           Points the shotgun at his head.

                                 DIANE
                        You were wrong.  This - is the 
                        moment of truth.

           DRIP!  Andy grins grotesque.

                                 ANDY
                             (hoarse, barely audible)
                        - could never do it.

                                 DIANE
                        Never say never.

           Diane raises the nose of the shotgun to the roof-line.

           And FIRES.

           ICICLES

           detach with the impact... 

           EXT. SKY - DAWN

           BIRDS take flight in a startled swarm, swinging up past the 
           house and into the clearing sky.   

           In the distance - A POLICE HELICOPTER approaches...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN CHALET - DAWN (FROM ABOVE)

           Below us, Diane lowers the smoking shotgun.  

           Andy lies at her feet dead - IMPALED BY ICICLES.
           All around him - the scattered ashes of his beloved money.  

           Jo emerges from the house with Cam on her arm, stumbling 
           their way through the snow to Diane, wrapping their arms 
           around her.  The shotgun slips from Diane's grip.  She turns 
           to her husband, her step-daughter, and buries herself in 
           their embrace.  They survived.  Together.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           FROM ABOVE - PRISTINE WHITE SNOW...

           and the soft outline of a SNOW-ANGEL.  

                                 JO (V.O.)
                        I guess some lies were truths once 
                        upon a time.

           PULLING UP, we see a second snow angel beside it, the "hands" 
           of each joined, intentionally connected.

                                 JO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But what I've learned, some lies, 
                        the ones you keep trying to prove -- 

           A YEARLING FAWN

           steps lightly into frame, moving across the snow angels, 
           stopping to nibble at a few blades of early spring grass.  
           Maybe it's the orphaned fawn, maybe not.

                                 JO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        -- sometimes, they're a sort of 
                        bigger truth.  Sometimes, a person 
                        doesn't have to be here - to be 
                        there.

           And the fawn moves UP-SCREEN and off, leaving the mark of its 
           hoof-prints across the angels...

                                                          FADE TO WHITE

                                         THE END.
