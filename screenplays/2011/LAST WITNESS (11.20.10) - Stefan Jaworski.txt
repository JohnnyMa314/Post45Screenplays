                                                       November 29, 2010
           Pitch darkness.

           A sudden GASP breaks the silence. 

           HEAVY BREATHING is all we hear. Followed by an uneven  
           HEARTBEAT.

           THA-THUD... THA... THUD... 

           CHOIR MUSIC reaches us from somewhere. Beautiful and sad. 

                                 CHOIR
                        Eternal Father, strong to save, 
                        Whose arm hath bound the restless 
                        wave.

           The darkness slowly fades as we move through--

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE - POV

           A greyish mist. The outlines of a room. A distorted tunnel?

                                 CHOIR
                        Who bidst the mighty ocean deep
                        Its own appointed limits keep;

           The mist turns out to be SMOKE. FLAMES dance across the 
           walls. Lifeless SHADOWS lie scattered on the floor. 

           Bodies? 

           Far ahead we see a light. An exit?

           We move towards it. Figures flicker in the light outside. 

           Like angels.

                                 CHOIR (CONT’D)
                        O, hear us when we cry to Thee

           We reach the light. And--

                                 CHOIR (CONT’D)
                        For those in peril on the--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE - DAY

           Chaos. 

           Absolute chaos. 

           Scorching sunlight. A strong stench of sweat and fear.

           People run in all directions. SCREAMS and distant SIRENS.
           A MAN (45) steps outside. And looks around. Stunned. 

           He’s dressed in a beige suit. His eyes are dark and worried.

           We are in Boston’s old harbor. Wooden boats, cozy  
           restaurants. Any normal day; a place of leisure and joy.

           Today; a scene of death and destruction.

           The Man turns around and looks at--

           The place he just left. It’s a cafe. 

           Or... it was.

           The entire front is blown away. Chairs and tables are 
           scattered outside the HUGE HOLE in the wall. Lifeless BODIES 
           lie next to them.

           Two PARAMEDICS desperately try to save one of the wounded.

           Behind them, a stretcher is rolled into an AMBULANCE that  
           SPEEDS OFF - sirens wailing.

           The Man is pushed aside by a desperate FATHER (41), fighting  
           his way through the crowd. He’s shouting a woman’s name at  
           the burning building.

           The Man can’t take his eyes off him. A FIREFIGHTER tries to 
           pull the father away from the flames. They almost get into a 
           fight, before the father buckles. 

           No one seems to notice The Man. Everyone’s busy with the 
           other cafe guests.

           Or what’s left of them.

           The Man steps on something. A steel COFFEE POT. He picks it 
           up. And stares at the polished surface.

           His distorted REFLECTION stares back at him.

           The Man frowns, when he sees--

           BLOOD flows from his right eyebrow. He touches it. Watches 
           his hand. Blood. All over. 

           A FIGURE comes running. From his lips we read--

                                 SWAT OFFICER (O.S.)
                        YOU OKAY!?

           The Man doesn’t notice him until the SWAT OFFICER (MARCUS 
           WOLFF) puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                 SWAT OFFICER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ARE YOU OKAY, SIR?
           The Man looks at him. And signals his ear. He can’t hear a 
           word.

           The officer wraps a blanket around him and leads him towards 
           another ambulance.

           The Man stops and lets a stretcher pass ahead of him. 

           He turns around one last time. And watches the chaos.

           INT. AMBULANCE / DRIVING - DAY

           The ambulance SPEEDS through the city. 

           The Man sits in the back, pressing a piece of cloth against 
           the wound on his forehead. Watching--

           A PARAMEDIC desperately trying to save the poor guy on the 
           stretcher. Not succeeding. 

           The victim’s body goes into SPASMS.

           A HAND comes out from under the blanket. Shaking violently. 

           The Man watches it. 

           Then he grabs it and holds it tight.

           It seems to bring some comfort to the dying victim.

           We stay with The Man. Till the hand stops shaking. And we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARIA PIERCE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A heavy PAINT BRUSH sweeps across a wall. Hard strokes. White 
           on white. 

           A WOMAN is wielding it. Absorbed. We don’t se her face, only 
           her strong hands, arms, neck.

           We’re in a dark apartment somewhere. The curtains are drawn. 
           The floor covered in plastic. 

           The woman JOLTS when -- the doorbell rings. She stops and 
           turns around, and we finally see her face. 

           She’s MARIA PIERCE - mid thirties. Her face looks younger. 
           Her eyes, older. 

           She hesitates. RING, RING, RIIIIIING.

           Before she decides what to do, the door opens, and a man 
           steps inside. THOMAS BISHOP, late 30s. Well dressed, dead 
           serious, and obviously in a hurry.
                                 THOMAS
                        Turn on the TV.

                                 MARIA
                        Buy your own TV. They’re on sale.

           Ignoring her, he walks to a plastic covered bureau, opens the 
           second drawer from the top and grabs A REMOTE.

           Maria swallows hard when he turns on the tv and reveals--

           EXT. HARBOR / TV - DAY

           A NEWS REPORTER standing in the midst of chaos. He is trying 
           to stay composed, and has to shout to make himself heard 
           through the noise.

                                 REPORTER
                        --here in the harbor where... the 
                        cafe right behind me suddenly 
                        exploded in... what seems to be... 
                        a terrorist attack, we don’t--

           An AMBULANCE thunders right past him. SIRENS WAILING.

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        The NATO-summit just opened, we 
                        don’t know if they plan to... 
                        continue, we’re still trying to 
                        reach secretary of defence Robert 
                        Gates. We don’t know... how bad it 
                        is or who’s responsible, we’re 
                        trying... we’re trying...

           Someone rolls a SCREAMING VICTIM right by him.

           The reporter loses it for a moment. The image FREEZES.

           INT. MARIA PIERCE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Maria stares at the frozen image. Thomas remains calm.

                                 THOMAS
                        Thirteen dead. Seven women. Six 
                        men.
                            (beat)
                        The summit is secure, they’re 
                        moving ahead. We don’t know who did 
                        this. Or why.

           Maria finally looks up at him.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        There was a man inside the cafe. A 
                        survivor. Apparently he’s in shock. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Claims he doesn’t remember 
                        anything.
                            (beat)
                        I need to know if he’s telling the 
                        truth.

           Finally, Maria understands why he’s here. And frowns.

                                 MARIA
                        You want ice cream? It’s home made.

           She heads for the kitchen.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Well, not by me but... by those 
                        guys down at the store.

                                 THOMAS
                        Maria--

                                 MARIA
                        Yeah, listen, I’d really like to 
                        help you, but I gotta... you know, 
                        paint this place, so... 

           She picks up her brush and resumes the paint job.

                                 THOMAS
                        I wouldn’t be here.

                                 MARIA
                        You’ve got Hanson, Furst and 
                        Daniels.

                                 THOMAS
                        They’re not you.

           She turns around.

                                 MARIA
                        I’m on leave.

                                 THOMAS
                        Crime scene and one interview.

                                 MARIA
                        I resigned my license. I’m not 
                        authorized.

           He pulls out a WHITE ENVELOPE, holds it up for a beat, and 
           puts it down on a table close to her.

                                 THOMAS
                        One hour. That’s it.
                                 MARIA
                        Thomas...
                            (beat)
                        I can’t...

           There’s a plea in her eyes. And something else. Fear? 

           They both look up, when -- The TV starts rolling again. Hand 
           held images of chaos and death.

           Thomas looks back at her. 

           She bites hard. And lowers her paint brush.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE / TV-VOX POP #1 - DAY

           A YOUNG MOTHER with a 2-YEAR-OLD BOY on her arm speaks to the  
           unseen reporter behind the camera.

                                 YOUNG MOTHER
                        It’s... horrible... really 
                        horrible... I don’t know what to 
                        say.

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE / TV-VOX POP #2

           Two agitated TEENAGE BOYS overlap each other--

                                 TEENAGE BOY #1
                        It was totally fucked up!

                                 TEENAGE BOY #2
                        Totally!

                                 TEENAGE BOY #1
                        We’re just sitting right over 
                        there, right? And then, BOOM!

           He illustrates the explosion with his hands. His big eyed 
           friend repeats the gesture.

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE / TV-VOX POP #3 - DAY

           An ELDERLY GENTLEMAN tries to remain calm.

                                 ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
                        All my windows...
                            (beat)
                        I was in the kitchen.
                            (beat)
                        All my windows...

           His facade cracks. He’s deeply shocked.
           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE / TV-VOX POP #1 - DAY

           Back on the young mother.

                                 YOUNG MOTHER
                        And then we heard... screaming.
                            (beat)
                        I don’t know if... if they got out, 
                        you know? If they were...

           Her son starts to cry.

                                 YOUNG MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Hushh..sh..sh.... It’s okay.

           She tries to comfort him. Doesn’t succeed. 

           INT. THOMAS BISHOP’S CAR / DRIVING - DAY

           Thomas SPEEDS through the city. He casts a glance at--

           Maria in the passenger seat. Looking out the window, as if it 
           were her first time out for ages.

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE - DAY

           Thomas’ car pulls up in front of the cafe.

           Thomas and Maria step out, and Thomas hurries inside.

           Maria stays by the car. Trying to take in the horrific sight. 
           She hesitates for a beat...

           Then pulls herself together. And follows Thomas inside.

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE - DAY

           Maria steps inside the burnt-out cafe.

           Rubble and glass and scorched wood. Everything’s soaking wet, 
           and smoke still rises from the piles. 

           The room is swarming with people. LAB TECHNICIANS and BOMB 
           SQUAD OFFICERS take pictures and collect samples. They scowl 
           at Maria. What’s she doing here?

           Maria ignores them. Puts on latex gloves and let’s her eyes 
           wander. She notices--

           The remains of a bar. A coffee maker. Bottles. Chairs. 
           Tables. A jukebox. A door to the kitchen, another door in the 
           back and--

           Thomas, watching her closely. He signals her to come over.
           Thomas is standing next to MARCUS WOLFF (33), the same SWAT 
           OFFICER who helped the nameless man to his ambulance. Marcus 
           is still high on adrenaline. Thomas introduces them--

                                 THOMAS
                        Marcus Wolff, Maria Pierce. Wolff 
                        was First On Scene, could you give 
                        her a brief rundown on what we’ve 
                        got?

           Maria’s eyes wander across the room, while Marcus speaks--

                                 MARCUS
                        Suitcase bomb. Plastic. Probably  
                        C4. Eight to ten pounds. Placed 
                        behind the jukebox over there. 
                        Manual detonation.

           Maria nods.

                                 MARIA
                        What did it play?

                                 MARCUS
                        Hmm?

                                 MARIA
                        The jukebox. What song was playing  
                        when the bomb went off?

           Marcus gives Thomas a questioning look. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Could you find out for me, please? 
                        Thank you. And I’d like a menu.

                                 MARCUS
                        From... here?

                                 MARIA
                        Yes please. Thank you.

           She nods. This conversation is over. Marcus exchanges another 
           glance with Thomas, before moving back to his colleagues. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        How did he survive?

           Thomas signals the back door. Maria walks towards it.

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, CORRIDOR - DAY

           Maria walks down a dark, narrow corridor.

           It seems to go on forever before ending at another DOOR 
           leading her into--
           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - DAY

           Maria enters a restroom. Two toilet booths, two sinks and two 
           mirrors.

           One mirror is broken. Apart from that, the room seems 
           undamaged by the explosion.  

           Maria catches her reflection in the broken mirror.

                                 THOMAS (O.S.)
                        You look... good.

           Maria looks back at -- Thomas in the doorway.

                                 MARIA
                        You’re losing your hair.

           He blinks.

                                 THOMAS
                        We think he was in here, when it 
                        happened.
                            (beat)
                        Maybe he saw the bag. Maybe he 
                        saw... someone.

                                 MARIA
                        Maybe he did it.

           Thomas gives her a look - Maybe. What does she think? 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        One interview.

           She walks past him and out.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, MAIN OFFICE - DAY

           DING! Elevator doors open and Thomas and Maria step outside. 
           Thomas moves with speed and confidence. Maria hesitates for a 
           beat - recognizing the room - before she follows him. 

                                 THOMAS
                        He’s down here.

           They move through the crowded office. Detectives run, shout 
           and work their phones and laptops all around them. The walls 
           are plastered with photos and maps of buildings and city 
           blocks. And portraits of US and foreign Heads of state.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        The negotiations continue. They’ve 
                        released a statement, and we’ve 
                        tripled security, but they’re not 
                        cancelling. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        It was an attack on a non-secured 
                        target, and the message is simple; 
                        You don’t stop a Nato Peace Keeping-
                        summit by bombing civilians.

           Maria is almost run over by two detectives rushing by.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        They’re expected to sign the treaty 
                        at nine thirty p.m. and at ten p.m. 
                        there’s an open press conference at 
                        Fort Strong, Long Island.

           They pass three of the department’s top guys. DANIELS (48), 
           FURST (34) and HANSON (37). The trio exchange glances when 
           they see Thomas with Maria. Thomas ignores them.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        The Britts and Germans brought 
                        their own security, we cover the 
                        rest. 800 guys at the summit, 300 
                        on the rock, four groups on every 
                        Head of State, and everyone else in 
                        the streets trying to find whoever  
                        placed that bomb. 

                                 MARIA
                        And what are they looking for?

           They turn one last corner...

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - CONTINUOUS

           ...and stop in front of a huge ONE WAY MIRROR.

                                 THOMAS
                        I was hoping you could tell us.

           Maria looks through the mirror and into - an INTERVIEW ROOM. 
           It’s big, delicately decorated, and floor-to-ceiling windows 
           offer a spectacular view of the city. 

           THE WITNESS is by the window, back turned. He touches his 
           forehead. Doesn’t know he’s being watched.

                                 MARIA
                        What do you know about him?

                                 THOMAS
                        He had no papers on him. Prints and 
                        teeth, not on file.

                                 MARIA
                        What do the doctors say?
                                 THOMAS
                        Nothing except the wound over his 
                        eye. Probably flying glass.

                                 MARIA
                        Can you talk to him?

                                 THOMAS
                        His hearing’s back. But Hanson and 
                        the boys didn’t get anything out of 
                        him.

                                 MARIA
                        Well, I’m not Hanson and the boys.

                                 THOMAS
                        No. You’re not. 

           They exchange a glance. Maria looks back through the mirror. 
           Hesitates for a beat. Then she pulls herself together - and 
           enters the room.

           Thomas makes eye contact with HANSON, who’s been watching 
           them from across the room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           THE WITNESS is by the window overlooking the city. Orange 
           sunlight plays off the water far below. 

           He doesn’t hear Maria until--

                                 MARIA
                        Quite amazing, isn’t it?

           He looks up. She walks up beside him. Points out the window.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I remember my first time in that 
                        funfair over there, my dad took me 
                        to the Ferris wheel. I hated it, I 
                        hated him, and still somewhere... 
                        deep inside... I remember this 
                        feeling that the world just... 
                        expanded, you know?

           She smiles to The Witness, who smiles back. Uncertain.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You remember that feeling?
                            (beat)
                        Your first time in a Ferris wheel?

           His smile fades as he searches for the memory. And fails to 
           find it.
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You wanna sit?

           He looks around. The room has three chairs, where would she 
           like him to sit?

           She signals that he can pick any chair he’d like. The Witness  
           hesitates. Insecure. Stays standing.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why you are here?

                                 THE WITNESS
                            (beat)
                        I think...

           Maria waits for him to continue. But nothing more comes. He 
           touches the wound over his eye.

                                 MARIA
                        At two p.m. today, 28 Nato leaders 
                        initiated a summit at the Boston 
                        Convention Center on future 
                        military strategies in the middle 
                        east. At tree minutes past two, a 
                        bomb exploded in a cafe called “The 
                        Warehouse” down in Old Harbor. 13 
                        people died. You survived. You’re 
                        the only one who saw what happened 
                        inside.

           He reacts with surprise.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        A... bomb?

                                 MARIA
                        Yes.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        How did I... survive?

                                 MARIA
                        You tell me.

           His eyes wander. She watches him closely.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You want anything? Water? Coffee?

           He makes an uncertain gesture.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you use milk in your coffee?

           The Witness looks at her. Wants to answer, but realizes that 
           he has to search for the answer - does he use milk? 
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Any headaches?

           The Witness signals his eye.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Up here.

                                 MARIA
                        Blurred vision? 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t know. Some. Maybe. 

                                 MARIA
                        Hearing?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Okay. Still a little... buzzing. 

           He signals his right ear. Maria nods.

                                 MARIA
                        Do you remember the explosion?

           He shakes his head. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        What’s the last thing you remember?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        The noise. Down by... the water. I 
                        come out and... all these people...

                                 MARIA
                        Inside?

           He shakes his head. Touches his eye.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        What happened to your eye?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Huh?

                                 MARIA
                        How did you hurt your eye?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t know...

                                 MARIA
                        What do you do for a living?

           The Witness wants to answer. But realizes that he can’t.
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        How old are you?
                            (beat)
                        What’s your name?

           The Witness searches for all the answers. And finds none of 
           them. He looks up at Maria. Frustrated.

           Maria nods. Walks back to the chairs, and signals - once 
           again - that The Witness can pick any one he chooses.

           The Witness hesitates. Then he walks up to her. Singles out  
           a chair. And sits down.

           Maria casts a short glance at the mirror. Then she sits down 
           in the chair across from him. 

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - DAY

           Thomas watches them. 

           Detective Hanson steps up and gives Thomas a short, serious 
           look - before he also looks in through the mirror. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Maria and The Witness sit in comfortable chairs. Like a 
           married couple in a living room. Only he is obviously not 
           feeling comfortable. Maria lets him sit there. Until finally--

                                 THE WITNESS
                        What do we do now?

                                 MARIA
                        Tell me how you feel.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        How I feel?

                                 MARIA
                        Yes.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Now?

                                 MARIA
                        Yes.

                                 THE WITNESS
                            (beat)
                        I’m afraid.

                                 MARIA
                        Why?
                                 THE WITNESS
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARIA
                        What are you afraid of?

           The Witness tries to find the right way to illustrate--

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Okay...
                            (beat)
                        On January 30th 1933, Adolf Hitler 
                        became Reichskanzler of Germany.

           Maria raises her eyebrows.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        The Beatles got their big break on 
                        the Ed Sullivan Show, February 9th 

                                 MARIA
                        Okay.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        The car that drove me here... Ford 
                        F-150 Crown Victoria. 4.6 litre V8 
                        engine. It pulls 250 horse power 
                        but its top speed is limited to 140 
                        Miles Per Hour... 

           He looks at her. And then points at himself.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        And I’ve never seen this face 
                        before in my life.

           She nods.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what I had for 
                        breakfast, I don’t know where I 
                        live, I don’t know what I do, I 
                        don’t know...

           His voice cracks and he stops. Obviously frustrated. She 
           looks at him for a long time. Then--

                                 MARIA
                        What happened to your eye?

           He looks at her. And shakes his head. Doesn’t know. Maria 
           nods. And writes down a few conclusive notes on a piece of 
           paper. Then she wraps it up - reassuring;

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get someone who can help you. 
                        You’ll be fine, don’t worry.
                                 THE WITNESS
                        What’s wrong with me?

           Maria stands up and heads for the door.

                                 MARIA
                        You’ll be fine. Thank you for your 
                        time.

           She walks out the door, leaving The Witness alone and in 
           despair. He catches his own reflection in the one way mirror.

           Doesn’t recognize it. 

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - DAY

           Maria joins Thomas behind the mirror. She and Hanson greet 
           each other with mutual reservation.

                                 MARIA
                        Jimmy.

                                 HANSON
                        Pierce.

                                 THOMAS
                        So?

                                 MARIA
                        Nothing to indicate he’s lying.

           They watch The Witness through the glass. He’s obviously 
           troubled about his situation. Touching his eye again.

                                 THOMAS
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 MARIA
                        He needs a thorough examination.

                                 THOMAS
                        Preliminary?

                                 MARIA
                        Psychogenic amnesia.

                                 THOMAS
                        Which is?

                                 MARIA
                        Hysteric memory loss. Total loss of  
                        identity and recollection of any 
                        personal experiences.

                                 THOMAS
                        How long does it last?
                                 MARIA
                        Worst case, several months. Best 
                        case, a couple of days.

                                 THOMAS
                        Days?

                                 MARIA
                        If he’s lucky.

           Thomas and Hanson exchange a glance.

                                 THOMAS
                        Any way to... speed up the process?

                                 MARIA
                        There have been experiments with 
                        cognitive confrontational therapy, 
                        but it’s dangerous and the results 
                        are... questionable.

                                 THOMAS
                        Could you... help us?

           Maria blinks. Then she snorts a hard smile.

           Thomas looks down and nods.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Okay then. I shouldn’t 
                        have... 
                            (beat)
                        Thank you. You want me to call a 
                        cab or...?

                                 MARIA
                        I’m fine.

           She nods. Thomas nods. And Hanson passes her with a short,  
           sarcastic--

                                 HANSON
                        Thanks.

                                 MARIA
                        You’re welcome.

           Hanson steps inside the interview room and closes the door 
           behind him. Through the mirror Maria sees him sit down in 
           front of The Witness. Their voices rustle through speakers. 

                                 HANSON
                        Alright, let’s do this one more 
                        time, shall we? Where were you 
                        today at two p.m.?

           The Witness reacts reluctantly. Hanson continues through a 
           series of traditional police questions.
           Maria looks up at Thomas--

                                 MARIA
                        You can’t... speak to him like 
                        that.

                                 THOMAS
                        We have no choice.

                                 MARIA
                        He’s asking closed questions to his  
                        short time memory, he can’t--

           Thomas cuts her off with a frustrated glance. He signals the 
           chaos around them. Phones. Shouting. Running detectives. Then 
           he finally reveals--

                                 THOMAS
                        We’ve received an email,  
                        threatening with another bomb if 
                        they sign the treaty tonight. We 
                        can’t trace the I.P. CIA are 
                        running around like headless 
                        chickens...

                                 MARIA
                        Close the summit.

           Thomas shakes his head.

                                 THOMAS
                        Not an option, politically. 
                        Besides, the summit is not the 
                        target. Convention’s secured, press 
                        conference secured, but the rest of 
                        the city...? Wide open. Squares, 
                        restaurants, busses, subways... 
                        Whoever did this killed thirteen 
                        civilians as a warning. We don’t 
                        know who, we don’t know where, but 
                        when they sign that document 
                        tonight...
                            (beat)
                        We haven’t got weeks or days. We’ve 
                        got six hours. And that guy is our 
                        last witness. So I’m sorry, but 
                        we’re doing the best we can.
                            (beat)
                        Thanks for coming in. Get home  
                        safe.

           Thomas nods and leaves Maria alone by the mirror.

           She looks back at The Witness, rubbing his wounded eye, 
           increasingly frustrated with Hanson’s scrutinizing questions.
           Suddenly, The Witness stands up, KNOCKS OVER his chair, and 
           walks to the far end of the room. Back turned. Shutting 
           Hanson out.

           Hanson reacts with frustration. Maria hesitates. Looks back 
           and forth between the mirror and the main office, where 
           Thomas disappeared. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Hanson looks up, when Maria enters and leans against the 
           wall. She discretely gestures towards the open door.

           Hanson looks back at The Witness, who has totally shut him 
           out. Hanson gets up and leaves the room. Giving Maria a short 
           look of warning on his way out. 

           She shuts the door behind him and focuses on The Witness.

                                 MARIA
                        My name is Maria Pierce. I’m a 
                        psychologist and I can help you. 
                        With your eye. And the rest. If you 
                        let me.
                            (beat)
                        Will you let me?

           The Witness slowly turns around to face her.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        What’s wrong with me?

                                 MARIA
                        What you’re experiencing is called 
                        a fugue state, formally 
                        dissociative or psychogenic fugue. 
                        You remember everything you’ve 
                        learned but nothing you’ve 
                        experienced. It’s a very rare 
                        condition, usually triggered by 
                        strong trauma or shock. It’s your 
                        brain pulling the emergency break.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        How long... does it last? 

                                 MARIA
                        Under normal circumstances--

                                 THE WITNESS
                        These are not normal circumstances. 
                        Are they?

                                 MARIA
                        No. They’re not. 
                                 THE WITNESS
                        So. How long?

                                 MARIA
                        Up to you.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        What can I do?

                                 MARIA
                        You can go back to the cafe. And   
                        relive the whole thing.

           The Witness swallows hard. Then he steps back towards the 
           center of the room...

           And sits down in his chair.

           Maria closes her eyes. Exhales. And gets ready.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - DAY

           Thomas steps back up behind the mirror. Hanson joins him, 
           watching Maria and The Witness.

                                 HANSON
                        So. She ready for this?

                                 THOMAS
                        Hmm?

                                 HANSON
                        Michael Kimberly.

                                 THOMAS
                        She did a fully professional psych-
                        evaluation. Considering the 
                        circumstances.

           Hanson makes a discrete gesture. He doesn’t agree. Thomas 
           looks directly at him. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t her fault. She couldn’t 
                        have done anything different.

           Again, the gesture. Thomas signals the chaos surrounding 
           them. What’s he supposed to do?

                                 HANSON
                        She’s ego. She gets an idea and she 
                        fixates on it.

           Thomas snorts and looks back through the mirror. This 
           conversation is over. Hanson nods. And walks back towards 
           Furst and Daniels. 
           Thomas keeps his eyes on Maria.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           A CLOSED EYELID. Vibrating.

           The Witness is trying to remember. His eyeball is moving 
           behind the eyelid. Until we SUDDENLY--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           A SHOCKING EXPLOSION. GLASS. BURSTING RIGHT AT US.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Witness opens his eyes. He tries to regain his composure. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Glass.

                                 MARIA
                        Glass?

           He nods.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Shattered glass.

                                 MARIA
                        What does it look like?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        It’s... coming right at me.

                                 MARIA
                        What else do you see?

           He shakes his head. Her voice is calm and comforting.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Try again. You’re outside the cafe. 
                        It’s cold. Bright sunlight in your 
                        eyes.

           He shuts his eyes again.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what you see.

           EXT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           “The Warehouse” before the explosion. Laughter and chatter.
           Outside the cafe is a small table.

           On the table is a BLUE VASE with faded WILD FLOWERS. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Witness searches through his memory. Eyes still closed.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Flowers.
                            (beat)
                        Wild flowers, they’re... pale.

                                 MARIA
                        Good. Walk to the flowers.

           EXT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The CAMERA does. MOVES towards the small table. And STOPS 
           right next to the vase.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Now try to look up.

           THE WITNESS appears. Wearing a coat and looking good.

           He looks up.

                                 MARIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        What do you see?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        A door.

                                 MARIA
                        Open the door. And walk inside.

           He reaches out and stops. There’s BLOOD on his hand.

           He touches his face.

           More blood.

           The WOUND above his eye has suddenly appeared.

           BLOOD IS GUSHING OUT. So much blood. 

           He tries to stop it. Presses his hand against the wound and 
           we--

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           THE GLASS EXPLOSION. EVEN MORE POWERFUL THIS TIME.
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness is JOLTED back to reality.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        No...

                                 MARIA
                        What?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t think... I can do this.

                                 MARIA
                        What did you see?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        You know what? This was a bad idea.

                                 MARIA
                            (beat)
                        What was?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        All this... I’ve never even been 
                        inside that place.

                                 MARIA
                        Yes. You have.

           There’s no accusation in her voice. She just states a fact.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Listen, I’m just...

                                 MARIA
                        It’s scary. I understand.

           He gets up. Shakes his head.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Could we do this later? Another 
                        time, okay?

                                 MARIA
                        Okay.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Yeah? Is that... okay?

                                 MARIA
                        Absolutely. We have to do this at 
                        your own pace.

           She stands up with a concluding gesture. 
           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas reacts. What’s she doing? 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Witness feels relieved as Maria eases off. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Thank you.

                                 MARIA
                        No problem. You want that cup of 
                        coffee now? 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Huh?

                                 MARIA
                        You want a cup of coffee before you 
                        go?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Uh...? I don’t...

                                 MARIA
                        Regular?
                            (off his reaction)
                        We’ve got regular, espresso, 
                        cappuccino and Latte. We’ve got 
                        Columbian, Brazilian, Kenyan or 
                        mixed. You can have a sandwich too 
                        if you like? We’ve got Club, Ham’n 
                        Cheese, Pastrami or Veggie. 

           He stares at her. What’s going on here? She opens a drawer, 
           and finds a MENU CARD from “The Warehouse”. She puts it in 
           his hands and then heads for the door.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Check out the menu and I’ll be back 
                        in just a minute, okay?

           And then she’s gone.

           He just stands there. Mystified. Until--

           The room is filled with SOUNDS. Joyful chatter. The rattling 
           of cups and plates. They’re sounds from inside a busy cafe.

           The sounds are real this time. They come from small speakers 
           discretely placed in the corners of the room. 

           The Witness frowns. What is this? Then--

           THE MUSIC starts. And The Witness freezes.
           It’s “Strong to save”, performed by a choir. We recognize it.

           So does he.

                                 CHOIR
                        Eternal Father, strong to save, 
                        Whose arm hath bound the restless 
                        wave.

           The Witness drops the menu card. It falls to the floor.

                                 CHOIR (CONT’D)
                        Who bidst the mighty ocean deep
                        Its own appointed limits keep; O, 
                        hear us when we cry to Thee.

           He closes his eyes. And we--

                                 CHOIR (CONT’D)
                        For those in peril on--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           A SURREAL TUNNEL of bright light and deafening noise. 

           We RUSH THROUGH it, and end in--

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           A teenage girl, LAURA (17), sits at a table in the far end of 
           the cafe. We see her through TUNNEL VISION, that blurs 
           everything around her.

           She’s sulking. Texting someone on her cell phone, while 
           talking to... her mother ANNA (42), a frail woman who tries 
           to get through to her. They’re having a suppressed argument.

           We can’t hear them. We only hear the HEAVY BREATHING and the 
           uneven HEART BEAT of the beholder.

           Laura suddenly has an outburst. Her mother gives up and hands 
           her something. 

           A QUARTER.

           Laura gets up and walks trough the cafe, right past--

           THE WITNESS, who sits at a table near the window and watches 
           her. He reacts when he sees where she’s heading--

           THE JUKEBOX. An old model from the 50s.

           Laura stops in front of the colorful machine.
           The Witness is clearly affected when Laura reaches for the 
           coin slot.

           The quarter touches the metal.

           The Witness stands up and SHOUTS--

                                 THE WITNESS
                        STOP!

           EVERYTHING STOPS!

           THE IMAGE FREEZES!

           The Witness stares at the girl. Her coin hovers in front of 
           the coin slot. The look on her face is frozen in time.

           The Witness shuts his eyes. And hyperventilates.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness is sitting in his chair. Hyperventilating. Eyes 
           still closed.

           Maria’s back in her chair and gently guides him.

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t be afraid. You’re in charge.

           His breathing slows down.

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The Witness concentrates. And--

           The whole situation REWINDS right in front of our eyes.

           Laura walks BACKWARDS through the cafe. 

           Past The Witness, back to her mother. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness keeps his eyes closed.

                                 MARIA
                        What does she look like? The girl?

           The Witness reacts. He can’t tell.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Go over there. 

           He moves his head. Eyes still closed.
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Get up, walk over there and sit 
                        down next to them.
                            (beat)
                        What do you see?

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The world is still frozen. But now--

           The Witness is sitting at LAURA’s table. Her face is BLURRED. 

           Only visible trait is her HAIR -- long, straight and blond. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        She’s... blond. No, wait...
                            (beat)
                        It’s... sandy.

           Before our eyes Laura’s hair CHANGES COLOR. From blond to 
           sandy. The Witness examines her and indicates on his 
           shoulder.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        It was longer. Here. And more... 
                        curly.

           Her hair GROWS LONGER. And CURLIER.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        She’s pretty...

           Laura’s face finally becomes visible through the blur.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        ...just like her mother.

           Anna’s does the same. Laura’s upset about something.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Why is she upset?

           The Witness concentrates for a beat, and--

           The MEMORY PLAYS FORWARD. Anna tries to reach her daughter, 
           who’s texting on her cell. Sulking.

                                 ANNA
                        You want anything to drink?

                                 LAURA
                        When’s dad coming?

                                 ANNA
                        Well, he’s the one who’s late. 
                        Again. So I guess you’d have to ask 
                        him.
                                 LAURA
                        I wanna live with him.

           Laura doesn’t even look up. Anna tries to keep calm. “Strong 
           to save” plays gently on the jukebox. 

                                 ANNA
                        Okay. Well, if he starts to live up 
                        to his responsibilities, then maybe 
                        we can talk about--

           Laura looks around and cuts her off with an angry outburst.

                                 LAURA
                        Jesus, what is this shit, could 
                        they change the fucking music in 
                        here!?

                                 ANNA
                        Laura! Language!

           Laura frowns.

                                 LAURA
                        You got a quarter?

           Anna looks at her daughter. Deeply frustrated. Then she 
           sighs, pulls out her purse and hands her a QUARTER. 

           Laura reaches out for it and--

           THE IMAGE FREEZES.

           The Witness sits right next to them. Staring at the quarter 
           in Anna’s hand. And Laura’s frozen hand reaching for it.

           He reaches out. And tries to grab the coin--

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness grabs in the air. He opens his eyes. Frustrated.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - DAY

           Thomas looks to the side--

           In the far end of the crowded office, Hanson is interviewing 
           LAURA’S FATHER, who got pulled away from the burnt-out cafe. 

           From the father’s grief and desperation we gather, he’s got 
           nothing but pain to bring to the table.

           Thomas focuses on Maria and The Witness.
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Maria encourages The Witness.

                                 MARIA
                        You’re doing well. Do it again. 
                        Start on the coin.

           The Witness closes his eyes. Concentrates and focuses on--

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           --the quarter in Anna’s hand. Frozen in time.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Now, there’s a table behind her.

           The Witness looks over Anna’s shoulder and sees--

           An empty table.

           A SHORTHAIRED GIRL (18) materializes at the table. A SPIKY 
           HAIRED GUY (19) materializes across from her.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        A young couple. 18-20 years old. 
                        They’re... on a date?

           The world STARTS MOVING again. The young couple flirt. Laugh.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Go over there.

           The Witness gets up from his chair but--

                                 MARIA (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to get up. The room 
                        is in your mind. You control it.

           The Witness hesitates. Then concentrates for a moment and--

           The WHOLE ROOM TURNS AROUND HIM. Until he’s standing right 
           beside them. The young couple never notice him.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Maria watches him closely.

                                 MARIA
                        Good. There are three tables by the 
                        window. Who do you see?
           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The Witness looks back at the window. Three empty tables. 
           He’s getting a better hold of the process now.

           Two ELDERLY LADIES materialize by the first table. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Two ladies. 70s. Good friends. One 
                        of them’s wearing a... red coat. 
                        She’s distracted by...

           A LONELY MAN appears at the empty table next to them. He’s 
           alone with his beer. Scruffy looking. An outsider.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        A man. Mid fifties. Looks lonely. 
                        He’s on his... third beer, and...

           TWO NEW BOTTLES materialize next to the one he’s drinking.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        ...he seems irritated by...

           THREE YOUNG EXECUTIVES appear at the last empty table.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        Three suits. Young guys. One of 
                        them bragging. The others... not 
                        really listening.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        And in the bar?

                                 THE WITNESS
                            (without looking)
                        There’s a bartender I guess.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        Stop.

           The IMAGE FREEZES and The Witness is PULLED BACK TO--

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           He opens his eyes. Maria is very serious.

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t. Guess.

           He nods his head. Understands why. Closes his eyes again and 
           travels back to--

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The ROOM ROTATES until The Witness is standing by the bar.
                                 THE WITNESS
                        The bartender is a... woman. Late  
                        thirties.

           The BARTENDER (39) materializes. She’s pissed at someone in 
           the empty kitchen. A YOUNG GUY (19) appears out of thin air. 
           Working his balls off. Stressed. 

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        She’s yelling at a young guy doing 
                        the dishes. Not doing ’em fast 
                        enough.

           The young guy scowls at his boss. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Maria watches him carefully. 

                                 MARIA
                        Anyone else?

           The Witness’ vibrating eyelid. Searching. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        No. 

                                 MARIA
                        Go back to your seat.

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The WHOLE ROOM ROTATES till he’s is back at his table. 
           Sitting on the same chair from where he first saw Laura.

                                 MARIA
                        Who sat here?

           EVERYTHING FREEZES.

           The Witness looks up. Surprised. MARIA is now present in his 
           frozen memory. Physically sitting opposite him. 

           In front of her is a CUP OF COFFEE. It’s been there all 
           along, but we didn’t notice it until now.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Huh?

                                 MARIA
                        You’ve just described twelve 
                        people. Six men and six women. 
                        Thirteen people were killed in this 
                        room. You’re missing one. A woman.
                            (beat)
                        Who did you have coffee with?
                                 THE WITNESS
                            (beat)
                        Nobody.

                                 MARIA
                        Nobody?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Not that I remember.

                                 MARIA
                        Did someone leave when you got 
                        here?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t know.

           She watches him closely.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness is avoiding eye contact. 

                                 MARIA
                        Anything unusual.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I know.

                                 MARIA
                        You understand how important this 
                        is?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I do.

                                 MARIA
                        Good. Now look at me, please?

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           He looks up. They’re back at the table.

                                 MARIA
                        Who. Sat. Here?

           The Witness suppresses a desperate smile. Mimics her tone.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I. Don’t. Know.

           As on cue, he hears WATER RUNNING. He looks up. The sound 
           comes from the back of the cafe, It’s LOUD and DISTORTED. We 
           CLOSE IN on The Witness who grows pale, and we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:
           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           BOOK PAGES flutter by at tremendous speed and with a  
           THUNDERING NOISE.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness REACTS. He doesn’t understand the image that hits 
           him, but keeps his eyes closed and tries to focus.

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           The Witness gets up and moves towards the sound.

           Through the cafe, past the bar, and into--

           INT. CAFE, CORRIDOR / MEMORY - DAY

           He moves through the narrow corridor leading to the restroom.

           It seems to go on forever. His breathing is heavy, his heart 
           pounding.

           THA-THUD... THA-THUD...

           The noise from the FLUTTERING PAGES increases when he sees--

           THE DOOR at the end of the corridor. It’s an inch ajar. 

           UNDER THE DOOR The Witness can see a SHADOW moving. And he  
           realizes--

           SOMEONE’S IN THERE!

           * THA-THUD *

           He feels something in his eye. Touches it. BLOOD.

           His wound has opened.

           He hesitates. So much blood.

           He forces himself to continue. Raises his hand...

           * THA-THUD, THA-THUD *

           ...and opens the door.

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           The Witness stops at the BLINDING LIGHT. He shields his eyes.
           He catches a glimpse of A SHADOWY FIGURE standing by the sink 
           furthest away. Washing his hands and his face methodically. 
           Hands and face. Hands. Face.

           The Figure is A MAN of unrecognizable age. He’s dressed in 
           dark clothes that seem to CHANGE back and forth in shape and 
           tone. Almost like they’re BREATHING. Never finding their true 
           form or color. 

           His face is BLURRED. There’s something deeply disturbing 
           about this shadowy figure and his methodical gestures. Hands 
           and face. The Figure suddenly stops. And checks his watch.

           The Witness takes one step closer, when suddenly--

           The Figure turns. And RUSHES RIGHT AT HIM!

           The Witness tries to avoid the blow, but too late. The Figure 
           hits him and--

           RUNS RIGHT THROUGH HIM!

           EVERYTHING EXPLODES AS WE--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           THE SHOCKING GLASS EXPLOSION. BURSTING RIGHT AT US.

           The Witness tries to dodge it, but--

           The GLASS turns into PAGES that flutter all around him. He 
           tries to fight them off and far behind them he suddenly sees--

           A SMALL KEY. Inserted in the keyhole of a small WOODEN BOX. 

           The key TURNS. The box is UNLOCKED. And--

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           The Witness falls from his chair and lands hard on the floor. 

           Maria jumps to her feet, shouting--

                                 MARIA
                        THOMAS!

           The Witness starts to tremble. SPASMS. He looks like he’s 
           having an epileptic seizure.  

           Thomas comes running. Hanson and Daniels are right behind 
           him. They throw themselves at The Witness, trying to hold him 
           down.
           We focus on The Witness’ pale GAZE into a distant world. And 
           as the SPASMS intensify, we’re pulled INTO HIS EYES and--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MEMORY / POV

           A grey, ghostly FOG. 

           The noise from the interview room is but a distant echo. 

           Something appears in the fog.

           A WOMAN’S FACE. She’s new to us. Young. Beautiful. 

           A smile.

           A laugh. 

           An intimate promise. She blinks. And then we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           DARKNESS.

           SILENCE.

           FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. Before we finally...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. COMMAND CENTER - EVENING

           Darkness has fallen upon the police head quarters.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, MAIN OFFICE - EVENING

           A TELEVISION transmits from outside the Boston Convention 
           Center. The flags of 28 nations tower above two important 
           looking men. They’re the US Secretary Of Defence ROBERT GATES 
           (68) and The Secretary General of Nato ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN 
           (57). Gates is addressing a crowd of reporters. A short 
           symbolic briefing, and then they’re back inside.

           Thomas sits on a desk nearby, watching the screen. He’s on 
           the phone with someone. Private.

                                 THOMAS (ON THE PHONE)
                        Mmm... Mmm... I don’t know... 
                        Just... stay inside, okay?

           Maria steps up. Thomas wraps up his call.
                                 THOMAS (ON THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be home as soon as I can... Me 
                        too. Bye hon.

           He hangs up and looks at Maria.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        So?

                                 MARIA
                        He’s okay. He’s just...

           Through the one way mirror, Thomas catches a glimpse of The 
           Witness - back in his chair. Quiet. Thoughtful. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What happened?

                                 MARIA
                        Physiologically it resembled an 
                        epileptic seizure. 

                                 THOMAS
                        He saw someone. In the restroom. 

                                 MARIA
                        Yeah.

                                 THOMAS
                        Bomber?

                                 MARIA
                        We don’t know. 

           Hanson steps up to them.

                                 HANSON
                        How’re we doing?

                                 MARIA
                        This process usually takes weeks or 
                        months. We’re pushing him. 

           Hanson nods. And hands a REPORT to Thomas.

                                 HANSON
                        We’ve traced the explosive. C4,  
                        stolen from a military stash right 
                        after Christmas. Whoever they are,  
                        they knew what they were doing.
                            (signals the room)
                        I need to talk to him.

                                 MARIA
                        He’s not ready. Let me handle it,  
                        and I’ll get you an I.D.
                                 THOMAS
                        How long?

           Maria can’t answer that. Hanson gives Thomas a look.

                                 HANSON
                        We have an active threat. We’ve got 
                        potential targets all over the 
                        city. We need to move on this.

           He signals his report. 

                                 MARIA
                        If we push him he might break, and 
                        we’ll get nothing. 

                                 HANSON
                        I’d be happy to do this together, 
                        she can--

                                 MARIA
                            (cuts him off)
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

           Hanson gives Thomas a stern look. His decision. Thomas 
           hesitates. Then orders Maria to--

                                 THOMAS
                        Focus on the bomber in the 
                        restroom.

                                 MARIA
                        We don’t know if he’s the bomber.

                                 THOMAS
                        Please?

           She blinks. And heads back towards the interview room. Thomas 
           makes eye contact with Hanson, who holds his gaze for a 
           silent beat, before he returns to Furst and Daniels.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           The room is quiet. The Witness is in his chair, absently  
           touching the bandage above his eye.

           He looks up, when Maria enters and sits down. For a long 
           moment they just sit there in awkward silence.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Everything okay out there?

                                 MARIA
                        They’re under a lot of pressure. So 
                        are we.
                                 THE WITNESS
                        How are we doing?

                                 MARIA
                        Good. Better than I hoped.

           He nods.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        There was... a man. In the 
                        restroom.

           She nods. Watches him silently. 

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        But you say you’re missing... a 
                        woman?

                                 MARIA
                        Remember anyone?

           He shakes his head.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        A girlfriend? Wife? Are you 
                        married?

           He looks at his fingers. No ring.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Apparently not.
                            (beat)
                        You?

           A hint of a smile in his eye. She looks at her fingers and 
           raises her hand - no ring there either. He nods. And signals 
           the mirror. 

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        They think I did it, don’t they?

                                 MARIA
                        What makes you think that?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Did I do it?
                            (beat)
                        Did I blow up that place? Did I... 
                        kill all those people?

           There’s genuine concern in his eyes. And something else. 
           Fear. He needs to know.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        I’m the only survivor, apparently I 
                        was in that restroom, and I 
                        can’t... see his face. Why can’t I 
                        see his face?
           She watches him closely. Then--

                                 MARIA
                        Come with me.

           She gets up and heads for the door. He gives her a surprised 
           look. Where are they going?

           INT. MORGUE - EVENING

           Greenish fluorescent light flickers under the ceiling as 
           three figures enter the huge, cold room. 

           Maria, Thomas and... The Witness, who stops when he sees 
           where she brought him. And what awaits him.

           13 STEEL BEDS.

           13 OPEN BODY BAGS.

           The Witness reacts. To the sight, and the stench. He looks at 
           Maria. She can’t be serious. She speaks softly. 

                                 MARIA
                        You say he ran right past you just 
                        before the explosion.
                            (beat)
                        Maybe he didn’t make it outside.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t think I can...

                                 MARIA
                        I know this is tough. Take your 
                        time.

           The Witness walks up to the first steel bed. And looks down. 
           We never see what’s in there. Only his reaction when he 
           gestures to the contents of the body bag.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I can’t... tell from...

           Maria just looks at him. The Witness swallows hard. And nods 
           his head. 

           Then he moves slowly. From bag to bag. Trying to recognize  
           someone, or something, inside one of them.

           Thomas stays by the door, watching.

           Maria follows The Witness on the other side of the steel 
           beds. Never looking at the scorched corpses. Only at him.  
           Recording every little twitch and reaction on his face.

           The Witness stops next to a body bag. We catch a glimpse of  
           Laura’s curly hair. Or what’s left of it. He looks up. 
           His eyes tear up, is this really necessary? Maria nods. 
           Unfortunately it is.

           He moves on. Slowly approaching the SECOND TO LAST body bag.

           From his POV we catch--

           A SHORT GLIMPSE of a CHARRED WRIST. A sooted GOLD BRACELET. 

           The Witness frowns. Recognizes the bracelet. And is hit by a--

           FLASH CUT OF: The wrist before the burn. It’s a young woman.

           The Witness stops in front of the body bag. He stares at the 
           bracelet. And suddenly he’s DRAWN INTO IT and we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           INT./EXT. INFERNO OF IMAGES / MEMORY - DAY & NIGHT

           An inferno of images.  

           Fragments of an intense and long lasting love affair BLAST  
           past us in seconds. 

           A young woman dominates the memories. JULIE CROSS (28) - in 
           intimate situations with The Witness. In hotel rooms, in the 
           woods, by the sea, in a car during a romantic rainstorm...

           TWO IMAGES repeat throughout the thunderstorm of images--

           The fluttering pages. 

           And the small key inserted in a wooden box. 

           JULIE CROSS returns. Naked. And close to The Witness. She 
           kisses him. And caresses his face with a hand that reveals--

           A GOLD BRACELET around her wrist. 

                                                           MATCHCUT TO:

           INT. MORGUE - CONTINUOUS

           The Witness blinks. He stares at the bracelet, worn by the 
           black remains of a person down there. 

                                 MARIA
                        You okay?

           He looks up. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Yeah. I’m... I’m sorry.
           He shakes his head. And walks back towards the door. A bit 
           too fast.

           Maria watches him all the way.

           EXT. COMMAND CENTER - EVENING

           The dark building. There’s light on the third floor.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           The Witness is pacing back and forth. We haven’t seen him  
           like this before. Openly stressed.

           Maria enters with - seemingly - not a care in the world.

                                 MARIA
                        You want anything?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Huh?

                                 MARIA
                        Cup of coffee? Tea?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        No. Thanks.

                                 MARIA
                        Something to eat? I can--

                                 THE WITNESS
                        NO! Thank you!

           He cuts her off a bit too harshly. Regrets and explains.

                                 THE WITNESS (CONT’D)
                        You know what...
                            (beat)
                        I’d like to go home now.
                            (beat)
                        All this... I don’t know... It’s 
                        been... it’s been very... 
                        difficult.

                                 MARIA
                        I know.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I’ve done all I can.

                                 MARIA
                        It’s okay. You can leave if you 
                        want to.
                                 THE WITNESS
                        Yeah?

                                 MARIA
                        Your choice.

           She seems almost indifferent. He doesn’t quite get it. But--

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Okay then. Well...?  

           He heads for the exit. Can’t believe she’s letting him walk. 
           But she does. All the way to the door, before--

                                 MARIA
                        Who was the girl in the bag?

           He stops. And stares at her. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        The second to last body bag, you 
                        stopped and you saw something. Who 
                        was she?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I did?

                                 MARIA
                        Yeah.

           She eyes him closely. He can’t recall.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Was she the one you had coffee 
                        with?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        No.

                                 MARIA
                        No? Who did you have coffee with?

                                 THE WITNESS
                            (beat)
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARIA
                        But you know it wasn’t her?

           He smiles a strained smile. Maria does not.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        There are thirteen bodies down in 
                        the morgue. You’ve described all of 
                        them in that cafe. Except one. A 
                        woman.
                                 THE WITNESS
                        I saw a man in the restroom.

                                 MARIA
                        So you say.

           The Witness’ smile stiffens. He casts a glance at the one way 
           mirror behind Maria.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - CONTINUOUS

           Behind the mirror, Thomas and Hanson are watching closely.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Witness signals a pack of cigarettes, lying on a table.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Can I?

           She gestures. Of course. He picks it up and pulls out a 
           cigarette. Starts looking for a light, and doesn’t find it.

                                 MARIA
                        So. You smoke?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Maybe I drink too?

           Another strained smile.

                                 MARIA
                        I can get you a drink if it’s okay 
                        with your medication?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        What medication?

                                 MARIA
                        For the epilepsy. You do suffer 
                        from epilepsy, don’t you?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARIA
                        Okay then, you say you’d like to go 
                        home, do you know where you live?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        No, I was... What I meant was... 
                        Listen, if you’ve got something to 
                        say, could we..?
                                 MARIA
                        I just have one last question, 
                        actually.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Mhmm?

           She produces a lighter. He leans in to light his cigarette 
           and--

                                 MARIA
                        Why are you lying to me?

           --freezes. Their faces are so near. He hesitates just a beat. 
           Then lights his cig and leans back.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARIA
                        I mean; why did you start lying to 
                        me?

           He blows smoke. Calm.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I didn’t. I’m not. 

           She examines him carefully. Then nods.

                                 MARIA
                        Let me tell you something. There 
                        are three types of amnesia: Organic 
                        amnesia is usually caused by 
                        something blocking the flow of 
                        oxygen to the brain; a tumor, a 
                        blow to the head. Would’ve been my 
                        initial diagnosis, except with O.A. 
                        you never forget who you are. Loss 
                        of identity is a symptom of  
                        Psychogenic amnesia. Along with  
                        personality changes, mood swings, 
                        large holes in the conscious 
                        memory. You cure it by fishing for 
                        details. Suddenly you hook onto 
                        something; an image, a scent, and 
                        then it all comes rolling. Usually 
                        in big chunks; seasons, places, 
                        people. They say it’s like opening 
                        a photo album. Was that how it felt 
                        to you?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I haven’t... felt anything like 
                        that.
                                 MARIA
                        No? Down in the morgue? When you 
                        looked into that body bag?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        No. 

           She looks at him. For a long beat. Then she nods.

                                 MARIA
                        Then my guess is, you’re suffering 
                        from the third kind of amnesia.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Which is?

                                 MARIA
                        Simulated.

           He snorts a strained laugh. Looks up and shakes his head.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Laughter as a defence mechanism.  
                        Little pauses before every 
                        deliberate lie, eyes seek up and to 
                        the right to stimulate creativity, 
                        that’s it: Up. And to the right.

           The Witness looks at her again. Dead serious now.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Am I accused of anything?

                                 MARIA
                        Why would you think that?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Should I call my lawyer?

                                 MARIA
                        Do you know if you’ve got one?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I didn’t do anything!

                                 MARIA
                        You sure about that?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        YES, I’m...

           He stops himself. Maria leans in.

                                 MARIA
                        Who was the girl in the bag?

           The Witness snorts. Stays quiet.
           Maria nods. Then reaches down under the table and pulls 
           something up -- an evidence bag. Containing--

           THE GOLD BRACELET - from the body bag.

           She puts it on the table right in front of him -- CLONK.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        How did you get that?

                                 MARIA
                        What is it?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        How did you get it off her?

                                 MARIA
                        Off who?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I said HOW DID YOU GET IT OFF?

           The Witness stands up. Strongly affected.

                                 MARIA
                        Who is she?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Stop it!

                                 MARIA
                        What’s her name?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I said STOP IT!

                                 MARIA
                        What’s your name?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I don’t kno--

                                 MARIA
                        How did you hurt your head?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        I said I--

                                 MARIA
                        Did she place that bomb?

                                 THE WITNESS
                        What!?

           Maria leans forward and SHOUTS him right in his face--
                                 MARIA
                        Did the owner of this bracelet 
                        bring and detonate that bomb, that 
                        killed thirteen people in “The 
                        Warehouse” today!?

           Maria’s voice cracks when she lets it all out on him. 

           The Witness blinks. As if the horrible truth of what happened 
           just dawned upon him. He sits. Shaken. Exhausted.

           Then, he finally looks up. Composed.

                                 THE WITNESS
                        My name is Martin Cross. I’m a  
                        pediatrician. I live and work in 
                        Beacon Hill. I’m 45 years old and 
                        my social security number is 034-65-

                                 MARIA
                        Who’s the girl in the bag?

                                 THE WITNESS
                            (beat)
                        My wife.

           Maria nods. Thank you. She sits.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, BEHIND THE ONE WAY MIRROR - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas and Hanson stare through the glass.

                                 HANSON
                        Fuck. Me.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, MAIN OFFICE - EVENING

           CLOSE on a computer screen. DATA flows, WORDS roll. 

           Hanson is by the keyboard, quickly skimming through the text. 
           Thomas watches over his shoulder. 

                                 HANSON
                        Julie and Martin Cross, 54 Mt 
                        Vernon Street. She’s a student at 
                        UMB, political science, he’s a 
                        pediatric doctor, clinic on the 
                        hill, consults abroad, London, 
                        Berlin... He suffers from... 
                        epilepsy. 

           Hanson looks up at Thomas. Thomas grabs a phone and dials a 
           number from the screen--
           EXT. MT VERNON STREET, BOSTON - EVENING

           An quiet apartment block in the expensive part of the city.

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Big, bright and silent. Delicate colors and Scandinavian  
           design. This is the home of an educated upper middle class 
           couple. Who are absent this evening.

           We find and close in on the PHONE. Ringing. Ringing.

           Finally, the ANSWERING MACHINE picks it up--

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, MAIN OFFICE - EVENING

           Thomas puts the phone on speaker, and everyone gathers around 
           it when JULIE CROSS’s voice is heard. Young and cheerful.

                                 JULIE (V.O.)
                        Hi, you’ve reached Martin and Julie 
                        Cross. We can’t come to the phone 
                        right now, but leave your name and 
                        number and we’ll get back to you as 
                        soon as we can. Bye.

           BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! The TONE that follows seems to go on 
           forever. Sound’s like someone FLATLINING in a hospital.

           Thomas, mercifully, hangs up and quells the tone. He looks 
           up, and there’s -- Maria.

                                 MARIA
                        She’s the key. Julie Cross.

                                 THOMAS
                        How?

                                 MARIA
                        I don’t know yet.

           Hanson comes back from another phone call.

                                 HANSON
                        CIA just called. White House wants 
                        to know what’s happening. I told 
                        them we’re not ready to conclude,  
                        but they’re pushing for either  
                        right wing militia or one of three  
                        Islamic terrorist cells.

           Maria reacts reluctantly.
                                 MARIA
                        Why would a bright, 28-year old  
                        girl from Boston join an Islamic 
                        terrorist group?

                                 HANSON
                        Just because she was there, doesn’t 
                        necessarily mean she had anything 
                        to do with--

                                 MARIA
                            (cuts him off)
                        She was part of this.

           Hanson and Thomas exchange a short glance. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how, I just...
                            (beat)
                        This is no ordinary suicide bomb.

           Hanson makes a discrete gesture - he doesn’t agree.

                                 HANSON
                        The explosive was stolen by pros. 
                        They’ve made a distinct political 
                        demand. Martin Cross identified a 
                        man in the restroom and--

                                 MARIA
                            (cuts him off)
                        He recalled a man. I think he’s got 
                        it wrong.

           Hanson bites his lip. He addresses Thomas--

                                 HANSON
                        I’d like to join Dr. Pierce in the 
                        room, and if that’s not an option, 
                        I’d like her to focus on the male 
                        suspect in the restroom and not on 
                        Martin Cross or his wife.

                                 MARIA
                        She’s the key.

                                 HANSON
                        It’s... 07.19 PM. They’re signing  
                        this thing at 9.30. And the whole 
                        city’s in the streets tonight.

           They both look at Thomas, who hesitates for a beat. Then he 
           nods to Maria--

                                 THOMAS
                        Go with the girl. But you’re taking  
                        Hanson in with you and--
                                 MARIA
                        I don’t think so.

           She turns around and walks back towards the interview room. 
           Hanson gives Thomas a stern look. He calls after her--

                                 THOMAS
                        One hour!

           She disappears into the room - never once looking back. 
           Hanson snorts and looks up at the tv-screen - hand held 
           images of chaos and death.

           Thomas looks away. And we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           A closed EYELID. Opens. And-- 

           Martin Cross is back at his table in the crowded cafe. He 
           sits alone. Uneven heartbeat. Heavy breathing. Everything 
           plays out in dreamlike SLOW MOTION.

           Outside, the OLD BOATS creak ominously.

           Martin blinks and REALITY SMASHES BACK when a young woman 
           enters. Smiling. And carrying a big SHOPPING BAG. 

                                 JULIE
                        Hi honey, I’m so sorry.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                            (no problem)
                        No, no...

           He gets up and pulls out a chair for her. There are two cups 
           of coffee on the table. She gives him a quick kiss and sits.

                                 JULIE
                        Not my fault, your mother-in-law, 
                        four hours straight in a stench of 
                        Chanel. What’s this sick obsession 
                        old women got with perfume?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        You just wait.

                                 JULIE
                        She got you something.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Of course she did.

                                 JULIE
                        It’s for the clinic.
                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Of course it is.

           She pulls something out of her bag. A PORCELAIN CAT. Ugly 
           beyond belief.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Ah... that’s... really...

                                 JULIE
                        You love my mother.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I really do.

                                 JULIE
                        I promised her you’d put it on your 
                        desk.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Of course you did.

                                 JULIE
                        You will put it on your desk.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Over my dead body.

           She laughs.

                                 JULIE
                        My dad put up all her crazy shit!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Why do you think they divorced?

           She pokes him.

                                 JULIE
                        Ha-ha, funny guy. Did you eat? I’m 
                        starving.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Not yet, you pick something, I’m 
                        just gonna...

           He signals the restroom. Gets up and leaves his WALLET on the 
           table. Lunch is on him. She picks up a MENU CARD.

                                 JULIE
                        Let’s see if we can find you a  
                        delicious mouse-à-la-carte, shall 
                        we?

           He smiles and walks towards the back corridor.

           Behind him -- Laura gets a QUARTER from her mother.
           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           Martin Cross is washing his hands.

           He catches his own reflection in the mirror. Gets an ominous 
           feeling. But before he can even blink--

           THE BLAST. Bright light. Deafening noise.

           Martin is THROWN to the wall. And everything goes--

           BLACK.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           Martin Cross opens his eyes. He’s back in his chair. Maria’s 
           back in hers. She eyes him closely before concluding--

                                 MARIA
                        So. That’s what happened?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        That’s how I remember it.

                                 MARIA
                        What about the man?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        What man?

                                 MARIA
                        The man in the restroom.

           Martin blinks.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        He ran... right past me.

                                 MARIA
                        Up and to the right.

           Martin reacts. Frustrated.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’m... trying, here...

                                 MARIA
                        Why didn’t you tell me about your 
                        wife before?

                                 MARTIN CROSS 
                        I didn’t... remember before... down 
                        in that... room, I was... afraid, 
                        you might...

           He stops himself.
                                 MARIA
                        You were afraid we might what?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        What you might think.

                                 MARIA
                        What would we think?

           He looks at her. Doesn’t answer.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        What else was in the bag?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Hmm?

                                 MARIA
                        You said she had a new bag, a big 
                        one, what else was in it?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I don’t know. Girl stuff.

                                 MARIA
                        Big bag for... “girl stuff”.

           He shrugs. Wouldn’t know.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        What does she do for work?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        She’s a student at UBM. She wants 
                        to get into politics.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE on computer screens. Digital copies of university 
           diplomas, bank accounts and tax reports scroll quickly by, 
           verifying Martin’s words.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        And you own your own praxis?

                                 MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        Yes.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        So you support the both of you.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        I do.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        And you’re okay with that?
                                 MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        She’s my wife.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maria nods and watches him closely.

                                 MARIA
                        How was your marriage?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARIA
                        Were you... happy?

           Martin hesitates for a beat and we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION / MEMORY - DAY

           It’s raining cats and dogs. Martin Cross exits the store, 
           carrying two cups of coffee and a newspaper under his arm. He 
           runs towards his car, but stops when he sees that--

           The car is empty. He looks around and spots--

           JULIE, on her cell phone. Talking to someone. Agitated. She’s 
           soaking wet but doesn’t seem to notice.

           Martin watches her. Something dawns behind his eyes...

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        JULIE?

           She looks up. Then quickly finishes her call and hurries back 
           to him. Puts up a smile.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 JULIE
                        Hmm? Yeah, let’s go.

           She seeks cover inside the car. 

           He stays outside for a beat. Rain pouring down his face.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           Martin blinks. Maria’s watching him.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        ... I’m sorry?
                                 MARIA
                        Were you happy together?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Very.

                                 MARIA
                        Julie too?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Mmm...

                                 MARIA
                        “Mmm?”

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Everyone has problems.

           Maria raises her eyebrows. Martin sighs and explains.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        She saw a therapist. She had 
                        these... issues with her mother.

                                 MARIA
                        What else did they talk about? 
                        Julie and her therapist?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I wouldn’t know, what do you talk 
                        about?

           Maria watches him closely.

                                 MARIA
                        She was very young.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Twenty eight.

                                 MARIA
                        And you are...?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’m forty five. I told you. 

           She pauses. Gives him time to elaborate on the age 
           difference. But Martin feels no need to explain. 

                                 MARIA
                        And you’ve been married for...?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Six years.

                                 MARIA
                        Have you been married before?
                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Me? No.

                                 MARIA
                        Did you ever cheat on her?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Wh...!? No!

                                 MARIA
                        Did she ever cheat on you?

           Martin blinks. And--

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           BAM - the PAGES flutter by at tremendous speed.

           INT. DARK BEDROOM / MEMORY - NIGHT

           Martin and Julie lie naked in a bed. After sex. They look at 
           each other. Silent intimacy.

           Martin reaches out and gently touches her cheek. Wants to get 
           closer. Julie smiles. A strained smile.

           And looks away. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           Martin clears his throat. 

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Not that I know of, listen...

                                 MARIA
                        So you got up and went to the 
                        restroom.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Huh? Yeah...

                                 MARIA
                        And she stayed by the table to 
                        order some food.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Yes.

           Maria nods her head. Waiting. Watching him.

                                 MARIA
                        Why are you lying to me, Martin?
                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’M NOT... lying to you, that’s 
                        what I remember, that’s... how I 
                        remember it, Jesus!

                                 MARIA
                        Okay.

           He stands up. Deeply frustrated.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I come in here... I just lost... my 
                        wife, I just... Do you understand!?

                                 MARIA
                        I do.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’m trying to help you here!

                                 MARIA
                        I know.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’m actually trying to help you!

                                 MARIA
                        I know.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Then why don’t you get the hell off 
                        my back!

           She remains calm.

                                 MARIA
                        Because there are things you’re not 
                        telling me.

           Martin’s had enough. He HURLS his chair aside, and marches 
           towards the door. He opens it and stops. Right in front of 
           him is--

           Thomas, blocking his way out.

                                 THOMAS
                        Can I help you, Mr. Cross?

           Martin swallows hard and looks back at Maria. Regretting his 
           outburst, and trying to get himself under control. 

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I... I’m sorry, I just...

                                 MARIA
                        It’s okay.

           Martin walks back inside the room. 
           Thomas signals Maria to follow him out. She does.

           Martin Cross is left alone. He stares at the closed door. 
           Pulse hammering in his temple.

           INT. COMMAND CENTER, MAIN OFFICE - EVENING

           Thomas leads the way through the office. Maria follows.

                                 THOMAS
                        We got the surveillance tapes from 
                        the break-in at the base. 

           They reach detectives Daniels, Furst and Hanson, and everyone 
           gather around Furst’s computer.

           A VIDEO CLIP fades in. Grainy night a desolate place. A 
           locked garage door filmed by a surveillance camera. A VAN 
           drives up. A SHADOWY FIGURE jumps out, dressed in a black 
           hoodie. He runs towards the door.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        December 27th, 02.39 AM. The van 
                        was stolen the night before, and he 
                        cut the plates.

           ON THE VIDEO -- The FIGURE cuts the padlock with a bolt 
           cutter. He tries to open the door, but then notices another 
           lock high up under the roof. He reaches up and cuts that one 
           too. Then opens the door and disappears into the dark.

                                 HANSON
                        The C4 came from that stash. He 
                        knew the place, but he doesn’t know 
                        there’s a camera, and he doesn’t 
                        know there’s a safety lock up 
                        there. I say he’s connected, but 
                        he’s not an army insider.

           Maria looks at Thomas, who signals the interview room.

                                 THOMAS
                        Hanson wants to show him the tape.

                                 HANSON
                        Maybe he’ll... recall something, 
                        when he sees the guy live.

           Maria shakes her head.

                                 MARIA
                        I just opened him up, and we can 
                        put anything inside his head right 
                        now. It’s like interrogating a 
                        child, he’s trying to remember what 
                        happened and he’ll probably grab on 
                        to anything we give him.
           Hanson gives Thomas a serious look. Thomas nods.

                                 THOMAS
                        We’re gonna show him the tape. You 
                        can do it so it’s done... properly. 

                                 MARIA
                        If you show him that tape, you’ll 
                        get a face. You’ll get a name. But 
                        it won’t be the right one.
                            (to Furst)
                        I need the records and a full 
                        medical history on Julie Cross. And 
                        I need a complete list of fellow 
                        students, teachers and all papers 
                        and assignments she wrote on UMB. 

           Furst hesitates. Unsure of the chain of command.

           Hanson grins and shakes his head. Can no longer hide his 
           frustration with Maria.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You afraid you won’t get credit, 
                        Jimmy?

                                 HANSON
                        No. Pierce. I’m afraid I will. I’m 
                        afraid you’re doing a Michael 
                        Kimberly on us, only this time your 
                        goose chase won’t end with you 
                        taking a sick leave but with 
                        someone blowing up the City Hall 
                        Square!

           He raises his voice at her. Deeply frustrated. Maria just 
           looks at him. Then she nods and turns to Thomas.  

                                 MARIA
                        Do you trust me?

                                 THOMAS
                        Come on.

           She snorts. But Thomas stands his ground. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        We’re showing him the tape.

           He marches back towards the interview room. Maria follows. 
           Furious. They reach the door, open it, and freeze.

           THE ROOM IS EMPTY.

           MARTIN CROSS IS GONE.

           Their eyes dart across the room and land on--
           The door leading outside. It swings shut. Someone has just 
           left the building.

           Thomas’ realizes what happened. And RUNS.

           Hanson gives Maria a stern look. Then he follows Thomas.

           Maria’s left behind. She swallows hard.

           Damn!

           EXT. HARBOR STREET - EVENING

           Martin Cross comes RUNNING alongside the dark waters. 

           He looks back over his shoulder. Then he changes direction,  
           away from the water, and pushes himself to run even faster.

           Far behind him -- Thomas and Hanson speed around a corner, 
           and run after him.

           EXT. CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS PARK - EVENING

           Snow falls gently on the beautiful park. People have gathered 
           in small groups, worried about the bomb and its consequences.

           Some of them react, when -- Martin Cross comes rushing 
           through. He slows down and tries to mingle with the crowd. 
           Still pacing himself forward. 

           Somewhere in the crowd, a group of teenagers play with 
           fireworks, and suddenly--

           BAM!

           Martin JOLTS as something blows up close to him. He forces 
           himself to move on. Behind him, an elderly gentleman grabs  
           hold of the kids.

           Martin looks back over his shoulder, just as--

           Thomas and Hanson come running around the corner. And stop. 
           Their eyes dart across the--

           GREY BLUR of dark winter coats moving around in the heavy, 
           silent snow. Martin is nowhere to be seen.

           Just as Thomas is about to give up, someone moves, creating 
           an opening in the crowd and Thomas spots--

           Martin. 

           In the opposite end of the park. Starring right at him.

           Thomas points at him. Martin reacts, turns around and runs.
           DOWN INTO THE SUBWAY. 

           Thomas runs. Hanson follows.

           INT. “AQUARIUM” SUBWAY STATION - EVENING

           The escalator is packed with people, who react when Martin 
           Cross pushes his way through.

           Martin freezes when he sees--

           Two UNIFORMED COPS at the bottom of the escalator. One of  
           them receives a message on his radio. And starts checking 
           people out.

           Martin swallows. And looks around. No way back.

           Then he spots A SINGLE MOTHER (33) a bit further down the 
           escalator. She’s trying to juggle three shopping bags and her 
           BABY in a stroller. 

           Martin steps down to her with a sympathetic smile.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        You need a hand with those?

           She smiles. Surprised and relieved by his offer.

                                 SINGLE MOTHER
                        Thank you, that’s very... kind of 
                        you.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        No problem.

           He relieves her of her bags, and they exchange a smile when 
           they reach the bottom of the escalator. Looking like a small 
           family, they slide right past the uniformed officers.

           They stop on the platform. Waiting for the train to arrive.

           Martin looks up at the sign that tells us that the train will 
           be here in 2... no 1 minute.

           They wait. In silence. Faint smiles. Martin can feel the eyes 
           of the two officers burning a hole in his back.

           They finally hear the DISTANT RUMBLE of the train. But then--

                                 THOMAS (O.S.)
                        MARTIN!

           Everyone on the platform looks up at -- Thomas and Hanson 
           rushing down the escalator. Flashing their badges. Martin 
           Cross’s been spotted!
                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        STOP THAT MAN! MARTIN!

           Everyone looks around to see who Thomas is chasing. Martin  
           looks around too. He exchanges a worried glance with the 
           single mother.

           The train arrives at the platform. Slowing down.

           Thomas jumps over a barrier and runs right towards Martin.

           The train doors open. Martin picks up the bags.

           The single mother turns pale. She looks at the two policemen 
           RUNNING. And back at Martin Cross. And his strained smile.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        You coming?

           She stares at him. Frozen. He moves towards the train doors, 
           and almost makes it, when--

           Thomas’ GUN is pressed to the back of his head.

                                 THOMAS
                        Stop.

           Martin Cross closes his eyes. Behind him, the mother grabs 
           her baby and tumbles back. Shocked that she trusted this man.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Step away from the train.

           Martin Cross takes a step backwards.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I didn’t do anything.

                                 THOMAS
                        Get down on your knees and put your 
                        hands behind your head, please.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I didn’t. Do...

                                 THOMAS
                        I said--

           BAM! Neither gets to finish their line before Hanson comes 
           running and kicks Martin hard in the back of his knees. 
           Martin falls. The shopping bags SMASH against the ground. 

           Hanson CUFFS him harshly and pulls him back up.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Help me.
           Everyone looks away. Suddenly very busy minding their own 
           business.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I’m Martin Cross, I’m being held 
                        against my will.

           The single mother hurries into the train. Pressing herself 
           against the far wall. Shielding her baby with her body. 
           Staring at Martin with fear in her eyes.

           Martin’s voice breaks--

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        My name is Martin Cross! I’m being 
                        held against my will!

           The train doors close.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING!

           Hanson tries to pull him away, but Martin fights back. His 
           eyes are locked on the scared mother inside the train. 

           Suddenly the most important thing in the world is that she, 
           this total stranger, if no one else, believes him. 

           She averts her eyes.

           The train starts. Accelerates.

           And she’s gone.

           Martin blinks. Something dies in his eyes. And as he’s pulled 
           away we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           Dead silence. 

           Martin is back in his chair. His hands are cuffed. His suit 
           stained. And his gaze is fixed on something somewhere.

           He doesn’t react, when Thomas and Maria enter and shut the 
           door behind them. Maria is bringing a paper file. 

           Thomas takes charge now. Maria stands against the wall, 
           watching, while Thomas paces back and forth in front of 
           Martin Cross. Frustrated. What the hell is this?

           Martin clears his throat and looks up at him.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It was me.
           Thomas stops.

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m sorry?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It was me. I did it.

                                 THOMAS
                        You did what?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        That bomb. In the cafe.

           Thomas exchanges a glance with Maria and looks back at 
           Martin.

                                 THOMAS
                        You did it?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Yes.

                                 THOMAS
                        You detonated the bomb that killed 
                        13 people in Old Harbor today?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Yes.

                                 THOMAS
                        Including your own wife.

           Martin Cross twinges.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Yes.

           Another glance between Thomas and Maria.

                                 THOMAS
                        You could’ve saved us all a whole 
                        lot of trouble if you’d told us 
                        earlier.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I didn’t... remember till now.

           Thomas nods.

                                 THOMAS
                        Tell me something. Martin. How does 
                        a pediatrician from Beacon Hill get 
                        hold of twenty pounds of Semtex?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I stole it. From the military.
                                 THOMAS
                        And why didn’t you set the timer so 
                        you could get out of there in time?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It malfunctioned. It went off 
                        before I planned.

                                 THOMAS
                        When did you open the hotmail 
                        address you used for the threat 
                        mail?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                            (beat)
                        Right before I sent it.

                                 THOMAS
                        And why did you do it? The bomb?

           Martin looks directly at Thomas. His eyes are filled with 
           sorrow, anger, hate.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        You want war? You’ll get war.

           Thomas looks at Martin for a long time. Then--

                                 THOMAS
                        The bomb was released manually. A 
                        trigger, not a timer. It wasn’t 
                        Semtex but C4, it was ten pounds, 
                        not twenty, and the threat was sent 
                        from a Gmail, not a hotmail.
                            (beat)
                        Who did you see in that restroom? 
                        Martin?

           Martin looks away.

                                 MARIA
                        It was Julie. Wasn’t it?

           Both men look up. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Julie and that man. They were in it 
                        together. And you’re covering for 
                        her. Aren’t you?

           Martin snorts and shakes his head. This is absurd.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you have kids? You and Julie?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        No.
                                 MARIA
                        Why not?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Is that against the law, now?

                                 MARIA
                        Of course not. But you’re forty 
                        five. She’s going on thirty. You’ve 
                        been married for six years. Is it 
                        because you don’t want to?
                            (beat)
                        Or because you can’t?

           Martin looks up at Thomas.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Are you gonna charge me?

                                 THOMAS
                        Not yet.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Then I’d like to go home.

                                 MARIA
                        Infertility is an increasing 
                        problem in western--

           Martin gets up from his chair.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It’s Julie. Okay? Her ovaries are 
                        sealed, okay? 

                                 MARIA
                        Yeah?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Yeah. You happy now?

                                 MARIA
                        It’s not you?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        No.

                                 MARIA
                        Okay then.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Okay.

                                 MARIA
                        Up and to the right.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’m leaving now. Good bye.
                                 MARIA
                        She was pregnant.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Hmm?

                                 MARIA
                        Julie was pregnant when she died.

           He freezes. Stares at her in utter disbelief. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Thirteen weeks.

           She opens her file and spreads out a series of PHOTOS across 
           the table. Greenish ultrasound scans of a human fetus. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        If one of you is sterile, it’s 
                        definitely not her. And if it’s 
                        you?
                            (beat)
                        Then who’s the father of that 
                        child?

           She points to one of the photos. Martin stares at her. Pale 
           as a sheet. Heart pounding.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Who was she with in that restroom, 
                        Martin?

           He fumes as he realizes, and we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           INT. MEMORY - SFX

           PAGES flutter by with a deafening noise. A PEN is writing 
           something on them.

           INT. DARK PLACE / MEMORY - NIGHT

           Julie’s in bed with an unseen man. Dreamlike. Ecstatic.

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT / MEMORY - NIGHT

           Martin walks down a dark, narrow corridor - not unlike the 
           one in the café. We HEAR heavy rain outside.

           At the end of the corridor, the door to Julie’s room is 
           slightly ajar. Through it, Martin can see his wife. 

           Writing something in A BOOK. She flips a page. A thundering 
           noise. 
           Martin stops outside the door. She hasn’t noticed him. 

           She’s crying.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Julie?

           She jumps. Drops the book in a small wooden box and closes 
           it. Then she SLAMS the door shut in his face.

           He grabs the handle. Locked. He knocks--

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Julie? Julie open the door!

           No answer. He hammers the door now - BAM, BAM, BAM!

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        JULIE!?

           BAM, BAM--

                                                           MATCHCUT TO:

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           --BAM, BAM, BAM! Martin is hammering on the locked door to 
           one of the toilet stalls.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        JULIE!

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT / MEMORY - NIGHT

           --BAM!

           Martin turns around as he hears a KEY in the front door far 
           behind him. The front door opens and--

           JULIE comes home. Different clothes. Different night.

           She stops when she sees him. Off guard for just a second. 
           Then she puts up a smile.

                                 JULIE
                        Hey, I thought you were...

           She signals “out”.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        No, I’m... I’m just... reading.  
                        Where have you...?

                                 JULIE
                        I uh... had a lecture. It ran late, 
                        and then we had a beer.
                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Okay. You and...?

                                 JULIE
                        The girls.

           She strips off her shirt and heads for the bathroom.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be in the shower. See you  
                        upstairs.

           He watches her move - a bit too quickly. She drops her shirt 
           on the floor.

           Martin’s eyes land on something, that came off with it. A 
           leather necklace. With a SMALL KEY.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT

           Maria leans close to Martin, whose eyes wander through a 
           world, only he can see.

                                 MARIA
                        Pick it up.

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT / MEMORY - NIGHT

           Martin squats next to the key. He picks it up.

           He looks back at Julie’s room.

           The door is ajar.

           In the bathroom, Julie turns on the shower. And the sound of 
           running water PULLS MARTIN INTO--

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           The blurred FIGURE is standing by the sink. Washing his face. 

           INT. JULIE’S ROOM / MEMORY - NIGHT

           Martin enters Julie’s room, and finds the small wooden box.

           He inserts the small key into the box and turns -- CLICK.

           In the box he finds a little black book. A DIARY.

           He opens it. He reads. Fluttering pages.

           A STORM gathers behind him.

           The pages rush by at supernatural speed.
           He drops the book. But the pages keep rushing by.

           He closes his eyes and we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT / MEMORY - NIGHT

           Now he’s back outside her locked door again. Hammering away--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        JULIE!!?

           BAM, BAM, BAM -- the sound of his pounding continues over:

           INT. DARK PLACE / MEMORY - CONTINUOUS

           Julie’s in bed with the unseen man. It’s dark, hot, obscure.

           She climaxes to the sound of her husbands desperate pounding 
           and shouting somewhere far away--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        JULIE!

           BAM, BAM--

           INT. MEMORY - CONTINUOUS

           Julie’s HAND lets go of Martin’s hand.

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT / MEMORY - CONTINUOUS

           Martin hammers desperately on the door, and suddenly leaps 
           forward and BANGS HIS HEAD against it.

           It EXPLODES in an INFERNO OF LIGHT AND BROKEN GLASS!

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - EVENING

           Martin is TORN BACK to reality. Deeply frustrated that he’s 
           falling out of the trance. Maria fights to keep him focused.

                                 MARIA
                        A face, a name, I need a name!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I can’t...

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t let go! What’s in the book?

           His wound starts to bleed. 
                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        She’d been with him.

                                 MARIA
                        The man in the restroom.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Every Tuesday.

                                 MARIA
                        Who is he? Martin!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        She was meeting him. Today.

                                 MARIA
                        Where?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Warehouse.

                                 MARIA
                        Go. You can stop them.

           Martin closes his eyes and we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           EXT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           “The Warehouse” before the explosion. Laughter, chatter and 
           bright sunlight. Just like in Martin’s very first memories.

           And here he comes. But this time, there’s no hesitation. He’s 
           angry. Determined. Walks right up to the door, raises his 
           hand - no blood this time - and barges inside. 

           As he passes, he knocks over the BLUE VASE. It SMASHES on the 
           pavement. Wild flowers scatter everywhere.

           INT. CAFE / MEMORY - DAY

           Martin Cross walks through the cafe. Spots HIMSELF sitting 
           alone at the table. Waiting for his wife.

           Martin snorts at his own naiveté, and heads straight for the 
           back corridor.

           Hidden behind the JUKEBOX is Julie’s BIG BAG.

           Laura gets a quarter.
           INT. CAFE, CORRIDOR / MEMORY - DAY

           Martin runs through the dark, narrow corridor. The sound of 
           BOOK PAGES flutter all around him.

           He speeds up and runs even faster towards the CLOSED DOOR at 
           the end of the corridor.

           He THROWS HIMSELF at it and BARGES INTO--

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           Silence.

           Martin stops. From the locked toilet stall in the far end of 
           the restroom he can hear the unmistakable sound of--

           Two people having sex.

           Martin swallows. Stunned by the sound. Before finally--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Julie?

           The sound stops. 

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Julie?

           Movement inside the booth. Clothes. Martin PULLS the handle. 
           Locked. He BANGS on the door--

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        JULIE!!!???

           BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM--

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Martin’s desperately struggling with his memory.

                                 MARIA
                        They’re in there. Open the door. 
                        You’re in charge!

           Martin reaches out and--

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - CONTINUOUS

           --grabs the handle and -- PULLS THE DOOR OPEN!

           He tumbles back and stares at the toilet stall.

           It’s empty.
           Martin Cross is all alone in the restroom. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Martin shakes his head. Maria’s high on adrenaline - they’re 
           so close now, so close.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It’s empty.

                                 MARIA
                        No it’s not.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        There’s no one there.

                                 MARIA
                        She’s in there, he’s in there, come 
                        on, Martin!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I can’t--

                                 MARIA
                        Close your eyes and look again!

           Martin’s pulse is beating rapidly. He closes his eyes and 
           forces himself back to--

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - CONTINUOUS

           Martin looks back at the stall, and suddenly a SWARM OF 
           BRIGHT GHOSTLY FIGURES come tumbling out. We recognize their 
           faces, as they rapidly METAMORPH into each other. 

           Martin tries to avoid them as--

           MARIA, THOMAS, HANSON, JULIE, THE TWO ELDERLY LADIES, THE 
           DISHWASHER, THE DRUNK and MARTIN HIMSELF rush by in a  
           thundering inferno that keeps increasing in speed, until the 
           memory finally BURSTS in--

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           A BRUTAL EXPLOSION! GLASS AND BLINDING LIGHT!

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Martin tumbles out of his chair and away from Maria. He’s 
           shouting desperately at her--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        There’s no one there, I told you, 
                        you’re putting all these... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT'D)
                        things into my head, all these... 
                        faces! I haven’t seen them, they’re 
                        not my memories, they’re yours! 
                        You’re putting them in there, I 
                        can’t... I can’t...

           He slowly glides down the wall and crumples in the corner.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t. Remember. Anything.

           He puts his hands over his face. No more.

           Maria stares at him. Heart pounding. Heavy breathing.

           She blinks as it slowly dawns on her - what she’s done.

           She jumps when the door opens behind her. Thomas enters and 
           looks at them for a beat. Then he steps up to Maria and 
           speaks softly in her ear.

                                 THOMAS
                        We’ve got him. His name is Simon 
                        Kirk. He called the base at 2.06 AM 
                        on the night of the break-in. His 
                        phone number is on Julie Cross’s  
                        listing. Calling Card cell, 
                        untraceable, but the built in GPS 
                        puts him in a rented appartment 
                        down in the D street projects.
                            (beat)
                        He’s down there right now. We’re 
                        hitting him in twenty.

           Maria looks at him. Tries to understand. He nods at Martin.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        We’re done here. Stay with him till 
                        we get back.

           He gives her a tired smile. Thank you. And then he’s off.

           Maria stays. Frozen. Her eyes tear up. She puts her hand over 
           her mouth and turns away from Martin. 

           She doesn’t notice him, before he’s back on his feet and 
           finally speaks.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I’m sorry... I...

           She turns around. And shakes her head. He’s not the one who 
           should feel guilty here. She tries to explain. Finally--

                                 MARIA
                        I had this... case last year.  
                        Michael Kimberly. His wife left him 
                        with the kids. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIA (CONT'D)
                        She was afraid what he’d do and 
                        wanted a restraining order on him. 
                        He was devastated. He didn’t wanna 
                        hurt them, he just wanted them 
                        back. He wasn’t dangerous, I was 
                        sure of that. And he promised to 
                        stay away from them. I believed 
                        him. I let him go.
                            (beat)
                        He shot them. All three of them and 
                        then himself. In the new house. The 
                        girls were... painting the walls...

           Her voice cracks. Her facade breaks. She hates to do this in 
           front of a stranger, but can’t hold back any longer.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        You can’t blame yourself.

           She snorts when she realizes--

                                 MARIA
                        You’re right. I do put these things 
                        in your head, because I...
                            (beat)
                        I needed to.

           He nods.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        The worst part about being cheated 
                        isn’t the deception. It’s that you 
                        stop trusting people. In the end 
                        you stop trusting yourself.

           She finally looks at him.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I wanna go back. To the cafe.

                                 MARIA
                        It’s okay, we’re done.

           He shakes his head.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        You were right. I was there. I saw 
                        him.

                                 MARIA
                        Doesn’t matter now, they found him. 
                        They’re getting him now.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I need to know what happened. If 
                        Julie... was part of this.
           Maria looks at him. Martin struggles to keep his pride. His 
           dignity. But his eyes are begging her. For a beat they see 
           and recognize their own pain and desperation in the other. 

           Then Maria nods and we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE - EVENING

           “The Warehouse” is dark and quiet now. It’s cordoned off by 
           police tape that flutters gently in the cold breeze. 

           TWO POLICE OFFICERS step up and take guard on either side of 
           the dark hole in the wall.

           A hand lifts up the police tape. Maria. She looks back at--

           Martin Cross. He stares at the burnt-out cafe. A third 
           officer removes the cuffs from his wrists. Martin swallows 
           hard.

           Then he steps under the tape - and follows Maria.

           EXT. D STREET PROJECTS - EVENING

           A housing project in the Southside of the city. Concrete 
           walls, yellow light and dark empty streets.

           AN ARMORED RESCUE VAN pulls up. A SWAT TEAM jumps out of the 
           van and hides in the shadows near a doorway.

           Two TEAM LEADERS take position by the car. They are -- THOMAS 
           and HANSON. Both dressed in Swat uniforms. 

           On Thomas’ signal, the Team moves into the building. Fast and 
           quiet. Thomas follows them - leaving Hanson by the car. 

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE - EVENING

           Through the hole, two silhouettes appear in the pale 
           moonlight. Maria and Martin. 

           Martin hesitates at the sight of the bombed out cafe. Then he 
           pulls himself together and steps forward.

           Maria let’s him take it all in at his own pace. 

           His breathing his heavy. His heartbeat uneven. THA-THUD... 
           THA-THUD...

           Distant ECHOES reach him; chatter, laughter, plates rattling.

           And music. A CHOIR. 
           Martin suddenly sees the FIGURES from his memories. Appearing 
           like TRANSLUCENT GHOSTS in the cafe. Chatting. Laughing.  
           Without a clue of what’s about to hit them.

           Martin’s gaze lands on Maria. Grey and real. 

           The ghosts vaporize around her. 

           Maria signals the corridor in the back. Martin stares at it. 
           Pulls himself together. And steps forward. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - EVENING

           The SWAT OFFICERS move up the stairs. Fast and quiet.

           A homeless man staggers off in the shadows. Thomas never 
           notices him.

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, CORRIDOR - EVENING

           Martin Cross walks down the dark, narrow corridor. Maria 
           follows behind him. 

           Martin hesitates when he notices--

           A dim LIGHT behind the closed restroom door.

           He steps up to the door. Reaches out. And pushes it open.

           INT. CONCRETE CORRIDOR - EVENING

           The SWAT TEAM moves silently from door to door, till they 
           find the right one. They stop and wait for--

           Thomas to reach them. On his signal the team produce a 
           BATTERING RAM and--

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Martin steps through the doorway and stops. The restroom is 
           empty. There’s no one by the mirror.

           He turns around and faces Maria.

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           BAM! -- The Swat Officers BURST through the door and STORM 
           the appartment. Weapons raised. Adrenaline pumping.
           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Maria steps up to Martin. He shakes his head, regretting that 
           he came down here. He touches the wound over his eye.

                                 MARIA
                        Psychogenic amnesia is best cured 
                        by building physical bridges back 
                        to the moment you lost your memory. 
                        Julie’s wristband, the menu, the 
                        music from the jukebox...

           She points to her eye. That’s why he keeps touching his 
           wound. He lowers his hand. She nods towards the toilet stall 
           in the far end of the restroom.

           The door is closed.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Open the door, Martin.

           He stares at the door. Turns pale and looks back at Maria.

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Flashlights and fast shadows. The Swat Team clears the place.

                                 SWAT OFFICERS (O.S.)
                        Clear! Clear!

           We follow THOMAS through the dark appartment. It’s messy. 
           Almost without furniture. PAPERS, BOOKS and OLD NEWSPAPERS 
           are scattered everywhere. 

           But no one is here.

           Thomas stops when he sees--

           A CELL PHONE. Left on a table. Transmitting it’s location. 

           Thomas grabs his radio--

                                 THOMAS (IN RADIO)
                        10-23, location confirmed. 10-12 on 
                        suspect, repeat; Simon Kirk is not 
                        on site.

           Thomas looks around with frustration. 

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Martin steps up to the closed toilet stall. It’s dead quiet 
           in there. 

                                 MARIA
                        They were in there.
           Martin stares at the door. Doesn’t want to open it.

           But the memory comes back. He sees a LIGHT under the door. 
           Glowing in the same ghostly way, his memories have all night.

           And then come -- the sounds. A distant echo of someone inside 
           the stall. A couple. Having sex.

           Martin reacts. 

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        J... Julie?

                                 MARIA
                        Open the door.

           He stares at the door. The light. The moaning...

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Thomas points his flashlight around in the dark, and freezes 
           when his light beam lands on SOMETHING.

           We sense the shape of A PIECE OF MACHINERY, placed on a table 
           by one of the windows. Thomas grabs his radio again--

                                 THOMAS (IN RADIO)
                        Jimmy? You gotta come see this.

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Martin stares at the light under the door. Listens to the 
           echo of the couple having sex. Then he steps up and HAMMERS 
           on the door--

           BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM!!!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        JULIE!!! JULIE!!!???

           The sounds continue. 

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        JULIE!!!

           BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM!

           Maria steps up to him. Tries to reach him.

                                 MARIA
                        Open the door, Martin. OPEN IT!

           He grabs it - and YANKS IT OPEN.

           The light EXPLODES in his face. Martin stumbles backwards, 
           shields his eyes, and when the light finally fades...
           There she is. Julie. A translucent ghost. She’s alone. Only 
           half dressed. There’s no doubt as to what just happened here. 
           She sees him. And freezes.

                                 JULIE
                        Wh... What are you... doing here, 
                        you shouldn’t... be here!

           Martin stares at her in shock.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        A toilet!? On a toilet!?

           Julie clenches her teeth. This was an unexpected complication 
           in more ways than one.

                                 JULIE
                        You gotta go. Now. You have to go,  
                        you can’t stay here!

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Wh... what!?

                                 JULIE
                        I’ll tell you everything later, I 
                        promise, but right now you--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--

                                 JULIE
                        JUST GO, GOD DAMN IT! 

           Martin leans against the sink. She grabs him and tries to 
           push him out the door.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Get the hell out of here, NOW!

           But he’s stunned. Julie looks back and forth between her 
           husband and the dark corridor.  

           Then she runs for the door.

           Martin grabs her hand. Stopping her. Pleading her.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Stay.
                            (beat)
                        Stay with me.

           Julie hesitates. A long painful moment...

           Then she PULLS HER HAND OUT OF HIS. And runs away. 
           Martin is left behind. Watching the dark, empty corridor. 

           He slowly turns and catches his reflection in the mirror. 

           He steps up to it. Watching his face. Hating it. And then--

           BANGS his head hard against the glass!

           INT. MEMORY / SFX

           EVERYTHING EXPLODES! GLASS AND BRIGHT LIGHT!

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Hanson speeds through the dark apartment, passing several 
           officers putting evidence in plastic bags, before he finds--

           Thomas standing next to his discovery by the window. It’s a 
           SOWING MACHINE. On the table lie needles and thread and piles 
           of printouts from the internet.

           Thomas is carefully placing a PIECE OF CLOTH in a clear 
           plastic bag and explains to Hanson--

                                 THOMAS
                        “TX1”. Fibre explosive. Thirty 
                        times the power of plastic.
                            (beat)
                        They say the marines use it on High 
                        Risk missions. In case they’re 
                        captured and tortured. They sew it 
                        into their uniforms if they  
                        need... a quick way out.

           Hanson looks at Thomas, when he realizes--

                                 HANSON
                        He’s not bringing another bomb.

           Thomas nods.

                                 THOMAS
                        He’s wearing it.

           They stare at the plastic bag. 

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Martin Cross is leaning against the broken mirror. Blood 
           flows from his wound. He’s devastated from the realization 
           that-- 

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        She chose him.
                                 MARIA
                        Who?
                            (beat)
                        Who is he?

           Martin shakes his head. Until he suddenly senses something 
           behind him. The LIGHT reappears in the toilet stall. And--

           A GHOSTLY FIGURE steps up right behind Martin, who stares at 
           his reflection in the mirror. The Figure is a man. Blurred. 
           Faceless. The glowing phantom that’s been haunting him all 
           night.

           The Figure steps up to the sink next to Martin. Turns on the 
           water. And starts washing his hands and face. Hands. Face. 

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        He’s right here.

           Maria can’t see him and stays focused on Martin.

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t let go. You’re in charge. 
                        What do you see?

           Martin swallows. He slowly walks around the blurred figure to 
           get a better look, when suddenly--

           The Figure RUSHES RIGHT AT HIM with shocking speed. He runs 
           right past Martin and is halfway out the door when--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        STOP!!!

           EVERYTHING STOPS! 

           Like in his first memories, Martin commands time and space. 

           The Obscure Figure is caught in mid air. 

           THE SIGHT IS SURREAL: His clothes change and transform  
           through all shapes and colors. His entire figure seems to 
           BREATHE rapidly. Searching for a true form. 

           Only his face remains blurred.

           Martin stares at him.

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Thomas and Hanson flip their way through the piles of papers 
           and printouts, spread around the sowing machine. Hanson finds 
           a newspaper clip, catches Thomas’ attention and reads--
                                 HANSON
                        “First Lieutenant Simon Kirk, 21, 
                        returned from Helmand Province 
                        after being wounded by a roadside 
                        bomb.”

                                 THOMAS
                        That’s our guy.

                                 HANSON
                        “He took his own life... on 
                        September 19th...”
                            (looks up)
                        Three years ago.

                                 THOMAS
                        I don’t...? Our bomber, did he... 
                        take a dead man’s name? 

           They try to comprehend. Hanson reads on, skimming the text.

                                 HANSON
                        “Simon Kirk was buried to the sound 
                        of the Royal Navy Hymn...”
                            (looks up again)
                        “Eternal Father, Strong To Save”

                                 THOMAS
                        What the hell is this...?

           They’re interrupted by a Swat Officer--

                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        Chief?

           He signals them to come. Thomas and Hanson follow him through 
           the apartment and into a distant room, where two officers are 
           removing a stack of boxes that have been concealing--

           AN OLD WOODEN CLOSET. It’s padlocked. Thomas and Hanson 
           exchange a glance. Then Thomas nods to the officer, who grabs 
           a bolt cutter and removes the padlock.

           CLONK - the doors swing open.

           Thomas and Hanson freeze as they see--

           The entire INSIDE of the closet is plastered with MAPS and 
           SKETCHES of what seems to be some kind of MILITARY FORTRESS. 
           Random notes and markings clutter the maps.

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Martin stares at the frozen Figure, still metamorphing before 
           his eyes. Maria steps up to him.
                                 MARIA
                        This is it. Don’t let him go.

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I... can’t, I...

                                 MARIA
                        Find a detail and lock on to it. 

           Martin tries to focus, but the Figure keeps CHANGING.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Walk around him.

           Martin walks around the frozen Figure. Breathing. Changing. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Look at his face, what does he look 
                        like?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        I can’t.

           The Figure flashes faster. Martin is losing the struggle.

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Thomas steps up to the closet, and grows pale when he 
           realizes that these are maps and sketches of--

                                 THOMAS
                        Fort Strong, Long Island. Press 
                        conference.

           Hanson stares at him. Then at his watch.

                                 HANSON
                        They just signed the treaty. They 
                        left the convention center eight 
                        minutes ago. Half the city’s out 
                        there.

           The size of the threat sinks in. Then they dash towards the 
           exit. Thomas grabs his radio on his way out and shouts--

                                 THOMAS (IN RADIO)
                        This is Thomas Bishop, we’re 
                        changing the route: Divert the N1-
                        motorcade away from the city and 
                        wait for my orders. We have a man 
                        strapped bomb en route to Long 
                        Island, repeat: Fort Strong is the 
                        second target. I want the area 
                        cleared of civilians, and every 
                        available officer on site. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THOMAS (IN RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        I want snipers on point, and guards 
                        on all entrances and exits, we’re 
                        on our way!

           --and then they’re gone.

           INT. BURNT-OUT CAFE, RESTROOM - EVENING

           Martin struggles to keep the frozen Figure from running off.

                                 MARIA
                        Come on, Martin, he’s right there, 
                        look at him. How old is he? Is he 
                        tall, small, fat, thin?

           Martin sweats. The Figure is FLASHING before his eyes.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        How long is his hair? What color? 
                        Does he have a beard? A scar? 
                        Tatoo?

           He succeeds in slowing down the constant transformation of--

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        His... clothes...

                                 MARIA
                        What about ’em?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It’s a... suit, it’s...

                                 MARIA
                        What kind of suit?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        It’s... rough?

                                 MARIA
                        Rough how?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        The fabric, it’s like...

           He shakes his head. He loses focus for a second, and the 
           Figure changes again. 

                                 MARIA
                        Hold on. Color. Cut. Patterns...

           He regains focus and then--

           WHITE STRIPES materialize around one of the Figure’s legs. 
           And then around the other. And then around his arms.
                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        Wait...

           The texture changes. The cut changes.  The shirt disappears.  
           And SOMETHING new appears on the Figure’s upper arm--

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        It’s not a suit. It’s...

           A BADGE.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        A uniform.

           Identical to the one we’ve seen on every SWAT OFFICER all 
           day.

                                 MARTIN CROSS (CONT’D)
                        A police uniform.

           THE SWAT TEAM UNIFORM finds it final form.

           Maria stares at Martin. She’s speechless.

           He meets her gaze, and can no longer uphold his concentration  
           on the frozen Figure. 

           The moment BREAKS and the uniformed bomber RUNS OFF and 
           disappears into the dark corridor.

           Maria and Martin are left behind. Alone. Afraid. And we--

                                                           SMASHCUT TO:

           EXT. FORT STRONG / HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

           The remains of an impressive fortress on Long Island - a 
           military installation from the late 19th century. It was  
           abandoned in the 1960s, but it still radiates power, 
           nostalgia and national romanticism.

           The Boston skyline lights up the horizon and makes this a 
           perfect venue for a symbolic handshake between 28 allied 
           nations.

           EXT. FORT STRONG - NIGHT

           SEARCHLIGHTS illuminate the old IRON CANNONS, pointed at the 
           dark sea. 

           A STAGE has been erected by the coast side. Behind a metal 
           railing is a deep drop to the dark waters below. 

           On the stage, A MICROPHONE awaits the guests of honor. 
           THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS have gathered in front of the stage  
           to support the speakers, defy their own fear, and show their 
           contempt for the bomb in Old Harbor. 

           And all around them - HUNDREDS OF SWAT OFFICERS do their 
           utmost to prevent a second bomb. 

           The officers all look the same. Dark uniforms. White stripes 
           on arms and legs. Badges on their upper arms.

           On a VIEW POINT high above, two SNIPERS take their place.

           An A.R.V. arrives, and another batch of SWAT OFFICERS jump 
           out, grab their equipment and run to their positions.

           The last of them stops outside the car and takes in the view.

           We recognize him as--

           MARCUS WOLFF. The same Swat Officer who helped Martin  
           outside the cafe in the opening scene. He looks around. At 
           the spectators, the stage, and at the microphone up there.

           Then he grabs his gun, puts on his helmet. Follows his 
           colleagues and disappears in the crowd.

           INT./EXT. THOMAS BISHOP’S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

           Thomas is behind the wheel - RACING through the night. Hanson 
           sits beside him. Thomas is shouting in his handsfree--

                                 THOMAS (ON HIS CELL PHONE)
                        Just keep the motorcade away from 
                        the Fort till we got him and remove 
                        him, understood? I want zero 
                        tolerance on anyone or anything 
                        suspicious, and get all civilians 
                        out of there as soon as you--
                            (beat)
                        What do you mean, you can’t clear 
                        the square!?

           Thomas’ cell BEEPS - incoming call on the line. He checks the 
           display, and--

                                 THOMAS (ON HIS CELL PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hang on.
                            (connects incoming call)
                        Yeah?

           INT. POLICE CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

           Elsewhere in the city, a patrol car is BLASTING through the 
           night. An officer is behind the wheel. Maria and Martin are 
           in the back seat. Maria speaks quickly. City lights 
           flickering over her face--
                                 MARIA (ON HER CELL PHONE)
                        It’s one of ours. It’s a cop.
                            (beat)
                        He found Simon Kirk in the files 
                        and used his name. He wore his 
                        uniform inside the cafe. He could 
                        walk right out of there and drive 
                        away in one of our cars, and he can 
                        be any one of the thousand men, you 
                        just sent to the Fort.
                            (beat)
                        He’s one of us, Thomas.

           Martin gives her a troubled look.

           INT. THOMAS BISHOP’S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

           Thomas grows pale as Maria’s words sink in.

           He blinks when he through the windshield sees - CHAOS.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Thomas’ car comes to a screeching halt in front of the 
           entrance to the fort. Their way is blocked by--

           HUNDREDS OF CARS with honking horns and revving engines. 
           People try to get in and out at the same time, causing a HUGE 
           TRAFFIC JAM. 

           Thomas and Hanson jump out and try to get a grasp of the 
           chaotic situation. Thomas looks up when--

           A police car arrives and Maria and Martin jump out. 

           The three meet in the midst of chaos.

                                 THOMAS
                        What’s he doing here?

                                 MARIA
                        He’s seen him.

           Thomas understands what she wants and looks at Martin.

                                 THOMAS
                        You think you could... recognize 
                        him if you see him again?

                                 MARTIN CROSS
                        He killed my wife.

           Martin struggles to keep his anger under control. Thomas 
           hesitates. Looks around. And then he nods.
                                 THOMAS
                        Come with me.

           Thomas leads Maria and Martin through the crowd. They stop at 
           the SECURITY GATE, where a group of GUARDS keep anyone from 
           entering or leaving. People complain and argue. 

           Thomas shouts to the CHIEF SECURITY GUARD, identifies himself 
           with his badge and bids him to--

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Let them in!

           The guard lets Maria and Martin through the gate and into the 
           crowded square, leading up to the stage. 

           Thomas stays outside and watches them disappear in the crowd.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Maria and Martin make their way through the CROWD of 
           civilians, waiting for the guests of honor to arrive. Most of 
           them cast worried glances at the--

           HORDES OF SWAT OFFICERS surrounding the square.

           Standing guard in one of the lines we find -- Marcus Wolff. 
           He has not yet seen Maria and Martin. And they have not yet 
           seen him.

           Marcus is staring at the stage, guarded by his colleagues. 
           It’s still empty. The microphone still awaits tonight’s key 
           speaker. Marcus clenches his weapon.

           BY THE SECURITY GATE -- Thomas catches a glimpse of Maria and 
           Martin moving through the crowd. He utters an order in his 
           radio; Stand By. 

           ON THE VIEW POINT -- one of the snipers receives the order. 
           He focuses his sight on -- Maria and Martin in the crowd.

           Maria lets Martin follow his own intuition. He moves swiftly 
           and with purpose. Searching for the man, who ruined his life.

           Martin’s eyes dart across the many faces in the square. They  
           flash by. His breathing is hard, his heartbeat uneven - THA-
           THUD... THA... THUD.

           He closes his eyes when another sound reaches him from 
           somewhere. The ominous SQUEAKING of old wooden boats. 

           He shakes it off, and forces himself to move on. 

           He recognizes a SWAT OFFICER in the crowd and stops him. 
           Examines his face. But it’s not him.
           He moves on and finds ANOTHER SWAT OFFICER. Martin grabs him 
           and turns him around. Not him either. Martin moves on, while 
           Maria tries to calm down the officer behind him. 

           Martin pushes onwards through the crowd - a dreamlike blur of 
           obscure faces all around him. Martin finds a third man, turns 
           him around and startles backwards. It’s not a man...

           It’s JULIE. After the explosion. She covers her scorched face 
           with a scorched hand. Her one remaining eye is staring out 
           between her black fingers. Around her wrist - the golden 
           bracelet.

           Martin shuts his eyes. Tries to repel the image. When he 
           finally dares to open his eyes again-- 

           Julie’s gone. Leaving--

           A free line of sight all the way through the crowd to--

           Marcus Wolff. Clenching his weapon.

           The two men make eye contact.

           Everything freezes. Time stands still.

           Martin feels DRAWN towards him, and is suddenly STRUCK by--

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           The OBSCURE FIGURE. Frozen in mid air. Staring right at us. 
           His face is still blurred.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Martin gets a sinking feeling. Marcus breaks eye contact and 
           looks away. Martin can’t take his eyes off him.

           ON THE VIEW POINT -- The sniper watches through his SCOPE. 
           Martin is surrounded. The sniper can’t get a clear shot, or 
           view of what’s going on. He reports in his radio--

           BY THE GATE -- Thomas receives the report, tries to locate 
           Martin in the crowd, and finally catches a glimpse of him--

           ON THE SQUARE -- Martin stares at Marcus. Who finally looks 
           up again, and stares right back at him. Martin is hit by 
           another FLASH when he suddenly remembers--

           EXT. BURNED OUT CAFE / MEMORY / MARTIN’S POV - DAY

           Martin Cross’s POV sails out into the blinding sunlight. 
           Dust, smoke and screaming everywhere.

           A BLURRED FIGURE approaches. His voice is a distant echo--
                                 SWAT OFFICER
                        YOU OKAY!?
                            (beat)
                        ARE YOU OKAY, SIR?

           The Swat Officer steps all the way up to us. And out of the 
           dreamlike fog. He looks us right in the eye, and Martin 
           finally recognizes--

           MARCUS WOLFF

           Dressed in his dark uniform. White stripes on arms and legs.

           And the police badge on his upper right arm. 

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Martin freezes. He raises his hand. With fury in his eyes. 
           And POINTS DIRECTLY AT MARCUS.

           Marcus blinks with surprise. Then gets a sinking feeling. He 
           closes his visor. And moves.

           Towards Martin. 

           A DRAMATIC CHASE COMMENCES! - Martin and Marcus fight their 
           way through the crowd, both heading directly for the other.

           Maria fails to keep up with Martin, and loses sight of him in 
           the chaotic crowd. She cries a warning after him, but Martin 
           is gone. She turns around and shouts back at--

           Thomas BY THE GATE. Thomas can’t hear her, but from her 
           desperate gestures he realizes that something’s horribly 
           wrong. He shouts an order in his radio and then throws 
           himself into the chaos.

           Marcus plows his way through the crowd. Clenching his gun.

           Martin forces his way towards him. Furious and desperate.

           FROM A HIGH ANGLE - the SNIPER SCOPE dances across the 
           square. Trying to catch sight of the two men. And failing.

           Marcus and Martin draw closer and closer to each other, when  
           suddenly--

           Martin’s gone. Marcus stops. His eyes dart across the many 
           faces in the crowd, but Martin is nowhere to be seen. Until--

           BAM! - Martin comes flying in from the side, SMASHES into 
           Marcus with great force, and KNOCKS him over in the dust.

           Marcus loses his helmet. It rolls off amongst the shocked 
           spectators, who instinctively pull back. 
           Maria and Thomas fight their way through the masses, trying 
           to reach--

           Martin who gains the upper hand and lets his fists rain down 
           on Marcus with vindictive rage. Martin is a driven man, but 
           he’s just a man up against--

           A machine. Marcus grabs his hand, twists it around, and 
           throws Martin to the ground. Martin grimaces as Marcus shoves 
           his face in the gravel.

           Marcus pulls his HANDGUN and presses it to the back of 
           Martin’s head.

           Martin tries to fight back, but Marcus holds him down. 
           Cocking the gun, biting his teeth and-- 

           BAM!!! - is struck in the back of his head with the butt of 
           another handgun. Marcus rolls his eyes. And for a beat he 
           just sits there. Then he falls over and...

           THUMP - lands unconscious in the dust. Right next to Martin.

           Everything goes quiet.

           Martin stares right into Marcus’s wide open eyes. For a 
           moment, Martin just lies there. Gasping for air. 

           Then A HAND comes down to help him up. Martin looks up at--

           THOMAS, standing above him. With his gun. Martin grabs his 
           hand, and Thomas helps him to his feet just as--

           Maria fights her way through the crowd and joins them. 
           Relieved. The three of them all look down at--

           Marcus. Lying unconscious in the dust. In his uniform.

           We slowly PULL UP above them. People have pulled away from 
           the fight, leaving a big, empty circle around Marcus.

           Four SWAT OFFICERS come running, grab the unconscious Marcus 
           by his arms and legs and quickly carry him towards the exit.

           Maria, Martin and Thomas don’t take their eyes off him till--

           Marcus is carried outside the square and into an awaiting 
           Armed Response Vehicle. It speeds off into the night.

           Martin, Maria and Thomas breathe a sight of relief when 
           suddenly--

           BOOOOOM! - a HUGE EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE SKY!

           Everyone SCREAMS in panic. Then they see the beautiful golden 
           light, raining from above and realize that the blast was--

           Fireworks. 
           More of it follows. Rockets swoosh to the sky and light up 
           the night. 

           All over the square, people clap and laugh with relief.

           Maria, Martin and Thomas exchange little smiles. It’s over.

           Thomas grabs his radio--

                                 THOMAS (IN RADIO)
                        This is Thomas Bishop. The Fort is 
                        secure. I repeat...
                            (beat)
                        We’ve got him.

           Thomas smiles a smile of recognition to Martin - and then to 
           Maria. She did it. Then he moves towards the exit, leaving--

           Maria and Martin behind. She smiles a tired smile. He exhales 
           deeply. She reaches out her hand. He looks at it. Hesitates a 
           second. Then he reaches out - and shakes her hand. A nod from 
           Maria. Thank you. A nod from Martin. You’re welcome.

           They both look up, when they hear--

           EXT. FORT STRONG, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A MOTORCADE arrives. A long line of BLACK CARS escorted by 
           police motorcycles. 

           BODYGUARDS open the doors of the first black car. TWO MEN in 
           suits climb out and take in the scenery.

           We recognize them as the US Secretary Of Defence ROBERT GATES 
           and The Secretary General of Nato ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN.

           Thomas steps up to Gates and gives him a quick brief of what 
           just happened. Gates listens, nods, and thanks Thomas.

           Then Gates and Fogh Rasmussen smile and wave to the 
           spectators in the square. Behind them, other black cars 
           arrive, and the remaining NATO STATE LEADERS step out - all 
           surrounded by heavy security. 

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Robert Gates takes the stage and waves to civilians and 
           press. The other state leaders stand in a line behind him. 

           Press cameras FLASH and light up the night.

           ON STAGE -- Gates’ PRESS SECRETARY walks up to him, whispers 
           something in his ear, and discretely signals a man in the 
           crowd down there. Their savior. 
           Gates spots -- Martin, still standing with Maria. Gates 
           signals Martin to come join them on stage.

           Martin exchanges a surprised look with Maria. Is it okay?

           Maria looks back at the security gate, where Thomas and 
           Hanson exchange smiles and relieved hand shakes. Maria nods 
           to Martin. He can take the stage. He deserves the acclaim.

           Martin heads for the staircase leading up to the stage. Up 
           there, Gates takes the mike and makes a grand introduction.

           Maria smiles to herself. Then she turns around. And heads for 
           the exit. Her job here is done.

           Martin stops by the staircase and watches Maria disappear. 
           She never looks back. 

           Then Martin looks up at Gates, finishing his introduction. 

           Martin hesitates. And closes his eyes.

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / MEMORY - DAY

           The OBSCURE FIGURE is washing his face.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Maria exits the security gate, nods to the guards, and leaves 
           the fort behind. Her eyes catch--

           A well dressed TROUBLED MAN, desperately trying to explain 
           something to the guards, who obviously won’t let him in. He 
           looks up when Maria passes and--

           Their eyes meet. 

           The Troubled Man gives up on the guards, runs over and tries 
           Maria instead--

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        Excuse me, are you... are you on 
                        this case? The bomb?

           She walks past him with a polite rejection.

                                 MARIA
                        All questions go to the press 
                        office down town.

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        I’m not...
                            (beat)
                        I think my wife was in there.
           She stops. And turns around. He’s handsome. Mid 40s. 
           Sympathetic looking. And clearly very anxious.

                                 TROUBLED MAN (CONT’D)
                        In the cafe. I think she was in 
                        there when it...

                                 MARIA
                        Did someone call you?

           He shakes his head.

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        I was in London, I just...

                                 MARIA
                        All relatives have been notified.

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        I know, but...

                                 MARIA
                        Don’t worry, I’m sure your wife is 
                        fine.

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        I know, it’s just...

           Maria starts walking again. 

                                 TROUBLED MAN (CONT’D)
                        Julie always calls.

           Maria stops. Freezes. And turns to face the Troubled Man.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Martin looks at the stage - Robert Gate waves him up.

           Martin takes a step up the stairs. And a second. And third. 

           EXT. FORT STRONG, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Maria walks back to the Troubled Man. Alert. 

                                 MARIA
                        Julie?

           He’s obviously desperate, and decides to open up to this 
           total stranger. 

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        I think she was... seeing someone. 
                        Someone else. I think... he did it. 
                        The bomb.
                                 MARIA
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t... catch your 
                        name?

                                 TROUBLED MAN
                        Oh, I’m sorry.

           The Troubled Man produces a PASSPORT.

                                 TROUBLED MAN (CONT’D)
                        My name is Martin Cross. I’m a 
                        pediatrician out in Beacon Hill.

           Everything. Freezes. In. Maria. When she stares from the 
           passport and back up at--

           THE REAL MARTIN CROSS. 

           She turns pale like a ghost. Staggers. And as he tries to 
           explain, she is STRUCK by SHOCKING FLASHES of--

           EXT. GAS STATION / FLASHBACK - DAY

           It’s raining cats and dogs. THE REAL MARTIN CROSS exits the 
           store, looks around and spots--

           JULIE, on her cell phone. Talking to someone. 

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        She’s been seeing him for months. 
                        Maybe longer.

           He watches her. Something dawns behind his eyes.

           INT. DARK BEDROOM / FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           THE REAL MARTIN CROSS and Julie lie naked in bed. After sex.  
           Silent intimacy.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        I planned to stay over in London 
                        but suddenly I was... afraid. 

           He reaches out and gently touches her cheek. Wants to get 
           closer. Julie smiles. A strained smile. And looks away. 

           INT. MARTIN CROSS’S APARTMENT / FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           THE REAL MARTIN CROSS is in the dark corridor. Through a half 
           open door, he can see his wife. Writing something in A BOOK.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        I went home to surprise her. She 
                        wasn’t there. I read her diary. 
                        She’d written... everything. 
           Julie hesitates when she senses that she’s being watched.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Maria stares at The Real Martin Cross.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS
                        They were meeting today. In that 
                        cafe.
                            (beat)
                        I don’t know if... she was in 
                        there? If he... used her?

           His voice cracks when he finally speaks his fear out loud.

           Maria turns around. Ever. So. Slowly. She looks all the way 
           across the crowded square and up at the stage, where--

           EXT. FORT STRONG, ON THE STAGE - NIGHT

           THE WITNESS takes his last step up on the stage.

           Robert Gates awaits. Ready to have his picture taken with the  
           one surviving hero of the Boston Bomb. A symbol. A perfect 
           Photo Op. Behind him - the line of foreign statesmen. 

           The Witness looks out at the crowded square. People are  
           applauding. He lets his eyes wander till they land on--

           MARIA. 

           Standing by the security gate. For a beat, they see only each 
           other. He sees that she sees. And understands. There’s a hint 
           of something in his eyes. A smile?

           Then he looks back at Robert Gates. And closes his eyes.

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / FLASHBACK - DAY

           The OBSCURE FIGURE is standing by the mirror, washing his 
           hands and face. An eerie gesture.

           He’s dressed in a police uniform, but as we slowly close in, 
           the clothes start to CHANGE once more. They cycle through new 
           shapes and colors, until they finally find their true form.

           It’s a suit. We recognize it. 

           The Figure turns off the faucet. And looks up. His face is 
           finally clear. His features finally visible. He is:

           THE WITNESS

           He looks at himself in the mirror. His eyes are dark. 
           Suddenly ANOTHER FIGURE steps up behind him. JULIE. Her hair 
           and clothes are rumpled. Her cheeks are red. She caresses him 
           with a smile and whispers--

                                 JULIE
                        I’m gonna do it.
                            (beat)
                        I’m leaving him. 

           He turns around and looks at her. Surprised. 

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m having a baby. We’re having a 
                        baby. 

           She holds her breath. Waiting for his reaction. 

                                 THE WITNESS
                        Yeah? That’s... amazing!

           He smiles. She laughs. They embrace. 

           INT. CAFE / FLASHBACK - DAY

           The QUARTER touches metal. And slides into the jukebox coin 
           slot. The hand it just left belongs to--

           The Witness. His gaze is distant. All around him, thirteen 
           guests laugh and chatter without a clue.

           EXT. BURNT-OUT CAFE / FLASHBACK - DAY

           CHAOS. SCREAMING. WAILING SIRENS. 

           The Witness steps outside the bombed out cafe. He looks 
           around the chaos. 

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        Julie’s diary says he’s a 
                        psychologist. Specialized in trauma 
                        and shock therapy.

           The Witness is escorted to his ambulance by Marcus Wolff. The 
           Witness gives him a look. Notices the BADGE on his upper arm.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM / FLASHBACK - DAY

           The Witness stands by the window, taking in the view. His eye 
           catches Maria’s reflection, when she enters behind him. 

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        He knows how people behave under 
                        pressure. 
           EXT. CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS PARK / FLASHBACK - EVENING

           The Witness runs towards the subway. He stops and looks back 
           over his shoulder just long enough for--

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        He knows how to... manipulate.

           --Thomas to catch sight of him. Then he runs underground.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM / FLASHBACK - EVENING

           The Witness is on the floor. Mimicking an epileptic seizure. 

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        And she told him everything about 
                        me.

           EXT. SURVEILLANCE CAMERA / FLASHBACK - EVENING

           A GRAINY BLOW UP of the surveillance tape from the break-in. 
           The shadowy figure approaches the door. And lets the camera 
           catch him on tape.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        He worked for the army. He treated 
                        traumatized vets. Knew the system.

           INT. SIMON KIRK’S APARTMENT / FLASHBACK  - EVENING

           SWAT OFFICERS move quickly through the dark apartment. Guns 
           and flashlights raised.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.)
                        His own son was a soldier. Julie 
                        wrote that he...

           Thomas and Hanson finds the newspaper clip and reads.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...took his own life.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM / FLASHBACK - EVENING

           The Witness crumples on the floor, leaning against the wall.

           He’s sobbing silently. Tormented by painful memories.

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           The Witness and Julie gently let go of each other. She fixes 
           her hair and clothes with a playful smile. Then she heads for 
           the door.
           He grabs her hand. Stopping her. She looks back at him for a 
           beat - what?

           EXT. FORT STRONG, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The Real Martin Cross has tears in his eyes now.

                                 THE REAL MARTIN CROSS
                        I just want to know... if she 
                        was... part of this.

           Maria never answers. She just turns away from him - and RUNS.

           Back trough the gate. Towards the stage.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, ON THE STAGE - NIGHT

           ON THE STAGE Robert Gates reaches out to shake hands with The 
           Witness. In front of the stage, PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS get ready 
           to capture the symbolic handshake. 

           The Witness discretely loosens a small BUTTON from his right 
           cuff, and hides it in the palm of his hand.

           An almost invisible COPPER THREAD runs from the button and up 
           the sleeve of his beige suit.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Maria FIGHTS her way through the crowd. Shouting desperate 
           cries of warning.

           In the FAR END of the square - Thomas hears her. He spots her 
           running though the masses. And sees where she’s heading--

           The stage. The Witness. Hesitating in front of Robert Gates.

           Thomas grows pale.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, ON THE STAGE - NIGHT

           The Witness walks towards the smiling Secretary Of Defense. 

           He raises his hand for the handshake. Concealing the small 
           wired button in his palm.

           The two men meet center stage, camera flashes light up the 
           night, and their fingertips just touch, when--

           MARIA comes running up the stairs. Shouting. Out of breath.

           The Witness stops. Turns around. And looks at Maria.

           For a moment - their eyes meet. Time stands still.
           And he hesitates.

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / FLASHBACK - DAY

           The Witness is holding Julie’s hand. Hesitating.

           Then he gives et a little squeeze... and lets go.

           HER HAND SLIPS OUT OF HIS

           Julie sends him an uncertain smile. Everything okay? He makes 
           a reassuring gesture - everything’s fine, he’ll be right 
           there. She turns around. And disappears.

           Through the door. And into the dark.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, ON THE STAGE - NIGHT

           Maria stares at The Witness. They’re just ten feet apart.

           He looks back at Robert Gates, who grows pale at the sight of 
           them. What’s going on?

           EXT. FORT STRONG, MAIN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Thomas stares at the stage. Can’t believe it. Won’t believe 
           it. Then he does - and screams an order into his radio.

           ON THE HIGH VIEW POINT -- the snipers receive the order and 
           adjust their aim.

           EXT. FORT STRONG, ON THE STAGE - NIGHT

           The Witness stares at Maria, tries to break eye contact, but 
           hesitates for one second too long, and--

           .....sssssSSSSSSLAM! 

           His head JOLTS at the sudden impact.

           He stays on his feet. Doesn’t understand what happened. Until 
           he suddenly feels it: Blood in his eye. In his face. Hair. 
           Blood everywhere. He’s hit. In the head.  

           The Witness staggers one step. Two steps. And--

           BAM, BAM!

           --takes two more DIRECT HITS in the chest. 

           Everyone on the Fort is in shock. For one second. Then--

           CHAOS BREAKS LOOSE
           Secret Service Agents instantly surround and secure Robert 
           Gates and his Nato colleagues. 

           On the square below -- people PANIC. Scream and run in every  
           direction.

           The Witness reels backwards. Leans against the metal railing. 
           Coughs blood.

           Heavy breathing.

           Uneven heartbeat.

           THA-THUD.... THA.... THUD.

           Through the blood in his eye he sees--

           Maria. Still standing ten feet from him.

           The two of them eye each other for a long silent moment.  
           Taking no note of the chaos around them.

           Then, The Witness reaches out for her, smiles through all the 
           blood, and--

           FALLS BACKWARDS. OVER THE RAILING.

           Maria jumps forward, trying to catch him, but too late. 

           He’s gone.

           Maria stares down the steep cliff.

           Everything is quiet.

           EXT. FREE FALL - NIGHT

           The Witness falls silently through the cold night.

           We stay with him as the world flashes by. In his eyes we see--

           INT. CAFE, RESTROOM / FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           The Witness is alone in the restroom. Staring at the dark 
           doorway, where Julie disappeared.

           The smile vanishes from his eyes. And is replaced by 
           something else. Cold-blooded resolution.

           He leans his forehead against the mirror. And finds something 
           in his pocket.

           A DETONATOR.

           He stares at it. Then he places his thumb on the trigger. 
           Looks at himself in the mirror. And closes his eyes.
           EXT. FREE FALL - NIGHT

           The Witness keeps his eyes wide open - all the way down.

           Snow-clad rock THUNDERS UP from below.

           Just before he hits it, he clenches his hand into a fist and--

           EXT. FORT STRONG, ON THE STAGE - NIGHT

           Maria looks away, as--

           A SHOCK WAVE OF FLAMING WHITE LIGHT BURSTS UPWARDS, WHEN--

           The TX1 in The Witness’ beige suit detonates. With a BLAST 
           thirty times more powerful than any plastic explosive.

           TURNING NIGHT INTO DAY - for one deafening moment.

           And then... everything goes quiet.

           Maria stares down at the dark waters.

           Thomas comes running. Shocked. Out of breath. And relieved 
           that she’s still alive. He steps up next to her. And looks 
           down the chasm.

           She reaches out for him. Never taking her eyes off the deep.

           He takes her hand. And holds it tight.

           Behind them -- everything is chaos.

           But Maria and Thomas never sees or hears it. They just stand 
           there, holding each other’s hands. Staring into the abyss. 

           Finally, something echoes in the distance. Music. A choir.

                                 CHOIR
                        Eternal Father, strong to save, 
                        Whose arm hath bound the restless 
                        wave. Who bidst the mighty ocean 
                        deep.

           The singing continues as we slowly pull back. Out over the 
           sea. Into the dark silence of the cold winter’s night.

                                 CHOIR (CONT’D)
                        Its own appointed limits keep; O, 
                        hear us when we cry to Thee. For 
                        those in peril on the sea!

           We leave Maria and Thomas by the railing. Alone. Together.

           Until they fade away in the falling snow. And we finally--

                                                              FADE OUT:
