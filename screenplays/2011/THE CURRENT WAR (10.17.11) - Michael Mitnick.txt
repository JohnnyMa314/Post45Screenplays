           EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK, 1903 – AFTERNOON

           Winter.

           A lone MAN in a wool coat crosses the CONEY ISLAND boardwalk.  

           He passes hibernating rides and shuttered booths, promising 
           Freaks!, Tattooed Lady!, Werewolf Boy!, Wizards!

           The MAN clutches his lapels, fighting the freezing wind. From 
           a steely sky, fat snowflakes float onto the MAN’s grey hair. 

           The MAN is THOMAS EDISON.

           TITLE: “THE CURRENT WAR”

           (Words appear as a fluttering silent film title card.)

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND FROM ABOVE – CONTINUOUS

           A far shot: Everything shut down – the red wooden coaster, 
           the jumping horses, the shooting galleries, food stalls...

           EXT. CIRCULAR WOODEN PLATFORM – CONTINUOUS 

           Rounding a corner, EDISON arrives at a wooden stage. At the 
           center of this platform is an ELEPHANT. 

           The ELEPHANT shivers in the snow and flakes settle onto its 
           eyelashes. It tries to blink them away.

           Ropes as thick as forearms have been thrown over the 
           ELEPHANT, firmly tethering it to the wooden stage.

           Then, a long shot of just the small man and monstrous beast. 

           An unspoken salutation.

           A deafening train whistle sounds.

           TITLE: “23 YEARS EARLIER”

           EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE, 1880 – SUNDOWN 

           The roar of a locomotive as it blazes through farmland. 

           Burnt orange sunlight gasps over the treetops.

           Pistons churning, the engine spews black smoke into the air 
           and along the tops of three gorgeous crimson railcars. 
           INT. A PRIVATE RAILCAR – CONTINUOUS

           Inside are plush velvet benches, uncorked bottles of Moët et 
           Chandon, and fifty or so of the WEALTHIEST MEN ON EARTH.

           They are finely dressed FAT CATS, each at least fifty pounds 
           overweight. They sport beards, moustaches, muttonchops, etc.

           EXT. THE WINDOWS OF THE THREE RAILCARS – CONTINUOUS

           A row of top hats through the windows of the railcars as the 
           train steams deeper and deeper out of civilization.

           One particular FAT CAT looking out his window at the New 
           Jersey farmland with vague repulsion. 

           INT. THE PRIVATE RAILCAR - CONTINUOUS

           The train stops and the FAT CATS are thrown forward. 

           INT. THE PRIVATE RAILCAR - CONTINUOUS

           Materializing from nowhere, FRANCIS, a blonde kid of 25, 
           pokes his beaming, dimpled face into the aisle – –

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Chipper as hell.)
                        Gentlemen, welcome to Menlo Park! 

           His face disappears.

           The FAT CATS exchange glances, and because there are no other 
           options, they reluctantly collect their belongings...

           EXT. NEW JERSEY DIRT ROAD – CONTINUOUS

           Six carriages bump down a dirt road, Top Hats bobbing.

           EXT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - CONTINUOUS

           A horse’s foot clops down in the dust and the camera pans up 
           to reveal a LABORATORY – a whitewashed two-story, jumbo barn. 
           A warehouse wherein miracles are born. 

           In the distance, the sun is sliding down the tree trunks and 
           disappears.

           INT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - CONTINUOUS

           The cavernous workroom has been converted into a banquet 
           hall. The walls are outfitted with scientific machinery – 
           tools, beakers, twisted pipes, etc.
           The worktables are covered with white tablecloths, 
           candelabras, silver, and china.

           The FAT CATS sit up and down the tables, dining on Sirloin, 
           gleaming Lobsters, Baked Alaska and free flowing Champagne. 

           The waiters bumble. It’s almost as though these are slob 
           scientists masquerading as waiters...

           One FAT CAT, however, isn’t imbibing and is, instead, peering 
           around him at the walls packed full of scientific equipment. 
           There is a spark of curiosity in this man’s eyes. 

           This man is GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE.

           One FAT CAT, mouth full of lobster meat, manages to snag the 
           sleeve of a passing FRANCIS–

                                 FAT CAT W/ LOBSTER MOUTH
                        Where is he?

                                 FRANCIS
                        I’m sure I just saw him over the by 
                        the – oh excuse me one moment–

           FRANCIS breaks free from the FAT CAT’s grasp and escapes. The 
           FAT CAT turns to look, though he's being given the runaround.

           INT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - LATER

           In a dissolve that makes the men seem like ghosts at a dinner 
           party, the FAT CATS are now satiated and drunk.

           They are impatient now and a din grows with strains of “Where 
           the hell is He?” and “Do you know who I am?,” etc. And it is 
           at this exact moment of total impatience that He, of course, 
           bursts through the door. 

           He is visibly younger on this night – an electric current in 
           his eyes. Dressed like a sloppy bum, his hair is askew. The 
           room falls breathlessly silent.

           We see WESTINGHOUSE’s gaze at EDISON – like that of a little 
           boy seeing, in person, his very favorite ballplayer.

                                 EDISON
                        Follow me.

           EDISON spins and exits through door. The FAT CATS are 
           frustrated but have no choice.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You’ll want to bring the candles.
           Silver candelabras are snagged from tables.

           EXT. CORNFIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Fifty of the Richest Men on the Planet are stumbling through 
           the uneven dirt of the cornfield. 

           These Captains of Industry, who have never touched dirt, are 
           now ankle-deep in mud. Tuxedos sullied, bespoke shoes ruined. 
           It's an unusually cold fall night and they are anxious. In 
           the darkness, eyes strain to follow EDISON.

                                 EDISON
                        This way, boys!

           A PARTICULARLY ROTUND FAT CAT, stops a moment, puffing. 

           EXT. THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, NEW JERSEY - CONTINUOUS

           A shot from above of circles: top hats, bellies and butts, 
           all alone in a dark cornfield – 30 sq. feet containing 70% of 
           the world’s wealth.

                                 EDISON
                        Your candles, please.

           Hesitant looks and then, one-by-one, the candles are blown.

           The PARTICULARLY ROTUND FAT CAT is shaking his head ‘no.’ 
           WESTINGHOUSE looks over at him – the one not obeying orders. 
           A different FAT CAT nudges the PARTICULARLY ROTUND one in the 
           ribs. Begrudgingly, the last candle is extinguished.

           Black.

                                 EDISON’S VOICE
                        And God said...

           The sound of a heavy metal crank. Then, a roaring generator! 

           A FIELD OF LIGHT

           Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop...

           Rows and rows of light bulbs the size of cantaloupes, like 
           falling dominoes in succession, are brought to pure life.

           The bulbs stand on tall wooden poles. Rows and rows glowing 
           white orbs disappear into the horizon.

           It isn’t a cornfield – it’s a field of light.
           A pan across the faces of the rich men, their mouths 
           comically agape – their bushy white eyebrows raised.

           In their eyes – the reflection of the field. On their faces – 
           the recognition that they’ve just seen an absolute miracle. 

           WESTINGHOUSE turns away from the miracle, looking behind the 
           men and off to the side where FRANCIS stands next to a metal 
           generator, reading ‘EDISON,’ in beautiful red script.

                                 EDISON
                        I trust you brought your 
                        checkbooks?

           The FAT CATS burst into a roar that overtakes the roar of the 
           generator. They clamor, rushing EDISON with their checkbooks.

           Opportunity!

           INT. THE HOME OF WESTINGHOUSE, PITTSBURGH - DAY

           Tranquility. 

           The wallpaper is a decadent, dark green paisley. A Civil War 
           musket hangs on the wall.

           WESTINGHOUSE stands beside a green billiards table, looking 
           down at a the green felt where one of EDISON’s large bulbs 
           sits. There’s a baby blue silk ribbon tied around the metal. 

           WESTINGHOUSE is impeccably dressed, in a black coat and 
           starched shirt. Black bow tie. A bushy brown moustache 
           connects to mutton chops. His hair is neatly combed. His face 
           is like that of a child who never lost a drop of curiosity. 

           WESTINGHOUSE nudges the glass gift. It pirouettes.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                             (Trying to speak.)
                        You...uh. I’ve been noticing. Um.

           WESTINGHOUSE taps the bulb again, nervously. It spins.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        So. Mr. Ames has spoken with you 
                        four distinct times about 
                        your...problem.

           He pulls a glass of water from a pocket of the pool table and 
           takes a swallow.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Your problem with alcohol.
           Across the table is revealed an older man in shirt and vest. 
           White hair and wrinkled brow. Sort of a wise rabbit. Beside 
           him is a much younger WOMAN, dressed up. She’s quite lovely.

                                 WOMAN
                        Mr. Westinghouse, it’s true that he 
                        likes to have him a cold drink at 
                        the end of a hard day of work, but, 
                        see, at the end of his hard day of 
                        work, I also got me nine children.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Nine?

                                 WOMAN
                        Peter, Sam, Hannah, Darlene–

                                 MAN
                        Beatrice, Andrew, Sarah Alice–

                                 WOMAN
                        And Nathan.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        That’s eight.

                                 WOMAN
                        Baby Zoe. Nine. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Nine.

                                 MAN AND WOMAN
                        Nine. 

                                 MAN
                        And my wife, she’s got another 
                        coming. 

                                 WOMAN
                        We were gonna name him 
                        after...after you. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        But, but sir you’ve come to work 
                        intoxicated. Your negligence–

                                 MAN
                        One more chance, Mr. Westinghouse. 
                        Please. Don’t make me beg for my 
                        job. I struggle. I pray to the lord 
                        for help every day. But don’t make 
                        me beg for my job.
           A silence as WESTINGHOUSE looks to his dirty fingernails in 
           thought. He looks up.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        One more chance.

                                 MAN
                        No! 

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh for Pete’s sake, George! 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Was that good?

                                 MAN 
                        Was that good? Was that good? No! 
                        No, that was not good.

           The MAN is MR. FRANK POPE, WESTINGHOUSE’s friend, mentor, and 
           employee. The WOMAN is WESTINGHOUSE’s spunky wife MARGUERITE.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        He does have two children, right?

                                 POPE
                        It doesn’t matter if he just gave 
                        birth to a litter of kittens. He’s 
                        slowing down progress. He’s putting 
                        the other men at risk. 

           MARGUERITE walks to her husband, putting a hand on his chest.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Would you rather be nice or right?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Both.

           MARGUERITE smiles. POPE and picks up the bulb, studying it.

                                 POPE
                        Quick – was it like we thought?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        It was a field of light...growing 
                        out of the ground like corn. 
                        Marguerite, it was the most 
                        beautiful thing...

                                 POPE
                        Ha! What’d I tell ya! Who knows him 
                        better than me, huh?
                                 MARGUERITE
                        So are we going to invest?

           WESTINGHOUSE stares at the bulb. He shakes his head ‘no.’

                                 POPE
                        No!? George, dollars will spew out 
                        of the earth like oil.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I looked over the paperwork and...

                                 POPE
                        And?

           A knock at the door. WESTINGHOUSE takes the bulb from POPE.

                                 POPE (CONT’D)
                        One minute!

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I need to talk with Edison. Send an 
                        invitation. A dinner.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Oh a dinner! With Thomas Edison 
                        himself? How fabulous!

                                 POPE
                        Trust me, Edison can’t be bothered 
                        to take a shower let alone–

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        He’ll take the meeting. Say his 
                        Electric Company depends on it.

           The door opens and a MAN, 40’s, enters. He’s got the saggy 
           face of a drunk. In his arms, he carries two babies...

                                 POPE
                        Good god. 

           POPE and MARGUERITE exit as WESTINGHOUSE greets the man– 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Uh...Thank you...all...for coming.

           EXT. FILTHY STREETS OF BUFFALO, NEW YORK - DAY

           WILLIAM KEMMLER, a prickly mess of a man, pushes a rickety 
           produce cart along a steaming rundown street. 

                                 KEMMLER
                        Apples. Apples. Apples.
           He lets the cart alone for a moment, reaching into his back 
           pocket to pull a whiskey flask. He drinks. Looking back at 
           his cart, he sees a horse helping himself to apples.

                                 KEMMLER (CONT’D)
                             (Pushing away the head.)
                        Outta…get yer…

           A little girl approaches KEMMLER like he’s a wild lion.

           KEMMLER removes his hat and selects a good apple. He polishes 
           it on his shirt hands the apple to the girl. She takes it, 
           smiles, and moves on. KEMMLER lifts the cart and continues.

                                 KEMMLER (CONT’D)
                        Apples. Apples.

           INT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - DAY

           The laboratory is half-restored. On the two laboratory-long 
           wooden tables, the plates and stained table clothes are now 
           sharing space with burners, magnifiers, boilers, wiring, etc.

           EDISON, enjoying a piece of blackberry pie, sits next to a 
           small BOY, 6, eating pie in exactly the same way as the 
           inventor – same hand, same twist of the wrist.

           In the background are young men at work, testing the density 
           of various metals, measuring fluids, etc. Directly behind 
           Edison, at the other long table is FRANCIS, entering check 
           amounts into a ledger. EDISON addresses MATTHEW, an 
           assistant, who is filling out paperwork.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Headquarters...Menlo Park?

                                 EDISON
                        Yes. No.

           He pops a huge forkful of pie into his mouth.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                             (Pie falling out.)
                        Manhattan. The Manhattan office.

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s not even set-up yet.

           EDISON turns, addressing a young man in the distance.

                                 EDISON
                        Charlie! Set-up the Manhattan 
                        Office! Make it look professional!
                                 CHARLIE
                        What does that mean?!

                                 EDISON
                        I don’t know. Carpets...or? I don’t 
                        know. Carpets?!

           EDISON takes a bite off the BOY’s plate.

           CARSON, a kind-eyed, older man enters the lab. He wears a 
           cheap suit and hat. He carries a suitcase.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Tom?

                                 MATTHEW
                        And...I guess all that’s left is 
                        the official name.

           EDISON crooks his head and glares at MATTHEW as if to say, 
           “You know what the name will be, dummy.”

                                 MATTHEW (CONT’D)
                             (Smiling and writing.)
                        ‘Edison Electric Company’

                                 EDISON
                             (Hands to his heart.)
                        Ahhhh!

           EDISON ruffles the BOY’s hair.

                                 FRANCIS
                        We’ve only got about half.

                                 EDISON
                        HALF?! All these fat cats and half?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Half. You know how much copper 
                        you’ll need just for one city? 
                        We’re going to haveta ask you-know-
                        who for the rest.

           EDISON shrinks in his seat. He tosses down the fork.

           CARSON approaches, hesitantly.

                                 CARSON
                        Mr...Edison?

                                 EDISON
                        Queen Victoria.
           EDISON retrieves his fork. Then, an angry bite of pie.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                             (Pointing to the BOY.)
                        This is also Mr. Edison. You mean 
                        him?

                                 CARSON
                        I’m...I’m Carson Schmidt? 

                                 EDISON
                        Is that a question?

                                 CARSON
                        I was offered a position.

                                 EDISON
                        What kind of position? Sitting? 
                        Standing? Like this–

           He thrusts his hands in the air like a ‘V.”

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Or this.

           He thrusts his fists forward, like he’s pulling something.

                                 CARSON
                        I’m Carson Schmidt. I was offered–

                                 EDISON
                        Christ. How old are you?

                                 CARSON

           A murmur from the younger men at the laboratory.

                                 EDISON
                        Who’d you speak with?

                                 CARSON
                        Well...You. I wrote to you and...
                             (Fumbling, he produces a 
                              letter.)
                        ...You said I might come work for 
                        you and...

           EDISON takes the paper, squinting.

                                 EDISON
                        Uhuh-Uhuh-Uhuh-Uhuh.

           EDISON stands and walks around the tables, CARSON follows.
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t remember any of this. 
                        Probably a forgery. A forgery boys! 

                                 CARSON
                        I traveled from...from North 
                        Carolina? 

                                 EDISON
                        Again, is that a question?

           Shots of EDISON’s employees grinning at one another, they’ve 
           been through this hazing. Some start to clear the tables. 
           They know what’s coming... EDISON and CARSON are now at the 
           heads of the two long tables.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        How are your legs?

                                 CARSON
                        Excuse me?

                                 EDISON
                        If I repeat everything twice, I’ll 
                        say only half as much. I asked, 
                        “How are your legs?”

           EDISON nods to MATTHEW and MATTHEW lifts the BOY from his 
           seat, away from the table.

                                 CARSON
                        They are. Fine? They’re fine. 

           EDISON heaves himself up onto one of the tables. He nods to 
           CARSON. CARSON hesitates, then puts down his suitcase, and 
           hoists himself up onto the other table.

                                 EDISON
                        Beat me down the table and I’ll 
                        hire you.

                                 CARSON
                        But your letter, sir, I thought you 
                        already offered a job?

                                 EDISON
                        Another question and one year ago, 
                        this world was lit by fire. Times 
                        change my good fellow. Now do you 
                        want this job or not?
                             (Addressing the 30 or so 
                              other employees.)
                        Boys?
                                 EVERYONE
                        One! Two! Three!

           EDISON and CARSON take off, running the lengths of their 
           respective tables! They jump over glass beakers and china 
           plates. CARSON slips a little.

           EDISON giggles to himself as the leaps over a silver pitcher, 
           heaving a bit, and, he too, slips a little on a stray napkin.

           The WORKERS whoop and holler, drumming their hands on the 
           sides of the tables as the men RUN. The little BOY laughs.

                                 EDISON
                        C’mon Carson!! Put some grease into 
                        it!!!

           They’re neck-and-neck! EDISON suddenly goes down, sliding on 
           the table cloth, plates, silver, and bottles falling to the 
           ground and shattering.

           He rides the tablecloth to the very end of the table where he 
           falls onto the floor, laughing. The BOY runs from MATTHEW’s 
           arms and jumps on his father, who throws his arms around the 
           kid and playfully wrestles.

           CARSON has stopped, 3/4 of the way down HIS table. He’s 
           confused and speechless. EDISON suddenly bounds to his feet. 
           He rests a palm on the BOY’s head, using him like a cane. The 
           other hand he extends to CARSON. CARSON bends and shakes.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I applaud Mr. Schmidt. He got up on 
                        the table. The man actually got up 
                        on the table. All of you could 
                        learn a lesson from him.
                             (To CARSON.)
                        You’re the first one to do that 
                        since Francis.

           FRANCIS looks away, bashfully.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Menlo Park, Mr. Carson. 
                        I’m Thomas Alva Edison and we’re in 
                        the business of building miracles.

           All the boys applaud and holler. It is raucous and inspiring. 
           CARSON looks around and smiles broadly in disbelief. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        Not to ruin this touching moment 
                        but we’re still short. You’re going 
                        to have proposition Beelzebub.
                                 EDISON
                        No.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Milt, where is Morgan this week?

           A red-haired, round employee flips through a hand-made book, 
           eyes quickly scanning a column.

                                 MILT
                        Carnegie...Frick...Mellon...Morgan. 
                        Washington. Meeting with the 
                        President. Deregulation. 

                                 CARSON
                             (To FRANCIS.)
                        How does he know J.P. Morgan’s 
                        schedule?

           FRANCIS smiles and shrugs, implying illegal activities.

                                 EDISON
                        If you’re going to visit a snake, 
                        might as well go to a swamp. 
                        Well...

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        As Jesus said before they strung 
                        him up on the cross.....”fuck.”

           INT. CARRIAGE ON THE STREETS OF PITTSBURGH - DAY

           WESTINGHOUSE, clean as always and impeccably dressed, sits on 
           the leather bench. He’s holding a large notepad and has his 
           fountain pen nib resting on the corner of the paper. 
           MARGUERITE sits by his side.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        I spoke with Mr. Edison’s assistant 
                        this morning. Oh, I’m thrilled!

           She looks at her husband, lost in thought. His pen streams 
           out a pool of ink.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong George?

           On the paper are some physics equations, some with ‘check 
           marks,’ others crossed out. WESTINGHOUSE draws a box, then 
           two lines from either side.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        You have breakfast on your face.
           MARGUERITE picks something from WESTINGHOUSE’s moustache. She 
           can’t get it off.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        It’s really stuck in your... 

           She gets it free, tosses it out the window then kisses him on 
           the cheek. WESTINGHOUSE drops the nib again on the box and 
           thinks.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Will Edison be like the papers make 
                        him out to be? I’ll need a new 
                        dress. New draperies. Which means 
                        new rugs. Two days – Oh George. 
                        You’ve really sprung this on me. 
                        Will you at least ask your men to 
                        find out his favorite foods?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                             (Absently.)
                        He’s just a man like you or me.

           MARGUERITE smiles at her distracted husband. A BUMP of the 
           carriage and WESTINGHOUSE’s head hits the top of the 
           carriage. He looks up at the roof, surprised. Then, back to 
           the paper.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Hmmmm.

           EXT. THE GRAND ESTATE OF GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE - NIGHT

           A soaring mansion, surrounded by woods and gardens.

           INT. BEDROOM OF WESTINGHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Darkness. Then, a gas lamp is suddenly lit. It's a stately 
           bedroom - gold, ornate fixtures and white silk bedding. Heavy 
           drapes. In two beds, side-by-side, are WESTINGHOUSE and 
           MARGUERITE. 

                                 MARGUERITE
                             (Waking up.)
                        George? George what is it?

           WESTINGHOUSE is clamoring for his fountain pen.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        George? What’s the matter?

           WESTINGHOUSE falls out of bed and hurriedly pats down the 
           pockets of his coat, hanging from a valet. He finds a pen. 
                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        George!

           WESTINGHOUSE unscrews the cap of the fountain pen and, having 
           no paper at hand, sinks to the floor on his knees and begins 
           to sketch out an idea in ink onto the bedsheet.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        George!! Those were brought in from 
                        Egypt! George! What are you doing?!

           WESTINGHOUSE can't stop - he's on a roll. 

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        George...

           MARGUERITE’s scowl melts into a reluctant smile. 
           WESTINGHOUSE, imbued with inspiration, races to jot down his 
           idea before it fades away. A shot from above the bed reveals 
           a blue-print taking shape – a bleeding, ink schematic that 
           tattoos the white bedsheet.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                             (Laughing.)
                        Well, at least this means I can go 
                        shopping.

           WESTINGHOUSE doesn't take notice. He’s busy. Creating.

           INT. TRAIN TO WASHINGTON, D.C. - EARLY MORNING

           EDISON sits in a private car. With him are his son DASH, the 
           boy from the laboratory, his daughter DOT, 5, and his wife 
           MARY – a delicately beautiful blonde.

           Also in the car are FRANCIS and CARSON, the new employee. 
           EDISON stares out the window. MARY bounces DOT up and down. 
           FRANCIS briefs CARSON on working for EDISON.

                                 MARY
                        Are you excited to meet the 
                        President of the United States?

                                 DOT
                        Yes.

                                 EDISON
                        Ask her if she’s excited to meet 
                        J.P. Morgan.

           EDISON leans into the girl.
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        He looks like an ogre! His nose is 
                        BIG and BRIGHT RED, like a cherry. 
                        You’ll wanna pop it in your mouth!

                                 MARY
                        Don’t say that! 
                             (To DOT.)
                        Don’t say anything about his nose. 
                        Do you understand?

           EDISON pulls at his collar. He’s dressed nicely. 

                                 EDISON
                        Mary, why in the hell do I have to 
                        dress like a monkey?

                                 MARY
                        Oh you look handsome. Finally.

                                 EDISON
                        Finally. Ho, ho, ho! Finally...

                                 FRANCIS
                             (To CARSON.)
                        He gets distracted VERY easily. 
                        Always direct the conversation back 
                        to the issue at hand.

                                 EDISON
                             (To MARY.)
                        This is pathetic. Should I have my 
                        hat in my hands when I beg?

                                 FRANCIS
                             (To CARSON.)
                        He’ll try to skip meetings – keep 
                        him on track. Remind him about the 
                        Westinghouse meeting.

                                 EDISON
                        Or maybe I should place the hat on 
                        the rug and do a jig?

                                 MARY
                        Hush.

                                 FRANCIS
                             (To CARSON.)
                        Everyone lives and dies for his 
                        approval. Word to the wise – don’t. 
                        Just do good work. If he doesn’t 
                        say anything, that means you’re 
                        doing fine.
                                 EDISON
                             (In a funny voice.)
                        Pleeeeease Mister Money Man, 
                        pleeeeease gimme some of your gold 
                        so I can do something actually god 
                        damned important.

           DASH and DOT giggle.

                                 MARY
                        Your words, Tom. Please. They’re 
                        children.

                                 EDISON
                        I’m sorry about the swearing. I’m 
                        god damn sorry.

           DASH giggles.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                             (In the funny voice, 
                              grabbing his head.)
                        Damn it!

           The CHILDREN and MARY laugh. FRANCIS is looking over and 
           breaks a grin – he loves the man.

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Snow falls on Washington. On the front steps of The White 
           House stand the coalition.

                                 CARSON
                        Don’t forget, Mr. Edison, we’re 
                        stopping to meet Westinghouse on 
                        the way back.

           EDISON seems not to hear. A door opens. They’re ushered in.

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A MANSERVANT escorts them into a magnificent drawing room 
           with grand piano, paintings, and priceless sculptures.

                                 MANSERVANT
                        Of course, Mrs. Edison. The 
                        President and Mr. Morgan are 
                        finishing a meeting. Lunch will be 
                        served shortly. May I get you 
                        anything while you wait? 
                             (Smiling at the children.)
                        Hot chocolate perhaps?
                                 DASH
                        Hot chocolate!

                                 MARY
                        Thank you.

           The MANSERVANT exits. EDISON apes his voice.

                                 EDISON
                        Hawwwt Chocolit, perhapthhhhhh?

           The CHILDREN laugh. 

                                 MARY
                        Tom, we’re in The White House.

                                 EDISON
                        Paint it green and let’s have some 
                        yucks.

           SERVANTS enter silver trays carrying mugs of hot chocolate 
           and stacks of gingerbread.

                                 DOT
                        Gingerbread!

           The CHILDREN are served and everyone takes cookies.

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Mouth full.)
                        Tom, this is important. By this 
                        point, Morgan knows you’re...not so 
                        good with money.

                                 EDISON
                             (To CARSON.)
                        I have a tiny bad habit of losing 
                        oodles of money–

                                 FRANCIS
                        Because he invents and then drags 
                        his feet on the way to market. If 
                        we did just one thing at a time–

                                 EDISON
                        No. Damn damn. No Francis. Thirty-
                        things at a time! I’m building a 
                        Flying Machine.  Flying machine!

           The MANSERVANT returns.

                                 MANSERVANT
                        Lunch is served.
                                 EDISON
                        Tell them to wait.

                                 MANSERVANT
                        I–

                                 EDISON
                        I’m not ready yet.

           Everyone is quiet. The MANSERVANT’s mouth is open in surprise 
           protest. No one tells The President to wait.

                                 MARY
                        Tom!

           EDISON holds up one finger as if to say, “Wait.” They all 
           stand still. EDISON looks around the room. And whistles. He 
           taps his foot on the floor. His eyes take in the rococo 
           chandelier. He raises a brow in appreciation. Then – 

                                 EDISON
                        OK now I’m ready. Let’s go.

           EXT. YELLOW OVAL ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           A door opens onto The Yellow Oval Room. There’s a Christmas 
           Tree covered in silver ornaments. A bearded, smiling man 
           stands next to the tree, HARRISON. Another figure is backlit 
           by huge windows, JP MORGAN. Upon spotting the tree, the 
           children rush inside.

                                 MARY
                        Come back!

           INT. YELLOW OVAL ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON approaches The President.

                                 HARRISON
                        Good-looking children.

                                 EDISON
                        Mary’s fault, not mine. My wife–

           MARY and HARRISON shake.

                                 HARRISON
                        Delighted. She might be your most-
                        impressive miracle. 

                                 EDISON
                        These two lowlifes looting your 
                        tree are Dot and Dash.
                                 HARRISON
                        Dot and Dash! Charming!

           From across the room, MORGAN chimes in.

                                 MORGAN
                        Morse Code.

                                 EDISON
                        Uh...Yes.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN CAR, YEARS AND YEARS EARLIER - DUSK

           Filmed like the beginnings of cinema – flickering black and 
           white. EDISON, much younger, sits next to a beautiful, shy 
           girl – MARY. He reaches a hand over to her skirt.

                                 EDISON (V.O.)
                        I proposed to Mary by tapping it 
                        out on her knee. She was a 
                        telegrapher who worked for me–

           INT. THE YELLOW OVAL ROOM OF THE WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A sudden rupture in the memory.

                                 MORGAN
                        Do you make it a habit of wooing 
                        your employees?

           EDISON and MORGAN shake. It’s firm.

                                 EDISON
                        Pierpont. 

                                 MORGAN
                        How much more of my money do you 
                        want to wash down the drain?

                                 EDISON
                        Oh as very, very much as possible.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE’S HOUSE [MONTAGE ONE] - MORNING

           Excited, lush music under–

           The huge flutter of a satin sheet being tossed into the air 
           and down onto a bed. Then, the huge flutter of another. 
           The huge flutter of a pristine, white table cloth being 
           tossed onto a long wooden dining table.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back in the White House, all parties sit around a beautifully 
           set table, befitted with the remains of a decadent meal. The 
           CHILDREN and EDISON eat iced cream. Coffee and tea.

                                 HARRISON
                        Would you consider building a super-
                        gun for us, Mr. Edison? One that 
                        could send bombs across the ocean?

                                 EDISON
                        I don’t build weapons. I’m much 
                        more interested in creating than 
                        destroying. Such as my proposal.

           EDISON raises his brows. MORGAN takes the hint.

                                 MORGAN
                        One square mile of Manhattan?

                                 EDISON
                        I’m gonna light it up.

           MORGAN and PRESIDENT HARRISON exchange a look of incredulity. 

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Look –

           FRANCIS, primed and ready, hands EDISON a map of lower 
           Manhattan. EDISON walks to MORGAN and spreads it out on his 
           place setting. A pencil, from CARSON, is placed into EDISON’s 
           hand, without pause, and it circles the tip of the Island.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Here. This. Here. It will be a 
                        firework to civilization.

                                 MORGAN
                        You figured the whole thing out?

                                 EDISON
                        I did. We need to move fast before 
                        the jackals steal my ideas. Bell 
                        beat me with the telephone by one 
                        day. One day. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDISON (CONT'D)
                        I got spies figurin’ out how I 
                        captured sound and they’re gonna 
                        poach. We need to move fast. I need 
                        a firework to civilization. 

           EDISON looks to his wife, then back to the men.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        This is the most important thing I 
                        ever will do. This is the crowning 
                        achievement of 1,000 years. It’s 
                        the gateway to ten million 
                        inventions that we never could even 
                        dream of before. We are talking 
                        about actual, literal power. POWER!

           Everyone is silent after EDISON’s outburst.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I need double what I raised.

                                 MORGAN
                        Double?

                                 EDISON
                        Dammit, don’t you see this isn’t 
                        about money?

                                 DOT
                             (Whispered to MARY.)
                        Why is his nose like that?

           MORGAN smiles. MORGAN hems and haws. Then –

                                 MORGAN
                        No.

           FRANCIS and CARSON look to a speechless EDISON.

                                 HARRISON
                        Hell, it sounds pretty grand to me, 
                        Pierpont. If I had your fortune–

                                 MORGAN
                             (Standing.)
                        With respect, Mr. President, you 
                        don’t.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 EDISON
                        You’re going to give me that money.

           Silence. No one says this to JP MORGAN.

                                 MORGAN
                        Oh I am?

                                 EDISON
                        Make all checks payable to Edison 
                        Electric Company.

           MORGAN gets a look in his eye. HARRISON is beaming – this 
           kind of excitement doesn’t come to The White House every day. 

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        And I want an apology. You hurt my 
                        feelings.

           Silence. Then, EDISON turns to HARRISON.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for lunch. We must be going. 

           EDISON leaves. Everyone scrambles to follow, save MORGAN.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EDISON’s family and men get into a carriage. 

                                 EDISON
                             (TO HARRISON.)
                        Thank you for your hospitality.
                                 HARRISON
                        After seeing the way you spoke to 
                        Morgan...any chance I can get you 
                        to talk to Congress?

           EDISON shakes HARRISON’s hand.

                                 EDISON
                        Sorry, Mr. President. I know the 
                        difference between a challenge and 
                        a waste of time.

                                 CARRIAGE DRIVER
                             (Whipping horses.)
                        H’yah!

           The carriage bursts off.

           MARGUERITE putting small gifts onto two featherbeds – 
           presents for EDISON’s children.

           INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The White House disappears into the distance of falling snow.

                                 MARY
                        Do you know what you’re doing?

           EDISON puts DASH’s face between his fingers. DASH squirms.

                                 EDISON
                        This boy is far too handsome to be 
                        my son. Mary...what aren’t you 
                        telling me?

                                 MARY
                             (Shoving him.)

           Fast-forwarded tree-trimming by MARGUERITE and FEMALE 
           SERVANTS. A silver, industrial ‘W’ ornament is placed at the 
           top of the tree as the music climaxes.

           INT. TRAIN FROM WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON

           DASH and DOT are asleep on the plush seat, exhausted from 
           their meeting with the PRESIDENT and mostly sugar-high. 
           MARY is also dozing, her temple resting on the window. Across 
           from FRANCIS and CARSON, EDISON looks over papers. 

                                 EDISON
                        And our man in the patent office?

                                 FRANCIS
                        It’s being expedited.

           EXT. PITTSBURGH TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON

           Feet are shuffling into place. Forming a line...

                                 CARSON
                        Excuse me...um...Mr–

                                 FRANCIS
                        Just call him Tom already.

                                 EDISON
                        Just call him Dr. Francine Already.

                                 CARSON
                        What happens if J.P. Morgan doesn’t 
                        give you the money for all that 
                        copper?

           In the condensation on the train window, EDISON draws a 
           rifle. He puts his head next to the illustrated rifle.

                                 EDISON
                        Pull the trigger.

           They laugh.

                             (TO Francis.)
                        I bet you one month’s wages we’ll 
                        have the go-ahead from Morgan by

                        No deal. The trip to Pittsburgh 
                        buy’s Morgan more time!

                                 EDISON
                        Time is the one thing he can’t buy; 
                        neither can we and what in the name 
                        of G.O.D. do you mean by... “the 
                        trip to Pittsburgh?”

                                 FRANCIS
                        Look out your window. George 
                        Westinghouse is having the family 
                        over for dinner. To stay the night.

                                 EDISON
                        What? When?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Tonight. You know about this.

                        The hell I do and the hell I am. I 
                        don’t have time to discuss air 
                        brakes with some Fat Cat.

           FRANCIS and CARSON exchange a look.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You can’t just...uh...skip 
                        Pittsburgh. He invited and you 
                        accepted. Westinghouse wants to 
                        talk with you about electricity – 
                        his invitation said it’s important.

                                 EDISON
                        If he wants to invest, then let him 
                        but remember – he doesn’t get 
                        special treatment. Morgan doesn’t 
                        get special treatment. No one does. 
                             (He points over to MARY.)
                        She gets special treatment.

                                 FRANCIS
                        C’mon, Tom – Westinghouse isn’t a 
                        Fat Cat. He’s an inventor too. 

                                 EDISON
                        Some pudgy kitten who made it rich

                        improved upon an idea.

                        carefully, Carson: We’re. Not.

           Camera pans along the dignified and expectant faces – 
           WESTINGHOUSE, MARGUERITE, POPE, and SERVANTS, who have 
           flowers for MRS. EDISON and treats for the CHILDREN.

           The sound of a train whistle pierces the silence.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        And here he comes...

           THEY spot the little train chugging closer...but it doesn’t 
           seem to be slowing down at all.

                                 POPE
                        He’s comin’ rather fast, wouldn’t 
                        ya say?

           The train approaches...

                                 POPE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not slowing–

           A LOUD BANG and RUSH as the train speeds past them! The wake 
           blows MARGUERITE’s hair into WESTINGHOUSE’s face and he takes 
           a step back.

                                 POPE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe the brakes are busted.

           WESTINGHOUSE fixes his gaze on the underside of the train. 
           The brakes clearly read, “WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKES.”

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I seriously doubt that.

                             (As the train disappears.)

                        maybe a decade? Head electrician.
                                 EDISON
                        You know I lived in his basement 
                        when I was just starting out. His 
                        wife still alive?

           FRANCIS shrugs.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I’d forgotten about him. 

           CARSON and FRANCIS don’t respond.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                             (To CARSON.)
                        Send a...I don’t know...what’s a 
                        nice present? Send them an Edison 
                        Letter Opener or something from the 
                        drawer. Call it an ‘oversight. ‘

           EDISON looks over at his children a moment.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna catch forty winks.

           EDISON slouches and brings a hat down atop his eyes.

           EXT. TRAIN FROM BALTIMORE - CONTINUOUS

           The train barrels down the tracks into snowcapped trees as 
           the sun sets.

           EXT. WESTINGHOUSE’S HOME - A LITTLE LATER

           Snowflakes softly float and gaslights glow. Evening light. 
           SERVANT opens the front door and EMPLOYEES file inside. 

           INT. ENTRY TO WESTINGHOUSE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The table is set for an exquisite dinner. Candles are lit. 
           MARGUERITE approaches the CHEF and a line of SERVANTS who are 
           looking expectantly for the most famous man on earth, EDISON.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        An emergency came up in New York. 
                        They’re not coming.

           An audible, collective sigh is heard from the staff.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Well. 

           MARGUERITE takes her place at one end of the table.
                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Everyone sit.

           The SERVANTS look at one another. They’re not usually asked 
           to dine at the table with the WESTINGHOUSES. 

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Come now. We’ve got a lot of food 
                        that’ll go rotten. Let’s all sit.

           WESTINGHOUSE and POPE watch as the SERVANTS each take a seat.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Joseph. Let’s get ten more bottles 
                        from the cellar. 

           The SERVANTS smile in anticipation of the great meal ahead. 
           WESTINGHOUSE pulls FRANKLIN by the sleeve, nabbing the Edison 
           light bulb centerpiece off the table as he passes through. 
           The SERVANTS are digging in.

           INT. KITCHEN OF WESTINGHOUSE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           A grand kitchen; copper pots hang from the ceiling. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Sally, is there a lemon about?

           SALLY, a chef with powerful arms, fetches a lemon.

                                 POPE
                        What’s this about, George? What did 
                        you need to tell Edison? Ya can’t 
                        hide things from me.

           With a table knife, WESTINGHOUSE pries a nail from the floor.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You have a penny?

           POPE grumbles and pulls a handful of change. WESTINGHOUSE 
           pushes the penny into the lemon, then the zinc nail.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Edison has made a fatal error.

           From his pocket, WESTINGHOUSE produces a long copper wire, 
           which he quickly wraps around the nailhead and the penny.

                                 POPE
                        Which is...

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Which is – (Hand me the bulb.)
           WESTINGHOUSE wraps the long loop of wire around the base 
           contact of the bulb. It quickly and softly illuminates. 
           WESTINGHOUSE hands the lemon to POPE.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what you’re holding?

                                 POPE
                             (Smiling)
                        Lemon.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You’re holding Edison’s complete 
                        system of DC electricity. Which is, 
                        as it also happens, a lemon. Watch!

           WESTINGHOUSE begins to back away with the lit bulb. As he 
           does so, the glow of the bulb dims, then burps out.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Pope, we’re going to pick a 
                        town, one little town somewhere 
                        north, and put on a show for Mr. 
                        Edison because I think I’ve found a 
                        flaw at the very heart of his 
                        system.

           POPE takes in this revelation, resting a hand on the counter.

                                 POPE
                        Well, we’re gonna need more lemons.

           INT. MENLO PARK FACTORY OF THOMAS EDISON - MORNING

           Two bare feet hang off a bench. A body reclines.

                                 VOICE OF EDISON
                        Ooooph.

           The body rises. Two bare feet pad around the workshop. A hand 
           locates a silver urn of coffee. One finger is inserted; the 
           coffee is cold. The hands bring it to the lips. A glance at 
           the hardwood bench where a night was spent. Hands feel the 
           back – in a bit of pain. A stack of notebooks and some wiring 
           lay about. A door swings open, a body backlit in early 
           morning farm sunlight. EDISON’s face squints.

                                 EDISON
                        Francis?

           FRANCIS takes a singe step inside, he’s holding a paper.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You look like hell.
                                 EDISON
                             (Smiling.)
                        Frannnnnncisssss? What IS that in 
                        your HAND?

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Grudgingly.)
                        A money order...From J.P. Morgan.

                                 EDISON
                        Bring me that chicken and lemme 
                        count the eggs.

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Bringing the paper.)
                        So now what?

                                 EDISON
                        Now...

           EDISON brushes past him, headed for the morning sunlight.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        We take Manhattan.

           EXT. UPSTATE MASSACHUSETTS - EARLY MORNING

           WESTINGHOUSE, MARGUERITE and POPE, in a carriage, draw into a 
           small town of charming character. MARGUERITE is asleep on his 
           shoulder. POPE stares out the window with excitement. As the 
           BUGGY pulls to a stop along quaint main street, MARGUERITE 
           blinks awake.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Why did we have to come all the way 
                        up to Massachusetts?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        If you fall on your face, you don’t 
                        do it in front of a crowd.

                                 POPE
                        I grew up here. Nice to give 
                        something back. Well, here we go.

           Doors are opened...

           INT. / EXT. EDISON IN LOWER MANHATTAN / WESTINGHOUSE IN 
           MASSACHUSETTS – DAY/NIGHT

           MONTAGE TWO [THE RACE IS ON!]:
           Rhythmic drums – or are they hammers and shovels? Then, a 
           Dixieland explosion. The feeling of a Century lurching to the 
           top of a tremendous hill.

           EDISON and FRANCIS retrieve MORGAN’s money from banks in huge 
           canvas sacks like bank robbers.

           WESTINGHOUSE and MARGUERITE arriving a tiny hotel room – 
           suitcases opened. POPE looks at a quaint New England street.

           EDISON: Irish digging trenches in NYC streets, shoveling 
           mounds of horse shit out of the way. Laying copper lines. ONE 
           PARTICULAR DIGGER, in particular, has crazy eyes and VERY 
           fancy shoes. He’ll come back later...

           WESTINGHOUSE and POPE in the town square as the MAYOR gives 
           WESTINGHOUSE the KEY to the city. WESTINGHOUSE looks super 
           uncomfortable. Flash bulbs go off at in a PUFF of smoke! 

           EDISON grabbing a shovel away from a worker in the street – 
           shoving it into the frozen earth. FASTER! CARSON and FRANCIS 
           observe, astounded. Then, they join in.

           WESTINGHOUSE supervises as a huge metal machine, the size of 
           a tomb, is loaded off a truck by fifteen men. On it, a 
           painted sign reads: WESTINGHOUSE.

           EDISON: Men in office buildings over the square mile of 
           Manhattan are pulling down gas fixtures and installing wires.

           WESTINGHOUSE: Shots of men driving poles into the cold 
           ground. Shots of men stringing up electric wires. 

           EDISON updating MORGAN over a fancy meal, reassuring him. 

           WESTINGHOUSE: A shot of SHADY LOOKING MAN observing the 
           finished strung wires and WESTINGHOUSE, who walks the dark 
           street alone, staring up at the good work his men have done. 
           The SHADY LOOKING MAN, lights a cigarette.

           EDISON being interviewed by the press. EDISON smiles a folksy 
           grin and points up at buildings in lower Manhattan. He’s 
           hoisting his daughter DOT onto his shoulder.

           WESTINGHOUSE: A load of crates arrive. WESTINGHOUSE cracks 
           them open and inside are hundreds of light bulbs - but 
           they’re a different shape and size from EDISON’s. Copies...

           Intercut with the MONTAGE: CARSON and FRANCIS cut wood, sand, 
           and paint it. It becomes a map of the WORLD. Each territory 
           has a small socket.  FRANCIS take a small bulb and screws it 
           into MANHATTAN. It glows. EDISON then walks forward and 
           unscrews the light – they haven’t done it yet.
           BOTH EDISON & WESTINGHOUSE: Bulbs of both varieties are 
           screwed into place, then each man inserts a final bulb as the 
           sequence perfectly buttons. 

           INT. KEMMLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A hammer comes down in the house of WILLIAM KEMMLER. From the 
           nail, KEMMLER hangs a thin piece of twine, strung around two 
           sections of hollow metal pipe, hanging in front of the door. 

           Darkness. Time passes. KEMMLER sits opposite the door, 
           drifting in and out of sleep. Then, the jangle of the pipes 
           hitting each other wakes him. It’s his wife TILLIE. She’s in 
           a revealing dress and drunk.

                                 KEMMLER
                        Where were you?

           TILLIE scrambles to the stairs.

                                 KEMMLER (CONT’D)
                        Tell me where you WERE!

                                 TILLIE
                        You’re drunk. Were’s Ella?

                                 ELLA (O.S.)
                        Ma?

                                 TILLIE
                        Oh wonderful. You woke her.

                                 KEMMLER
                        You screwin’ around on me?

                                 TILLIE
                        Drunk.

           TILLIE walks up the stairs. We hear her comforting her 
           daughter. KEMMLER takes a swig from a bottle.

           EXT. STEPS OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

           In the street, an enormous crowd is abuzz. Reporters and 
           photographers are everywhere. Silk bunting is draped from the 
           stone columns of the Stock Exchange. Snow falls. 

           An actual soap box sits at center of the top step. On one 
           side are MORGAN’s MEN, rotund men in tails and top hats. On 
           the other side of the box are EDISON’s family bundled up. DOT 
           and DASH have sparklers and giggle. MARY, looking a bit weak, 
           stands beside the EDISONS’ oldest friends, THE GILLIANDS. To 
           their side are FRANCIS and OTHER EDISON MEN.
           INT. THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

           A marble hall lit by gas. In shadows, J.P. MORGAN and EDISON. 
           EDISON walks to a gas wall sconce and twists it off. EDISON 
           strides back to MORGAN, extending a hand. MORGAN shakes.

                                 MORGAN
                        This is the biggest moment of your 
                        life. Don’t fuck it up.

           MORGAN heads out the front door.

                                 EDISON
                             (Calling after him.)
                        I’m just glad I didn’t pay for it.

           MORGAN snorts and EDISON follows him out the door but stops 
           short, and turns to see his own reflection in the glass 
           entry. He stares, and then in one brisk motion, messes up his 
           hair. He smiles and throws open the door.

           EXT. THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

           A blurry shot of the pillars and bunting. Blurry snow flakes 
           fall on lower Manhattan. EDISON’s head suddenly steps into 
           frame and focus. A wild roar of appreciation from the crowd.

                                 EDISON
                             (Like a madman.)
                        Good evening. I’m Thomas Edison. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DANK CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

           WESTINGHOUSE and POPE are crouching in front of the GENERATOR 
           marked ‘WESTINGHOUSE.’

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        And the transformer–

                                 POPE
                        Triple checked.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        The wires on Cowper the raccoon...

                                 POPE
                        Patched. Insulated. Raccoon now 
                        Raccoon hat.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Oh grief – coal for the generator–
           POPE turns WESTINGHOUSE around there’s a HUGE pile of coal. A 
           clomp-ing as MARGUERITE comes down the stairs. She’s dressed 
           to the nines.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Not a word more! Upstairs young 
                        man.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        How many are there?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        It’s a crowd, George. You make a 
                        miracle and you draw a crowd. 

           MARGUERITE ascends the stairs. 

           EXT. THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

                                 EDISON
                        In the beginning...there was this 
                        nice fellow named ‘God.’ And he 
                        created what people call the 
                        ‘heavens’ and the ‘earth.’

           J.P. MORGAN shakes his head in amazement and disbelief.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        And the earth, see, it had 
                        no...um...shape. And darkness 
                        reigned. And God looked upon the 
                        ocean. His big ol’ face – a face 
                        that I can only assume was doggone 
                        HUGE, stared into the seas and a 
                        great roaring was heard.

           Silence.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I said, “A great ROARING was 
                        heard.”

           The crowd begins to roar.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Ah, I see you read his bestseller!

           EDISON laughs and turns to his family as if to say, “Look 
           what I can do: I can make fun of God and they love me.”

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. DANK CHURCH BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A turn of a wrench. POPE stands and walks to WESTINGHOUSE. A 
           head pops down the stairs again. MARGUERITE.

                                 MARGUERITE’S HEAD
                        George!

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’m coming, I’m coming.

                                 POPE
                        When’ll ya tell Edison about this?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        A day or so. I’ll bring him up, 
                        he’ll see how Alternating Current 
                        is better. Then we’ll partner up. 
                        His bulbs, my generator.

                                 POPE
                        Hell, why dontcha just take him on? 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Challenge Edison? That’s the last 
                        thing I ever want to do.

           EXT. THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

           We pan among the faces of the crowd. Expectant faces. 

                                 EDISON
                        Tonight we are all part of 
                        something bigger than us. Bigger 
                        than anything that’s come before. 
                        Bigger than anything that can ever 
                        come after. Tonight, we mark the 
                        fulcrum of human history.

           EDISON’s face is stone serious.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        The Fulcrum. Of Human History.

           He points to a dark building.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna happen right there!

           He points to another dark building.
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        And THERE! And soon across this 
                        country, and Europe, this whole 
                        world; into the darkest corner of a 
                        wild forest that’s never before 
                        felt the crunch of a human foot.

           EDISON’s face, tight.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Edison has captured in a jelly jar 
                        what has only before flashed across 
                        the night sky. And tonight...
                             (He sniffles in the cold.)
                        Whaddaya say we unscrew the lid and 
                        see what happens?

           INT. DANK CHURCH BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           WESTINGHOUSE and POPE, eye to eye. A significant moment.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’d be proud if you pulled the 
                        switch.

           POPE’s eyebrows raise. He smiles. WESTINGHOUSE smiles. They 
           shake hands. 

           WESTINGHOUSE turns and ascends the stairs.

           INT. CHURCH SOCIAL HALL - CONTINUOUS

           He emerges into a modest hall. There is table with punch and 
           cookies. One reporter. One photographer. Townspeople in their 
           Sunday best. Like a church social. A little brass band.

           When the people spot WESTINGHOUSE, they cheerfully applaud. 
           WESTINGHOUSE goes red in the face. He waves.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                             (Spying the photographer.)
                        No photos!

           The room goes a little quiet.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, you should photograph the 
                        miracle that’s going to be up and 
                        down those streets. 

           WESTINGHOUSE points to three HUGE windows offering a perfect 
           view of Main Street, cloaked in dusk.

           The camera sails forward, the crowd parting to accommodate...
                                 WESTINGHOUSE (V.O.)
                        All ya have to do is stomp!

           EXT. THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

                                 EDISON
                        Ahhh, enough blither-blather. 
                        Poetics aren’t my thing. So I’ll 
                        quote my protege: Let there be 
                        light.

           The sound of a generator springing to life. The huge crowd 
           turns suddenly to the sound. All heads on the platform turn 
           to look up at the city. Then –

           SHOT OF AN ENTIRE BUILDING LIGHTING UP!

           THEN ANOTHER! THEN ANOTHER! THEN ANOTHER! 

           INT. MENLO PARK FACTORY OF THOMAS EDISON - CONTINUOUS

           CARSON, fresh off a slip of paper from the telegraph, screws 
           a bulb into MANHATTAN on the HUGE MAP. It glows bright white!

           EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

           The crowd roars!!!

           A HUGE band plays. Confetti is strewn from windows. 

           MARY looks up at an unlit window and starts to fall 
           backwards. MR. GILLIAND catches her with the palm of his 
           hand. MARY rights herself.

                                 MARY
                        Excuse me. I... Oh.

           MR. GILLIAND looks her over a second – something’s wrong.

           INT. CHURCH HALL - CONTINUOUS

           The camera continues lurching forward as the crowd parts and 
           flies through the window space as WESTINGHOUSE shouts:

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (O.S.)
                        Let’s have it!

           Everyone STOMPS on the wooden floor.

           EXT. MASSACHUSETTS QUAINT MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The camera flies through the window and sails down the street 
           as a flutter of electricity blinks forward and reveals:
           A perfect American street, illuminated in soft, glowing white 
           light from the poles and windows of the barbershop, the 
           tailor, the butchershop, the cobbler...

           INT. CHURCH HALL - CONTINUOUS

           The band plays the 1812 overture as people cheer.

           POPE, old man that he is, pounds up the stairs and looks out 
           the window and grins broadly.

           MARGUERITE hugs WESTINGHOUSE and kisses him on the cheek. His 
           flushed face goes full RED. WESTINGHOUSE looks pleased, but 
           his pleasure is reserved. It’s restrained. It’s dignified. 

           EXT. MASSACHUSETTS CHURCH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           SHADY MAN hangs up a telephone.

           INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

           An AID TO MORGAN hangs up a telephone on the trading floor of 
           the stock exchange and briskly walks down the marble hall, 
           slips a bit, rights himself, and continues outside.

           The confetti is still falling. EDISON has DOT on his 
           shoulders, the little girl catching confetti in her hands. 
           Photographer’s bulbs blast white smoke into the air. 

           The AID TO MORGAN whispers something into J.P. MORGAN’s ear.

           EXT. MASSACHUSETTS INN - A BIT LATER

           WESTINGHOUSE and MARGUERITE prepare for bed. WESTINGHOUSE 
           approaches his wife. He holds a letter.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        That’s the invitation to Edison? 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’ll send it off in the morning.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        The way he dismissed you, George. I 
                        don’t care what the man has 
                        achieved. It just wasn’t polite. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        He’s strongheaded is all.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Dance with me.
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        There’s no music. 

                                 MARGUERITE
                        George.

           In silence, they sway. WESTINGHOUSE slowly brings an arm 
           around her. His fingers relax against her back. They sway in 
           the darkness, but out the window – a faint glow of light.

           EXT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON finishes interviews with reporters – there is a buzz 
           all around -- The Wizard of Menlo Park has done it again! 

           Dot and Dash play on the grand, marble steps with sparklers. 

           MORGAN shakes EDISON’s hand, pulling him in. He whispers:

                                 MORGAN
                        Westinghouse just lit up Great 
                        Barrington, Massachusetts.

                                 EDISON
                        George Westinghouse? He’s in the 
                        railroad business.

                                 MORGAN
                        Not anymore.

           EDISON’s face goes ashen.

           INT. MENLO PARK FACTORY OF THOMAS EDISON - DAY

           Bangs! Crashes! EDISON, back at MENLO PARK. The mood is 
           frantic. EDISON is off the leash, throwing things. He stands 
           at a corner of the factory, facing the full staff of his 
           company.

                                 EDISON
                        Where’d he get the bulbs?
                             (No response.)
                        Are the lawyers on that? Get the 
                        lawyers on that.
                             (No response.)
                        And no one knew?
                             (No response.)
                        What a roaring silence from the 
                        brightest minds in America. A 
                        roaring SILENCE!!!!

           Everyone is taken aback. EDISON picks up a stray bulb from 
           the wooden work table. He holds it above his head.
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        If Westinghouse stole even a 
                        socket. Even a single fucking screw 
                        from our design, we nail him to the 
                        cross. Do any of you even care 
                        about what we’re trying to do here? 
                        Do any of you care about having our 
                        design raped right in front of us? 
                        Do any of you children understand 
                        that this is a RACE??

           Shot of his employees both inspired and terrified.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Figure it out, beat the son of a 
                        bitch bloody and let’s stick a 
                        goddamn EDISON flag in him.

           CARSON wraps red cellophane around a bulb, fastens it, and 
           screws it into the area of MASSACHUSETTS. Two bulbs – one 
           pure white and one devil red.

           EDISON’s employees scatter as REPORTERS are let into the 
           factory. EDISON’s demeanor changes instantly to a cheerful, 
           folksy scientist.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen. Welcome! Aw, my hair’s 
                        all a mess. Don’t report on that!

           The reporters laugh and all write it down. A cylinder 
           phonograph is quickly placed onto the table. 

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        My new miracle. The phonograph. A 
                        portable echo. The first time a man 
                        is able to hear the sound of his 
                        own voice repeated back, outside of 
                        a caveman calling into a ravine.

           The men gather around a wax phonograph. 

                                 REPORTER
                        When are you bringing this to 
                        market?

                                 EDISON
                        Soon. Hey – wanna know the names of 
                        the men who are stealing my design 
                        on this? I’ll tell you. And you’ll 
                        print them. First – Emile Berliner. 
                        Spelled the way it sounds, which to 
                        me, is the precise sound of a 
                        CHEAT, a COWARD, and a THIEF. 
           EDISON cranks the phonograph frantically then drops the 
           reproducer.

                                 EDISON’S VOICE
                        MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB...

           The men are astonished and applaud. A tight shot of EDISON’s 
           face – he’s smiling too, but it’s a different kind of smile– 
           a darkness behind the eyes...

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE COMPANY (WABCO) - MORNING

           WESTINGHOUSE punches in at the factory. He looks around at 
           his men at work, building air brake machine parts. He 
           breathes in the air of his factory. He’s home. A MAN with a 
           friendly face enters behind WESTINGHOUSE.

                                 FRIENDLY MAN
                        Oh my goodness. You’re George 
                        Westinghouse?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        May I help you sir?

                                 FRIENDLY MAN
                        I’ve only seen a photograph of you. 
                        Good thing I did. I would’ve walked 
                        right on by and not even–

           The man pulls a handful of papers. They say “EDISON” in large 
           letters across the top.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I don’t normally pose–

                                 FRIENDLY MAN
                        I just came from Thomas Edison.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        What? From Edison? Well that’s 
                        another story – Please, follow me.

           A tracking shot as the two men walk the long length of the 
           factor, passing flying sparks and men at work. The bedsheet 
           blueprint hangs from a rafter. It’s signed by all the 
           employees who worked on the Massachusetts generator. 

           The two men enter WESTINGHOUSE’s private office and 
           WESTINGHOUSE closes the door. WESTINGHOUSE moves behind the 
           desk and picks up a letter opener with the name, EDISON, 
           forming the handle – in overlapping, attached metal letters. 
           He gestures for the FRIENDLY MAN to sit; he does so.
                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Please tell Mr. Edison I received 
                        his gift and I thank him. He sent 
                        it, accidentally, to the 
                        Philadelphia office. It’s a rather 
                        nice letter opener, I’d say...

                                 FRIENDLY MAN
                        You want me to tell Mr. Edison?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You’re right. Very rude. I’ve 
                        already sent a note of thanks along 
                        with my invitation to 
                        Massachusetts, but I hadn’t heard 
                        back. I guess he gets stacks of 
                        mail, no? 

           A silence. The FRIENDLY MAN squints.

                                 FRIENDLY MAN
                        I think...Mr. Westinghouse...there 
                        must be some misunderstanding.

           The door to the office opens and POPE slips inside.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        That’s my friend Frank Pope. And 
                        this is–

                                 FRIENDLY MAN
                        Sherman Quincy. Call me Sherm.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Mr. Quincy works for Edison.

                                 QUINCY
                        No I don’t.

           WESTINGHOUSE opens his mouth to continue, but is befuddled. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You...

                                 QUINCY
                        No, I’m sorry. It’s just...I was 
                        sent to visit Edison’s office in 
                        New York to examine the 
                        practicality of his proposal for 
                        local electricity...well, look–
                             (Spreading papers across 
                              WESTINGHOUSE’s desk.)
                        I’m from Columbus.
                                 POPE
                        Ohio?

                                 QUINCY
                        What? Oh yes. Ohio. But these 
                        figures from Edison are...they’re 
                        mighty astronomical. But then I saw 
                        your quoted price in this 
                        Massachusetts paper that’s making 
                        the rounds...

           He pulls a newspaper from his pocket and it’s the photo that 
           took WESTINGHOUSE by surprise up in Massachusetts.

                                 QUINCY (CONT’D)
                        I think it would make much more 
                        sense for the taxpayers of Columbus 
                        to go with Westinghouse Electric. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        But, Mr. Quincy, there is no 
                        “Westinghouse Electric.”

           The man looks through the window of WESTINGHOUSE’s office. He 
           points to an electric generator, a duplicate of the tomb-
           sized one that they hauled up to Massachusetts. In bold red 
           letters, it reads, “WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC.”

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s a duplicate in case the 
                        first one...see, and the sign is a 
                        joke the boys played on...Sir. I’m 
                        not actually in the electricity 
                        business. It was only a 
                        demonstration for Edison’s sake. 

                                 QUINCY
                        Oh I see how it is. Fine. I can 
                        play hard ball too, Mr. 
                        Westinghouse. I have strong 
                        associations with Mr. Fallows of 
                        Cleveland and Mr. Youmanns of 
                        Dayton. I’m sure if this is an 
                        issue of negotiation, I can 
                        persuade them to persuade their 
                        city councils to opt for 
                        Westinghouse Electric over Edison, 
                        but frankly, sir, your numbers make 
                        Westinghouse sell itself.

           WESTINGHOUSE squints at the man, confused as hell.
                                 POPE
                             (To QUINCY.)
                        Would you excuse us one moment?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        But–

                                 POPE
                        Just one moment!

           POPE pulls WESTINGHOUSE outside the office door.

                        By now he knows and just doesn’t

                        just cares about getting it.

                        Step on Edison’s toes? You know

                        You dropped a circus elephant right 
                        on top of the man’s head!

           A  huge CRASH and both look over and see the DRUNK (who 
           earlier had two babies in his arms) – the man WESTINGHOUSE 
           was supposed to fire. He’s shattered a morning’s work.

                        Lordy, you didn’t fire him?

           WESTINGHOUSE sighs.

                        George, you want to get the

                        George started a whole company 
                        without even consulting me. He 
                        doesn’t know how to comb his hair 
                        without asking me which way the 
                        part should be and yet he started a

                        So why’s his system bad, Tom? I say 
                        maybe you just got bit by the green-

                        Westinghouse is using what is known 
                        is ALTERNATING Current. Know what 
                        that is?

                        It’s HIGH VOLTAGE! It means you

                        invent something that hurts people. 
                        For that, you have to go shopping 
                        in Pittsburgh.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        So you say that Westinghouse wants 
                        to hurt people?

                                 EDISON
                        I can’t say that...but you 
                        absolutely should.

           They laugh.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Look – how much more money would 
                        you be willing to spend to make 
                        sure your wife was safe at night?

                                 REPORTER 3
                        My wife? I think I’d buy 
                        Westinghouse.

           They all laugh, including EDISON.
                                 EDISON
                        This is not just about inventions 
                        and profits. This is a battle over 
                        the value of a human life.

           INT. GRAND LIVING ROOM OF WESTINGHOUSE’S HOME - NIGHT

           A fire is roaring! A Christmas tree (with candles) glows.

           MARGUERITE raises a copy of THE NEW YORK SUN above her head. 
           It reads: EDISON’S CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO WESTINGHOUSE: WAR.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        He’s calling you a profiteering 
                        madman! You!

           POPE and WESTINGHOUSE are shown sitting opposite MARGUERITE. 
           They are in low, comfortable chairs. They don’t seem upset.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll ask you once and I want a 
                        quick answer: Is your high voltage 
                        “AC” system more dangerous?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        No.

           MARGUERITE is confused.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        But–

                                 POPE
                        Both Edison’s DC and our system can 
                        be lethal if you touch the live 
                        current. That’s why you should 
                        NEVER TOUCH THE LIVE CURRENT. 
                        George, I think you missed a spot 
                        shaving. Look. Here–
           POPE touches a spot high up on WESTINGHOUSE’s cheek.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Oh yes. I see. Why do I grow hair 
                        so high on my cheek?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        George!

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Bumblebee, the reason Edison is 
                        jabbing me is that my system uses a 
                        fraction of the amount of copper 
                        because I use high voltage and 
                        fewer generators. It’s just about 
                        dollars. May I have another cookie?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        You’re like a little boy!

           MARGUERITE paces in silence back...Both MEN’s eyes follow her 
           back...and forth...

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Then it’s settled.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        What is?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Your name is my name and no one 
                        drags my name through the mud. 
                        We’re going to write a response to 
                        Edison’s attacks. If he wants a 
                        fight, well...he’ll get one. 

           INT. / EXT. EDISON’S LAB / WESTINGHOUSE AT HOME, ETC. - 
           DAY/NIGHT

           Montage 4 – the electric music increases in tempo and the 
           shots are intercut even faster:

           RED and WHITE BULBS being screwed into the HUGE MAP all over 
           the US and even LONDON, which goes to EDISON. 

           EDISON, in his lab, working on a new device, looks up as 
           FRANCIS screws in two RED BULBS. EDISON picks up his device 
           and throws it down the table with fury and it breaks apart.

           Men on  ladders, stringing up wires for WESTINGHOUSE.

           MORGAN yelling at EDISON. EDISON walking out on the argument.

           Men in trenches, laying down wires.
           Two men arguing with a very large women. Their trench is 
           leading directly under her house. She’s quite against this.

           Men installing an electric elevator in a swanky hotel.

           MARGUERITE throws a paper down in front of WESTINGHOUSE that 
           reads: “WESTINGHOUSE ‘CURRENT OF DEATH,’ SAYS EDISON.”

           Men building an electric stove in a swanky restaurant.

           Night along the Rialto, Grand Canal, Venice. Glorious amber 
           bulbs create a magical atmosphere. A young, attractive kisses 
           beneath the lights.

           A shot of the inked-up sheet hanging from the WABCO rafters 
           in the empty Westinghouse Factory at night.

           WESTINGHOUSE, MARGUERITE and POPE on train. MARGUERITE is 
           helping WESTINGHOUSE to write a letter. She’s marching up and 
           down the aisle as she dictates, impassioned.

           MORGAN yelling into a phone at EDISON. EDISON hangs up on 
           him.

           The WESTINGHOUSES and POPE arrive in WEST VIRGINIA. Shaking 
           hands with the mayor. Trenches dug. Copper laid. Lights 
           installed. More trains. PROVIDENCE. More handshakes. More 
           installations. More lights on. LOUISVILLE. More handshakes. 
           More installations. More lights on. 

           EDISON sitting with MARY, pale as hell. A Christmas Wreath 
           overhead. EDISON eats forkfuls of pie. MARY isn’t eating. 

           A shot of the glorious EDISON farmhouse, green lawns, and 
           then a bright orange seam tears across the sky as the sun 
           scuds behind clouds. A rumble in the heavens. Then...rain.

           NEW RED BULBS SCREWED INTO THE MAP – WEST VIRGINIA, 
           PROVIDENCE, LOUISVILLE...

           EXT. LOUISVILLE TOWN STREET - DAY

           MARGUERITE and WESTINGHOUSE walk down the quaint street. The 
           street lamps are affixed with large domes of glass – bulbs. 
           They are illuminated during the day, though they can’t 
           compete much with the sunlight. MARGUERITE carries shopping 
           bags.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Louisville is so excited to have 
                        the electricity, they keep it on in 
                        the daytime.
                                 MARGUERITE
                        Mmmmm.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Pope is already asleep, can you 
                        believe it? Tuckered out.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Mmmmm.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Do you...would you like that 
                        necklace you were trying on?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        I bought it.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Oh. Well. Good.

           There is a palpable awkwardness between them.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Bumblebee?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        We wrote that response letter to 
                        the papers together. I saw the 
                        envelope addressed. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Yes...

                                 MARGUERITE
                             (Producing it from her 
                              purse.)
                        Then why did I find it in the 
                        wastebasket?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        After a good night’s sleep, I’ve 
                        decided not to engage him. Edison 
                        wants to take a couple of slugs at 
                        me in the press, that’s fine. A man 
                        who fights with air only tires 
                        himself out. My system can speak 
                        for itself.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        You’re making a mistake. You need 
                        to say something, George!
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        This is going to be over in a 
                        month. He and I on the same side of 
                        things, Bumblebee. This is just how 
                        boys plays.

                                 MARGUERITE
                             (Marching off.)
                        I’m taking a bath.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Two slender legs step out of a bathtub. A towel is pulled the 
           body is patted dry. It belongs to MARY, EDISON’s wife. She 
           bends over and dries her white thighs and then, suddenly, she 
           loses her balance and tips forward. Her hand catches the edge 
           of the sink just in the nick of time. She stands straight. 
           Breathes. She stands completely naked, staring at her hazy 
           expression in the foggy mirror. Her hand reaches up to the 
           corner of her mouth. Then, the finger touches the white 
           towel. Blood.

           INT. A DINGY ROOM IN BUFFALO NEW YORK – DAY

           ALFRED BLACK, a new character, is show at home in Buffalo, 
           New York. He’s extremely well-groomed. Everything in his 
           tiny, spare apartment is lined up at right angles – very 
           A.D.D. BLACK spins wax into his mustache. He shines his 
           shoes. BLACK lifts a hatbox from a chair, opens it and inside 
           is a turtle. He feeds a piece of lettuce to the turtle.

           EXT./ INT. BUFFALO PRISON - LATER

           BLACK walking, then joining a line of men who all look like 
           they are poor and/or drunk. The impeccable BLACK looks out of 
           place. One-by-one they file into a building, past a 
           policeman. One-by-one they take a seat on a bench. 

                                 WARDEN’S VOICE
                        Have you any last words?

           An unintelligible murmur from a distance, muffled by a sack 
           over a face.

                                 WARDEN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        God have mercy on your soul.

           The sound of a wood lever thrown and a gallows trapdoor. The 
           shot changes and to just the swinging feet of the hanged man. 
           Suddenly, the feet start to twitch. BLACK stands up, in the 
           blurred distance. The jangle of policemen and someone runs 
           over and grabs the feet his arms, like a hug, and gives them 
           a heavy YANK. The sound of a neck snapping. 
           They’d botched the hanging. BLACK, from a distance and out of 
           focus, is seen to sit back down.

           INT. TRAIN FROM BALTIMORE - NIGHT

           EDISON beside CARSON and opposite FRANCIS in the train car. 
           The country flashes through the window. Skeleton trees. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        He...he has patents from all over 
                        the world. Sweden. France. His own. 
                        Tom, I’ve looked, the lawyers have 
                        looked and Westinghouse, 
                        technically, hasn’t done 
                        anything... illegal. It’s one thing 
                        to go around saying that 
                        Westinghouse makes dangerous 
                        electricity, but the thing 
                        is...people aren’t dying. Like you 
                        always say, people have to see it 
                        to believe it.

           EDISON looks into his lap.

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        Answer the man’s letters. He wants 
                        our bulbs and we could use his 
                        current. Perfect! Everyone wins.

                                 EDISON
                        I never understood that phrase. 
                        “Everyone wins.” Don’t you see that 
                        if everyone wins, no one does?

           FRANCIS is stymied.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        People need to see it to believe 
                        it, huh? Carson?

                                 CARSON
                        Uh, yes?

                                 EDISON
                        How do they kill dogs? 
                        Say...strays? Greyhounds?

                                 CARSON
                        Gas, mostly. Sometimes they cut the 
                        throats.

           EDISON looks out into the darkness.
           INT. A DARK WOOD BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Rain pelts the windows like stones.

           EDISON, J.P. MORGAN, FRANCIS, and two other EDISON employees 
           are sitting along a fancy wooden table. On the other side are 
           two MEN OF ILL-REPUTE – crud under their nails, cheap torn 
           clothing. These are men one hires to do bad things.

                                 MAN OF ILL-REPUTE
                        Ain’t no problem. We’ll route it 
                        through Mexico, bring it up the 
                        coast.

           MORGAN looks at EDISON. EDISON hesitatingly nods. FRANCIS 
           looks distressed.

                                 MAN OF ILL-REPUTE (CONT’D)

           EXT. SHOT OF WESTINGHOUSE WABCO FACTORY - NIGHT

           Crickets. The Pittsburgh laboratory is silent. Suddenly, a 
           window is broken. MEN climb in.

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE COMPANY (WABCO) - CONTINUOUS

           Using blackjacks, they begin to smash bulbs and pieces of 
           machinery. They are searching for something. They find it. A 
           WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC AC GENERATOR.

           EXT. SHOT OF WESTINGHOUSE WABCO FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

           We see them hoist the GENERATOR onto a horse cart. They whip 
           the horses as the cart dashes off down a dirty road into the 
           night, just as NIGHT WATCHMAN ambles onto the scene and takes 
           in what has happened. His stumble turns into a run.

           EXT. MENLO PARK ESTATE - AFTERNOON

           A beautiful grass field. EDISON, MARY, and their two 
           children, DOT and DASH, are taking an evening stroll. They 
           are dressed in white. DASH is hitting a ball out into the 
           field and he runs after it. 
           EDISON holds hands with DOT, the great inventor and the 
           little girl. Behind them, in a flowing skirt, is MARY. 

                                 DOT
                        Why can’t we do this every day?

                                 MARY
                        Because your father is a busy man.

                                 EDISON
                        We do this. We do this a lot.

                                 DOT
                        No we don’t.

           DASH has retrieved the ball.

                                 EDISON
                             (To DASH)
                        Now hit it hard – aim higher than 
                        you think it can go.

           DASH licks his lips, winds up, tosses the ball up, and hits 
           it. It SOARS. EDISON, releasing DOT’s hand, begins to RACE 
           with DASH. They are laughing and DOT is giggling as the two 
           boys gain distance. EDISON tackles his son and they roll 
           through the grass. Then, a scream. 

           A shot of EDISON’s face – he knows exactly what has happened. 

           EDISON scrambles to his feet and runs through the field, back 
           to DOT who is just standing and crying. 

           A shot from above – MARY has collapsed in the grass field, 
           her flowing white skirt billowing out among the green.

           EXT. BUFFALO PRISON - NIGHT

           ALFRED BLACK is in line, again, at a hanging. 

           He tries to enter but is stopped by a guard who puts a grimy 
           hand against BLACK’s pressed, white shirt.

                                 GUARD
                        I see you at all these hangings. 

           BLACK raises his brow, as if to say, “So?”
                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        I don’t like the look’a you. 

           A brief standstill. Then, BLACK removes his billfold, takes 
           out a fistful of money, and presses it to the guard’s chest. 
           BLACK enters the hanging.

           INT. BUFFALO PRISON - CONTINUOUS

           Only BLACK’s eyes and the reflection in them, of a man 
           dropping down through the trap of the gallows. BLACK doesn’t 
           even blink.

           EXT. FILTHY STREETS OF BUFFALO, NEW YORK - DAY

           KEMMLER in the street, a horse is eating out of his cart. 
           KEMMLER sees his wife TILLIE flirting with some WELL-TO-DO 
           MAN. ELLA, their daughter, is in the street, dragging a 
           branch through the spokes of a wagon wheel. The WELL-TO-DO 
           MAN touches TILLE’s arm; she laughs.

           A carriage tears around the corner, heading directly for 
           ELLA.

           A MAN is buying an apple from KEMMLER. As KEMMLER takes out a 
           handful of change, he sees ELLA in the carriage's path. 
           KEMMLER drops the change; it spills all over the dirt. 
           KEMMLER runs to ELLA. Children, in the background, begin to 
           steal KEMMLER’s fallen change. KEMMLER grabs ELLA by the 
           waist and pulls her out of the carriage’s path just as she is 
           almost struck. KEMMLER, still carrying his daughter as though 
           she were a parcel, makes a b line directly for TILLIE. He 
           grabs her arm.

                                 TILLIE
                        Lemma’go!
           He pulls her away.

                        Is there a problem here?

                                 KEMMLER
                        There could be.

           The WELL-TO-DO MAN stares into KEMMLER’s eyes, which are grey 
           and deep. He backs off. ELLA squirms.

           WESTINGHOUSE pokes his head into an area where POPE is hard 
           at work. A sparkling new WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC GENERATOR sits 
           beside him. POPE is winding a spring around a gear.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Any word on the break in?

                                 POPE
                        Edison.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        The police haven’t –

                                 POPE
                        I don’t need the police to tell me 
                        what my gut knows is true.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Does your gut know there’s no 
                        reason why he’d want to steal one 
                        of our generators? I’ve invited him 
                        about a dozen times to meet, 
                        offering to show him how the whole 
                        thing works. I want to be partners.

                                 POPE
                        If this thing I’m building works, 
                        then you don’t need to partner on 
                        anything.
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        A motor?

                                 POPE
                        That’s Edison’s only advantage with 
                        DC. But when I’m done – 

           The spring flies out of his hand.

                                 POPE (CONT’D)
                        Damn arthritis.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Just be careful. 

                                 POPE
                        It’s a brand new generator and I 
                        know what I’m doin’. I’d rather die 
                        at the workbench then in my bed 
                        anyway.

           This kind of talk makes WESTINGHOUSE uncomfortable.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Yes, well. I don’t like the way the 
                        winds are blowing these days.

           INT. EDISON’S BEDROOM, MENLO PARK - CONTINUOUS

           A shot from above of the bed. MARY is unconscious. On either 
           side of the bed are EDISON’s best friends MR. and MRS. 
           GILLIAND, EDISON, DOT, DASH, and the DOCTOR.

           Then, a shot down the bed. At the wall above the pillow is a 
           wooden cross.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Anything you can do to settle her 
                        heart; to lessen the stress, the 
                        better.

           MRS. GILLIAND puts her hands on the childrens’ necks.

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        Come on, children, your Momma needs 
                        some sleep. Let’s have a bowl of 
                        cherry ice cream. 
                             (Leading them out.)
                        Mmmm. I like to dig for the 
                        cherries like treasures, lost in 
                        the sand...
           The DOCTOR packs his medicine bag. MRS. GILLIAND starts to 
           follow her husband when she is stopped, on the arm, by 
           EDISON. He points at the cross.

                                 EDISON
                        What’s that doing up there?

                                 MRS. GILLIAND
                        I...it’s what you DO when someone 
                        is ill.

                                 EDISON
                        Not here.

                                 MRS GILLIAND
                        Oh Tom, it could only help.

                                 EDISON
                        Not. Here.

           MRS. GILLIAND exits. The doctor is about to exit when he 
           stops and addresses EDISON.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You aren’t looking well yourself, 
                        Mr. Edison. I recommend that you 
                        stay here on the farm. With Mary. 
                        You’re getting older. Take some 
                        time off and you’ll return with 
                        twice the energy.

           EDISON shakes the DOCTOR’s hand.

                                 EDISON
                        Thank you. I will.

           A LOUD brass fanfare!

           EXT. MICHIGAN PUBLIC SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           Shot of EDISON from behind. He’s dressed better than normal. 
           He stands tall. On a wooden platform, he’s addressing a sea 
           of adoring fans and members of the press. People wave small 
           American flags and hoist their children in the air. In the 
           distance, white clapboard buildings are draped with bunting. 
           A banner reads: MICHIGAN WELCOMES HOME THOMAS EDISON. Then, 
           EDISON’s face – tight.
                                 EDISON
                        I will not rest. I will not sleep. 
                        I will not kick off my shoes and 
                        lay down my head ‘til you are safe.

           The crowd cheers. EDISON smiles broadly.

                             (He points.)
                        When I was seven, I was arrested 
                        for trying out my flying machine 
                        from the top of that building, back 
                        when it was the library. My father 
                        made me spend a night in lock-up.

           The crowd laughs.

                        But why read a book when I have 
                        living proof? 
                             (Calling off–)
                        Francis?

           The band plays and FRANCIS leads on a huge brown work horse.

           The horse doesn’t want to go up on the platform and FRANCIS 
           tugs hard at the reins.
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                             (Smiling.)
                        Oh! I don’t blame Gus! He’s smarter 
                        than the average consumer.

           FRANCIS gives a hard YANK on the reins and the horse clops up 
           onto the platform. The crowd cheers. As EDISON speaks, 
           FRANCIS attaches leather straps with metal coils to the 
           horse’s feet and a huge leather and metal girdle around its 
           mid-section. 

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        A month ago, an order was given for 
                        Gus to become glue. Very sad, but 
                        just as we like bacon with our 
                        eggs, this is the way life goes. I 
                        asked Lawrence Reighter, Gus’s 
                        owner, if he might let Gus live an 
                        extra month, such that Gus might be 
                        dispatched from this world without 
                        a trace of pain. Mr. Reighter is 
                        with us today and I would like us 
                        all to give him a hand.

           Applause. A 250-pound farmer with full beard waves, 
           stoically, from among the crowd.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        My assistant is connecting Gus to a 
                        Westinghouse Alternating Current 
                        Generator. Mind you, this is the 
                        EXACT SAME GENERATOR that towns 
                        across America are investin’ in...

           The camera pans along more open and trusting faces.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)

                        The EXACT SAME GENERATOR people are 
                        using to power their schools, their 
                        churches...their homes.

           The crowd looks shocked.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        You may wonder how I, the 
                        “competition,” obtained one. 
                        Well...

           EDISON smiles a coy smile and lifts an eyebrow.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I got one.
           EDISON winks and the crowd cheers. EDISON turns to the 
           generator, but quickly takes a step back to the crowd.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Oh! There’s no word yet coined to 
                        define “death by electricity.” I’ve 
                        spoken with men at Universities, 
                        with the men who write the 
                        dictionary, heck, I even asked my 
                        own son Dash. And I heard back a 
                        few suggestions: Electro-dite, 
                        Electra-cremate, Flash-a-boom! 
                        (That’s my favorite!)

           The crowd laughs.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        But just as the French doctor Joe 
                        Guillotine is given credit for his 
                        invention, I just can’t see how we 
                        could deprive the rightful inventor 
                        of Death-By-Electrity of his due 
                        credit.

           FRANCIS has completed attaching the horse to the generator.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Let’s ‘Westinghouse’ this horsey. 
                        Whattaya say?

           The crowd cheers. As EDISON speaks, we see that also in the 
           crowd is ALFRED BLACK, the curious attendee of every hanging. 
           He looks on with keen, but emotionless, interest. EDISON 
           walks over the generator. He looks to FRANCIS. FRANCIS nods, 
           looking uncomfortable. 

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I now ask that women and children 
                        look away. A-One-and-a-Two-and-a...

           EDISON flips the switch and a RUMBLE and ZAP are heard. Then, 
           the sound of a horse falling onto a wooden stage, but this 
           coincides with a flashbulb and photograph of EDISON shaking 
           hands with the mayor, who holds up a copy of EDISON’s book 
           WARNING! The band strikes up a buoyant, patriotic march!

           EXT. EDISON AMONG THE PEOPLE - CONTINUOUS

           A dense circle has formed around EDISON as he signs their 
           WARNING! books with a thick, black pencil. ALFRED BLACK sews 
           his way to the center of the circle and EDISON takes BLACK’s 
           book and scribbles a signature.
                                 BLACK
                        Excuse me, Mr. Edison. My name is 
                        Dr. Alfred Black.

                                 EDISON
                        To Dr. Alfred Black–

                                 BLACK
                        May I have a word with you? 
                        briefly?

                                 EDISON
                        Can’t slow down, Dr. I have people 
                        to save, I’m sure you understand.

                                 BLACK
                        Yes, yes I do, but...I’ve come to 
                        Michigan under directive of the 
                        Governor of New York.

           EDISON’s eyebrows rise. He squints at BLACK. 

                                 BLACK (CONT’D)
                        It is of grave importance.

                                 EDISON
                             (Considering.)
                        Let’s meet on the steps of the old 
                        library at one. But for now –

           A flashbulb goes off.

           Laughter and a PUFF of smoke.

           EXT. LIBRARY STEPS - A BIT LATER

           The smoke dissipates and EDISON is found sitting alone on the 
           top step of six limestone stairs leading to the old library. 
           He looks around the picturesque town square - pure Americana. 
           A small boy, in the distance, rounds a corner. The boy stops 
           at the base of the steps, a few feet from the inventor.

                                 EDISON
                        What’s your name?

                                 THE BOY
                             (Not interested in being 
                              delayed.)
                        Tom.

                                 EDISON
                        A good solid name.

           The BOY kicks the dirt and looks up at the sky.
                                 THE BOY
                        I think it’s gonna rain.

           EDISON looks up at the clouds.

                                 EDISON
                        Oh no...it’s just the passin’ of 
                        the clouds.

                                 THE BOY
                        I think it’s gonna rain.

           EDISON stares at the boy. 

                                 EDISON
                        What’s your last name, son?

                                 THE BOY
                        I’m gonna jump off that library.

           EDISON squints, looking hard at the boy.

                                 EDISON
                        ...What?

                                 BLACK
                        Mr. Edison?

           EDISON looks up sharply. At the base of the steps stands 
           ALFRED BLACK. The boy is gone. Vanished into vapor.

                                 EDISON
                        Uh...yes sir?

                                 BLACK
                        I am Dr. Alfred Black. I have been 
                        hired by the Governor of New York 
                        to discover a method of humane 
                        execution.

                                 EDISON
                        For...

                                 BLACK
                        For homo sapiens.

           A far shot of the two men in the empty town square. Then, 
           BLACK’s earnest face.

                                 BLACK (CONT’D)
                        You’ve no doubt read of the series 
                        of botched hangings in the 
                        Northeast? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLACK (CONT’D)
                        Men who find their counter-balance 
                        inadequately calculated – they 
                        either choke to death or they 
                        discover their heads 
                        immediately...displaced.

                                 EDISON
                        No doubt.

                                 BLACK
                        They blink, Mr. Edison. I’ve seen 
                        it. The dismembered head will blink 
                        40 seconds after separation.

           FRANCIS approaches, carrying too many bags for his comfort, 
           slung from his shoulders. He listens to the conversation.

                                 BLACK (CONT’D)
                        A human weighs a fraction of a 
                        horse. If you were to help–

                                 EDISON
                        That is beyond my interest, sir.

           EDISON stands.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        The United States military has 
                        attempted for years to use my brain 
                        to build weaponry. A micro-poison. 
                        A...floating death-ray. I won’t do 
                        it. There’s a big difference 
                        between a man and a horse.
                             (To FRANCIS.)
                        Is all ready?

                                 FRANCIS
                        All aboard.

           EDISON begins to exit.

                                 BLACK
                        God humanely brings us into this 
                        world. Why would you reject the 
                        opportunity of being the first man 
                        to humanely take us out of it?

           EDISON walks away with FRANCIS.

                                 FRANCIS
                        What was that about?

           BLACK calls out to EDISON who is almost too far away for this 
           desperate outburst:
                                 BLACK
                        You realize that no one will ever 
                        buy the electricity system that is 
                        explicitly used to kill a human 
                        being?

           INT. / EXT. ANIMAL EXECUTIONS IN TOWNS ACROSS AMERICA - 
           DAY/NIGHT

           Montage Six – aka - Death Menagerie

           The band strikes back up and the drums roar.

           We go into a montage of ANIMAL EXECUTIONS:

           Stray cat led up to a platform – ZAP!

           Stray dogs led up to a platform – ZAP!

           EDISON, touting his book, shaking it to heavens. The lever on 
           the ridiculously labeled WESTINGHOUSE generator being pulled 
           again and again. 

           Westinghousing a snarling hog – ZAP!

           Westinghousing another horse – ZAP!

           A shot of CARSON looking on with disgust, he walks away from 
           the demonstration shaking his head.

           Westinghousing a huge milk cow – ZAP!

           Shots of WESTINGHOUSE hounded by reporters; WESTINGHOUSE 
           retreating to his office where he is sweating profusely. He 
           undoes his shirt collar. Sweat streams down his face. 

           Four sheep – ZAP! ZAP! ZAP! ZAP!

           Westinghousing a zebra – ZAP!

           A pony wanders the front lawn of WESTINGHOUSE’s home. A sign 
           tied over its back reads: “KILLER.” Two WESTINGHOUSE servants 
           try to catch it, but the pony trots quickly, eluding them.

           INT. EDISON’S HOUSE - EVENING

           In a darkened hallway, where paisley wallpaper and wooden 
           floors seem to stretch to infinity, EDISON and FRANCIS are 
           having it out. FRANCIS is dressed up.
                                 EDISON
                        Cats, dogs, sheep, eleven HORSES. 
                        What more do they need to see – the 
                        entire London Zoo!? Westinghouse’s 
                        system is dangerous!

                                 FRANCIS
                        The problem is that no one IS dying 
                        from Westinghouse’s system except 
                        your cats, dogs, sheep, and eleven 
                        horses.

                                 EDISON
                        Pay the reporters again to 
                        reinforce that my system will move 
                        MOTORS. Westinghouse’s DC can’t. 
                        Edison makes electric engines. 
                        Edison makes electric elevators! 

                                 FRANCIS
                        The trouble is not many homes are 
                        going to be buying elevators or 
                        train engines. People are shopping 
                        for light.

           EDISON kicks the wall behind him with the heal of his foot.

                                 EDISON
                        What’s with the duds?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Carson is introducing me to his 
                        daughter.

                                 EDISON
                        That little girl who’s yay high?!

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Uncomfortable to be 
                              talking about girls with 
                              EDISON.)
                        No...The older one...

           They look at one another a moment.

                                 EDISON
                        So you’re just taking the day off?

                                 FRANCIS
                        It’s nighttime, Tom.

           EDISON stares at the floor, not knowing what else to say. 
           FRANCIS claws a handwritten letter out of his vest pocket and 
           tries to get EDISON to take it, but EDISON won’t even look. 
                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        Look, this is a peace pipe. 
                        Westinghouse is CREDITING you with 
                        leading the charge. The man is 
                        ignoring every single one of your 
                        attacks and still wants to meet! 
                        How much longer can we afford to 
                        ignore his generosity? 

                                 EDISON
                        My wife is DYING in that room 
                        because of this competition. Don’t 
                        you see that?

           FRANCIS is silent.

                                 FRANCIS
                        At least look at this paper!

                                 EDISON
                        I will go down in history as the 
                        sole creator. You hear me?

           EDISON puts his hand on the knob to his wife’s room.

                                 FRANCIS
                        What about the 400 of us who helped 
                        the sole creator...

           EDISON ignores FRANCIS and enters his wife’s room. The scene 
           fades to black and then we are suddenly brought to the 
           haggard and drunken face of:

           INT. BUFFALO BAR - EVENING

           WILLIAM KEMMLER. He drinks a large glass of whiskey. Several 
           empty glasses surround him. In the corner of the bar, the 
           only other guest, a DRUNKEN LOON, is goading KEMMLER.

                                 DRUNKEN LOON
                        An’ you know what, Willy? 

           KEMMLER sips on the glass of whiskey. 

                                 DRUNKEN LOON (CONT’D)
                        If my wife fucked every man in 
                        town, it wouldn’t bother me that 
                        she moved onto goats. I mean, where 
                        do ya go once you’ve fucked every 
                        man in town? It jus’ makes sense.

           The DRUNKEN LOON laughs hysterically to himself.
                                 DRUNKEN LOON (CONT’D)
                        I saw...
                             (He throws back two shots 
                              of rye.)
                        She had her fingers halfway up the 
                        goat’s rectory, ya know what I 
                        mean? I mean, what was she lookin’ 
                        for? Diamonds?

           He laughs hysterically. KEMMLER stares at the table top.

                                 DRUNKEN LOON (CONT’D)
                        That is...unless you ain’t sampling 
                        her goods at all. In that 
                        situation, I’d be the goat any day 
                        of the week.

           KEMMLER bursts to his feet and just stands. The LOON goes 
           quiet. Is KEMMLER gonna beat the shit out of him? What’s 
           going to happen? KEMMLER sways a moment, then erupts out the 
           doorway as the bartender calls…

                                 BARTENDER
                        Ay Kemmler!! You gotta pay for...

           EXT. BUFFALO STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The camera moves haphazardly down the street. KEMMLER is on a 
           rampage, barely able to see straight, and certainly unable to 
           walk straight. He staggers into a horse trough and the water 
           spills suddenly, flowing down the dirt path. KEMMLER breaks 
           into a run. He’s seeing double. He turns a bend, nearly 
           knocking into a young couple kissing.

                                 WOMAN IN COUPLE
                        Watch it!

           KEMMLER turns another corner and passes several houses. He 
           then reaches his doorstep, fumbling for his key. He tries to 
           fit it into the lock, but his drunkenness prevents him from 
           making contact with the keyhole. He scratches several nicks 
           into the knob. Then, he stops suddenly. He stares at the 
           knob. After all that, he simply turns the knob and it opens. 

           INT. KEMMLER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A closet is flung open. A hand grabs an axe.

           INT. KEMMLER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bedroom door is flung open. The axe approaches a sleeping 
           body. A hand fastens onto the sleeping body’s arm. 
           TILLIE bolts upright in bed. Her eyes are wide. They fix on 
           the intruder.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK. 

           INT. KEMMLER’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Silence.

           Two eyelids open. It’s morning as orange streams into a 
           kitchen. It’s blurry. It all comes into focus. KEMMLER is 
           sitting on the kitchen floor, his back against the cabinets. 
           He’s hungover. From first look, it seems nothing is awry. 
           Then, the camera slowly pulls back a few feet and reveals the 
           mutilated body of his wife TILLIE, in a huge pool of blood. 
           KEMMLER looks over. He registers what he’s done.

           EXT. BUFFALO STREETS - MORNING

           KEMMLER walks through the streets, his wife’s blood 
           splattered all over him. People move to the side as he slowly 
           passes. KEMMLER approaches the Buffalo Police Station.

           INT. BUFFALO POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           A man, WARDEN DURSTON, is reading the morning paper at the 
           front desk. He has a warm cup of coffee and a fresh roll. The 
           paper says something about “Niagara Falls.” He looks up at 
           the blood-soaked KEMMLER.

                                 DURSTON
                        William?

                                 KEMMLER
                        I done killed my wife. Gimme the 
                        rope.

           DURSTON takes in this information. He sets down the paper. 

           INT. NEWARK CAFE - EVENING

           CARSON, FRANCIS, and EMMA (CARSON’s daughter), sit around the 
           remains of supper. EMMA is petite, but has a spunky nature, 
           similar to MARGUERITE’s. The men drink coffee; EMMA sips tea.

                                 FRANCIS
                             (On a passionate and 
                              youthful tirade.)
                        And you’ve seen the map. 
                        Westinghouse is beating us on a 
                        ratio four-to-one. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                        The Thomas Edison is traveling 
                        around with the DC generator on the 
                        back of a wagon, putting on shows 
                        like some kinda...door-to-door 
                        potion salesman. Do you wanna know 
                        how many bootleg phonographs are 
                        going to be on the market – on 
                        actual STORE SHELVES – come June?

                                 CARSON
                        No. No I honestly don’t.

           FRANCIS is taken aback.

                                 CARSON (CONT’D)
                        Francis, if you’re always looking 
                        to find the fastest way to the 
                        future, ya won’t ever enjoy what’s 
                        here and now.

           FRANCIS looks at EMMA.

                                 CARSON (CONT’D)
                        Francis, I...I’m retiring.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You haven’t even worked a year!

                                 CARSON
                        I’ve been having some health 
                        matters...it’s just – I gotta get 
                        my energy up or it’s toes up.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh don’t you talk like that!

                                 FRANCIS
                        Retiring?

                                 CARSON
                        I’m old. Look at me. An old man. I 
                        thought I had a bit more adventure 
                        in me than I did.
                             (CARSON stands.)
                        I’m going to visit the necessary. 

           CARSON walks off.

                                 FRANCIS
                        I don’t understand.
                                 EMMA
                        Killing animals? Peddling a system 
                        that everyone knows is inferior 
                        just because Mr. Edison didn’t 
                        decide on AC at the start. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        It’s easy to see the path if you 
                        can turnaround–

                                 EMMA
                        No. What Mr. Edison is doing is 
                        clinging onto a bad idea because of 
                        pride. And my father doesn’t have 
                        the stomach for that sort of thing.

           FRANCIS is floored. He takes a sip of coffee.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        And though I just met you, Francis, 
                        I don’t think you have the stomach 
                        for it either.

           FRANCIS looks into her eyes.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Now can we please stop talking 
                        about electricity start discussing 
                        important things like the weather!

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE COMPANY (WABCO) - NIGHT

           3:18 AM in the cavernous, sleeping factory. POPE, on his 
           back, is in small crawl space looking upwards at a mess of 
           wiring. The thin, copper wires are tangled and look like 
           human ligaments. POPE squints and tries to get at a loose 
           connection with needle nose pliers.

                                 POPE
                        C’mere ya bugger.

           A sudden ‘zap’ and flash of light. A shot of POPE’s feet 
           kicking up once, and then straight down.

           EXT. WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE COMPANY (WABCO) - MORNING

           MARGUERITE, bustling, carries a paper sack and enters WABCO.

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE COMPANY (WABCO) - CONTINUOUS

           MARGUERITE walks along the factory floor, her white dress 
           dragging along the sawdust. WORKERS nod and wish her “good 
           day.” 
                                 MARGUERITE
                        Hello...Good morning, etc.

           MARGUERITE approaches WESTINGHOUSE’s office door; she opens 
           it suddenly.

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           WESTINGHOUSE stands in front of his desk and FOUR MEN IN 
           SUITS stand opposite him. Laid out on his desk is a long line 
           of papers and WESTINGHOUSE signs them one-by-one. He looks up 
           when the MARGUERITE enters.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Marguerite! Gentlemen, this is my

                        A pleasure, Mrs. Westinghouse.

           MARGUERITE laughs.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        And you are?

                        Very nice to meet you. My husband 
                        has forgotten his lunch!

           She tries to hand it to him, but WESTINGHOUSE has reached 
           into his desk and produced a lunch sack.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You mean, this?

           MARGUERITE smiles.
                                 MARGUERITE
                        Looks like Sally has made you two 
                        lunches.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’ll take it!

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Oh no! While you worry about the 
                        middle of the United States, I 
                        worry about the middle of you. I’ll 
                        give it to Franklin, he never eats.

                        Should be around the corner.

                        Gentlemen.

           They nod. MARGUERITE blows a kiss to her husband and exits 
           the office.

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE COMPANY (WABCO) - CONTINUOUS

           Back on the factory floor, MARGUERITE walks around an iron 
           caldron the size of a whale. She reaches a door whose window 
           reads: FRANKLIN POPE, MASTER ELECTRICIAN. MARGUERITE knocks, 
           but no answer. MARGUERITE opens the door.

           INT. FRANK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The floor is absolutely covered with gears, springs, tools, 
           and the prototype motor. MARGUERITE smiles at POPE’s mess. 
           But POPE is not there.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Franklin?

           MARGUERITE’s gaze settles on a gleaming copper wire that 
           snakes through the debris. She follows the wire, like a maze, 
           out a second door, a half-sized door, to the rear.

           INT. SPACE OUTSIDE FRANK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           MARGUERITE ducks into this crawl space and calls out.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Franklin??

           MARGUERITE, hunched, sniffs. Her eyes register a bad smell.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Frank?
           MARGUERITE bends and picks up the wire with her hands and 
           follows it, like a guide, into the darkness. Her steps slow 
           and she almost hits her head.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Ow.

           Still, she continues, hand-over-hand, around a turn, through 
           a jungle gym of pipes...down a single step, and around one 
           more turn. Then, a close shot of MARGUERITE’s body lurching 
           forward, taking in what she sees.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Oh...

           INT. EDISON’S BEDROOM, MENLO PARK - NIGHT

           EDISON sits in a chair beside his bed, where his pale wife 
           MARY sleeps. EDISON’s pen rests on a notebook. He’s written 
           the word “OPTIONS:” MARY’s eyes flutter a little. She moans.

                                 MARY
                        Tom?

                                 EDISON
                             (Looking up, suddenly.)
                        I’m here.

                                 MARY
                        Tom.

                                 EDISON
                        I’m here. Tell me what you want.

           She says nothing.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        There’s good news, my dear. Men 
                        want to use Niagara Falls to power 
                        the entire Eastern Seaboard. If I 
                        can get that contract, do you know 
                        what that would mean for our 
                        company?

           MARY doesn’t respond. Her eyes close back a sleep. Her 
           breasts rise and lower the bed sheet. EDISON sighs a sigh of 
           relief. He returns to his notebook and sees that his fountain 
           pen has created a black void next to the word “OPTIONS:”

           INT. BEDROOM OF WESTINGHOUSE - EVENING

           WESTINGHOUSE, solemn and broken, sits at the foot of the bed. 
           MARGUERITE is a hurricane.
                                 MARGUERITE
                        I’ll never get it out of my head. 
                        Never. The smell. Do you know what 
                        burning human flesh smells like?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I do. The Civil War afforded me–

                                 MARGUERITE
                        I assume you’ve contacted his son?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        We’re trying to locate him. They 
                        hadn’t spoken in years. Bumblebee?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Don’t call me that.

           WESTINGHOUSE begins to pull of his socks.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Forgetting that the papers will 
                        DRINK THIS UP – forgetting that 
                        Edison will use Franklin’s death as 
                        a tactic –

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        He won’t. The man has principles.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        If he has them, they’ve gone 
                        missing long ago.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        It was a horrible accident. 

           MARGUERITE stops and looks her husband in the eye.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        You do not have the abilities to 
                        deal with what this means. I’ve had 
                        your secretaries contact men from 
                        each of the seven main New York 
                        papers. Tomorrow afternoon you will 
                        speak with them and explain that 
                        you are dismantling Westinghouse 
                        Electric and returning to what you 
                        love to do – building brakes which 
                        actually save human lives.

           Silence.
                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear what I said? I said 
                        you will tell the papers tomorrow 
                        that you are dissolving your 
                        company. You will sell off all your 
                        contracts. Sell them to Edison for 
                        all I care, but we are getting out 
                        of this deadly business.

           WESTINGHOUSE looks at her. He blinks.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you dare protest.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I’m not.

           MARGUERITE softens. She kneels before her husband and puts 
           her arms around him.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        He was your friend.

           WESTINGHOUSE, choked up, just nods.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        Let us try to rest. Soon all this 
                        terribleness will be over.

           INT. MENLO PARK FACTORY OF THOMAS EDISON - LATE EVENING

           EDISON sits at a long table, eating a piece of peach pie. 
           Next to him, DOT twists a piece of copper wire, playing with 
           it, forming it into the shape of a person. FRANCIS is 
           standing before the huge map. The bulbs are red, 4:1 
           WESTINGHOUSE.

                                 FRANCIS
                        What else do you want from me? We 
                        can’t scare them. Unless you can 
                        figure a cheaper way for DC current-

                                 EDISON
                        My system works! It’s not BAD!

           CARSON approaches the wooden map of the United States and 
           tries to carefully changes a few white bulbs to red without 
           EDISON’s notice. It doesn’t work.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        What the HELL are you doing, 
                        quitter! If you want to quit, quit. 
                        Leave. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need you to stay out the 
                        week but don’t you touch that GOD 
                        DAMNED map.

           DOT looks up at her father, recognizing the anger.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Cities you’ve won are switching. 
                        They’re eating the cost. Something 
                        has to change.

                                 DOT
                        Daddy?

                                 EDISON
                             (To his daughter.)
                        Please, monkey, quiet.

           DOT resumes twisting her wire. CARSON and FRANCIS stand in 
           front of the map. Their expression says, “What now?” 
           Suddenly, the phone rings. FRANCIS walks over and answers. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        It’s J.P. MORGAN.

                                 EDISON
                        Hang it up.

           A stand-off. Both parties know he has to take the call. 
           EDISON stands and approaches the receiver.

           INT. J.P. MORGAN’S LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Dark wood, dark green carpet. Almost like a hunting lodge. 
           Crimson books line the shelves. An enormous Lion’s head is 
           set above a roaring fire. MORGAN speaks into the telephone.

                                 MORGAN
                        I have word that Westinghouse is 
                        hosting a press event tomorrow. He 
                        must be expanding overseas.

                                 EDISON
                        They love me in Paris.

                                 MORGAN
                        We are hemorrhaging money. Get on 
                        the train. Come immediately.

                                 EDISON
                        You’re ordering me?
                                 MORGAN
                        Get ON a train, Edison. I’m not a 
                        wallet.

           Silence on the line.

                                 EDISON
                             (In a quieter tone.)
                        My wife is dying, Pierpont. I can’t 
                        leave New Jersey.

                                 MORGAN
                        This is not a request.

           J.P. MORGAN hangs up the receiver.

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE’S BATHROOM - MORNING

           WESTINGHOUSE stands, in underpants, at the mirror. He shaves. 
           MARGUERITE, groggy, passes behind him. She stops and points 
           to a spot on his cheek that he missed. She kisses him lightly 
           on the shoulder and passes by. WESTINGHOUSE shaves the spot.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - LATER

           It’s 4 A.M. The first train of the day. EDISON is in a 
           rumpled suit-and-tie. His eyes are bloodshot. He has a small 
           notebook and tries to think of ideas. He’s written down: 
           “Electro-Hammer, Electro–Drill, Electro-Shovel.” He puts down 
           the pencil and looks out the window as the train begins to 
           lurch forward. He watches the sun rise over the tiger lilies 
           and buzzing dragonflies. He’s Manhattan bound.

           INT. BUFFALO PRISON - MORNING

           KEMMLER is led into his cell. It’s small, dusty, and bleak. A 
           tiny, barred window looks out onto a brown, Buffalo morning. 
           The metal door clangs shut. Kemmler slowly lowers himself 
           down onto the dirt floor.

           INT. BLACK’S HOME - MORNING

           BLACK is home, running a comb through his wet hair. He twists 
           wax in his mustache. He reaches into a paper bag and crosses 
           to a box. He feeds a lettuce leaf to his turtle.

           EXT. WESTINGHOUSE’S BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING

           WESTINGHOUSE, dressed up for reporters, takes his cup of 
           coffee. Beside him is a stack of mail and the ‘EDISON’ carved 
           letter opener. WESTINGHOUSE picks it up, looking at it a 
           moment. The sound of a doorbell. WESTINGHOUSE sighs.
           INT. TRAIN CAR - MORNING

           EDISON has fallen asleep. The car jolts to a stop. EDISON 
           wakes with the motion. He looks down at his notebook and sees 
           he’s written: “Electro-Westinghouuuu.” He closes the book 
           quickly. Out the window is rising steam and smoke. He’s in 
           New York.

           INT. CARRIAGE THROUGH THE STREETS OF NEW YORK - LATER

           EDISON in carriage, looking out at the dirty streets of 
           Manhattan, at the poor lined up for breakfast.

           EXT. WESTINGHOUSE’S GARDEN - MORNING

           REPORTERS are easing into wooden lawn chairs, arranged in a 
           semi-circle before a lectern. SERVANTS offer them scones and 
           coffee.

           EXT. CARRIAGE ARRIVING AT THE HOUSE OF J.P. MORGAN - LATER

           Wearily, EDISON steps down from the carriage in front of 
           MORGAN’s monstrous house. EDISON takes it in.

           INT. HOUSE OF J.P. MORGAN - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON is brought into MORGAN’s dark study where he waits. 
           EDISON refuses coffee. He just waits.

           INT. BUFFALO COURT ROOM - MORNING

           KEMMLER stands before a judge in an all-wood courtroom. 
           KEMMLER is cleaner. His beard is trimmed. His hair is parted. 
           KEMMLER has no attorney. KEMMLER turns to the back of the 
           court room and sees his daughter ELLA sitting next to a WOMAN 
           OF THE STATE. The JUDGE, a very fat man with a moonface, 
           takes a quick sip from a cup of coffee and clears his throat.

                                 JUDGE
                        What say you, William Kemmler?

                                 KEMMLER
                        I done killed my wife.

           INT. HOUSE OF J.P. MORGAN - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON continues to wait. He checks his pocket watch. He is 
           restless.

           INT. BUFFALO COURT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The JUDGE nods to a squirrely BAILIFF who brings over a 
           wooden portable writing desk with a fountain pen, ink well, 
           and written confession.
                                 JUDGE
                        Your wife–

                                 KEMMLER
                        Tillie. I done killed Tillie.

           The judge nods again and the BAILIFF hands KEMMLER the pen. 
           The BAILIFF points to a line where KEMMLER must sign. After a 
           moment, KEMMLER slowly draws an ‘X’ across the line. He’s 
           illiterate. The BAILIFF whisks the writing desk away.

                                 JUDGE
                        William Kemmler. This court rules 
                        that you shall hang by the neck 
                        until you cease to breathe.

           He brings down his gavel. KEMMLER stares forward, 
           emotionless. ELLA is led out of the courtroom by a WOMAN OF 
           THE STATE. The little girl is too young to really know what’s 
           happening.

           EXT. WESTINGHOUSE’S GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           All seven of the REPORTERS are sitting, drinking coffee, and 
           buzzing with anticipation regarding the mysterious 
           announcement to come...

           INT. MORGAN’S STUDY - MORNING

           EDISON has started to doze again when the door to MORGAN’s 
           study flies open and MORGAN enters, downing a cup of hot 
           coffee and munching on a croissant, the crumbs falling across 
           his broad stomach and gold chain. EDISON stands.

                                 MORGAN
                             (Through bites of 
                              croissant.)
                        Has your phonograph gone to market?

           EDISON shakes his head.

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D)
                        Why the hell not?

                                 EDISON
                        It will. But...the clock is running 
                        out on electricity and I need more 
                        time–

                                 MORGAN
                        That’s just bad business, Edison. 
                        The phonograph could PAY for the DC 
                        generators you’re giving to towns 
                        for FREE.
                                 EDISON
                        I give them the generators so that 
                        they’ll have no choice but to pay 
                        for the electricity–

                                 MORGAN
                        Westinghouse SELLS his generators. 
                        Profit. Profit. God knows what he’s 
                        telling the papers today and your 
                        refusal to abandon your flawed 
                        system–

                                 EDISON
                        My system is NOT flawed. It works–

                                 MORGAN
                        Your REFUSAL to adopt 
                        Westinghouse’s current is causing 
                        me to hemorrhage money. EDISON 
                        ELECTRIC is tanking faster than–

                                 EDISON
                        This will all change soon–

                                 MORGAN
                        You change your current or you lose 
                        my funding. You get it?

                                 EDISON
                        Yeah, yeah–

                                 MORGAN
                        No. I don’t think you’re listening. 
                        Do you know how much of “your” 
                        company I own? One snap of my 
                        fingers–

                                 EDISON
                        You make me come to Manhattan to 
                        tell me this? You could have told 
                        me over the telephone. 

                                 MORGAN
                        If I ask for someone, they come. 
                        That’s how it works!

           EDISON walks over to the richest man on earth.

                                 EDISON
                        No. Here is how it works: I 
                        captured sound in a box. I caught 
                        lightning in a jar. I build 
                        miracles. You are nothing more than 
                        grease. My wife is dying. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDISON (CONT'D)
                        You will continue to give me as 
                        much money as I for. I’m Thomas 
                        Alva Edison.

           EDISON gathers his things and walks to the door, not even 
           turning while he says–

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ever summon me again.

           EXT. THE HOUSE OF MORGAN - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON climbs into the carriage and closes the door.

                                 DRIVER
                             (To horses, cracking his 
                              crop to their rumps..)
                        Heee-ya!

           The carriage begins to roll away.

           INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A hand suddenly appears at the glass of the door and BANGS 
           furiously. EDISON jumps.

                                 EDISON
                             (Knocking his fist on the 
                              roof.)
                        Stop! Stop!

           The carriage stops and one of MORGAN’s BUTLERS opens the door 
           of the carriage.

                                 BUTLER
                        Excuse me, Mr. Edison. A Francis 
                        Upton just telephoned?

           A horse kicks his foot in the dirt.

                                 EDISON
                        She’s dead, isn’t she?

           EXT. WESTINGHOUSE’S GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           The glass door to WESTINGHOUSE’s home opens and the man 
           himself strides to the lectern. The REPORTERS quiet 
           themselves.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Good morning.

                                 REPORTERS
                        Good morning.
           MARGUERITE stands in the open doorway to the house.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Yesterday, my head electrician 
                        Franklin Leonard Pope, was killed 
                        in an accident at the factory–

                                 A REPORTER
                        Was alternating current electricity 
                        the cause of death?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Electricity was the cause of death. 
                        It was an accident and –

                                 ANOTHER REPORTER
                        Mr. Westinghouse – does this mean 
                        that Thomas Edison’s attacks are 
                        not spurious?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Not spurious...

           MARGUERITE takes in a large breath.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, if you will please allow 
                        me to say...

           WESTINGHOUSE trails off. He looks into the garden, beyond the 
           MEN. He’s silent. The MEN look at one another, confused. The 
           morning sunlight is ripping through the forest beyond the 
           garden. It causes WESTINGHOUSE to squint.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Frank and I began Westinghouse 
                        Electric as an experiment. Up in 
                        Great Barrington, the little town 
                        that bore Frank, we wanted to 
                        show...the world that there was a 
                        better way to illuminate.

           MARGUERITE licks her lips.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        What was just a seedling has 
                        blossomed into the de facto 
                        standard of electricity 
                        distribution. And...

           A close-up on MARGUERITE’s face. Then –
                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Though I mourn the loss of a great 
                        friend, misfortune does not trump 
                        progress. And as Franklin Pope 
                        would no doubt wish – Westinghouse 
                        Electric shall endure. Thank you.

           WESTINGHOUSE leaves the lectern; the reporters are 
           speechless. WESTINGHOUSE passes his wife in the doorway.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Cream will rise. I’m sorry.

           MARGUERITE stops him.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        That’s it? Cream will rise? George, 
                        you’re not a fighter and yet I 
                        think I just heard you declare war.

           WESTINGHOUSE reaches into his pocket and pulls the ‘EDISON’ 
           letter opener. He takes the letter opener and, in one swift 
           motion, stabs it into the door frame. It sticks, easily.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        My dear, I think you just did. I’m 
                        going to New York.

           EXT. HOME OF ALFRED BLACK - DAY

           A knock at the door. BLACK opens it, a stack of books tucked 
           under his arm. A MESSENGER stands on the step.

                                 MESSENGER
                        Dr. Black?

           BLACK nods. The MESSENGER hands BLACK a telegram. 

           BLACK’s eyes light up with fire as he reads...

           EXT. CORNFIELDS OUTSIDE THE EDISON HOUSE – DARK

           The stars are shining pinholes through the dark. EDISON, in 
           loose shirt and trousers, stands in the same field of light 
           from the beginning of the film, except the bulbs are off. 
           Clear glass balls covered in mud and gnats, they don’t seem 
           so magical anymore. Some have broken. One seems to be 
           supporting a bird’s nest. Across a bulb, like a crystal ball, 
           is ALFRED BLACK. He’s impeccably dressed. The two men speak 
           in hushed voices.
                                 EDISON
                        Two conditions. One: Your electric 
                        chair must use WESTINGHOUSE brand 
                        electricity. You must make that 
                        very well known.

                                 BLACK
                        Of course.

                                 EDISON
                        The generator from the animal 
                        executions...you may have it.

                                 BLACK
                        Thank you.

                                 EDISON
                        Two: My name must NEVER be 
                        associated with your death chair. 
                        It is the first and only credit I 
                        do not want.

                                 BLACK
                        But it is noble to–

                                 EDISON
                        I trust you can find your way to 
                        the train.

           EDISON turns and walks into the darkness. BLACK is left 
           alone. Fireflies dance around him. He looks for any sign of 
           direction. He’s lost.

                                                              LOUD FAST

                                                            BULB, WHITE 
                                                        BULB, RED BULB,

           EXT. GRAVEYARD OUTSIDE NEWARK, NJ - DAY

           The rain falls in fat drops through the greenery and drums 
           against the tops of two black umbrellas. EDISON and MR. 
           GILLIAND stand before the 8 foot tall grave of MARY STILWELL 
           EDISON. EDISON’s name is enormous across the foot of the 
           stone pillar and he can’t look away from it. 

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        Normally I wouldn’t...I wouldn’t 
                        divulge this as it is not yet 
                        announced but...
                             (He clears his throat.)
                        There’s going to be a competition 
                        at Niagara.
                                 EDISON
                        Niagara...

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        For who can harness the power of 
                        the falls. Who can turn water into 
                        power. 

           EDISON, using the toe of his shoe, moves a fallen leaf from 
           the stone monument to the grass.

                                 MR. GILLIAND (CONT’D)
                        It will be a defining win. More 
                        important, it will be a deathblow 
                        to the competition. Westinghouse’s 
                        system can light up lights, but it 
                        can’t spin a motor. Only Edison can 
                        do that. And a motor is what needs 
                        to go under the Falls.
                             (Turning to EDISON.)
                        It doesn’t matter what came before. 
                        Whoever wins Niagara wins 
                        everything. Everything. It will be 
                        both the largest contract of all 
                        and the largest symbol: Mankind 
                        harnessing nature.

           EDISON’s eyes are fixed on his last name at the base of 
           MARY’s grave.

                                 EDISON
                        My boys agree that it’s impossible 
                        for Westinghouse’s Alternating 
                        Current to power a motor. 
                        But...what if he somehow does 
                        figure it out? He seems to have all 
                        the luck...

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        That’s why I need to distance 
                        myself from you now, Tom. 

           EDISON looks up and into GILLIAND’s eyes.

                                 MR. GILLIAND (CONT’D)
                        I looked carefully at the bylaws 
                        and it turns out...it turns out 
                        that with my position on both the 
                        Niagara Committee and the United 
                        States Energy Advisory Board...I 
                        have the deciding vote.

           The two men look at each other.
                                 MR. GILLIAND (CONT’D)
                        You’ve just invented a machine that 
                        builds Luck. And it’s me.

           INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY

           An audience is full of reporters and academics. ALFRED BLACK 
           is on stage with a WESTINGHOUSE generator and a GORILLA. 
           BLACK holds the GORILLA’s hand, like they are friends. The 
           GORILLA looks around.

                                 BLACK
                        I am building a device that will 
                        dispatch the human soul without a 
                        trace of pain. 

           MEN in the audience take notes.

                                 BLACK (CONT’D)
                        Gorilla’s are the closet relative 
                        to man. This is Sally...

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK IN SPRING - DAY

           WESTINGHOUSE walks through the Park in the direction of the 
           Plaza. A newspaper is folded under his arm. Under his other 
           arm is a package, wrapped in brown paper and twine. The trees 
           are starting to bloom and WESTINGHOUSE glimpses the tops of 
           the fancy apartments on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. 
           FRANCIS and EMMA are walking towards WESTINGHOUSE, EMMA’s 
           hand around FRANCIS’s arm. FRANCIS spies WESTINGHOUSE and 
           immediately takes EMMA off the path and into the bramble. 

                                 EMMA
                        What are you–

                                 FRANCIS
                        Shhh!

           The two duck down, sitting behind a large boulder.

                                 EMMA
                        What–

           FRANCIS cups a hand over her mouth.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                             (Muffled.)
                        What’s going on?

           FRANCIS closes his eyes. Then –

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (O.S.)
                        Francis Upton?
           FRANCIS opens his eyes. He turns and looks up at WESTINGHOUSE 
           who stands on the path watching the two young people with 
           amusement.

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Standing, and helping 
                              EMMA to her feet.)
                        Mr...Mr. Westinghouse.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Will you do me the honor of 
                        introducing–

                                 FRANCIS
                        Oh – this is. This is Ms. Emma 
                        Schmidt.

                                 EMMA
                        Soon to be Emma Upton.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Congratulations.

                                 FRANCIS
                        How did you...you know who I am?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You’re next to Edison in almost 
                        every photo.

                                 FRANCIS
                        I am?

           WESTINGHOUSE hands the newspaper to FRANCIS. FRANCIS unfolds 
           it to the front page. Above the fold it says: “EDISON AND 
           WESTINGHOUSE BATTLE FOR NIAGARA!” There is drawing of 
           WESTINGHOUSE. There is a photo of EDISON smiling proudly. 
           FRANCIS is by his side, looking off.

                                 EMMA
                        Look! It’s you! You could have 
                        smiled, Francis.

                                 FRANCIS
                        I didn’t even know they were taking 
                        my photograph.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        With the number of unanswered 
                        letters I’ve sent to your boss, 
                        I’ve started to think I’d have 
                        better luck writing to Santa Claus.
                                 FRANCIS
                        Tom’s absent-minded as hell–

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Tell me this much – is he behind 
                        the death chair that ape-killing 
                        man is building? 

           WESTINGHOUSE reaches over and flips the paper over to below 
           the fold. A picture of ALFRED BLACK and a gorilla! Beside 
           them is a generator clearly marked “WESTINGHOUSE.”

                                 FRANCIS
                        No. Tom would never make a weapon.

           WESTINGHOUSE looks at the young man’s face. The two men stare 
           at each other a moment. Then, WESTINGHOUSE smiles.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        It was very nice to meet you, Mrs. 
                        Upton-to-Be.

                                 EMMA
                        Delighted.

           FRANCIS looks down the path where WESTINGHOUSE is heading. It 
           terminates at the PLAZA.

                                 FRANCIS
                        So...uh...where are 
                        you...um...going?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You’re sweating, Francis. No need 
                        for subterfuge. I’ll give you two 
                        clues. One: I’m going to the Plaza. 
                        Two: In this brown package are 
                        three shirts. Handmade. Silk. 
                        Three.

           FRANCIS’s mouth drops open.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Ah yes, I see you figured it out. 
                        Enjoy this beautiful day.

           WESTINGHOUSE leaves. EMMA turns to FRANCIS.

                                 EMMA
                        Where’s he going?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Oh no.
           INT. PLAZA HOTEL HALLWAY, OUTSIDE ROOM 333 - DAY

           WESTINGHOUSE knocks twice on a suite door marked ‘333.’ No 
           response. WESTINGHOUSE knocks twice again. No response. 
           WESTINGHOUSE turns to leave, takes a few steps, then stops. 
           He’s figured something out. He returns to the door. 
           WESTINGHOUSE knocks THREE times. The door swings open to 
           reveal...NIKOLA TESLA. He’s tall and wiry. A beak nose, dark 
           moustache. His hair is slickly parted down the center. He’s 
           lavishly dressed in a bespoke cashmere coat with an almost 
           comic number of buttons. 

                                 TESLA
                             (A thick, Serbian accent.)
                        Mister Westinghouse!

           WESTINGHOUSE raises an eyebrow.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Tesla–

                                 TESLA
                        Come in, come in!

           INT. TESLA’S ROOM – CONTINUOUS

           It’s a lavish hotel room – dark velvet curtains, a large 4-
           poster bed with satin sheets, etc. Shots of everything in 
           THREES – three sets of shoes, three suits, three suitcases, 
           three toothbrushes, three combs, three hats, even three beds. 
           WESTINGHOUSE and TESLA are now sitting opposite one another 
           in armchairs. WESTINGHOUSE is handed a glass of whiskey by 
           TESLA. It is poured quite high. WESTINGHOUSE puts it 
           immediately down on a side table. He doesn’t drink. TESLA, in 
           his Serbian lilt, is praising a brand new walking stick which 
           he holds on his palms.

                                 TESLA
                        Perfect balance. Surinamean Snake 
                        Wood. But, look, Mr. Westinghouse, 
                        (and this is why I simply could not 
                        let it go), a hand-carved Fibonacci 
                        sequence spirals down here and the 
                        PITCH of the wood is proportional 
                        to the sequence.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        The pitch?

           TESLA smiles and puts the stick to both their ears, and then 
           flicks the wood. Then, he raises a long bony finger as if to 
           say, “Wait!” and he flicks the wood at a different part of 
           the stick. It sounds exactly the same.
                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Very...nice.

                                 TESLA
                        The craftsman is building a...how 
                        would you say...a bust of me to put 
                        atop the walking stick. It will 
                        look exactly like this:

           He turns his head to the side. He pauses. WESTINGHOUSE 
           doesn’t know if he’s waiting for something or...nothing.

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                        But smaller, of course.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Mr. Tesla, I appreciate your taking 
                        time to meet with–

           TESLA stands and begins to walk out of the room.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        ...me. I...are you going somewhere–

           TESLA is now out of the room. WESTINGHOUSE, confused as hell, 
           looks around and doesn't know what to do. Then, a door click 
           is heard and TESLA reenters, carrying a large hand-drawn 
           blueprint. He takes it to WESTINGHOUSE who stares, befuddled, 
           at the blueprint.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        How did you know this is what I–

                                 TESLA
                        When I first came to this country, 
                        I worked for Mister Edison. Did you 
                        know that?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I did not.

                                 TESLA
                        He told me that if I could solve 
                        two of five impossible challenges, 
                        he would pay me fifty-thousand 
                        dollars.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Did you–

                                 TESLA
                             (Leaning forward and 
                              smiling.)
                        All five. One night. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TESLA (CONT'D)
                        I almost needed an additional 
                        morning, but I decided to think 
                        faster.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        To think faster?

                                 TESLA
                        So, the next morning, when I came 
                        to Mister Edison, I said, “Mr. 
                        Edison, I have solved all of your 
                        challenges and you shall no doubt 
                        make a considerable profit off of 
                        this work, would you kindly pay me 
                        as you had promised?” Do you know 
                        what he said?

           WESTINGHOUSE shakes his head.

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                             (Impersonating, VERY 
                              POORLY, THOMAS EDISON.)
                        “Oh Mister Tesla. You do not 
                        understand the American sense of 
                        humor. I was...eh...how you...I was 
                        ribbing you about the fifty-
                        thousand dollars.”

           WESTINGHOUSE gives a knowing smile.

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                        I quit. I will not work for a man 
                        who does not value his workers. I 
                        will not work for a man who is not 
                        good on his word. But I had no 
                        money. And I was starving, Mr. 
                        Westinghouse. So I took the only 
                        job I could find. Ditch digging. 
                        For a system of electricity to be 
                        installed in the lower part of 
                        Manhattan.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        You went from working alongside 
                        Edison himself to–

                                 TESLA
                        I was a ditch digger employed by 
                        EDISON ELECTRIC. A digger of 
                        ditches. Once...I saw Edison 
                        crossing the street and I had to 
                        hide my face. The pride. Oh what we 
                        will give for pride...
           WESTINGHOUSE is now looking over the blueprint.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        This is a motor.

                                 TESLA
                        I know.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        A motor for my Alternating Current. 
                        You designed this. You figured it 
                        out.

                                 TESLA
                        I know, yes.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Is it...for sale?

           TESLA pauses, he doesn’t want to scare WESTINGHOUSE away.

                                 TESLA
                        Two-hundred dollars?

           WESTINGHOUSE breaks out laughing hysterically. We have never 
           seen him laugh like this. His face is bright red.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Nikola, this blueprint is the key 
                        to winning the war. Two-hundred 
                        dollars?

                                 TESLA
                        Fine. One-fifty. But not a penny–

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I will give you two-dollars and 
                        fifty cents.

           The two men stare.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        ...For each HORSE-POWER of each we 
                        build.

           WESTINGHOUSE’s eyes go wide. TESLA is doing a calculation on 
           his fingers.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t bother. This will make you 
                        one of the richest men on earth.

           TESLA bolts to his feet and shakes WESTINGHOUSE’s hand. He 
           stands too.
                                 TESLA
                        Thank you! Oh thank you!

           They’re still shaking.

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                        A man may work in ditch, but a man 
                        may not be treated as though he 
                        belongs there.

           A sudden pounding at the door.

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                        Aw Fuck.

           WESTINGHOUSE is taken aback by TESLA’s language.

           EXT. TESLA’S DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Two enormous Irish POLICEMEN stand with the HOTEL MANAGER. 
           The door opens and we see WESTINGHOUSE. TESLA is cowering in 
           the background.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        All right, Mr. Tesla, time to go.

                                 TESLA
                        I will not!

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                             (To WESTINGHOUSE.)
                        He hasn’t paid his bill for a 
                        month. 
                             (Nodding to the 
                              POLICEMEN.)
                        The spindly guy in the back there, 
                        with the moustache. Take him out of 
                        here.

           WESTINGHOUSE reaches into his pocket and pulls out a 
           billfold. He removes a THICK STACK of hundred dollar bills.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        How much does he owe?

           In the background, TESLA smiles a Cheshire grin.

                                 TESLA
                             (Calling to the 
                              POLICEMEN.)
                        Be gone! Be gone!

           WESTINGHOUSE turns to hush him.
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Please, Mr. Tesla.
                             (Then, to the HOTEL 
                              MANAGER, counting hundred 
                              dollar bill after hundred 
                              dollar bill into his 
                              hands.)
                        How much to keep him in this room 
                        for a year?

           INT. BASEMENT OF THE HOUSE OF EDISON - NIGHT

           Time-lapse sequence, overlapping slow fades: EDISON, himself, 
           is nailing together wood, screwing in metal plates, building 
           what slowly takes shape as the First Electric Chair. As the 
           final nail is driven into wood, DASH, EDISON’s son, comes 
           down the stairs sobbing. EDISON quickly pulls a canvas over 
           the chair. The boy is just standing before EDISON, crying.

                                 EDISON
                        Dash? What’s the matter?

           The boy continues to cry. EDISON embraces his son. It is 
           awkward and strained. Unnatural. The boy flings his hands 
           around EDISON’s neck.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        There, there...There, there.

           From the angle of EDISON’s hug, EDISON sees only the chair, 
           partially covered with canvas.

           INT. EDISON’S BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING

           The next morning, EDISON, FRANCIS, EMMA, DOT, and DASH are 
           enjoying a country breakfast. Thick fall light streams in 
           waves through the bay windows. EMMA is showing DOT how to do 
           a “cat’s cradle” with a piece of string. DASH is pushing his 
           hand into his oatmeal. 

                                 EDISON
                        Dash, stop it. 

           DASH looks at his father guiltily and stops.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Are you building anything new in 
                        the house?

                                 EDISON
                        No.
                                 FRANCIS
                        I heard...that you asked for a 
                        workshop to be built downstairs.

           DOT walks over to FRANCIS and transfers the cat’s cradle to 
           his hands. DOT is smiling – she has a crush on FRANCIS. 
           FRANCIS accepts the strings but doesn’t seem to register it. 
           He’s focused on EDISON.

                                 EDISON
                        The boys...are wrong.

           EMMA eyes FRANCIS as if to say, “Go on...”

                                 FRANCIS
                        Alfred Black needs the death chair 
                        built. And he’s not a scientist...

                                 EDISON
                        And I told him “No.”

           EMMA looks away.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Is there something you want to ask 
                        me Francis?

           DOT looks up at her father. The room goes quiet.

                                 FRANCIS
                        No.

           EDISON exits. FRANCIS is left staring with his fingers 
           entangled in the string web.

           INT. BUFFALO PRISON - DAY

           ALFRED BLACK stands next to WARDEN DURSTON. From a distance, 
           they observe KEMMLER in his cell. He is sitting with a NUN 
           who shows KEMMLER a children’s bible. His head is bowed, 
           carefully paying attention.

                                 BLACK
                        And...and it’s OK to have her in 
                        there with him?

                                 DURSTON
                        Oh William is as meek as a bunny.

                                 BLACK
                        Except that he struck his wife 
                        thirty-seven times with an axe.
                                 DURSTON
                        Forty-one.

                                 BLACK
                        What’s she doing in there?

                                 DURSTON
                        Teaching him to read.

           They observe a moment.

                                 DURSTON (CONT’D)
                        So the Governor has given the 
                        directive?

                                 BLACK
                        He’s to be the first man executed 
                        with electricity. Intentionally, 
                        that is.

                                 DURSTON
                        God help him.

           BLACK turns to DURSTON in disbelief.

                                 BLACK
                        He’s the most fortunate man to ever 
                        be put to death. 

           The camera pulls back as BLACK and DURSTON continue to 
           observe.

                                 DURSTON
                        Some people got all the luck.

           EXT. PARIS - EVENING

           A loud band plays! 

           Before a huge crowd of Parisians, WESTINGHOUSE and NIKOLA 
           TESLA are standing along the Seine, posing for a photograph. 
           WESTINGHOUSE looks miserable. TESLA poses grandly. A 
           drumroll...and BANG – the ornate buildings along the Seine 
           are beautifully illuminated. The crowd cheers.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Un. Deux...

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        No, I...pardon.

           WESTINGHOUSE walks off, leaving TESLA alone. He just can’t do 
           it. The photographer is confused. After a moment –
                                 TESLA
                             (To the crowd.)
                        Try to capture my brilliance on 
                        film!!

           A puff of white smoke!

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                        I am glorious!!!

           CLOSE-UP OF A RED BULB SCREWED IN ON PARIS

           INT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - NIGHT

           EDISON himself has screwed in the bulb. He’s note alone.

                                 BLACK
                        I hesitate to ask but...has there 
                        been...progress on the chair? Have 
                        you had a moment to draw the plans? 
                        I know how terribly busy you–

           EDISON strides out of the laboratory. BLACK follows.

           EXT. MENLO PARK GRASS – CONTINUOUS

           The two shadowy figures walk across the wet grass. They enter 
           the storm cellar.

           INT. BASEMENT OF THE HOUSE OF EDISON - CONTINUOUS

           A switch is flipped and THE ELECTRIC CHAIR, fully built, is 
           illuminated in a warm glow. BLACK drags a single finger along 
           the top edge of the chair, in an almost sexual way.

                                 BLACK
                        It’s built?

           He looks to EDISON who then nods. BLACK sits in the chair and 
           relaxes back. He puts his arms on the arm rest. He closes his 
           eyes, luxuriating in the moment. He opens his eyes.

                                 BLACK (CONT’D)
                        Shall we have a drink to celebrate?

                                 EDISON
                        I do not drink. Ever. And don’t 
                        misunderstand this relationship. I 
                        am not your friend. I have arranged 
                        for the chair to be delivered to 
                        your office by way of Ohio.
                                 BLACK
                        Ohio?

                                 EDISON
                        And you better have destroyed all 
                        our correspondences. No one must 
                        ever know about this.

                                 BLACK
                        I have followed your directions. 
                        All letters are burned.

                                 EDISON
                        Good. Now get out.

           INT. BLACK’S HOME - DAY

           BLACK sits in his apartment. He feeds his turtle. From a 
           locked drawer, BLACK removes a thick stack of letters tied 
           with a satin ribbon. He sets each letter out, one by one, on 
           his bed. The camera pans along the bottoms of the letters. 
           Each letter is signed “T.A. EDISON.” We see the words 
           “destroy this” and “to be burned” many times. BLACK stretches 
           out his fingers and pushes them down on the letters, feeling 
           the paper. He closes his eyes.

           FADE INTO: EDISON’S MAP OF THE WORLD – 2/3 RED BULBS

           INT. WESTINGHOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING

           A terrible thunderstorm is shooting rain against the windows 
           like bullets. WESTINGHOUSE, TESLA, and MARGUERITE are having 
           dessert.

                                 TESLA
                        Mrs. Westinghouse, this is the best 
                        Baked Alaska I’ve ever had. Better 
                        than Delmonico’s!

           MARGUERITE doesn’t respond.

                                 TESLA (CONT’D)
                        Mrs.–

                                 MARGUERITE
                        I didn’t make it.

           Silence.

                                 TESLA
                             (To WESTINGHOUSE.)
                        Is she cross with you?
                                 MARGUERITE
                        Tell me, Mr. Tesla, when will that 
                        enormous motor be out of my living 
                        room?

           A shot through the open doorway and a GIGANTIC motor, bigger 
           than a grand piano, sits on the wooden floor.

                                 TESLA
                             (Laughing.)
                        Soon, soon. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        He wanted to work at night and it 
                        was either build it here or make 
                        him sleep at the factory.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        And why couldn’t you do the latter?

           TESLA laughs hard. The WESTINGHOUSES don’t. A SERVANT enters.

                                 SERVANT
                        Mr. Westinghouse. I’m sorry, sir, 
                        but the tracks have flooded. They 
                        won’t be able to get you to Buffalo 
                        before the trial.

           WESTINGHOUSE tosses his napkin to the table.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           The room is FILLED to capacity with reporter. Behind a small 
           table, KEMMLER sits with SENATOR BOURKE. They are the only 
           ones not laughing at EDISON who is at the stand. FRANCIS 
           looks on from the back. 

                                 EDISON
                        If I’m shootin’ an apple off a 
                        head, I’d want to use my best 
                        arrow.

           The room laughs heartily. The most famous man on earth 
           doesn’t come to Buffalo every day... The LAWYER representing 
           New York offers EDISON a cigar as he continues his questions. 
           EDISON accepts.

                                 LAWYER
                        And, would you please, Mr. Edison, 
                        tell the court what happens when 
                        electricity is applied to the human 
                        body?
                                 EDISON
                        A high enough dosage of electricity 
                        causes the heart muscles to 
                        constrict instantly.

           EDISON puts the cigar to his lips. The JUDGE himself offers 
           EDISON a light.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Ah, thank you, your honor.

                                 JUDGE
                        No – it is my honor.

                                 EDISON
                        The point is, gentlemen, it is my 
                        expert opinion that the only humane 
                        method of execution...

           EDISON’s eyes dart over to KEMMLER for just a moment. KEMMLER 
           is staring out the window.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        ...the...uh...it’s electricity. 

           INT. ANTEROOM JUST OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM - A BIT LATER

           EDISON shakes the hands of many men and signs a few 
           autographs as he makes his way out. 

                                 A FAN
                        Good luck with Niagara, Mr. Edison!

                                 EDISON
                        I don’t need luck. I just need the 
                        better idea. And I got it!

           He whispers to FRANCIS.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        And you’re SURE he’s not here?

           The doors close on the courtroom, leaving just FRANCIS and 
           EDISON.

                                 FRANCIS
                        A squall in Pittsburgh has shut 
                        down the railroads.

                                 EDISON
                        Good, good. Make sure you wire–

           TWO BODIES COLLIDE SUDDENLY. ONE, is EDISON’s.
                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, excuse me.

           He looks up and sees the other belongs to...

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        George Westinghouse.

           The cigar hangs a bit from EDISON’s lip. He’s speechless. 
           FRANCIS is bug-eyed. 

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll forgive my appearance. I’ve 
                        been in a carriage for the last two 
                        days.

           EDISON is silent. Then, he springs to life, removing the 
           cigar from his lips and offering out a hand.

                                 EDISON
                        Thomas Edison.

           WESTINGHOUSE shakes it.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        The pleasure is mine.

           A shot of the round anteroom, the floor tiles forming a 
           universe. The two titans stare at each other. Finally, 
           EDISON’s mind catches up with him –

                                 EDISON
                        Look, it’s nothing personal –

           The doors to the courtroom are flung open and WARDEN DURSTON 
           leads out KEMMLER in shackles. DURSTON, seeing EDISON, 
           explodes with enthusiasm.

                                 DURSTON
                        Sweet Jesus, I was afraid you were 
                        gonna leave before I got a chance-
                             (Shaking EDISON’s hand 
                              quickly.)
                        The name is Warden Durston. I’m a 
                        big fan, big.
                             (To KEMMLER.)
                        One moment, William.
                             (To EDISON.)
                        I’m a bit of an amateur inventor 
                        myself. I invented a, uh, can I get 
                        yer autograph?

           EDISON is extremely uncomfortable. He looks at WESTINGHOUSE.
                                 EDISON
                        Uh, sure.

           DURSTON claws a handkerchief out of his pocket. He hands it 
           to EDISON.

                                 DURSTON
                             (To WESTINGHOUSE.)
                        Hey mister, you got a pen?

           WESTINGHOUSE reaches into his vest and produces a fountain 
           pen, handing it to DURSTON. DURSTON hands it to EDISON.

                                 DURSTON (CONT’D)
                        Bend forward, William.

           KEMMLER, at the center of the round universe, bends. DURSTON 
           spreads the handkerchief along his back. 

                                 DURSTON (CONT’D)
                        Will you make it out to Charles? 

           EDISON, using KEMMLER as a writing table, quickly signs the 
           handkerchief and hands it to DURSTON who accepts it as a 
           precious object. EDISON briskly screws the cap back on.

                                 EDISON
                             (Turning.)
                        As I was saying–

           EDISON stops short. WESTINGHOUSE is gone. As if by magic.

                                 DURSTON
                        Where’d he go? He forgot his pen.

           EDISON is speechless. He looks at FRANCIS who shrugs.

                                 DURSTON (CONT’D)
                        Nice pen. Hey – can I keep this?

           EXT. STREETS OF BUFFALO / BLACK’S HOUSE - DAY

           BLACK jauntily walks through the streets, eating an apple. He 
           reaches the staircase leading to his little apartment. 

           INT. BLACK’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           BLACK enters and turns on the electric lights. He suddenly 
           stops. The place has been ransacked. Chairs are overturned, a 
           vase smashed. The floor is littered with broken objects. 
           BLACK slowly walks through the debris. It crunches. He walks 
           over to his desk which is smashed in half. All the drawers 
           are gone. And so...are the EDISON letters. The camera catches 
           the turtle crawl by BLACK’s foot.
           INT. KEMMLER’S CELL - DAY

           KEMMLER sits on his bench, quietly sounding out the words in 
           the childrens’ bible. The NUN sits beside him.

                                 KEMMLER
                        Annnnd Chrrrrisst. Sssaid. 

           A sound makes them both look to the little window. Out the 
           window, KEMMLER sees five men unloading the Electric Chair.

           INT. EDISON’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           DOT sits at the piano and finishes playing a piece. EDISON 
           and DASH applaud.

                                 EDISON
                        Very good, Dot! What an ear! You 
                        didn’t get it from me, I’ll say.

           FRANCIS bursts into the room and throws a newspaper at 
           EDISON.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You lied to me!

           EDISON looks incensed. No one talks to him this way. 
           Especially in front of his children.

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        You LIED!

                                 EDISON
                             (To DASH.)
                        Take Dot out and play.

           The children leave.

                                 FRANCIS
                        You’re the smartest man I know, 
                        Tom. But beyond all your brains. 
                        Beyond building miracles out of the 
                        air, I wanted to work for you 
                        because you had principles. Well, 
                        your brain could have at least told 
                        the maniac to burn the damn 
                        letters.

           FRANCIS storms out. EDISON opens the paper. The headline 
           reads: “EDISON INVENTS DEATH CHAIR TO SHOCK WESTINGHOUSE!”

                                 EDISON
                        No...no...no...
           INT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - NIGHT

           EDISON sits alone in his warehouse of a laboratory. A soft 
           rain falls on the windowpane. EDISON looks around at the 
           vastness of his workspace. At the tools. The half-built 
           inventions. The photographs. He stands. He’s holding a glass 
           of scotch. There’s a half-consumed bottle on the table beside 
           him. EDISON walks over to the MAP OF THE WORLD. He reaches 
           forward and unscrews a WHITE bulb. He carefully sets it down 
           on the table. He reaches into a wooden box of RED bulbs and 
           screws it in. MAINE goes to WESTINGHOUSE. The camera pulls 
           back slowly and EDISON’s body is now backlit by the glowing 
           MAP OF THE WORLD, which, aside from a few white bulbs here 
           and there, is illuminated in bright RED.

           INT. EDISON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON is drunk, fumbling at a telephone, knocking things 
           over in the process.

           INT. THE GILLIAND’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           MR. and MRS. GILLIAND are sleeping. A telephone begins to 
           ring. MRS. GILLIAND awakens first. Then, MR. GILLIAND sits 
           up. He looks at her.

           INT. MR. GILLIANDS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           GILLIAND is on the telephone. 

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        Is that you, Tom?

                                 EDISON
                        I need to win Niagara. It’s 
                        slipping–

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        Are you...drunk?

                                 EDISON
                        I need to win. Do you want money? I 
                        can get Morgan to pay you–

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        I’m your FRIEND, Edison. You don’t 
                        bribe your friends. Your friends 
                        help you because they are your 
                        friends.

           GILLIAND hangs up on EDISON.
           INT. DASH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Arms shake DASH awake. He shudders a moment, scared. Then, he 
           sees the arms belong to his father.

                                 EDISON
                             (Smiling.)
                        Hey Dash! Wanna have some fun?

           DASH is confused by his father’s behavior. He slowly nods.

           INT. MENLO PARK LABORATORY OF THOMAS EDISON - CONTINUOUS

           In pajamas, the little boy of 6 stands next to his father. 
           EDISON takes a hammer from the wall and hands it to DASH. He 
           leads DASH over to the huge, glowing, red MAP OF THE WORLD.

                                 EDISON
                        It is so fun to create.

           DASH nods, holding the heavy hammer with both hands.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        But here’s the secret nobody tells 
                        you: 
                             (Whispering.)
                        It’s also a lot of fun to destroy!

           DASH looks at his father.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead! It’ll make a funny sound.

           DASH walks forward and lifts the hammer, bringing it down on 
           a red bulb. It pops and sizzles. DASH laughs a little.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           DASH does it again.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Again!

           DASH does it again- breaking three in a row.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t this fun???

                                 DASH
                        I’m tired, Daddy.

           EDISON lowers himself to his knees, staring into his son’s 
           eyes. They are droopy. The kid is sleepy.
                                 EDISON
                             (Taking back the hammer.)
                        I’m tired too.

           EXT. A SPEEDING NORTHBOUND TRAIN - DAY

           It tears through the wilderness, smoke billowing longer than 
           the train itself.

           INT. SPEEDING NORTHBOUND TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

           TESLA sits by himself, quickly drawing a schematic into a 
           notebook. He works so quickly, the pencil tip breaks and he 
           switches pencils almost instantly. MARGUERITE sits opposite 
           her husband. MARGUERITE reads and WESTINGHOUSE stares at her. 
           After a moment, MARGUERITE looks up.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        What!?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        I think you’re beautiful.

           MARGUERITE purses her lips.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        You think complimenting me solves 
                        anything?

           She returns to her book. Suddenly, a PLOP lands in her lap. 
           MARGUERITE picks up the tied parcel: letters. She scans them, 
           one-by-one.

                                 MARGUERITE (CONT’D)
                        These are the stolen Edison 
                        letters!

           MARGUERITE looks at her husband who is now reading the paper 
           himself. He looks up, feigning (almost perfectly) surprise.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Did you say something?

                                 MARGUERITE
                        George!

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Yes, Bumblebee?

                                 MARGUERITE
                             (Smiling.)
                        GEORGE! Did you break into that 
                        madman’s office and–
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Break in? Why that’d be...
                             (”Searching” for the 
                              word.)
                        ...illegal.

           MARGUERITE clasps the letters in her hands and gleefully 
           grins.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Niagara, here we come.

           EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - DAY

           The camera races across the roaring water and lifts suddenly, 
           climbing UP the Falls and exploding up and back, capturing 
           the majesty and impossible scale of this Goliath cataract. A 
           Fair has been created along the observation area. A military 
           band plays patriotic songs at brisk tempos – the 1812 
           Overture, the Star Spangled Banner, etc. An enormous crowd 
           has gathered for the decision of who has won the contract. In 
           a panoramic shot, the camera moves along the faces of the 
           crowd – excited kids with sparklers, young men with dates, 
           tons of press, women with umbrellas, shielding them from the 
           mist of the Falls. In a separated area, EDISON and his 
           children await the news. EDISON is dressed a little better 
           than normal. J.P. Morgan and his MEN are set apart from 
           EDISON by a short fence.

                                 EDISON
                             (Over the fence.)
                        We’re almost there.

                                 MORGAN
                        Sorry your wife’s dead.

           MORGAN turns away. EDISON, shaken a moment by the gruffness, 
           hangs there. Across the way, in a different area, are 
           WESTINGHOUSE, MARGUERITE, TESLA, and several senior 
           WESTINGHOUSE employees. TESLA is dressed in a ridiculous 
           tuxedo and top hat. 

                                 TESLA
                             (Shouting to the crowd.)
                        I love this country! I love 
                        America!

           The crowd around them cheers. WESTINGHOUSE and MARGUERITE 
           stand, patiently waiting. MARGUERITE holds her parasol over 
           her head and gives it a little spin. WESTINGHOUSE looks at 
           her and smiles.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        What are you thinking about?
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        My father.

           She sees something in his eyes.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        What George?

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        When...when I was around ten, I’d 
                        cut school for the umpteenth time, 
                        I don’t know. I hated school.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        I know.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        Well. I was remembering...my...my 
                        father couldn’t stand it anymore 
                        and he grabbed me here, by my shirt 
                        collar, and he pulled me into the 
                        yard. He was yelling at me, looking 
                        around the yard for a stick. And he 
                        finds one. And he lifts it from the 
                        grass and he...he tells me to bend 
                        over. And he yanks down my 
                        britches.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Oh George–

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        So he winds back with the stick 
                        and, hard as he can, he brings it 
                        down on my rump and...you know what 
                        happened?

           MARGUERITE shakes her head.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        The stick broke clean in half.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        A tough rump. Believe me, I know.

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        So...so I looked to my side and 
                        spotted a thicker fallen branch. 
                        And I reached down, grabbed it, and 
                        without looking at him, I handed 
                        him the new branch. I said, “Here, 
                        father, this is a better one.”

           MARGUERITE embraces her husband. 
                                 WESTINGHOUSE (CONT’D)
                             (Over her shoulder.)
                        Even at ten I could take a beating, 
                        but I had no patience for shoddy 
                        craftsmanship. 

           The band stops playing and the crowd is hushed. At a 
           platform, before both competing parties, MR. GILLIAND walks 
           to the front. Behind him sit a row of six well-to-do men. 
           Everything is silent. GILLIAND clears his throat. As loud as 
           he can, he announces the decision.

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        After careful deliberations. And in 
                        consultation with the leading 
                        experts in the field. This 
                        committee has decided to award the 
                        Niagara Contract...

           A close-up of EDISON’s face. A close-up of WESTINGHOUSE’s.

                                 MR. GILLIAND (CONT’D)
                        ...to Westinghouse Electric.

           The crowd cheers and band strikes up! EDISON is 
           expressionless. His shoulders seem to dip ever-so-slightly. 
           J.P. MORGAN turns to EDISON and raises his brow. MARGUERITE 
           and TESLA are screaming with delight.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        We won! We won! We won!

                                 TESLA
                        I won! I won! I won!

           WESTINGHOUSE stifles his smile. Dignified to the end...

           The camera cranes up and over the cheering crowd.

           INT. NIAGARA HOTEL - NIGHT

           EDISON sits alone, staring into the fire of the lobby. He has 
           a tablet and a pencil. On the tablet, he draws a dark 
           rectangle. His hand, with the pencil, falls to his side. 
           GILLIAND approaches. EDISON looks up.

                                 MR. GILLIAND
                        I tried, Tom. You won’t believe the 
                        performance I put on but...

                                 EDISON
                        He had the better system.
           Silence, and then, MR. GILLIAND nods. He walks away. EDISON 
           looks back at the tablet. Then, a voice–

                                 MORGAN
                        Edison.

           EDISON stands, slowly, and turns to see J.P. MORGAN, alone, 
           in the expansive door way. The light from the fire flickers 
           on his face.

                                 EDISON
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 MORGAN
                        Say whatever you want. I won.

                                 EDISON
                        What do you mean?

                                 MORGAN
                        Simply, I mean that I put money 
                        into both companies. 

                                 EDISON
                        You –

                                 MORGAN
                        I don’t lose. And the best way not 
                        to lose, is not to compete.

                                 EDISON
                             (Sneering.)
                        What are you saying? You didn’t 
                        invest with Westinghouse.

                                 MORGAN
                        No, but I did invest quite a bit in 
                        about fifteen ankle-biting 
                        competitors. Little scrappy 
                        electric companies that are 
                        undercutting Westinghouse in little 
                        scrappy towns. Of course, they use 
                        Alternating Current.

           EDISON sits back down, in front of the fire. 

                                 MORGAN (CONT’D) 
                        You no doubt realize that by this 
                        point I own your entire company. I 
                        own it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORGAN (CONT’D) 
                        And I’m going to take your 
                        infrastructure and I’m taking the 
                        contracts you somehow managed to 
                        retain, and I’m going to merge them 
                        with all these little scrappy 
                        companies and form one big company. 
                        And in time, I will beat 
                        Westinghouse. Because Thomas Alva 
                        Edison...couldn’t.

           MORGAN starts to leave.

                                 EDISON
                        What are you calling it?

           MORGAN stops.

                                 MORGAN
                        Excuse me? 

                                 EDISON
                        You’d be a fool not to use my name 
                        on the company. My name is still 
                        worth more than anything else. You 
                        must still use my name. 
                        Electricity. Edison. The two are 
                        inseparable. I built the first 
                        system. For God’s sake – the bulb, 
                        Morgan. The light bulb. You have to 
                        use my name.

                                 MORGAN
                        I’m not. I don’t attach a losing 
                        name to fledgling company. 

                                 EDISON
                        So what are you calling it?

                                 MORGAN
                        We don’t have a name yet. For right 
                        now, the contracts just say 
                        ‘General Electric.’ But I’m sure 
                        I’ll think of something. I can be 
                        creative too.

           MORGAN leaves. The door to the hotel slams shut. EDISON looks 
           down at a table by his side. A newspaper headline reads: 
           “BUFFALO MURDERER TO MEET DEATH CHAIR”

           EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

           EDISON is hunched, banging as hard as he can on a door.
                                 EDISON
                        Francis!! Francis!! 

           More banging. Finally, it opens. FRANCIS is spooked as hell.

                                 FRANCIS
                        What IS it, Tom? You woke Emma. 

                                 EDISON
                        We have to...we have to get a 
                        carriage. I need to. I need to get 
                        to Buffalo. How long will that–

                                 FRANCIS
                             (Checking a grandfather 
                              clock in the hall behind 
                              EDISON.)
                        It’s 4 in the morning, Tom. It’ll 
                        take half an hour at least for the 
                        hotel to get a driver–

                                 EDISON
                        Now! I need one now! Dammit.

                                 FRANCIS
                        What are you – wait. You want to 
                        stop the execution?

                                 EDISON
                        Now.

           The sun is rising over the treetops. The wheels of a carriage 
           are shaking almost off their axles. The driver cries, 
           cracking the reins:

                                 DRIVER
                        Hhhhyah!

           The horses snort, their noses steaming into the cold morning.

           INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           EDISON, determined as hell, is breathing quickly. Across from 
           him, FRANCIS sits, staring at his boss. EDISON wipes his 
           brow.

                                 EDISON
                        What time is the execution?

                                 FRANCIS
                        6 AM.
                                 EDISON
                        Tell the driver to go faster!!

                                 DRIVER
                        Horses don’t go faster than this.

                                 EDISON
                        Tell him to add more horses!!!

           FRANCIS smiles.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Do you remember the night you 
                        brought all those rich fat men to 
                        Menlo Park–

                                 EDISON
                        Francis...I’m gonna do something 
                        so...so great that the world will 
                        forget I ever had anything to do 
                        with electricity in the first 
                        place.

           FRANCIS’s smile disappears. He looks out the window.

           EXT. BUFFALO CITY LIMITS - MORNING

           The carriage barrages past a sign reading: “Welcome to 
           Buffalo.” The sun is rising.

           EXT. BUFFALO PRISON GATE - MORNING

           The carriage comes to a sudden halt outside the Prison gate. 
           A large cloud of dust is spinning through the air. The door 
           of the carriage if flung open and EDISON tears out of the 
           car, racing to the gate of the Prison. A GUARD meets him.

                                 EDISON
                        Open the gate!

                                 GUARD
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 EDISON
                             (Pointing with both index 
                              fingers to his own face.)
                        Look at this face!

                                 GUARD
                        Sweet Jesus on the Cross. You’re 
                        Thomas Edison!

                                 EDISON
                        Open the gate!
           The GUARD quickly opens the gate. FRANCIS leans his head out 
           of the carriage.

           EXT. BUFFALO PRISON ENTRANCE – CONTINUOUS 

           EDISON yells back to FRANCIS who stands at the gate.

                                 EDISON
                        What time is!?

                                 FRANCIS
                        It’s ten to six!

           EDISON scrambles over the door, tripping in the dust, falling 
           over, getting back up. He reaches the door and pounds on it 
           as hard as he can.

                                 EDISON
                        Open the door! Open the door! Open 
                        the door! Open the door!

           The door opens and a FAT GUARD looks at EDISON.

                                 FAT GUARD
                        You’re–

                                 EDISON
                        Get me Alfred Black immediately! 
                        Run!

           The FAT GUARD hustles, his keys jangling. EDISON enters the 
           door of the prison and looks around frantically. It’s a 
           staircase. He looks left and right. He doesn't know where to 
           go. He walks back out onto the step of the door. He squints 
           and sees FRANCIS in the distance, leaning with an arm to his 
           forehead against the gate, looking at him from afar. 
           Suddenly, BLACK appears behind EDISON.

                                 BLACK
                        Mr. Edison?

           EDISON spins.

                                 EDISON
                        Stop the execution! 

                                 BLACK
                        Excuse me?

                                 EDISON
                        Stop the execution! 
                                 BLACK
                        He’s being strapped into the chair 
                        now. I’m missing it.

                                 EDISON
                        Missing it? You stop this 
                        execution! You don’t know HOW MUCH 
                        electricity it takes to kill a 
                        human being.

                                 BLACK
                        A gorilla–

                                 EDISON
                        The man is not a monkey!

                                 BLACK
                        You do not have the authority to 
                        interrupt the execution of justice.

                                 EDISON
                        A man is not a monkey!

                                 BLACK
                        This is happening.

                                 EDISON
                        Too little electricity and he will 
                        feel a pain greater than any man 
                        has felt before!

                                 BLACK
                        So we shall use a safe, larger–

                                 EDISON
                        Too much electricity and the man 
                        will burn alive.

           EDISON’s face is pouring sweat. BLACK lingers, just a moment.

                                 BLACK
                        The state thanks you for your 
                        expert opinions.

           BLACK slowly closes the door on EDISON’s face. EDISON is 
           stunned. He turns to FRANCIS. He turns back to the door. He 
           starts to bang and then begins to pace – it’s futile. He’s 
           imprisoned on the outside of the jail...It begin to softly 
           rain. EDISON stands in the mud, alone. By his foot, he sees a 
           small basement window. He kneels down in the mud and lies on 
           his stomach, placing his ear by the window. The camera stays 
           close on EDISON’s face. There is the sound of the jangling 
           metal. Some murmurs that are unintelligible. Then, suddenly, 
           the sound of a WESTINGHOUSE generator springing to life. 
           A bulb above the prison door dims considerably. The hum of 
           the generator lasts 25 seconds. The longest 25 seconds of 
           EDISON’s life. Then, the sound vanishes and the bulb above 
           the door returns to full. Silence. EDISON exhales a deep 
           breath and lets his head relax down into the mud. Then– 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        My god!

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        He’s still breathing!

                                 VOICE OF BLACK (O.S.)
                        Turn it back on! Higher! Higher!

                                 VOICE 4 (O.S.)
                        Dear Lord!

           The generator sound returns and the hum is much deeper. The 
           bulb above the door goes almost completely out. During this 
           intense BUZZ, flashes of the past rush forward in EDISON’s 
           mind like ghosts–

           INT. TRAIN CAR, YEARS AND YEARS EARLIER - DUSK

           Filmed like the beginnings of cinema – EDISON, much younger, 
           sits next to a beautiful shy girl. He reaches a hand over to 
           her skirt. He taps a message out on her knee. He smiles. She 
           smiles. She reaches her hand over to his knee. She taps, with 
           her pointer finger: Dash Dot Dash Dash / Dot / Dot Dot Dot . 
           EDISON’s face fills with delight. The reverie wavers back and 
           forth with the prison and mud. Then, the sound of the 
           generator is GONE and EDISON is snapped back to the present.

           EXT. BUFFALO PRISON ENTRANCE – CONTINUOUS

           Nothing. Then, the light above the door returns. EDISON 
           begins to blink. He blinks again. He blinks several times, 
           rapidly. He sits up from the mud, quickly, as though he were 
           a drowning man gasping for air. He brings the sleeve of his 
           jacket to his nose. There is a smell coming from the little 
           window. A terrible smell.

           EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - MORNING

           WESTINGHOUSE and MARGUERITE take a walk along the grass at 
           the base of the falls. They hold hands. They round a bend and 
           see a photographer who has a giant camera set up on an easel.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Oh George, let’s go. It’s one of 
                        the newspapers...
                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                        No. I asked him to come.
                             (Calling over to the 
                              photographer.)
                        Where do you want us?

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Oh, you know, maybe, I don’t know, 
                        have the Falls in the back. She can 
                        open her umbrella. Should be a real 
                        nice shot. Gimme a second to, uh, 
                        this shutter’s been givin’ me 
                        trouble all week...

                                 WESTINGHOUSE
                             (To MARGUERITE.)
                        You don’t mind, do you?

                                 MARGUERITE
                             (In disbelief.)
                        No...I don’t mind at all.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Ah! OK Mr. Westinghouse. Now you 
                        two gotta stand real still – hell, 
                        what am I sayin’? I bet you get 
                        this done all the time.

           MARGUERITE and WESTINGHOUSE stand, dignified, with the Falls 
           at the backs.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
                        Ready? Here we go. One. Two...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FLASH!

           A photograph fades up on the screen – The real GEORGE 
           WESTINGHOUSE and MARGUERITE in front of NIAGARA FALLS.

           Text fades up over the photo:

           In 1911, in honor of a career of meritorious achievement in 
           the electrical arts, The American Institute of Electrical 
           Engineers awarded Westinghouse with their highest honor: The 
           Edison Medal.

           Westinghouse died on March 12th, 1914. He is buried in 
           Arlington National Cemetery alongside his wife Marguerite, 
           who followed him three months later.
           To this day, there are only a dozen known photographs of 
           George Westinghouse, inventor of the air brake, father of the 
           World’s system to electricity distribution, and winner of the 
           War of the Currents.

                                                         THE PHOTOGRAPH 
                                                              BEGINS TO

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK, 1903

           Grainy film of the lumbering elephant transitions to– REAL 
           LIFE. EDISON is back as he was at the beginning of the film. 
           The snow falls in large flakes, settling in his greying hair. 
           Text fades up over EDISON:

           “After losing the War of the Currents and after an aborted 
           venture into mining, Thomas Edison was awarded a patent for 
           the Kinetograph and began a new career – motion pictures.

                                                            TITLE CARD:

           FLICKERING TITLE CARD READING:

           “EDISON MOTION PICTURES PRESENTS!”

           “ELECTROCUTING AN ELEPHANT”

           The text fades away. The blinking elephant shifts slightly.

           To the side of the elephant, the enormous WESTINGHOUSE 
           generator, weathered by time, but still sporting the jumbo 
           “WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC” sign, stands. EDISON looks up into 
           the eyes of the elephant. A YOUNG EDISON EMPLOYEE nervously 
           approaches the great inventor.

                                 YOUNG EDISON EMPLOYEE 
                        Mr. Edison?

           EDISON turns, looking at the YOUNGSTER.

                                 YOUNG EDISON EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)
                             (Clearing throat.)
                        Sir...they’re all set to go. And 
                        suffice it to say, we can only do 
                        this once.

           EDISON, left alone again, looks up and addresses the elephant 
           softly –

                                 EDISON
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Elephant.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Tom! You’re in the shot.

           EDISON turns, smiling broadly.

                                 EDISON
                             (Calling off to an unseen 
                              camera crew.)
                        What? I thought you boys wanted to 
                        shoot me! These legs’ll sell!

           EDISON does a tiny dance, like he’s a burlesque dancer and 
           laughter is heard.

                                 EDISON (CONT’D)
                             (Walking off screen.)
                        Camera!

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           The actual footage of EDISON’s 10 second film:
