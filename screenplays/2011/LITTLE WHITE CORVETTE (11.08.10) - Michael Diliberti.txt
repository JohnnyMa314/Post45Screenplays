           An ear splitting WAIL!

           SUPER: First Things First...

           A BURST OF FLASHING LIGHTS -- 

           As an EMERGENCY SIREN spins before us.  We're atop an
           ambulance TEARING THROUGH SUBURBAN STREETS. 

           Action-deprived LOCALS watch from the sidewalk.  As the
           ambulance hurtles past, a blur of light and sound --

           INT. CLASSROOM, PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY (1998)

           The door opens.  Two dozen FIFTH GRADE heads turn.  They
           find a stone-faced school ADMINISTRATOR.   

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Nathan Burr?

           NATE BURR (11) is the scrawny kid at the back of the class. 
           Uncomfortable with attention, he slowly raises his hand. 

           INT. GIRLS' ROOM, PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

           The door opens.  Two TEENAGE heads turn.  Nate's pretty sister,
           CAMPBELL BURR (14), and her chunky friend, DONNA (14), African-
           American.  They wear punk clothes from the local mall.  Campbell
           is halfway through spray painting the anarchy A on the mirror. 
           No stranger to trouble, she just sighs at the Administrator.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Motherfucker...

           INT. HALLWAY, PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

           Nate, Campbell and Donna trail the Administrator down the
           long, institutional hallway.  Campbell whispers --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What did you tell them, Nate?  What
                        the hell is this about?

                                 NATE
                        I don't know.  I swear.       
                            (beat, sweetly)
                        Hey, Donna.  Are you gonna come over
                        later?

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah, your sister said you were gonna
                        let us pierce your nose. 

                                 NATE
                        Oh.  We hadn't, uh, discussed that
                        yet... but sure, I could --
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Stop flirting with my friend, Little
                        Fuck.  She doesn't like white guys. 
                        And you can't even ejaculate yet. 

           Nate averts his eyes, embarrassed.  Donna nudges him.

                                 DONNA
                        It's cool.  Most fifth graders can't. 
                        White or not.  

           Nate smiles, reassured.  Yes, she's a big girl.  But Nate
           has a crush.  They arrive at the school doors.  

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Nate, Campbell, you have a ride
                        waiting outside.  Donna, you can go
                        back to class now. 

           The Administrator opens the doors.  A Toyota Previa minivan
           idles at the curb.  Uncertain, Nate and Campbell nod goodbyes,
           then head off.  Donna watches her friends go...

           EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

           Welcome to Kissimmee, Florida.  It's 90 degrees and humid. 
           Proximity to Disney World is all this place has going.  

           The kids arrive at the minivan.  The driver side door opens
           and HARRY (30s) emerges.  He is a heavyset guy in shades and
           Tommy Bahama.  At present, there is a crack in the cool
           demeanor that usually companies his cool outfits.  

                                 NATE
                        Harry, what are you doing in mom's
                        van?  Where's the Camaro?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, I thought you and dad were on
                        business in Tampa. 

                                 HARRY
                        The trip, uh... got cut short.  I
                        just figured I'd stop by... check
                        out one of your bother's karate kicks.   

           Nate smiles and demonstrates a lame kick. 

                                 HARRY
                        Good deal, kimosabe.  You're a karate
                        master.  Never forget that...  

           Harry gets a little emotional.  Fumbles to open the side
           door of the family wagon.  Scoots Nate in and shuts it.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What the hell, Harry?  Did mom go
                        off the rez again?
                                 HARRY
                        No.  It's your dad...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY, KISSIMMEE HOSPITAL - DAY

           Campbell books down the busy corridor.  Skids to a stop at
           FRANCINE BURR (30s).  A sweet but colossally ill-equipped
           mother.  The current situation has turned her into primordial
           goo, in tight clothes and smeared makeup.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where is he!?

                                 FRANCINE
                        I don't know... there was a nurse and...
                        I think she was getting me a soda...

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Mom, what did the nurse say!?  Am I
                        an orphan!? 

                                 FRANCINE
                        No, you're not an orphan, honey...
                        you still have... me...  

           Francine's voice cracks as this registers.  New tears streak
           her face.  She sinks into a seat, overwhelmed.  

                                 FRANCINE
                        There were some forms I had to fill
                        out... but I can't find the nurse... 

           Campbell's eyes well up, too.  A scared little girl.  

                                 FRANCINE
                        Can you get Nate... I need a hug
                        from my Little Bundle...

           And there, in the eye of the shitstorm, Campbell makes a
           decision.  She flips a switch somewhere.  The tears cease
           and she is one cool customer.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just leave the Little Fuck out of
                        it.  I'll handle him.  You... don't
                        do anything.  Stay put. 

           Francine nods.  Campbell turns and heads off.  Harry waits
           nearby.  He gives her an awkward hug.  Searches for some
           wisdom to impart.  Settles for --  

                                 HARRY
                        Life... it ain't all blowjobs and
                        sunglasses.  At least that's what your
                        dad used to say.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        And he woulda kicked my ass if I didn't
                        promise that whatever you need, Uncle
                        Harry is here. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Thanks.  Just deal with paperwork, ok. 
                        And get her a fucking soda. 

           She continues off. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM, KISSIMMEE HOSPITAL - DAY

           Campbell stops and looks at her brother from afar.  Sitting,
           oblivious, in a chair.  She sighs at the responsibility.  

           Something catches her eye out the window... a toy store.

           INT. TOY STORE - DAY

           Campbell marches along, with purpose.  Sees a bright display
           for HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS.  A poster shows two kids playing,
           having the time of their lives.  She nods to herself...

           Grabs one of the games and hotfoots it.  A beat later, we
           hear the WHOOP of a security sensor.

           INT. WAITING ROOM, KISSIMMEE HOSPITAL - DAY

           All alone, Nate searches for a familiar face.  Campbell
           appears, sweaty from her getaway, clutching the game.  

                                 NATE
                        What happened?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I just dropped my life savings on Hungry
                        Hungry Hippos for you.  300 bucks.

                                 NATE
                        Shut up.  That game didn't cost 300 bucks. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wrong, shithead.  It's manufactured in
                        Paraguay, where the hippos are from.  Do
                        you know what it costs to import stuff?  

                                 NATE
                        No...

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Then keep quiet and enjoy my gift. 

           Campbell removes the game.  They silently set it up.

                                 NATE
                        Hey, Campbell... is dad ok?
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Why don't you worry less about dad, and
                        more about me beating your ass here.

           Campbell dumps the marbles into the game board.  As she slams
           a hand down on her hippo, and it takes a big, hungry bite -- 

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           TITLE:   l i t t l e   w h i t e   c o r v e t t e   

           The THROATY ROAR of an engine builds.  Revs at a V8 decibels. 
           Gradually gives way to a PITCHY WHINE.  That's the sound of 

           A LAWN MOWER

           Coming right at us, steel teeth gnashing.  We're 

           EXT. CONDO DEVELOPMENT - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Cuban WORKERS tend the grounds of this brand new development,
           in the sun baked sprawl of Florida.  

           We FIND Nate, now 23, wearing a "Masters Realty" nametag. 
           He has grown into a good looking young man.  Well intentioned,
           if not entirely fit to navigate life's challenges.  

           He gives a tour to a sweet YOUNG COUPLE and their CHILD. 
           There are ten other developments like this down the road, so
           it is not an easy sell.  And Nate is not a good "salesman."

                                 YOUNG HUSBAND
                        So these prices are negotiable, right?  

                                 NATE
                        Totally.  Well, I mean, we could
                        always talk to my boss and... you
                        know.  But I think you may find
                        yourself negotiating just to get in
                        on one of these paradise slices.  

                                 YOUNG HUSBAND
                        They're all empty. 

                                 NATE
                        Lotta interest, though.  Lotta interest. 
                        And, hey, that's the future site of the
                        community pool.  Coming 2012.  Now let's
                        check out the model home.  Get a sneak
                        peek at what could be Your New Life. 

           Nate leads the family toward one of the condos. 

           INT. MODEL HOME, CONDO DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Nate holds the door open and the family enters past him.  
                                 NATE
                        ...and I can easily throw in the
                        Disney World season tix for the little
                        guy.  30 minutes or less and you're
                        at the happiest place on... 

           Nate trails off and stops in the foyer, as MUSIC builds. 
           Pulsing, aggressively sexy techno.  The family continues on.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Now give me, "I'm not gonna fuck you
                        tonight.  But maybe I'll blow you."

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        How the fuck do I act that?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Just lick your lips.  But like they
                        do it in Vogue. 

           Dread washes over Nate's face.  He hurries forward to find
           the family standing, stock-still, watching --

           Campbell, now 26, pose lascivious atop the dining room table,
           in heels, body glitter and skimpy couture.  She is still
           very attractive, but there's some wear on the tires.  A flash
           explodes over and over, as a TWEEKER GUY snaps photos on
           what must be a stolen camera. 

           The Wife is horrified.  The Husband covers his Child's eyes,
           but cannot turn away.  

           Nate finally snaps out of it.  Stumbles to the stereo and
           kills the music.  Campbell and the Tweeker stop and turn. 
           Campbell sighs -- as before, no stranger to trouble.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Motherfucker...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. MASTERS REALTY - DAY

           A bland strip mall storefront.  Nate bursts out.  Trudges
           across the lot, to the Toyota minivan from the opening.  

           Campbell sits on the hood, beside a military-style duffel. 
           She holds a huge ice cream cone that melts and drips in the
           sun.  As she talks, she licks the sticky runoff down her arm.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nate, it was a misunderstanding. 
                        Schedules got tangled.  I honestly
                        thought today was a Saturday.  I had
                        no idea you'd be showing the place.   

                                 NATE
                        It's Wednesday! 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, I don't have a secretary like you. 

                                 NATE
                        I am a secretary!  I got promoted a
                        week ago!  And now I got fired!

           Campbell holds out the cone, sweetly.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I got you Ben and Jerry's... 

                                 NATE
                        Sure, rainbow fucking sprinkles should
                        help this situation! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You told me I could crash there. 

                                 NATE
                        Not in the model home!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        There's a totally legit explanation. 
                        I needed a backdrop... for the photo
                        shoot.  That dude was a very well-
                        respected photographer.  He had a
                        flyer at Savage Tan.  He was helping
                        me update my portfolio.
                            (testing it out, vulnerable)
                        I've been thinking about giving modeling
                        another shot.  I feel like I could have
                        gone further.  And I enjoy luxury.

           Nate stands looking at her, anger giving way to incredulity.  

                                 NATE
                        That's the plan?  You wanna revisit
                        your fourth aborted career, after
                        packing on six years of hard living
                        and questionable tattoos?  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Step off.  My ink defines me. 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, as incomplete.  Have you even
                        gotten that back piece filled in yet? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm saving up for it...    

           Nate shakes his head. 

                                 NATE
                        You were supposed to be "laying low."
                        Not posing for some creep you met at
                        a tanning salon.   
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, just because I'm a fugitive,
                        doesn't mean I can totally stop
                        thinking about the future.  

                                 NATE
                        You're AWOL!  You need to be thinking
                        about how to convince the U.S. Army
                        that democracy is safer without you. 
                        Although... you wouldn't have to if you
                        hadn't enlisted just to piss off mom.  

           MOM.  The word is a gunshot to the gas tank.  Shit goes boom.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It had nothing to do with mom!  I'm a
                        patriot!  Love it or leave it, Nate!

                                 NATE
                        Fuck it, then, Patton.  Just go back.   

           Campbell takes a big, frustrated bite of ice cream. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No way.  Basic training sucked, and
                        now they expect me to waste the next
                        four years of my life on some boring
                        base in Georgia.  That fucking
                        recruiter promised me there was a
                        five percent chance I'd get stationed
                        in Hawaii.  Five percent my ass. 

                                 NATE
                        I'm not gonna lie, this is fucked. 
                        You've screwed up impressively here. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I realize that!  Quit crip-kicking
                        me!  Unless you wanna see what I
                        picked up from my drill sergeant!

           Campbell springs to her feet, demonstrates some sort of
           improperly learned neck strikes, while balancing the cone. 
           Nate sighs.  Sinks down onto the hood of the van.      

                                 NATE
                        You really are an "Army of One."

           Campbell takes a calming breath.  Sits beside Nate and offers
           the cone.  A peace treaty.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Rainbow sprinkles always used to
                        cheer you up... they're delicious. 

           Despite himself, Nate takes a lick.  
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Look at the bright side, you hated
                        that job.  

                                 NATE
                        I "disliked" it.  Anyway, you're the
                        one who told me to go into real estate.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Harry says that most of the world's
                        millionaires are in real estate.  I
                        figured you'd work there for a few
                        months and get stupid rich.  I'm always
                        thinking big for the two of us, Nate. 
                        That's just the kind of sister I am. 
                            (beat)
                        So, can I stay at your place for a while?

                                 NATE
                        I mean, an empty condo is one thing. 
                        But my apartment...?  Last time you --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I have nowhere else to go.  And I'm
                        covered in toxic body glitter.  At
                        least let me come back and wash this
                        stuff off...  

           She looks at Nate, imploringly.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, NATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Campbell's military duffel has exploded clothes and bizarre
           personal possessions all over Nate's once tidy living room. 
           He tries to watch TV, as Campbell yells from the bathroom --

                                 CAMPBELL (O.S.)
                        It's amazing how much thinking I can
                        get done in your shower!  I was down
                        before, but now I'm way up!  Here's
                        the plan: out of the Army, onto the
                        runway!  Then once I'm famous, I'll
                        help you find a new job!  Shit's
                        gonna be so awesome!  I can feel it! 

                                 NATE
                        I can feel my water bill skyrocketing! 
                        Just get out here and clean up already!  

           After a beat, the shower stops.  Campbell emerges, in a towel. 
           She looks at Nate -- wet, makeup-less and concerned.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey... do you really think I've lost
                        my looks?  Because that would definitely
                        fuck up the plan.  
           Nate softens a bit.

                                 NATE
                        You're still... a very attractive
                        young lady.  Though I use "lady" as
                        more of a census term. 

           Campbell laughs, strikes a little pose.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm a sexy bitch.  They can't take
                        that away from me.  Try as those
                        motherfuckers might.  

           She heads back into the bathroom.  Stops in the doorway.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, could you pick up some groceries? 
                        I can't exactly go to Publix during
                        store hours, you know, in case they're
                        hunting me.  Just grab some Lean
                        Pockets, Corona Lite, cookie dough,
                        gotta have my Sour Patch Kids...
                            (beat)
                        You know what, I'll make a list. 

           Campbell shuts the door.  Nate sighs.  

           INT. BEDROOM, NATE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           An alarm clock blares: 8:00 AM.  Nate shoots up.  Realizes
           he has nowhere to be.    

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

           Nate wanders.  He crosses to a crappy retail prison and knocks
           on the window.  Francine looks out from behind the register.  

           EXT. PUBLIC PARK, TOWN CENTER - DAY

           A few haphazard clumps of grass.  Nate sits on a bench with
           his mom.  She has grown older and more put together, but it
           has been a bumpy road.  

                                 NATE
                        Just come by and talk to her.  Please. 
                        Let her know she'll always have her
                        old room at your place.  

                                 FRANCINE
                        Honey, that's an awful idea.  She
                        came back for Thanksgiving and look
                        where that got us.  I made one comment
                        about Iraq and she spiraled into a
                        war hawk.  Took a stupid argument
                        all the way to the recruitment office.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANCINE (CONT'D)
                            (shakes hear head, at a loss)
                        Your sister and I... we need our space. 
                        And you're so much better with her. 

                                 NATE
                        I'm better at having my life upended? 

                                 FRANCINE
                        Yes.  You're a caretaker.  A giver. 
                        You're my Little Bundle.  And I was
                        in labor with you for ten hours, so
                        you owe me. 

           Nate slumps back in frustration.  Francine checks her watch. 

                                 FRANCINE
                        I gotta get back to the store. 
                        Just... try to have fun with her. 
                        Go get ice cream or something.    

           She kisses him and heads off. 

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING

           Nate drives, lost in thought.  He answers a buzzing cell.  

                                 MAN ON THE OTHER LINE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Burr?  Nathan Burr?  

                                 NATE
                        Yeah... 

                                 MAN ON THE OTHER LINE (O.S.)
                        This is Donald from Lakemore Storage. 
                        I'm calling about your space.  There
                        are some payments outstanding. 

                                 NATE
                        I don't have a storage space, Donald. 

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        According to our records, you do.  

                                 NATE
                        Is this a promotional thing?  Because
                        I have nothing worth holding on to.     

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        No.  This is a "come pay the overdue
                        amount or we auction off your shit"
                        thing.  You are Nathan Burr, of 112
                        Almira Street, correct?  

                                 NATE
                        No.  That was my father.  He... passed
                        away a long time ago.  
                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        Oh.  I'm sorry to hear.  I guess that's
                        why the number he left was out of
                        service.  I Googled your name and got
                        this cell off a "Masters Realty" website. 
                        Hey, when's the market gonna turn around?

           Nate sighs. 

                                 NATE
                        Never.  Just give me your address. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM, NATE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Nate enters.  MTV booms.  Despite this, Campbell is passed out
           on the couch, in a sitting position, wearing only an XL Nirvana
           sleep shirt.  Nate takes her in: his cross to bear... or not.  

           He nudges her awake. 

                                 NATE
                        Hey, you wanna drive to some storage
                        facility, pick up a bunch of dad's
                        old shit?

           Campbell opens her eyes, mutters groggily --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Huh...?  I was having a crazy dream...
                        I was on this yacht... with all these
                        chicks in bikinis and hot black dudes...
                        and we were drinking champagne... and
                        "spending cheese"... do you have a
                        dream book I could check? 

                                 NATE
                        That's the video for "Big Pimpin'." 
                        It's like a decade old.

           Nate nods to MTV.  This is lost on Campbell. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wow... weird coincidence...  

                                 NATE
                        Just get some pants.  Put your face on.

           Campbell peels herself off the couch.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        My face is always on, bitch.

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING

           Campbell, fuzzy with sleep, chugs a Mountain Dew.  She looks
           over at Nate. 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm sorry about the blowback from my
                        photo shoot, ok.   

                                 NATE
                        Whatever.  I'm past it.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You don't have to be.  Check it out.
                        I took delivery of these today.  

           Campbell digs into her shoulder bag, removes a stack of glossy
           modeling portfolio shots.  It looks like a Maxim photo spread
           gone Boogie Nights.  She shoves them in Nate's face, one
           traumatizing photo after another. 

                                 NATE
                        No!  Stop!  I'm catching nipple in
                        most of those!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That's "implied nipple."  Not actual
                        nipple.  This is glamour-level shit. 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, of course.  It's totally
                        glamorous seeing your sister pose in
                        various exaggerated states of ecstasy.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sex sells.  First rule of the fashion
                        industry.  You're gonna have to learn to
                        be a professional.  Because I consider
                        you part-owner of these.  You're a
                        stakeholder in my career.  Call it 15
                        percent.  And when I blow up, when people
                        say "Campbell," the way they say "Gisele,"
                        you'll be happy I got you fired.     

                                 NATE
                        Oh, I'm counting my blessings already. 
                        It's gonna be a great story to tell at
                        the country club, when all those doctors
                        and lawyers ask how I made my millions. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sarcasm is for the weak.  Either lead,
                        follow, or get outta my way. 

                                 NATE
                        You can't keep using those little
                        Army slogans now that you're AWOL!   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I can do whatever the fuck I want. 

           Nate shakes his head.  They drive quietly for a beat.  He
           glances over at one of the more revealing photos. 
                                 NATE
                        So... when did you get your nipple
                        pierced? 

           Campbell painfully massages one of her breasts. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Like a month ago.  It hurt like shit. 
                        I have some numbness.  Don't do it.     

                                 NATE
                        I wasn't going to. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Neither was I, Little Fuck.  But
                        sometimes life throws you a curveball.  

           EXT. LAKEMORE STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

           Rows of storage garages.  DONALD (30s) leads Nate and Campbell. 

                                 DONALD
                        Looks like your father had an
                        arrangement with Ron, who used to
                        run the place.      

                                 NATE
                        What sort of arrangement?

                                 DONALD
                        Cash, off the books.  That's how come
                        we sorta lost track of the space. 
                        I'm not gonna make you pay the whole
                        11 years that's outstanding or nothing. 
                        Ron says your dad was good people. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ron knows his shit. 

           Campbell holds out her fist.  Donald hesitantly bumps it.

           They arrive at a storage garage.  Donald unlocks it.  Throws
           open the steel retractable door.  A car waits, hidden beneath
           a vinyl cover.  Donald yanks it off. 

                                 NATE
                        Fuck me... 

           Nate and Campbell stare, wide-eyed, at 

           A 1977 CORVETTE STINGRAY 

           White with red leather interior.  T-tops.  The shit. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yep.  You got yourselves a certified
                        asphalt shredder.  
           Campbell looks to Nate.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where did this thing come from?

                                 NATE
                        Detroit, I guess.  But how it got
                        here, I have no clue.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You're sure dad never mentioned this
                        to you?  I don't like being left out.  

                                 NATE
                        He liked you better.  If anything, I
                        would have been left out. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Good point. 

           Campbell makes for the driver side.  Nate intercepts her. 

                                 NATE
                        Safety first.  Get shotgun. 

           INT. CORVETTE STINGRAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Nate and Campbell settle into the car.  Through the windshield,
           Donald hooks up a portable charger to the battery.  Nate turns
           the key.  The engine sputters.  Then, all at once --

           VROOOOOOM!  It unleashes a maniac wail.  Donald slams the hood. 
           The engine is so powerful that it rattles the car. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Memorial lap.  Right now. 

                                 NATE
                        No way.  We gotta get this thing
                        checked out.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's obviously working.  Listen to
                        it.  It's making noise.  

                                 NATE
                        These old cars are deathtraps.  They
                        straight up explode if you --    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Either make yourself useful or vacate
                        the driver seat.  This is an omen,
                        from dad.  Supernatural, Ouija board
                        shit.  He's dropping us a line from
                        the other side, and we gotta answer.  

           Campbell: clearly not fucking around.  
           EXT. LOCAL STREET - DAY

           The Corvette turns out of the lot.  The dual-exhaust displaces
           three years of engine sludge in a thick black cloud. 

           INT./EXT. CORVETTE STINGRAY - DAY - MOVING 

           Nate minds the posted speed limit.  Campbell pries loose the
           t-tops, blocking his view.  He shoves her aside.  Campbell
           stows the t-tops.  Leans back in her seat.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wow, this is really The American Dream. 
                        Cruising in the greatest muscle car
                        ever made, at 35 fucking miles per
                        hour.  A Honda just passed us, Nate. 
                        The men who died fighting the Japanese
                        salute you. 

                                 NATE
                        How's this: you tell me with a
                        straight face that your license isn't
                        suspended, and I'll let you drive.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        My license isn't suspended. 

                                 NATE
                        Congratulations.  You're still the
                        world's worst liar. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Whatever.  I shredded all my IDs
                        when I went AWOl, anyway.

           Frustrated, Campbell tries the radio: static.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ok.  You tell me something.  And I
                        only mean this to be helpful.  What
                        was it like the last time you took a
                        girl to bed?

                                 NATE
                        I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck
                        up right now, because I'm not --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I spent most of high school waiting
                        to use the bathroom while you
                        barricaded yourself inside with my
                        Seventeen magazines.  We can dispense
                        with the sexual formalities.   

                                 NATE
                        Fine.  Right before you showed up...
                        I met this girl at an office picnic. 
                        And I "took her to bed." 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ok.  Now I'm not trying to offend
                        you... but you're a decent guy. 

                                 NATE
                        Why would I be offended by that?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Well, only vulnerable, self-conscious
                        girls sleep with "decent guys."  But,
                        hey, I've lived in that neighborhood. 
                        And I'll tell you what they want.  

                                 NATE
                        Remind me what the point of this -- 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's about the car.  You see, those
                        girls don't want to "go to bed." 
                        They want to get screwed.  

                                 NATE
                        This is quickly getting dark.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm not talking S&M or simulated rape.    

                                 NATE
                        Please arrive at your point!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ok.  One piece of advice.  Which I'm
                        uniquely qualified to give.  Next time
                        you're with a girl, hold her wrists
                        above her head with one hand, put the
                        other on her ass, push deep inside and
                        kiss her hard.  Do that, respectfully,
                        and you won't have to check the sheets
                        to see if she enjoyed herself. 

           Nate tries to process this... very disturbed, very intrigued.

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, I mean... I could certainly
                        see how -- hey, WHAT THE FUCK does
                        this have to do with the car!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        This steel bitch has been trapped in
                        a cage for years.  She wants to get
                        screwed.  And I think you're just
                        the man for the job.  

           Nate shakes his head.  Can't help but crack a smile.  He
           opens up the throttle.  The experience of being in a speeding
           70s Corvette is something like riding a wooden roller coaster.
           Campbell sticks her head out the open t-top.  Wind whipping
           her hair.  Yells at people --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Enjoy the bus stop, lady!  You too,
                        Ho Chi Min!  U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!   

                                 NATE
                            (laughing)
                        What are you on? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Mountain Dew and Ritalin!  It's like
                        the elevator business: ups and downs!  

           EXT. LOCAL STREET - DAY

           The Corvette flies through the intersection.  WHOOSH!    

           INT./EXT CORVETTE STINGRAY - DAY - MOVING

           Nate's face: flush with thrill.  

                                 NATE
                        I didn't know they made cars like this!  

           Campbell drops into her seat.  Drums the dash, wildly.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You've barely opened her up!  Punch
                        it, Nate!  Punch this bitch! 

           Nate mashes the accelerator.  The RPMs scream into the red,
           propelling the car forward with uncontrollable velocity. 
           Nate's senses are so overloaded by SPEED and NOISE that he
           doesn't notice the rapidly approaching

           RED LIGHT

           Or the Hyundai barreling at Campbell's side.  The license
           plate might as well spell: CERTAIN DEATH. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        LOOK OUT!

           Nate reflex-swerves --

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           For an instant.  Then back to

           EXT. LOCAL STREET - DAY

           Empty.  But for the SCREECH of tires and CRUNCH steel.  The
           Corvette lazily rolls into view.  Lands on its wrecked wheels. 
           Smashed and smoking.  We now notice its vanity plate: BURRN.
           On the sidewalk, a TEENAGER points at the wreck, like it is
           the coolest thing ever.  He holds the camera phone on which
           he has caught it all.  

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           Labored breathing.  Eyes flutter open.  Focus to reveal 

           CAMPBELL 

           Licking the top of a pudding snack, which she has reappropriated
           from a tray in  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           She smiles, crookedly.  Her injuries from the accident total:
           one bandaid across her cheek.  God protects babies and fools. 

           REVERSE TO REVEAL Nate in bed.  He groggily touches his
           bruised face.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Before you look down, I want to
                        prepare you... they had to lose both
                        your legs below the kneecap. 

                                 NATE
                        Lose...?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Amputate.  I'm so sorry.  But they're
                        fashioning a sort of rig that will
                        allow me to carry you on my back.  A
                        soldier I knew who was in "the suck"
                        had one.  It's gonna be ok.  The
                        human spirit can't be extinguished.    

           Nate begins to sob.  Confused and scared.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Calm down.  It's the meds.  Trust me,
                        they're strong.  I took a few personal
                        pan Percocets from your allotment. 

                                 NATE
                        I don't care... I gotta look at my
                        legs... I'm gotta look... 

           Nate rips off the covers.  Screams.  His legs are intact. 
           Campbell smiles. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I imagine you're pretty relieved
                        right now.  So, the fact that all
                        you have is one crushed testicle
                        should be awesome news. 

           Nate slowly reaches down.
                                 NATE
                        Oh, no.  I can't even tell which
                        ball I lost.  Can you get the doctor
                        or something...? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Actually, I'm not supposed to be here. 
                        You know, the whole AWOL thing.  Pretty
                        lucky I walked away from the crash. 
                        I'll pick you up tomorrow.  It's gonna
                        be ok.  Enjoy the rest of your lunch. 

           Campbell slides Nate his half-eaten lunch.  Heads off. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           A Day Later.  Francine and an ORDERLY wheel Nate out. 

                                 FRANCINE
                        You never should have gotten in that
                        car, Little Bundle.  Your father...
                        bad luck followed him everywhere.  

                                 NATE
                        I still don't get it.  Dad was a
                        neon sign salesman.  What the hell
                        was he doing with a vintage Corvette?

                                 FRANCINE
                        Maybe he got it in trade.  Maybe it
                        was a wreck he restored.  Who cares? 
                        I'm just glad the goddamned thing
                        didn't kill you.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Francine helps Nate to the curb.  The minivan idles, Campbell
           behind the wheel.  She sees her mom... slides on huge shades
           and gives her the finger. 

           Francine shakes her head.  Nate hugs her goodbye.   

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING

           Campbell drives.  Nate stares out at the accelerating middle-
           distance. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You ok?  Still the meds? 

                                 NATE
                        I don't know.  Could be the fact
                        that I almost died. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Drama queen.  Maybe this'll cheer
                        you up. 
           Campbell rummages through her bag, pulls out an iPhone.  She
           does a poor job of trying to use it while driving.  Swerves.    

                                 NATE
                        In general, car accidents make people
                        more cautious drivers.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, I wasn't behind the wheel. 
                            (hands over iPhone)
                        Check it out.  We made the news.   

           Nate presses play on a NEWS VIDEO that she has cued up: it
           is the camera phone footage that the Teenager shot.  We see
           the wreck in BRUTAL SLOW MOTION.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Pretty cool, huh?  

           IN THE VIDEO: the car comes to rest.  Campbell climbs out,
           dazed.  Looks around.  Bolts. 

                                 NATE
                        You didn't walk away from the
                        accident... you ran.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Gotta stay one step ahead of the
                        authorities.

           Campbell grins.  Nate explodes.  Grabs the wheel and forces
           her to the side of the road.  

                                 NATE
                        Pull the fuck over!  Get out of my van!

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

           The minivan skids to a stop.  Nate jumps out and charges
           around to the driver side.  Campbell intercepts him. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What's your problem!?

                                 NATE
                        Just that I can't seem to get rid of
                        you -- UNTIL I'M POTENTIALLY DEAD IN A
                        CAR WRECK!  Then you move at lightspeed!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, I checked your pulse!  Called
                        an ambulance!  I even told them you
                        were bleeding from the crotch, which
                        probably saved your other ball! 

                                 NATE
                        Thanks for the fucking courtesy!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Mom said that bad luck followed dad! 
                        Well, you really are your father's
                        daughter!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hell yes, I am!

                                 NATE
                        Then it's agreed!  You blow into
                        town, firebomb my life --   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Don't blame me for --

                                 NATE
                        You forced me to drive the car! 
                        Just take responsibility!  For once! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You first!  You chose to listen to me!

                                 NATE
                        Yes!  Like when you "advised" me to
                        drop out of college!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ok, you didn't drop out of Harvard,
                        you dropped out of Palm Beach State! 
                        You were miserable!  I was looking
                        out for you!

                                 NATE
                        Oh, and now I have all these great
                        opportunities! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Why'd you even ask me!?  I never 
                        finished high school!  

                                 NATE
                        I had no one else to ask!  I trusted you!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Well, you... convinced me to dye my
                        hair blonde!

                                 NATE
                        I honesty thought it looked cool! 
                        Like Drew Barrymore!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I hate Drew Barrymore!   

                                 NATE
                        Since when!?  You love E.T.!
                                 CAMPBELL
                        She's even in that!?  I love it for
                        that hardcore little alien!  And the
                        twisted way he says --
                            (bad E.T. voice)
                        Ellliottt...  
                            (suddenly)
                        And the blonde hair's got nothing on
                        the fork you stabbed me with!

           Campbell pulls up her shirt, shows off a nasty scar.

                                 NATE
                        I was nine!  None of this compares!   
                            (shakes his head)
                        Fuck it... whatever.  I am so done. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Whatever right back to you, Nate. 
                        Whatever-ever-ever.  

                                 NATE
                        Whatever up your ass!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Whatever down your throat!  HIV
                        positive! 

           Nate goes to respond.  Bites his tongue.  Paces back and
           forth, composing himself.  

                                 NATE
                        Ok, here's the thing... your dumbfuck
                        antics are gonna get me killed.  And
                        I don't want to die.  In fact, I want
                        to get my pathetic life in order.  So
                        I say we go deal with the car, split
                        up what it's worth, then put you on a
                        bus.  We need some breathing room.

           Campbell shrugs, hurt, but tries to play it off. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fine.  But your life's gonna be dull and
                        shitty without me... all alone in your
                        sad apartment, with an empty couch...

                                 NATE
                        Maybe.  But it's not just about me. 
                        You need to get your shit right, too. 
                        You could be stuck in one of those
                        self-destructive cycles.  And we can
                        break it, right now.  Send you to
                        some totally new city.  Jacksonville. 
                        No, further -- Los Angeles. 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm definitely too big for you and this
                        dump.  Let's just go to the junkyard
                        right now.  Bang out a few dents and
                        that 'Vette is probably worth some
                        serious coin.  Fuck a bus, I'll be flying
                        first class.  Living the high life. 
                        And it's gonna be a one-woman show.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

           Nate and Campbell stare at the mangled corpse of the Corvette. 
           A car has never looked worse.  The MANAGER waits beside them. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        So can you... bang it out?  Paint it?

                                 MANAGER
                        I can crush it into a steel cube and
                        give you 200 bucks.  We pay per pound
                        and it's a light car.  

                                 NATE
                        Just out of curiosity, what was it
                        worth in mint condition?  

                                 MANAGER
                        Maybe 30, 40 grand. 

           Nate and Campbell's faces drop.  The Manager walks off.

                                 NATE
                        I really could have used that money. 
                        A unicorn comes into our lives and
                        you turn it into glue. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Keep pushing me, Nate.  You're messing
                        with live ammunition right now...   

           They stand there, both stewing.  After a beat, a cool mechanic
           in dirty coveralls approaches.  This is MANNY (30).  He speaks
           in a measured, cautious tone. 

                                 MANNY
                        Ma'am.  Sir.  I just want you to
                        know, your "shit" is secure. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What are you talking about, pit crew?

                                 MANNY
                        Hey, I'm not looking for trouble. 
                        If you were to, say, give me a little
                        finder's fee, let me wet my beak,
                        then I'd be one cool customer.   
                                 NATE
                        Who are you again?

                                 MANNY
                        Ok.  I read you.  Discretion is a
                        virtue.  Follow me.      

           INT. OFFICE, JUNKYARD - DAY

           Manny leads Nate and Campbell inside.  Locks the door.  He
           goes to a tarp in the corner and yanks it off to reveal three
           large duffels.  He sets one on a table, unzips it --

           Inside are stacks of white, vacuum sealed bricks.  She don't
           lie, she don't lie, Cocaine.  

           Nate and Campbell share a confused, terrified look.  

                                 MANNY
                        Yep.  You got enough white to party all
                        summer long.  I mean that respectfully.

           Campbell hesitantly reaches out, hefts one of the bricks. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where... did you find this?

                                 MANNY
                        In that bored out trunk of yours. 
                        You really fucked up the ride. 
                        Outrunning the fuzz?

                                 NATE
                        This isn't ours.   

                                 MANNY
                        Of course not.  I am in no way
                        implying these illegal substances
                        belong to you.  I know the drill. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You're not listening.  The car was our
                        father's.  We've never seen this before.

           Manny's wheels begin to turn.  Campbell pulls Nate aside. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 NATE
                            (realizing)
                        A secret Corvette, a shit ton of cocaine...
                        dad was a drug dealer.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No way.  Maybe he was just holding
                        it for --
                                 NATE
                        That already sounds improbable.  Our
                        father sold drugs.  He was obviously
                        in the middle of some big deal when
                        he had his heart attack.  

           Campbell struggles to process this.  Manny looks them over.

                                 MANNY
                        So, you two aren't, like... dealers? 

                                 NATE
                        No.  We showed up in a minivan. 
                        We're regular fucking citizens. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Speak for yourself.  I pushed
                        Adderrall in high school. 

                                 NATE
                        For a week.  You got kicked out. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I also got those "Warped Tour" tickets
                        I was saving up for.  And I gave Tré
                        Cool a handjob.  Who'd you give your
                        first handjob to?  Office picnic girl?

                                 MANNY
                        Listen, you guys seem like you have
                        your hands full.  Maybe seek counseling. 
                        I'll hang on to the snow for you. 

           Manny goes for the open duffel.  Campbell grabs his wrist. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        The fuck you will.  No one touches
                        my father's property but me.  

           Manny doesn't let go.  Campbell tightens her hold.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        This is a "Ranger Grip."  It's meant
                        for use on towelheads, but it works
                        equally well on shitheads.  So chose
                        your actions wisely.   

           Manny lets go of the duffel.  Massages his wrist.  Looks at
           the drugs... the siblings...  

                                 MANNY
                        Ok.  Opportunity is knocking loud as
                        fuck.  I think we'd be stupid to ignore
                        it.  Maybe we can come to some sort
                        of arrangement.  Among new friends. 

                                 NATE
                        Like what...?
                                 MANNY
                        I help you unload the product.  But
                        I'd need to do more than wet my beak --
                        I'd need to straight drench it.  So
                        we split the million three ways.

           This figure staggers Nate and Campbell.  She lets loose a
           sudden, giddy chuckle. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That's a... million dollars worth of
                        cocaine? 

                                 MANNY
                        More.  But we can unload it easy for
                        a million.  It's ether cane.

                                 NATE
                        Is that supposed to mean something
                        to us?

                                 MANNY
                        Apparently not.  This is disco shit,
                        man.  Old school.  The stuff they
                        process now is garbage compared to
                        this.  Listen, just leave it with me,
                        I'll transact some business --   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sure.  We'll just leave our million
                        dollars of vintage cocaine with you. 
                        Hey, you wanna hang on to our wallets,
                        too?  Maybe rest your dick in my
                        brother's ass for a while?  

           Manny heaves a sigh.

                                 MANNY
                        Ok, fine.  Then we do it together. 
                        But you're gonna have to take a ride.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where?

                                 MANNY
                        You really are amateurs.  Where else
                        do you sell drugs in the sun?  Miami.   

           Campbell's face lights up.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fuck yes.  Now we're talking. 

                                 NATE
                        What!?  You really have no sense of
                        self-preservation!  We're not selling
                        drugs with some strange mechanic!  
                                 MANNY
                        Hey, do you mean "strange" like you
                        don't know me, or "strange" like you
                        think I'm weird or something? 

                                 NATE
                        A little of both. 
                            (to Campbell)
                        Let's just call the cops.  Turn the
                        drugs in for a reward.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's not a missing child.  All we'll
                        get is a fucking handshake.  This
                        guy has a plan. 

                                 NATE
                        He doesn't have a plan, he has a
                        location!  You can't just show up in
                        Miami and sell drugs!  

                                 MANNY
                        First of all, calm down, take a breath --
                        we're talking business.  Second of all,
                        white is like currency in Miami.  It's
                        as easy as changing bills at the airport.   

                                 NATE
                        I'm sorry, but you're wearing coveralls
                        with your name on them.  How do you
                        know shit about drugs or money?

                                 MANNY
                        I... did a little time.  

                                 NATE
                        Perfect.  You're a convict.

                                 MANNY
                        Do you see any bars here?  I'm an ex-
                        convict.  Nonviolent crime.  Good
                        news for you: I know all the right
                        people in the Magic City.  One day,
                        in and out, and we get paid. 

           Campbell looks to Nate, mind made up. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm doing it.  With this kind of
                        cash I can hire a lawyer to get Uncle
                        Sam off my back, fill in my tattoo --

                                 NATE
                        Oh, those sound like great reasons
                        to do dangerous, illegal shit! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nate, I can start over.  So can you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        And I'll be totally out of your way. 
                        Just like we talked about. 

                                 NATE
                        I didn't mean I wanted you dead or in
                        prison.  Just, you know... elsewhere.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Well, this is how you get it.  You heard
                        what he said.  One day.  We'll get a
                        tan, have Uncle Harry buy us an expensive
                        dinner, then do a little business. 

           Nate lets fly a frustrated --

                                 NATE
                        FUCK!  If you go and something happens,
                        it's on me.  I gotta deal with the
                        guilt, plan the funeral, make up a
                        bullshit eulogy about how great you
                        were.  And if I tie you to chair and
                        force you not to go -- IT'S STILL ON
                        ME!  Because then our lives will
                        probably continue to suck, I still got
                        the guilt, you're still on my couch --

                                 CAMPBELL
                            (to Manny)
                        We're in. 

                                 MANNY
                        Then gimme 24 hours.  I'll be in touch. 

           EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

           The sun sets.  Brother and sister haul the coke duffels to
           the parked minivan.  Campbell looks to Nate.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, Little Fuck... do you think dad
                        was one of the good drug dealers?  I
                        mean, there are good ones, right?

                                 NATE
                        I think I'm a relatively good person,
                        and I'm about to deal drugs.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Are you implying I'm not a good person?  

           Nate shrugs.  Campbell shoves him, knocking him over some
           junkyard debris.

                                                               FADE OUT:
           INT. LIVING ROOM, NATE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Coppertone Sunscreen, SPF 100, is set at the top of a travel
           bag.  Nate zips it shut.  Yells toward the bathroom --

                                 NATE
                        Campbell, get out of the shower!

                                 CAMPBELL (O.S.)
                        I'm planning the whole trip in here!

           Nate tosses his bag on the couch, next to the coke duffels. 
           There is a KNOCK at the door.  He crosses to it and opens up --  

           Two sweaty, young Military Police Officers wait.  MP CHAVEZ,
           fresh-faced, and MP DILLON, weary, with a cast and crutches.  

                                 NATE
                        Can I, uh... help you?

                                 MP CHAVEZ
                        We'd love to come in, sir.

           Nate hesitantly allows them in.  He glances at the couch,
           the coke duffels, the bathroom door.

                                 NATE
                        You guys look hot.  I got some, uh,
                        Fantas and stuff in here. 

           Nate steers them into the kitchen.  Grabs sodas from the
           fridge and hands them over.  The MPs nod thank you. 

                                 MP CHAVEZ
                        Mr. Burr, we're sorry to intrude, but
                        we're looking for your sister.  She
                        went AWOL from Fort Stewart down in
                        Georgia three weeks ago.  One more
                        week makes it desertion.   

                                 NATE
                        Does that mean you shoot her or something? 

                                 MP DILLON
                        There are consequences.  Especially
                        since she ran over one of our legs
                        in Augusta.  Can you guess which one
                        of us that was? 

                                 NATE
                        I'm... really sorry, man.  She's a
                        shitty driver.  

                                 MP DILLON
                        Seems to run in the family.  Caught
                        your name on a news search.  Nasty
                        wreck.  Saw the video and everything. 
                        Who was that in the car with you? 
                                 NATE
                        Just a... friend.  I haven't heard
                        from Campbell in months.   

           Chavez glances at the bathroom door, steam rising from
           underneath.   

                                 MP CHAVEZ
                        Then who's that in the shower?

           At a loss, Nate backs up to the couch, where the coke duffels
           are still out of view.  He spots a pile of Campbell's strewn
           clothes.  Steels himself.  Grabs her pink thong and dangles it.   

                                 NATE
                        Some girl I picked up last night. 
                        Wish I knew her name.  You should
                        probably leave before she gets out.   

                                 MP CHAVEZ
                        Is that what you're asking us to do?

                                 NATE
                        I don't know... do you have to leave
                        if I ask you?

                                 MP CHAVEZ
                        Technically, yes.  We're not civilian
                        police. 

                                 MP DILLON
                        But we are really pissed off.  And
                        we're taking this one personally. 
                        So maybe you can fill us in on some
                        details.  Like your trip to Miami.

                                 NATE
                        Huh?

           Dillon picks something up off the counter.  A guidebook:
           MIAMI FUN!  Nate snatches it back. 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, I'm going next month.  Quit
                        looking around.  Don't you need a
                        warrant or something?

                                 MP DILLON
                        Sure do.  But you invited us in. 

                                 NATE
                        Now I'm inviting you out.  Take the
                        sodas to go. 

           The MPs head for the door.  Dillon stops and looks back.  
                                 MP DILLON
                        We'll be waiting right downstairs. 
                        And we got all day.  Not like I can
                        get around much with this fucking leg.

           The MPs walk out.  The door shuts.  Nate hyperventilates.  He
           hears a SOUND and whirls.  Campbell stands there, in a towel.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Why are you holding my underwear? 

                                 NATE
                        Two MPs were here!  One said you ran
                        him over! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That was an accident!  I was driving
                        a stolen Bronco!  It handled weird! 
                        Are they gone!?

                                 NATE
                        No!  They're waiting downstairs all
                        day for revenge!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fuck!  Grab the coke, we're going
                        out the back window! 

           Campbell snatches the thong, drops her towel and quickly
           gets dressed from the pile of clothes. 

                                 NATE
                        It's official!  I've seen you naked
                        more than any other woman in my life!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just get your shit! 

                                 NATE
                        They know we're going to Miami!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You told them!?

                                 NATE
                        No, they saw my guidebook after I
                        invited them in!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What!?  You never invite vampires or
                        law enforcement into your home! 
                        That's how they get you!

                                 NATE
                        Of course!  Well, what now!?
                                 CAMPBELL
                        We have two options: they apprehend
                        me and find the drugs, or we go out
                        the window and run.  Miami's a big
                        city, we'll be fine.  

                                 NATE
                        I need another option!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Trust me on this!  90 percent of
                        life's problems can be solved by
                        jumping out a window! 

                                 NATE
                        And the other ten? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I don't know.  I've never had any of
                        those problems, and this certainly
                        isn't one of them.  Come on.

           Campbell grabs the duffels.

           EXT. NATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Campbell and Nate climb out onto the fire escape, hauling
           the bags.  They hear something and flatten themselves...  

           MP Dillon hobbles around back, where the tenants' cars are
           parked.  Satisfied, he heads back to the front. 

           Campbell and Nate hurry down the fire escape and pile into
           the minivan with their luggage.  

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           Nate puts the key in the ignition, turns it halfway.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What are you doing!? 

                                 NATE
                        I'm gonna put it neutral and we'll
                        quietly roll away. 

           Nate puts the van in neutral.  It rolls one foot then stops. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        FUCKING DRIVE!

           Nate takes a breath.  Starts the van and peels off.   

           EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

           A muscle car stops, kicking up a thick cloud of dust.  On
           the rear deck, a CARTOON DEVIL grins above the word "DEMON."
           A hulking Cuban emerges.  Despite his tight, loud clothes,
           he still looks like a badass.  The lenses of his Blublocker
           shades perfectly match the paint job of his Hemi Orange '71
           Dodge Demon.  This is LUIZ.  As he crosses the yard -- 

           Manny slams into him.  His eyes are terribly red and he looks
           like shit, in an ill-fitting leisure shirt.     

                                 MANNY
                        Sorry, man.  You need something?

                                 LUIZ
                        Mercury Insurance.  Here about a...
                            (takes out form)
                        '77 Corvette.  White. 

                                 MANNY
                        Oh... she's a wreck.  Total loss. 

                                 LUIZ
                        You got a manager?  

           Manny hesitantly nods to the Manager's officer.  Luiz heads
           off.  Manny watches him go...

           HONK-!  Manny whirls to see the minivan pulling up.  He
           hurries for it. 

           EXT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY - DAY

           Miles of scorching blacktop.  The minivan blows past.  

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING 

           Campbell is asleep in the passenger seat, sunglasses on. 
           Nate drives.  Manny sits in back.  Nate catches his bloodshot
           eyes in the rear-view.  An awkward beat.   

                                 NATE
                        So, uh... what'd you go to prison for?

                                 MANNY
                        30 miles of silence and that's what
                        you're gonna open with?

                                 NATE
                        I'm just trying to make conversation. 

                                 MANNY
                        If you picked up a chick with a cold
                        sore, would you just ask her first thing
                        if she's got herpes?  Have some tact.  

                                 NATE
                        I'm not about to have sex with the
                        hypothetical herpes girl.  I am on my
                        way to sell drugs with you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        The fact that you went to prison means
                        you got caught.  That's relevant. 

           Manny shakes his head.  Grudgingly -- 

                                 MANNY
                        Grand theft auto.  I was fencing high-
                        line shit.  Ferraris, Lamborghinis,
                        Testarossa.

                                 NATE
                        Isn't that just a kind of Ferrari? 

                                 MANNY
                        Yes.  And I specialized in it.  Then
                        my fiancé stabbed me in the back.   

                                 NATE
                        Oh.  Sorry.  Do you... wanna listen
                        to the radio or --

                                 MANNY
                        No.  My head's killing me.  I had to
                        quality test the coke last night and I
                        got no sleep.  And just so we're clear,
                        that was officially the last time you
                        question me.  For your own safety. 

                                 NATE
                        Are you threatening me?

                                 MANNY
                        I'm saying you don't know what you're
                        doing.  This isn't amateur night at
                        the local bikini bar.  When you're
                        moving weight, shit can get real heavy.

           Nate sighs.  Focuses on the road. 

           EXT. FLORIDA HIGHWAY - DAY

           The minivan rushes at us.  As the ORANGE in the center of
           the Florida license plate grows huge, it becomes 

           THE THROBBING ORANGE SUN

           Above Miami.  A modern-day Casablanca.  A city built as much
           on NARCOTICS and SEX as GLASS and STEEL.  

           As the minivan cuts through town, Campbell points out the
           window.  Harry's smiling face is plastered on a bus bench
           that reads, "Harry Delvin has the SIZZLING Real Estate Deals!"

           VARIOUS SHOTS as the minivan finds its way from the flash of
           South Beach to
           EXT. SIESTA MOTEL - DAY

           A much less exclusive part of town.  The minivan parks.  Our
           crew gets out.  Campbell and Manny both look to Nate.

                                 NATE
                        What?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Go check us in.

                                 NATE
                        I drove the whole way.  Packed snacks. 
                        Is there one fucking thing on this
                        trip that isn't my responsibility?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes.  All the cool drug dealing stuff. 

           Nate reluctantly heads off.  Many grabs him --

                                 MANNY
                        Use cash and a fake name.  We're in
                        deep on this.   

           INT. ROOM, SIESTA MOTEL - DAY

           Nate, Campbell and Manny enter.  Toss their travel bags. 
           Manny inspects the room, looking under the mattresses, etc. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Is that necessary?

                                 MANNY
                        Yes.  I always search a motel room
                        when I check in.  It's common sense. 

           Manny looks around some more, trying to seem very professional.   

                                 MANNY
                        Cool.  Let's go out and get the coke.
                        We shut the doors, close the blinds,
                        and lock it up until my associates
                        call.  We're totally under the radar,
                        no one knows we're here or --

           KNOCK!-KNOCK!  Manny whirls, instinctually pulls out a cheap
           handgun and aims it at the door.  Nate and Campbell freak.

                                 NATE
                        Gun!  Get down!

                                 MANNY
                        Oh, yeah... I brought a piece.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Why!?  So you can kill us in our
                        sleep and steal the drugs!?
                                 MANNY
                        You were sleeping the whole ride! 
                        It's for protection!

           More KNOCKING.

                                 NATE
                        Oh, shit!  Do you think it's the
                        MPs?  Should we go out the window?

                                 MANNY
                        Wait, what MPs?

           Campbell glares at Nate.  Manny looks from one of them to
           the other. 

                                 NATE
                        Campbell's AWOL from the Army and
                        the Military Police might have
                        followed us here.

                                 MANNY
                        Who the fuck are you people!?  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Who are you, asshole?  I texted a friend
                        on the way.  It's probably just her.  
                            (calling)
                        Who's there?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Room service.  You ordered the cheap
                        beer and Sour Patch Kids.  Just open up.

           Nate looks to Campbell. 

                                 NATE
                        Who do you even know in Miami?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I have hoes in different area codes.    

                                 MANNY
                        This was my deal!  I didn't agree to
                        inviting new friends or --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Now it's my deal.  Just put the gun
                        away before I physically disarm you.

           Manny reluctantly tucks the gun.  Campbell opens up to reveal --

           Donna, now 26, no longer chubby.  Very attractive, in a Miami
           way.  Nate eyes her up.  She and Campbell hug. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        HOLY SHIT you keep getting skinnier!
                                 DONNA
                        I got promoted to the poolside bar. 
                        I have to work in a bikini.  It's a
                        demeaning motivator.  You look
                        really... muscular.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I know.  Basic training.  Feel my arm. 

           Donna feels Campbell's bicep.  Nate waves at her.

                                 NATE
                        Hey, Donna.  Long time. 

                                 DONNA
                        Nathan.  Has she been taking care of you?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        He's alive. 

           Manny pushes by Nate, shakes Donna's hand, slick. 

                                 MANNY
                        Hey, I'm Manny.  I -- 

                                 NATE
                        He works at the motel.  Hey, how's
                        that toilet coming?    

           Manny just shakes his head. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We're taking off.  Text me when I'm
                        needed.  

                                 DONNA
                        You're not gonna bring your little
                        brother to hang out? 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, you're not gonna bring me...? 

           Campbell looks back at Nate.  Sighs. 

           EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

           A tourist trap near the motel, crowded with VENDORS hawking
           crap.  Donna leads Nate and Campbell to the beach. 

                                 DONNA
                        ...it's so crazy that you guys won a
                        sweepstakes.  I didn't even know
                        they had those anymore. 

           Nate glares at Campbell.

                                 NATE
                        I wasn't aware, either. 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Until you found that game piece at
                        the bottom of your cereal.

                                 NATE
                        And what cereal was that again? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Coco berry... crunch flakes... 

                                 DONNA
                        Is that, like, a budget brand? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes.  The point is, we'll probably be
                        rolling around with a ton of cash pretty
                        soon.  So just chalk it up to the cereal
                        sweepstakes.  By the way, did you hear
                        that Nate's missing a testicle?  

           Nate drops his head, embarrassed.  Donna laughs. 

                                 DONNA
                        You guys haven't changed much. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Change is just around the corner.

           As they pass a SUNGLASSES VENDOR, Campbell swipes a pair of
           sparkly shades.  Slides them on.  Nate grabs her, hushed -- 

                                 NATE
                        You're a horrible liar and a worse
                        thief.  Quit going on a crime spree. 
                        You already have sunglasses.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I don't have sparkly ones.

                                 NATE
                        Between the MPs, and the cocaine,
                        and the fact that my ass is on the
                        line, too, is it really worth getting
                        caught for a misdemeanor right now?  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Like I said... I don't have sparkly ones.

                                 NATE
                        Fine.  Then I'm just gonna steal random
                        shit, too.  We can both play "loose
                        cannon" if that's what you want.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Try it.

                                 NATE
                        About to.  
           Nate nervously looks at the OTHER SUNGLASSES VENDORS they pass. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Go on.  What about that pair?

                                 NATE
                        They're the wrong shape.  They would
                        look stupid on my face. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Then try those.

                                 NATE
                        Oakleys?  No thanks.  I'm waiting
                        for the right ones...

           Campbell shakes her head.  Quickly swipes a cool looking
           pair and throws them at him.  He slides them on.  Donna looks
           back at them, both wearing new shades. 

                                 DONNA
                        Did you guys just shoplift? 

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           The trio walks along.  The beach is packed with trashy people
           in poorly chosen swimwear.     

                                 CAMPBELL
                        This place is paradise, huh?

                                 DONNA
                        It gets a little better. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nah, this is all I need.  Sun and fun. 
                        "Miami Campbell" is here to stay. 

                                 NATE
                        You know, I can actually see myself
                        settling down here.  Maybe get one
                        of those jet skis out there.  Do you
                        enjoy jet skiing, Donna?

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah, I guess...  

                                 NATE
                        Well, maybe we can do that sometime. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sure.  You're terrified of the water. 
                        Ok, Donna, we gotta roll.  Busy
                        schedule.  People to see, shit to
                        do.  I'll call you... 

           Campbell pulls Nate off. 
           EXT. 510 OCEAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           An upscale place in a much nicer part of town.  Campbell and
           Nate head inside, glancing at all the fancy cars out front. 
           Among the bright colors, we see a flash of Hemi Orange.  

           INT. 510 OCEAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Nate and Campbell wait on the same side of a cozy booth. 
           Campbell finishes a giant piña coloda, signals for another. 

                                 NATE
                        Slow down.  Tonight's a big night.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Harry's picking up the tab.  It's
                        basically an open bar.  Just take it
                        easy, this is all part of the plan.

                                 NATE
                        No, it's another stupid detour.  You
                        shouldn't have even told anyone we
                        were in town.  

           Campbell shakes her head.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nate, do you know what centrifugal
                        force is?

                                 NATE
                        Do you know what it is?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes.  I apprenticed as a pool guy when I
                        ran away the first time.  Centrifugal
                        force is the shit that spins all the
                        water around the drain.  That's like me. 
                        And you're like a leaf, caught up in me.     

                                 NATE
                        I couldn't be more confused right now. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Exactly.  You can't handle my whole
                        plan.  It would spin you out.  The drugs
                        are just step one.  Step two is getting
                        Harry to hook me up with some modelling
                        connections.  So just enjoy your meal
                        and let the adults talk business.  

                                 NATE
                        Harry's in real estate.  All he can
                        get you is a shitty condo.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Harry's big time.  He's got his face
                        on a bus bench.  
                                 NATE
                        Vagrants probably sleep on him. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Whatever.  It's sad that you can't think
                        big picture.  Mentally, I'm on step six
                        or seven right now, which is probably
                        gonna be starting my own pay website. 
                        Harry might know investors.  It's gonna
                        costs millions to buy Campbell.com. 

                                 NATE
                        Sure.  You've got a lot on your mind. 
                        Put another drink down the fucking
                        pool drain. 

           Nate slumps back.  After a beat, Campbell spots Harry
           threading the crowd.  Over a decade later, he has bleached
           blonde hair and a deep v-neck that shows off a healthy tan.    

           Harry arrives at the table.  Campbell squeals and gives him
           a big hug.  Nate shakes his hand.    

                                 HARRY
                        Look at you two.  In my hometown. 

                                 NATE
                        I thought you were from Kissimmee. 

                                 HARRY
                        Adopted hometown.  Miami's been good
                        to me.  
                            (spins Campbell)
                        Wow, you look fantastic!  And Nate...
                        you're definitely bigger.  But I
                        guess I never hear from you.  

                                 NATE
                        It's been a while.  And I require
                        less "favors" than Campbell.    

                                 HARRY
                        Hey, Uncle Harry is always here.  Now
                        go on, let me see a karate kick.

           Nate looks between them, unsure. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        He's paying for dinner.  Just do a kick.  

           Harry smiles, encouragingly.  Nate is forced to do a pathetic,
           denim-constricted kick.  Harry and Campbell crack up.

           LATER

           Food has been served.  Campbell and Harry clink glasses,
           faces both flush with alcohol, having a good time. 
                                 HARRY
                        ...of course I'll make some calls. 
                        Last month I squeezed this guy into
                        a hot beach front -- I think he's in
                        the modelling game.  And then there
                        are some old flames I can ring up. 
                        But that might be dangerous.   

           Campbell laughs, happily. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I knew you'd understand, Uncle Harry.   

                                 HARRY
                        Hey, I believe in you, kiddo.  But
                        you probably don't even need me. 
                        With a face like that, 24 hours in
                        this town and they'll all be chasing
                        you.  Count on it. 

           Campbell smiles huge.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You know, Nate could also use a job. 
                        He was in real estate, like you.  But
                        he got shitcanned.  Fucking recession.  

                                 NATE
                        Thanks.  But I'm ok.  I've been
                        thinking about going back to school. 
                        A little scholarship fund actually
                        just came up...  

           Nate trails off, as he notices something at the bar.  Orange
           Blublocker lenses... as a strange man, Luiz, seems to be
           staring right at him. 

                                 HARRY
                        You know, I never went to college.  

           After a beat, Nate snaps out of it and turns back to the
           table.  Says, a little too harshly --

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, I did know that.  

                                 HARRY
                        It's just a statement, Nate.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We're self-made people, Harry.  We
                        take our fate in our own hands. 

           Campbell grins at Nate, smugly.  After a beat, she removes a
           vibrating iPhone.  A text from Manny: We're on.  Pick me up
           at the motel.  She shows Nate.  
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm sorry, Uncle Harry, we gotta run.  

                                 HARRY
                        Hey, I'll drive you back to wherever
                        you're staying.  Grab your stuff and
                        I can set you up someplace nice. 

           Campbell goes to speak.  Nate cuts her off --

                                 NATE
                        You know Campbell.  Once she throws
                        her clothes on the floor, she refuses
                        to pick them back up.  We'll be ok.   

           She and Nate wave goodbye, as they hurry off. 

           EXT. SIESTA MOTEL - NIGHT

           The pink neon sign glows.  Nate, Campbell and Manny head out
           of the room and cross the parking lot.  

                                 MANNY
                        ...so just play it cool, follow my
                        lead, and this shit will be easy
                        like Sunday morning.    

                                 NATE
                        Ok, so are we gonna -- 

                                 MANNY
                        You just keep quiet.  And you...
                        just keep looking hot like you are.  

                                 NATE
                        Are you hitting on my sister? 

                                 MANNY
                        No.  I'm stating that the best role for
                        a girl during a drug deal is to just
                        stand by, look hot, provide atmosphere.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, this all counts as hitting on
                        me.  Let's stick to business.  

                                 MANNY
                        That's what I'm trying to do!  

           Manny stops by the minivan. 

                                 NATE
                        What?  We're not taking my van.

                                 MANNY
                        How do you suggest we get there?
                                 NATE
                        That's what I was gonna ask you before
                        you fucking shushed me.  I assumed you'd
                        boost a car.  Isn't that what you do?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, we need something way cooler
                        than the minivan.  

                                 NATE
                        We need something that's not registered
                        in my name.  What about that Ford?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Let's at least steal the SUV.  In
                        case we have to off-road.  

                                 MANNY
                        Just let me think!  I'm the expert car
                        thief.  I'm picking the car.  And it's
                        not gonna be the canary yellow Wrangler. 

           Manny looks around.  Spots a shitty looking Buick with a
           door that is shut crookedly.  

                                 MANNY
                        That one. 

                                 NATE
                        Nice choice.  Totally discreet.  

           As they cross to the car --

                                 NATE
                        So how does this work?  Do you have
                        a special tool or a hanger to jimmy
                        the lock?   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No, you wrap your coat around your
                        hand and smash the window. 

                                 NATE
                        None of us are wearing coats.

                                 MANNY
                        Please shut up.  I use my bare hands. 
                        It's taken me years to learn and it
                        requires total concentration.  Just
                        look away.  Make sure no one is coming.  

           Nate and Campbell stand lookout.  Manny inspects the Buick. 
           He takes a breath... then yanks the handle of the crooked door.  

           AN ALARM BLARES!  Impossibly loud.  The car's lights flash. 
                                 MANNY
                        Alarm!  Run!

           They all take off. 

           EXT. STREETS, MIAMI - NIGHT

           The minivan speeds away from the motel.   

           INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING 

           Nate pounds the wheel, sweating.      

                                 NATE
                        Shit, Manny!  You really screwed that up! 

                                 MANNY
                        I told you, I specialize in Testarossas! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just calm the fuck down! 

           Nate takes a breath.  Loosens up a bit.

                                 NATE
                        Ok... we're doing this. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We're really doing it. 

                                 MANNY
                        Goddamn right we are. 

           Nate swerves.  Everyone grabs on to something.  He pulls to
           the side of the street and jumps out.  Campbell watches as he
           dry heaves into a trash can.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I honestly can't believe we swam in
                        the same gene pool.  

           Nate continues to wretch.  Campbell turns back to Manny, who
           seems to be off in his own world. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        So, did your fiancé really turn you
                        in to the cops?  

                                 MANNY
                        What?  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I heard you and Nate on the drive down. 
                        I was just pretending to be asleep so
                        I wouldn't have to listen to four hours
                        of his bullshit.  
                                 MANNY
                        Oh.  Well, yeah... she, uh, didn't
                        see the relationship the way I did. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        For what it's worth, I'm sorry.  It
                        sucks getting screwed over.  I've
                        had more than my share of it.  

                                 MANNY
                        Like what...?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Both parents and every guy I ever got
                        tangled up with.  The last one helped
                        me go AWOL, then ditched me in a Howard
                        Johnson, with a grand of incidentals
                        and a nipple ring I never wanted. 

           Manny cracks a smile. 

                                 MANNY
                        Medium-security prison's worse, but
                        I see where you're coming from.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        At least our luck's picked up, huh?

           Manny nods.  Outside, Nate pulls his shit together.  Hops in. 
           Before Manny or Campbell can speak --

                                 NATE
                        Fuck both of you.  We're really doing it.  

           He throws the van into gear.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET, LIBERTY CITY - NIGHT

           Welcome to Miami's most dangerous neighborhood.  The minivan
           parks and our crew emerges, each with a duffel.  It is eerily
           deserted, except for scattered pockets of suspicious activity.    

                                 NATE
                        Great spot, Manny.  Why didn't we
                        just go to Haiti?  At least there's
                        an embassy there. 

                                 MANNY
                        What kind of neighborhood do you
                        think you sell drugs in?  

                                 NATE
                        I think you deal drugs in this kind
                        of neighborhood.  I think you sell
                        them onboard a yacht, to a slick
                        dude in a linen suit. 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Unfortunately, we're not doing business
                        with a male prostitute tonight.  Just
                        fall in line. 

           Manny nods and they head down the block.  He smiles at a
           RANDOM LOCAL, like he knows the place.  

           They stop before a tall fence.  Tangled shrubbery blocks all
           from view.  Manny looks back at Campbell, takes in her
           expectant face.  He opens the gate.

           The door to the crumbling house lies down a dark walkway... 

                                 NATE
                        Hey, I think I saw this house on the
                        news -- in every report about white
                        people getting murdered.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Could you just fucking trust Manny. 
                        He got us this far. 

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, just... trust me. 

           Manny crosses the threshold of the gate.  Stops. 

                                 MANNY
                        Ok.  We gotta go. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What?

                                 MANNY
                        I kinda... set you guys up.  They're
                        gonna steal the --

           The door to the house opens.

                                 MANNY
                        Run!  Now!

           Manny grabs Nate and Campbell, hauls them off.  Two WHITE TRASH
           TWEEKERS burst from the house.  One unarmed, SHIRTLESS.  The
           other with a BASEBALL BAT.  They give chase.  

                                 SHIRTLESS
                        Manny, you piece of shit!  

                                 BASEBAL BAT 
                        We're gonna fuck you up!

           Nate, Manny and Campbell race down the middle of the street. 
           Legs pistoning.  Heaving humid night air.  

                                 NATE
                        I knew it!  You --
                                 MANNY
                        Later!  These guys have been doing
                        meth for 36 hours!  We can totally
                        outrun them!

           SCREECH!  An orange blur skids around the corner behind them --

           BAM!  Impacts Shirtless.  Sends him airborne. 

           Our crew stops and looks back.  Shirtless hits the ground
           with a sickening crunch.  

                                 NATE
                        Oh, my god!  Should we call 911!?

           Manny recognizes the car.  It is the Dodge Demon.  Luiz steps
           out.  Now Nate's eyes fill with recognition, too.  They both
           grab Campbell and take off.  

                                 NATE
                        Fuck it!  This is between them!

           A horrified Baseball Bat looks at his bloody friend.  Charges
           Luiz, bat raised.  Stops when Luiz produces his own weapon:
           a "Miami street sweeper" aka an UZI SUBMACHINE GUN.       

           Baseball Bat tosses his bat and flees.  Luiz races after our
           crew.  Steadies his Uzi...   

           Manny glances back.  Takes in their impending doom.  Does 60-
           90 in a sudden, desperate burst.

                                 MANNY
                        FUCKING MOVE!  

           AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ERUPTS

           Shreds eardrums.  Muzzle flash turns the night stroboscopic.          

           A plague of panic.  Our crew screams.  Bullets lace the air
           with terrifying velocity.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We're in "the suck!"  We're totally
                        in "the suck!"

           Our crew dashes madly for the minivan, parked 20 feet away.
           Falling over each other.  As shots RAT!-TAT!-TAT! off steel,
           explode glass.  

           Nate leaps.  Slides across the hood of a car.  Probably saw
           it in a movie.  Lands ugly, wrist first, twisting.  Stumbles
           to the driver side door, remote out.  CLICK-!  Locks go up.  

           Just in time for Manny to throw open the side door.  But
           Campbell shoves him aside and jumps into the van.  Forcing
           him right into the path of hot steel.     
           A BURST OF WHITE 

           As bullets pierce Manny's duffel.  He is thrown backward,
           into the van.  Coke from the shredded bag escapes in clouds.  

           Nate fires the ignition and peels off, side door still open.

           Luiz skids to a stop.  Aims the Uzi at the disappearing van. 
           CLICK-!  Empty.  He draws a handgun --

           INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING

           CRACK!-CRACK!  The rear windshield detonates.  Glass sprays. 
           Coke blankets all.  No one has stopped screaming.   

           Nate cranks the wheel.  Van sluing sideways.  The force throws
           Manny across the seat.  He grabs a handle at the last moment,
           barely avoids being flung out the open door.  

           The van fishtails, then steadies.  Rockets down another crime-
           ridden block.  Campbell whips a seatbelt around Manny's neck. 

                                 MANNY
                        Please!  I'm --

           She yanks.  His words are cut off.  Nate's pulse has slowed
           enough for him to produce coherent words --

                                 NATE
                        I KNEW IT!  HE TOTALLY FUCKED US!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Congratulations!  You were right! 
                        Do you want a fucking medal!?

           Manny struggles against the seatbelt.  Campbell notices blood
           splatters.  Loosens the seatbelt so Manny can scream --     

                                 MANNY
                        I'm hit!  Oh, fuck, I'm hit!  

           One of Manny's pant legs is covered in blood.  He fumbles to
           inspect it.  Nate is doing 80.  He blows a red light.  Another
           car skids to avoid him.  

                                 NATE
                        Is he shot!?  Is he gonna die!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hopefully!  Just slow the fuck down!

                                 NATE
                        No!  We're escaping!
                                 CAMPBELL
                        The minivan is covered in blood and
                        cocaine!  And every taillight is
                        busted!  You do not want to be pulled
                        over right now!

           Nate reins it in.  Campbell removes the seatbelt from Manny's
           neck.  Grabs his shirt and hangs him out the open side door. 
           He screams.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Let's just find a dangerous spot to
                        dump this piece of shit!

                                 MANNY
                        What!?  Why!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You set us up to be murdered!

                                 MANNY
                        I set you up to be ripped off!  I didn't
                        even know that other lunatic!  Besides,
                        I had a last minute change of heart!

                                 NATE
                        He's kinda right!  Let's just drop
                        him at a hospital!

                                 MANNY
                        No way!  I'm on parole!  I can't
                        leave the state and I definitely
                        can't get shot!      

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You're on parole!?  

                                 MANNY
                        Why do you think I'm working in a
                        junkyard!?  My P.O. got me the job! 
                        I'm better than that!

                                 NATE
                        Wait, how long have you been out of
                        prison!?

                                 MANNY
                        72 hours!  And I'm never going back!

                                 NATE
                        Oh, sure!  You seem committed to change!

                                 MANNY
                        Please!  Someone help me get my pants
                        off!  I'm scared I got shot in the dick! 

           Campbell reluctantly tosses Manny back against the seat and
           shuts the side door.  
           She strips him of his gun and helps him off with his pants. 
           Manny inspect the bloody mess beneath.  

                                 MANNY
                        It's just my leg.  I think it's a
                        flesh wound. 

           Nate glances back. 

                                 NATE
                        You've been shot multiple times. 

                                 MANNY
                        They're multiple flesh wounds.  I'm
                        pretty sure of it.  Let's just get
                        some first aid shit. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Excuse me!?  Why would we help you!?

                                 MANNY
                        You threw me right into the line of
                        fire!  You got me shot!  I've clearly
                        paid for what I did!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Barely!  You lied to me!  I HATE lairs!

           Campbell slams a fist into Manny's leg.  He shrieks.  Grabs
           a handful of the loose cocaine and smears it on his wounds
           to numb the pain.  Grabs more and sucks it back with a sudden -- 

                                 MANNY
                        Fuuuck!  That is some high-speed shit! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You're gonna need a lot more of it!

                                 MANNY
                        Wait!  Just hear me out!  I felt
                        like we... bonded earlier.  And when
                        it counted, I came through.  I fucking
                        did.  That was my moment.  
                            (beat)
                        Now are you gonna come through for me?  

           Manny's words sink in.  Campbell and Nate exchange a look. 
           Both grudgingly nod.   

                                 MANNY
                        Also, we should probably change motels. 
                        I kinda told them where we were staying.       

           EXT. EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - NIGHT

           Another dump.  The minivan parks in the shadows.  
           INT. ROOM, EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - NIGHT

           The bathroom door is open.  Groans comes from inside.  Nate
           and Campbell are slumped on the twin beds, coming down from
           the adrenaline rush. 

                                 NATE
                        Ok.  We're alive, so shit could be
                        worse.  We need to flush the coke
                        and get out of here first thing. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No one's flushing the coke.  If you
                        want out, the door is right there. 

                                 NATE
                        We were almost killed!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Exactly!  I've come too far to give
                        up!  And I just popped my cherry
                        with the whole violence thing!  

                                 NATE
                        Lovely.  But if you would have just
                        listened to me --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I said you were right once!  Make me
                        say it twice and I will kick your ass! 

                                 NATE
                        You can't push me around anymore! 
                        And guess what: I just decided that
                        I definitely need this money to get
                        you out of my life!  So I'm taking
                        over this shit show!    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        The fuck you are. 

           Nate gets to his feet.  Stares at his sister, emboldened.  

                                 NATE
                        The fuck I am.  Your decision-making
                        consistently results in disaster. 
                        Mine does not.  I've held down several
                        jobs.  I can do this.  And I think
                        you know that.  So, do you wanna
                        make a million dollars, be a rich,
                        AWOL model?  Or do you wanna wind up
                        in the bathroom, applying Neosporin
                        to your gunshot wounds?   

           Campbell grudgingly mumbles -- 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I wanna make a million dollars. 
                                 NATE
                        That's what I thought.  
                            (suddenly)
                        Manny!  Get out here!

           Manny limps out of the bathroom, leg crudely bandaged, eyes
           red from all the coke.  

                                 NATE
                        I want some answers.  Who were those
                        guys tonight? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        He says he's taking over.

                                 MANNY
                        Fuck me...  
                            (beat)
                        The first two guys I knew from the
                        joint.  They were a couple of tweeker
                        white supremacists.  But nice dudes. 
                        Now they're gonna kill me.    

                                 NATE
                        And the hit-and-run, fucking orange-
                        sunglasses-at-night guy?  I saw him
                        at the restaurant tonight. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What?

                                 NATE
                        He was there, at the bar, watching us. 

                                 MANNY
                        He was at the junkyard this morning,
                        too.  Looking for your 'Vette.  He
                        said he was from the insurance company. 

                                 NATE
                        We don't have insurance. 

                                 MANNY
                        Clearly he was lying. 

                                 NATE
                        Clearly he's following the drugs! 
                        You told your friends about them! 
                        They must have told their friends! 
                        Now every degenerate and psychopath
                        in Miami knows we're walking around
                        with a million dollars of blow!  

                                 MANNY
                        Yes!  And the Military Police are
                        hunting us!  On top of my "friends,"
                        who are probably super pissed and know
                        where I live!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MANNY (CONT'D)
                        So now I really need the money from
                        this deal, because I gotta skip parole
                        and go on the lam! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wait, you think we're still gonna
                        cut you in?  Not leaving you to die
                        in the ghetto is as far as our
                        generosity stretches. 

                                 MANNY
                        Come on!  Anyone who found out you
                        had that much coke would have screwed
                        you over!  You should thank god you
                        found someone like me, who stopped
                        short of it!  Plus, YOU GOT ME SHOT!

                                 NATE
                        Manny, you're a liability, so we
                        can't cut you loose.  But your
                        percentage will be docked.  

                                 MANNY
                        Goddamn it...

                                 CAMPBELL
                        And not that we can even trust you,
                        but do you actually know anyone else
                        to sell the drugs to? 

           Manny weighs it out... shrugs. 

                                 MANNY
                        I'm trying to restart our relationship
                        from a place of honesty, and I'd
                        just be lying again if I said yes.  

                                 NATE
                        Awesome.  So you're totally useless. 
                        And back to the lying.  What did you
                        really go to prison for?  Because you
                        clearly weren't a "high-line" car thief.  

           Manny sighs.

                                 MANNY
                        Identity fraud. 

                                 NATE
                        Could have seen that coming. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        And the fiancé thing... was that sob
                        story bullshit, too? 
                                 MANNY
                        Shades of grey.  She was my business
                        partner.  We fooled around.  But she
                        never really gave a shit.  When I got
                        caught, she split with some other con.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Smart girl.  

           Manny drops his head, hurt.  Nate paces the room. 

                                 NATE
                        Ok, here's what's gonna happen: I'm
                        gonna work my Miami connections.  If
                        there's a safe deal to be made, we go
                        for it.  If not, we flush the coke.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What connections?  Your guidebook?    

                                 NATE
                        Just worry about keeping an eye on
                        him.  I'll trust you with the gun,
                        because I don't know how to use it. 
                        Let's just get some fucking sleep. 

           Nate falls onto a bed.  Manny looks between them...  

                                 MANNY
                        I guess I'm on the floor tonight, huh?

           Campbell just cocks the gun.  CLICK-!

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           THE MIAMI SUNRISE

           Churns a flux of color.  Reflected in the flawless pool at

           EXT. THE STANDARD HOTEL - DAY

           It's early and the pool area is empty.  HUSHED VOICES come
           from one of those swanky poolside tents. 

           INT. POOLSIDE TENT, THE STANDARD HOTEL - DAY

           Nate, Campbell and Manny are crammed inside.  Across from
           Donna, who has just been downloaded on some version of what's
           going on.  She processes this.  

                                 DONNA
                        So, no sweepstakes... and you guys
                        came to the one black person you
                        know to help you sell cocaine?   

                                 NATE
                        Ok, it's got nothing to do with --
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, you're just Nate's only "Miami
                        connection."  When, in fact, you're
                        my connection.  But Nate doesn't
                        have any friends of his own.    

                                 NATE
                        Can we just stay on topic?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No.  Because I know Donna, and I
                        could have told you that she has no
                        idea how to --

                                 DONNA
                        I mean... I might.

                                 NATE
                        Yes!  You see, I am constantly right. 
                        She works at a hotel, she knows people. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Shut up.  Donna, what kind of people
                        do you know?

                                 DONNA
                        I don't, like, know "drug dealers."
                        It's just... the concierge runs this
                        service, where if you're staying in
                        a suite they'll get you whatever you
                        want.  Girls, drugs, anything.  

                                 MANNY
                        I knew shit like that went down.  I
                        love this city! 

           Donna looks to Nate and Campbell

                                 DONNA
                        And why is the motel handyman here?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Actually, he's just a lying cocksucker. 
                        But unfortunately he's with us.  

                                 DONNA
                        Ok... and how much cocaine do you guys
                        even have?

                                 NATE
                        A million dollars worth. 

                                 DONNA
                        What!?  How did you --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Call it an inheritance.  Apparently,
                        our old man had a side business. 
           Donna looks them over. 

                                 DONNA
                        Ok... if I help out here, I want a
                        share.  Like, 50 grand. 

                                 MANNY
                        Everyone's an opportunist. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Make it 60.  Out of Manny's end.

                                 MANNY
                        I'm basically making minimum wage!  

           Donna stands.  

                                 DONNA
                        I'll see what I can do.  No promises. 

                                 MANNY
                        Can we at least kick it by the pool?    

                                 DONNA
                        I guess...

                                 NATE
                        It's cool.  We'll keep a low profile. 

           EXT. POOL AREA, THE STANDARD HOTEL - DAY

           The pool scene is in full effect.  GORGEOUS PEOPLE abound. 
           Music THUMPS from palm tree mounted speakers. 

           Nate is in a lounge chair, fully clothed, sipping a lame
           pineapple drink.  Manny cannonballs into the pool, soaking him.  

           Nearby, Campbell hovers by a table, in a cheap gold bikini
           that reveals several ill-advised tattoos, including large
           angel wings that have not been filled in yet.  She chats
           with a SLICK GUY... somewhat out of her depth. 

                                 SLICK GUY 
                        ...your uncle was right, I scout new
                        girls around town every day.  My
                        agency's just a boutique, but we're
                        always excited by talent.  You clearly
                        have some.  I see it right in front
                        of me.  And I see it in these.  

           Slick Guy gestures to Campbell's modeling portfolio shots,
           which she has spread on the table.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Well, here I am.  Discover me already.

           She laughs, trying to play it cool.  
                                 SLICK GUY
                        Why don't you just tell me what I
                        need to know.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Oh... ok.  Full disclosure, I have
                        some legal problems. 

           Slick Guy smiles, waves this off.  

                                 SLICK GUY
                        A girl that looks like you always
                        does.  We can handle that.  I meant,
                        what are you looking to do with that
                        dangerous body of yours?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I think those pictures say it all. 
                        I want to be upscale hot.

                                 SLICK GUY
                        So you're thinking a little girl-on-
                        girl?  I have a Latina you'd melt
                        the internet with.  Get the two of
                        you in a whirlpool --     

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You whirlpool with a fucking wetback! 
                        Take a look at those shots!  I'm
                        gonna be the next Guess Jeans girl!    

           Nate looks over from his lounge chair, as Campbell screams. 
           Manny towels off beside him.  They share a look.  

                                 MANNY
                        So is she always like this...?

                                 NATE
                        No, sometimes she's real fucking crazy.   

           Nate reluctantly goes to stand.  Manny stops him.   

                                 MANNY
                        I got this one, amigo. 

           At the table, Slick Guy picks up one of the raunchier photos. 

                                 SLICK GUY
                        Calm down, honey.  I mean, this looks
                        like porn with your clothes on.  I'm
                        just being real with you.  Get a clue.     

           Campbell looks hurt.  Manny appears beside her.  He snatches
           Slick Guy's daiquiri from his hand, finishes it in a gulp. 

                                 MANNY
                        That was your last drink.  Get lost. 
                                 SLICK GUY
                        You don't know who the fuck I am. 

                                 MANNY
                        That shit cuts both ways.  And stop
                        glancing at the security guys.  That
                        means you're intimidated.  Just go.       

           Slick Guy grudgingly stands.

                                 SLICK GUY
                        You two aren't worth the trouble. 
                        Go back to the suburbs.  Miami doesn't
                        want you. 

           Slick Guy heads off.  Campbell yells after him --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That man is a pornographer!  No one
                        talk to him!

           Manny glances down at Campbell's photos.  She quickly gathers
           them up, embarrassed.  Manny looks at her sincerely for a beat. 

                                 MANNY
                        You know, in prison they'd talk to
                        us a lot about "false goals."  Like,
                        I'd steal other people's identities
                        because I thought I needed --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm not a convict, so save the self-
                        help bullshit.  

                                 MANNY
                        Ok.  I like the photos.  I just...
                        think you have something that's hard
                        to capture.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wow, great line.  How many studs
                        used that one on you in the showers? 

           Campbell stomps off.  Shoves the pictures in the trash. 

           Meanwhile, Nate sees Donna talking to a CONCIERGE by the
           bar.  She waves him over.  Goes to speak.  The Concierge
           silences her with a raised hand.  Looks to Nate.  

                                 CONCIERGE
                        This is a lot of product.  Give me
                        one reason why I should trust you.  

           Nate looks to Donna, who shrugs.  He turns back to the
           Concierge.  Checks his nametag.  
                                 NATE
                        Jorge, I'm a businessman.  You're a
                        businessman.  I'd love to just give
                        you my word, but what is that worth to
                        a stranger?  So, the only thing I can
                        offer is... do you trust this face?       

           Nate smiles at the Concierge.  He looks very trustworthy.  

           EXT. BEACH, THE STANDARD HOTEL - DAY

           GLAMOROUS WOMEN in expensive swimwear cool off in the ocean.  

           Campbell sits alone in the sand, legs tucked into her chest. 
           She looks like a dork in her gold bikini.  The relentless
           sun bakes her skin. 

           Nate walks up behind her.  She does not turn.  He looks down
           at her bright red shoulders.  

                                 NATE
                        You always forget to use sunscreen. 
                        You're gonna burn like you did in
                        Daytona during the --   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just fucking get to it. 

                                 NATE
                            (taken aback)
                        Ok... it's on.  The concierge vouched
                        for us.  We meet his guy tonight.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Shut up.  That easy?  You just --

                                 NATE
                        I'm sure it's hard for you to understand,
                        living at the epicenter of the hurricane
                        that is your life, but when I take
                        over... smooth, that's how I do it.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What the fuck did you just say? 

                                 NATE
                        Miami Vice.  That was Tubbs' line. 
                        He had his shit together.  Crockett
                        was a mess.  Couldn't handle being
                        undercover.  Always got in too deep. 
                        Remind you of anyone? 

           Campbell just stares straight ahead, at the ocean.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You know, once upon a time, you were 
                        ok.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        I don't know... maybe I just needed
                        someone to fuck with after Maxwell
                        went to doggie heaven, but you used
                        to amuse me.  Now you've aged into a
                        barely tolerable brat.  And I'm bored
                        of it.  Go away.  

           Nate stops at the harsh response.  STAY on his sister, as we
           hear his feet crunch off, up the beach.   

           After a beat, she turns.  He has left a bottle of sunscreen
           in the sand for her.  Grudgingly, she applies it.   

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING 

           A garbage bag has been taped over the destroyed back window. 
           It flutters.  Nate and Manny ride quietly.  Campbell, sparkly
           shades on, is asleep again in the passenger seat.  Or, rather,
           she is pretending to be, as she suddenly bolts upright -- 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        STOP!

           Nate slams the brakes.  Horns blare.   

                                 NATE 
                        What!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just pull over! 

           Nate whips to the curb.  Campbell peeks out the window. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        There's a Military Police cruiser
                        parked one block away from our motel. 
                        I'd love to think that's a coincidence. 

                                 MANNY
                        Nate... when you checked us in, did
                        you use cash like I told you? 

           Nate swallows hard.  

                                 NATE
                        You told me to use cash at the first
                        place... but last night it was late,
                        and you were bleeding, and -- 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You fucked up.  And they traced your
                        credit card.  Now the drugs are in a
                        room guarded by the United States
                        fucking Army.  Turns out you're not
                        right all the goddamn --
                                 MANNY
                        Please!  You guys are on vacation! 
                        I'm about to jump parole!  Can we
                        focus on getting back our lifeline!? 
                        Without those drugs --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just ask, Tubbs.  Hey, Tubbs, what's
                        a "smooth" way to --

                                 NATE
                        We could just turn you in.  That'd
                        be real smooth.  Kill about a thousand
                        birds with that stone. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You?  Turn me in?

           Campbell rolls her eyes.  Rehearses a "confession" --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Thank god you found me, officers. 
                        I'm a gorgeous patriot.  But my
                        brother is a crazed, homosexual drug
                        czar, who forced me to mule for him.  

           At a loss, Nate punches Campbell in the shoulder.  She punches
           him back.  As they trade blows --   

           Manny's eyes are fixed to the motel.  On the floor above
           theirs, one room over, COLLEGE KIDS party, spilling out the
           door.  Music POUNDS.  Manny whirls on the feuding siblings --

                                 MANNY
                        Stop!  You two are gonna need to
                        shut the fuck up for a brief period
                        of time, because I have a plan.  Now
                        let's find a hardware store.  Quick.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PINK TOENAILS

           As Campbell saunters, barefoot, bikini topped, along   

           EXT. 2ND FLOOR BALCONY, EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - DAY

           She smiles at one of the COLLEGE GUYS outside the crowded
           party room.  Walks right past him and inside.   

           INT. PARTY ROOM, EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Campbell finishes chugging a beer.  Whips the empty bottle
           across the room.  It shatters.  Guys cheer. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes!  Now is this a fucking party or
                        an ice cream social!?
           She whirls on two SCARED LOOKING GIRLS. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You two -- MAKE OUT!  NOW! 

           The Guys go wild, yelling for them to do it.  Campbell cranks
           the stereo's volume, stomps her feet.  Everyone follows suit. 
           As the Scared Looking Girls give in to peer pressure --

           EXT. EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - DAY

           On the ground floor, MP Dillon, in civilian clothes, hobbles
           by our crew's room with his crutches.  The noise from upstairs
           is deafening.  He nods to MP Chavez, who stakes things out
           from afar.   

           Manny approaches the room, dragging one leg, like a gimp. 
           He stops at the ROOM NEXT DOOR.  Dillon eyes up his "bad
           leg," suspiciously.  Manny smiles -- 

                                 MANNY
                        Twisted it on the beach.  How about you? 

                                 MP DILLON
                        I fell down some fucking stairs. 

           Dillon walks off to do another lap.  Manny opens the door. 
           Signals to --

           Nate, in sunglasses and a cap, who hustles over from the
           check-in office.  They enter  

           INT. ROOM NEXT DOOR, EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - DAY

           Manny drops his pants to reveal a crowbar strapped to the
           leg he was dragging.  He undoes it and tosses it to Nate. 

                                 MANNY
                        You're the "handyman" now.  

           Nate sighs.  Turns to the wall between the rooms.  All the
           crazy party noise masks the sound, as Nate tears apart the
           wood paneling with the crowbar.  Beneath is a cement wall.  

                                 NATE
                        Now what?

                                 MANNY
                        Welcome to 70s construction.  Just
                        have it.   

           Nate slams the crowbar into the cement.  A chunk crumbles. 
           He attacks the wall.  Sweat pouring.  Until there is a small
           hole into the other room.  He drops the crowbar, winded. 

                                 NATE
                        Go on...
                                 MANNY
                        I can't fit in there.  You have
                        smaller hips. 

                                 NATE
                        Fine... just give me a push...

                                 MANNY
                        My pleasure. 

           Nate awkwardly squeezes himself into the hole.  Manny shoves
           him.  Nate grunts as he THUDS to the floor on the other side.

           We hear Nate race across the room.  A beat later, he shoves
           the coke duffels through the hole.  Sticks his arms through.   

                                 NATE
                        Come on, pull me. 

           Manny just stands there with the duffels... 

                                 MANNY
                        You know, a lesser man might leave you
                        trapped.  Alert the MPs that you're
                        down here, your sister is upstairs. 
                        Leave just enough coke to get you some
                        prison time, and split with the rest. 

                                 NATE
                        Stop fucking around!  Come on!

                                 MANNY
                        I always wanted to go to Cuba.  I'm
                        gonna be on the run, anyway.  Might
                        as well go expatriate.  With a million
                        bucks, a man could live like a king
                        down there.  I do love Latinas... 

                                 NATE
                        Are you serious!?  Are you gonna
                        fuck me here!?

                                 MANNY
                        I certainly could.  So... is my share
                        reinstated? 

                                 NATE
                        I can't believe you're trying to
                        negotiate right now!

                                 MANNY
                        Well, this is how one negotiates. 
                        When one has the most the leverage. 

                                 NATE
                        You motherfucker!  You set me up! 
                        Just get me out of here!
                                 MANNY
                        Then treat me fairly.  I got the drug 
                        back.  Do we have a deal or not?

                                 NATE
                        Fine!  Fuck!  I guess you earned it!  

           Manny shakes Nate's outstretched hand.  Then grips it tightly
           and yanks him back through.  

           EXT. EL FLAMINGO MOTEL - DAY

           Nate and Manny hold their breath, as they carry the three
           coke duffels away from the room, super casual... while the
           MPs' eyes are hot on their backs.  

           The guys head into the check-in office, out a side door. 
           Take off running. 

           EXT. STREETS, MIAMI - DAY

           The minivan flies away from the rear of the motel.  Campbell
           hangs out her open window, screams back --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        YOU JUST GOT DATE RAPED, UNCLE SAM!

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING 

           One hand on the wheel, Nate yanks Campbell back inside.   

                                 NATE
                        You're shitfaced! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I had to keep chugging Tequizas to
                        maintain my cover.  Those college guys
                        are such pigs.  And the girls are so
                        impressionable.  I stand by my advice:
                        it's a good thing you dropped out.

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, college is a scam.  I can get
                        you a Florida State degree for 60
                        bills.  Hell, I can get you a Harvard
                        Med School degree for 200.  You can
                        open a practice by noon.  Lot safer
                        than dealing drugs.  

                                 NATE
                        Great.  So give up your share and go
                        open a bunk medical office. 

                                 MANNY
                        I already did, Nate.  That's how I
                        wound up behind bars.  I said it was
                        safer, not harder to get caught. 
           Campbell giggles, drunkenly. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What kind of medicine did you pretend
                        to practice? 

                                 MANNY
                        Gynecology. 

           Campbell gasps, cracks up more. 

                                 MANNY
                        I'm just messing around.  I did
                        pediatrics.  Kids are a fucking joke. 
                        Everything's on Web MD.  I just wish
                        I'd learned some more about trauma,
                        because my leg's definitely infected. 

           Manny massages his leg.  Nate glances back. 

                                 NATE
                        Perfect.  You're bleeding through
                        your pants, she's a wreck, and we
                        have to look like respectable drug
                        dealers in less than an hour. 

                                 MANNY
                        Wait, that's 5:30.  Who are we selling
                        to, senior citizens?

                                 NATE
                        Professionals work business hours. 
                        And we're not selling anything.  Yet. 
                        This is a meet and greet.  We flash
                        some stuff, he flashes some cash. 
                        Make sure everyone's on the level. 
                        Now admit how well planned my shit is. 

                                 MANNY
                        It does... sound pretty legit

                                 NATE
                        Fucking right it does.  I'm dropping
                        you guys at another motel.  Check in
                        yourselves.  And get cleaned up.  

           Campbell sighs, puts her shades back on.  

           EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT, MIAMI - DAY

           The minivan squeezes into a spot.  Nate gets out and heads
           down a block lined with upscale stores.    

           EXT. SUNSHINE MOTEL - DAY

           Yet another shitty motel.  Campbell and Manny wait outside
           the new room.  He stretches his bad leg, mid-conversation --
                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, I can definitely run if I have to.     

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fine by me.  If this one goes wrong,
                        I'm happy to have a slow-moving human
                        shield while I get away. 

           Manny uncertainly stretches his leg some more.  The minivan
           pulls up and Nate steps out -- 

           In a white linen suit.  Campbell cracks up.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        How much did you pay for that
                        Halloween costume? 

                                 NATE
                        A thousand bucks.  I put it on my
                        debit card, but I'm expensing it
                        from all of our shares. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That is a criminal waste of money.

                                 NATE
                        Well, I'm a fucking criminal.  Look
                        at me now.  

                                 MANNY
                        I am.  And you can't show up to a
                        deal like that.  This dude's gonna
                        think you're a cop.  

                                 NATE
                        Somewhere, in the world of make believe,
                        it's possible that you know what you're
                        talking about.  But not here and not
                        now, so shut up and blow me.    
                            (to Campbell)
                        And I want the gun.  My deal, my gun. 
                        Just put the safety on. 

           Campbell reluctantly takes out Manny's gun, hands it over. 
           Nate hefts it, feeling like a fucking drug dealer. 

           EXT. BISCAYNE BAY - DAY

           Vessels skim across the water.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're

           EXT. PIER - DAY

           A quiet spot overlooking it all.  Our crew walks along. 

                                 MANNY
                        My leg is killing me.  How far away
                        did we have to park? 
                                 NATE
                        I can't risk this guy seeing me roll
                        up in a Toyota Previa with a garbage
                        bag for a back window.  It'll undercut
                        the whole image I'm trying to establish. 
                        So will you opening your mouth.  Just
                        act like my right hand man.  And
                        Campbell... Manny was right the first
                        time, you should just look hot.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        So now I'm your "drug ho?"  That's
                        as pathetic as you bringing me to
                        your Freshman Formal.  

                                 NATE
                        You said you wanted to go! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        And didn't it seem like a coincidence
                        that mom bought me a discman the
                        next week?  

                                 NATE
                        Whatever.  You were a shitty date.   

           Nate turns away.  They continue along.  Arrive at a parking
           lot.  Empty, except for

           A MERCEDES G-55 AMG

           120 thousand bucks of German steel.  Tinted out.  Serious
           rims.  Our crew stops at the opposite end of the lot.  

                                 NATE
                        That must be him...

           Nate gives a little hand gesture.  The driver side door opens
           and out steps a deeply tanned player, ROBERTO (30s).  Look
           up "drug dealer" in the dictionary.  Oh, yeah... and he's
           wearing a white linen suit.   

           Nate turns to the others, with a huge, self-satisfied smile.

                                 NATE
                        Didn't I tell you!  Look at that
                        suit.  It's like an unspoken code
                        between the two of us.   

           Roberto heads for a remote picnic table near the water.      

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, this dude's a narc. 

                                 NATE
                        What are you talking about?
                                 MANNY
                        The exact same shit I was talking
                        about when you showed up in that suit. 
                        He's dressed like a guy who's trying
                        to dress like what people think a
                        drug dealer should dress like.  

                                 NATE
                        Did it ever occur to you that maybe people
                        think that because it's exactly how drug
                        dealers dress?  Just get my back. 

           They head to the picnic table.  Nate sits across from Roberto. 
           The others go to sit, but Nate holds up his hand like they
           should stand.  He nods to Roberto. 

                                 NATE
                        Nate.  Good to meet you. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        Roberto.  And who are they?

                                 NATE
                        My associates.  You don't need to
                        know them.  It's irrelevant.  You
                        just need to know me. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        You're right.  I do.  Because I'm
                        looking at you, and I can't help
                        thinking... this man is not what he
                        seems.  This man is an optical illusion.  

                                 NATE
                        I'm not really following...

                                 ROBERTO
                        Forgive my coarseness.  But before I
                        fuck, I hang my pants in the closet. 
                        And before I do business, I leave my
                        manners in the ride.  I'm calling
                        you a motherfucking cop.

           Sweat escapes Nate's pores, as he stares at this man's very
           resolute, very dangerous face.  Finally, he gathers his
           courage and says the only thing one can at a time like this -- 

                                 NATE
                        You look like the narc.  My man had
                        you pegged the second you showed up. 

           In a flash, Roberto is upright.  A large handgun materializes
           in his hand.  He gets right in Manny's face. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        Would a narc pack something like this!?
                                 MANNY
                        No!  That's a big fucking gun!

                                 ROBERTO
                        Would a narc blow off your head in public!? 
                        Turn this suit into abstract art!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        If you do that, people who are definitely
                        cops will -- NATE, WHAT THE FUCK!?

           Nate has Manny's cheap gun out.  He struggles to keep his
           hand from trembling and voice from faltering.  

                                 NATE
                        No, it's cool.  This guy wants to
                        see if I'm real.  Well, would a cop
                        pack something like this? 

                                 ROBERTO
                        I couldn't tell you.  That gun looks
                        like a piece of shit. 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah... because it's a burner.  Easily
                        disposable.  Like a pre-paid cell phone. 
                        Except if I leave a message with this
                        shit, I don't expect a call back.  

           Campbell and Manny exchange a "should we run" look.  Roberto
           sizes up Nate, who has a crazy look in his eyes, largely
           fueled by fear and desperation.   

                                 ROBERTO
                        So, you're a bad man?  Killed a whole
                        lot of people?

                                 NATE
                        No.  I've never killed a person. 
                        But I've slayed a few pigs.  Man, I
                        killed a federal agent on Tuesday. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        You offed a feeb?

                                 NATE
                        If I have to keep repeating myself,
                        this isn't gonna work.  And when people
                        ask me, "have you dealt with Roberto?"
                        I'm gonna say, "tried to, but the
                        motherfucker couldn't be dealt with."  

           Nate signals to Manny, who removes a brick of coke from his
           jacket and hands it over.  Nate slams it on the picnic table.  

                                 NATE
                        Try it out.  And then you'll know
                        I'm real.

                                 NATE (CONT'D)
                        Because my shit gets you real high. 
                        You don't want the rest, then stop
                        wasting my time.  This is a nothing
                        deal for me.  I move dump trucks
                        with my regular guys.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Oh, yeah?  Who's your source? 

                                 NATE
                        Bolivia.  If you have the number,
                        give them a call.        

           Roberto lays his gun on the table.  Takes a small knife from
           his pocket, pierces the brick and does a taste.  Blinks --

                                 ROBERTO
                        Wow.  This isn't your average shit. 
                        I... I can't feel my face.   

                                 NATE
                        Don't tell me how good my own coke
                        is.  I know how good my coke is. 
                        So, do we have a deal?

           Nate offers his hand.  Instead of taking it, Roberto removes
           an envelope from his coat pocket and puts it in Nate's hand. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        10 grand.  So you know I'm for real. 
                        Tomorrow, we do the whole load. 
                        I'll text you a location. 

           Roberto grabs the brick of coke off the table.

                                 ROBERTO
                        And if I find out you're not on the
                        level, you won't live long enough to
                        regret it.  Great coke or not. 

           Roberto heads off.  Nate, Manny and Campbell stand there,
           waving, as he gets in his SUV and pulls off.  

                                 MANNY
                        Holy shit... he went for it.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yes!  That was fucking hardcore!   

           Campbell snatches the envelope.  Removes the cash and "fans
           herself" with it.  Nate can't help but smile.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where'd those moves come from!?  You
                        pulled a gun!  You're dangerous!
           Nate basks in his older sister's respect.

                                 NATE
                        I guess I... just seriously thought
                        that dude was gonna kill us all. 
                        And I kinda came up with some cool
                        shit to say last night.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You're a way better liar than me! 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, I always have been.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        My bother the drug dealer!  A million
                        bucks!  Goddamn!  We're rich!

           Campbell throws her arms around Nate.  He is caught off guard. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I have a proposal.  I say we take
                        this little cash advance and blow
                        the fuck out of it tonight.   

                                 NATE
                        That's ten thousand bucks! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Which means nothing to us now.  Come
                        on.  We deserve a night out.  

                                 NATE
                        No way.  The motel has pay-per-view,
                        we're gonna order some takeout --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You know, I think Donna might want
                        to party tonight...

           Manny nods, seriously.

                                 MANNY
                        Saturday night in Miami... anything
                        can happen.  

                                 NATE
                        Fuck it.  Let's go.

           INT. ROOM, SUNSHINE MOTEL - NIGHT

           The bathroom door opens.  Nate emerges in casual clothes.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What happened?  You went in there
                        Superman and came out Jimmy Olsen. 
                                 NATE
                        You told me I looked dumb.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Only because it was you. 

           Campbell crosses to Nate.  Musses his hair.  Unbuttons his
           shirt and yanks it off.  He stands there in a v-neck
           undershirt.  She tosses him the linen suit jacket. 

                                 NATE
                        No way.  I'm gonna look gay. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        This is how Harry rolls.  Put it on.

           Nate puts the linen jacket over his v-neck.  He looks cool. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Perfect.  Now let's get this bitch
                        started with a toast.  

           Campbell goes to the mini-fridge, pulls it open.  It is empty
           and disgusting.  She kicks it shut. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fuck!  I think someone was storing a
                        severed head in there!  

                                 MANNY
                        Hey, why are we scrounging for mini-
                        bottles... when we've got enough
                        snow for a bunny hill? 

           Manny's eyes go to the closet.  Campbell's eyes follow.  

                                 NATE
                        No.  No.  We're drug dealers.  Not
                        drug addicts.  

                                 MANNY
                        "Addicts?"  Come on.  I'm just talking
                        about a taste.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, just a taste...    

           Off Nate, terrified -- 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           PURE WHITE 

           Fragmented by sudden thrusts.  It evolves from an amorphous
           mass... into neat lines.  Exposing WORDS beneath. 
           Nate and Campbell are gathered around a rickety table, as
           Manny chop the coke with expertise.  It is laid out on an
           open magazine.  Nate sweats.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's gonna be ok, Little Fuck.  You'll
                        do great. 

                                 NATE
                        I'm not worried about being "bad" at
                        drugs.  It's just, I heard a story
                        about a kid who did coke for the
                        first time and his heart burst.  

                                 MANNY
                        Urban legend.  Propaganda spread to
                        prevent people from partying.  There's
                        native tribes in the Congo that brush
                        their teeth with this shit.  And they
                        live forever.  Spiritually speaking. 

           Nate looks to Campbell, innocently... 

                                 NATE
                        Have you done a lot of this?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I've tried my share of recreational
                        substances.  But coke?  Never.  I've
                        got an addictive personality and an
                        empty bank account.  I tried huffing
                        keyboard cleaner when I worked at
                        OfficeMax and got hooked for like
                        six weeks.  Cost me a promotion.    

                                 NATE
                        So let's not snort drugs.  Easy.   

                                 MANNY
                        Nate, you can't come to Miami,
                        orchestrate a million dollar drug
                        deal, and not read a line.    

                                 NATE
                        "Read" a line?

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, I only read my lines.  It puts
                        your mind elsewhere, so your body
                        can ride the rush. 

           On the magazine, Manny arranges each line of coke over a
           sentence in what appears to be an article about choosing the
           right swimsuit.  Satisfied, he licks the instrument he's
           been using: a Radio Shack credit card.   

                                 NATE
                        Have you done a lot of this?
                                 MANNY
                        They say it takes 10,000 hours to become
                        an expert at anything.  So I consider
                        myself a very experienced amateur. 
                        Now listen, you're gonna take the line
                        back, then read the line below it --
                        straight through to the period. 

                                 NATE
                        This is a two year old Marie Claire. 

                                 MANNY
                        I found this and the Gideon's Bible. 
                        Would you rather read a line from
                        Paul's letter to the Corinthians?  

           Manny rolls up a hundred dollar bill.  Dips down and does a
           long line.  Pops up and rattles -- 

                                 MANNY
                        "To enhance a smaller bust try a
                        halter bikini top!" 

           Manny pumps his fist and blinks back the rush.  Turns to
           Campbell and "presents" the rolled up bill. 

                                 MANNY
                        I'm pleased to present this award to
                        Campbell Burr, for being tonight's
                        disco queen. 

           Campbell accepts, feigning awards show thrill.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Thank you so much!  This is an
                        unexpected honor!  I'd like to
                        dedicate this to... my parents.

           Campbell dips down and does a line.  Shouts her sentence -- 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        "With the right attitude, nearly any
                        woman's swimsuit will look good to men!"

           Campbell pounds the table.  Gains composure.  Hands the rolled
           up bill to Nate.  

                                 NATE
                        I thought about it and I'm out. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nate, look at me. 

                                 NATE
                        No.  You're just gonna --

           Campbell grabs Nate's face and pulls it close.  Her wild
           eyes locked with his puppy dogs.  
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I don't want to peer pressure you. 
                        But you did good earlier.  And I
                        honestly think you're a cool guy who
                        should try cocaine.       

                                 NATE
                        This is exactly peer pressure!  This
                        is what people who make PSAs fear is
                        happening in every high school! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I didn't mean it like that.  I just...
                        don't want you to be scared.  Look
                        at me -- I've been out in the world,
                        I've seen things, and I'm not scared
                        of shit.  I've been lost in the marsh
                        after an all-night rave.  I've woken
                        up on the floor of a condemned bowling
                        alley in Orlando, missing my front
                        teeth.  Godzilla runs from me.   

                                 NATE
                        Those aren't your real teeth?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No.  They're veneers.  And you're my
                        brother.  And if you don't want to do
                        that cocaine, you don't have to.  But
                        if you fear it... then you must. 

                                 NATE
                        I fear it.

           Campbell slaps Nate across the face. 

                                 NATE
                        OW!  I bit my tongue!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Pain is weakness leaving the body! 

                                 NATE
                        The Army brainwashed you. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Semper Fi.  Do it. 

                                 NATE
                        Fine.  Half my line. 

           Manny halfs Nates line. 

                                 NATE
                        Half it again. 

                                 MANNY
                        That's hardly a line. 
                                 NATE
                        Half it!

           Manny reluctantly halfs the line again.  Nate dips down and
           does the small line.  Pops up and screams -- 

                                 NATE
                        "The nicer your body, the less
                        coverage you need, unless you're shy
                        or you're smart and want to save
                        your skin from sun damage, which can
                        be prevented by -- " 
                            (suddenly)
                        THIS SENTENCE IS TOO FUCKING LONG!

           Nate springs up from his chair, knocking it backward. 

                                 MANNY
                        Take a breath, Nate!

                                 NATE
                        I can't!  FUUUCK!

           Nate picks up his chair and tosses it across the room.

                                 MANNY
                        Be cool!  Don't go party girl on me!

                                 NATE
                        My heart is gonna burst!  Like that
                        kid!  I foreshadowed my own death!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You're not gonna die!  You're just
                        dangerously alive!

                                 NATE
                        No!  I can hear it beating in my
                        head!  It's gonna pop any second! 

                                 MANNY
                        That might actually be the door.

                                 NATE
                        Make it stop!

           Nate scrambles to the door.  Throws it open --  

           Donna stands before him, done up for a night out.  Nate
           swallows hard.  Stares at her with red, high eyes... 

                                 NATE
                        It's good to see you, Donna.  You
                        look very beautiful.  May I offer
                        you some cocaine from Bolivia?

           Donna laughs, not sure what to make of this linen jacketed
           drug user.  She looks to Campbell, who spreads her hands wide.
                                 CAMPBELL
                        He just did a line this big.  Madman. 

                                 DONNA
                        So, were you guys high when Campbell
                        told me to book the party yacht? 
                        Because I actually did that.

           Nate whirls on Campbell.  She shrugs.  He tries to quickly
           regain control.  

                                 NATE
                        Ok, no, no -- fuck no.  Shut it down. 
                        No yachts, no attracting attention,
                        and nothing stupid.  This is my show. 
                        We've got enough heat.  So we're
                        just gonna have some fun...
                            (eyes up Donna again)
                        Like, a lot of fun.  Agreed? 

           Everyone dutifully nods.  They all grab their stuff and head
           out.  Campbell is the last one through the door.  She stops.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Oh, shit -- I almost left with the
                        gun in my bag. 

                                 NATE
                        Well, ditch it!  No firearms!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Totally.  My mistake.  

           She heads back and stashes the gun.  Makes sure Nate is not
           looking... then slips a whole brick of coke into her bag. 

           EXT. SOUTH BEACH - NIGHT

           Packed with six-figure cars and sexy foot traffic...

           Our crew emerges from the crowd, stumbling, passing a bottle
           of champagne in a brown paper bag.  They approach 

           EXT. MANSION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           A snaking line at the door.  Nate heads for the end of it. 
           Campbell yanks him toward the BOUNCER, digs into her bag and
           drops a heavy tip.  The Bouncer opens the door, revealing a
           corridor of bright, pulsing light.  

           INT. MANSION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Music pounds.  Campbell's high-heeled feet drunkenly dance
           on a table, avoiding empty glasses.  She loses her balance -- 

           Falls onto a plush VIP BOOTH, with the rest of the group.   
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm gonna get some more champagne! 
                        VIP section!  This is how I do it
                        from now on!  Campbell 2.0!

                                 MANNY
                        More expensive fizz might not be
                        necessary.  I'm ABC.  All Blitzed
                        and Carbonated. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's not to drink!

           She goes to stand, trips again.  Manny catches her and they
           split together.  Nate is too high, and too happy to be left
           alone with Donna, to care.  He smiles across at her... 

                                 NATE
                        So... this music really sucks.  

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah, it's very Miami --

           With no warning or coordination, Nate leans in to kiss her. 
           She stops him.  Looks at his unfocused eyes.   

                                 DONNA
                        How fucked up are you?  

                                 NATE
                        I feel like someone's prom date.  

                                 DONNA
                        Maybe we should slow it down.  

                                 NATE
                        No.  I really like you.  I've liked
                        you since you were fat!  

                                 DONNA
                        Excuse me?

                                 NATE
                        Totally fucked that up.  What I meant was --

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah, I know.  You had a crush.  It was
                        sweet, except every scrawny white boy
                        wants to hook up a thick black girl. 

                                 NATE
                        Really?  Is that, like, a fetish
                        thing you've encountered? 

                                 DONNA
                        It got me through junior college. 

           Nate laughs. 
                                 NATE
                        Well, I guess I missed my shot with
                        all that.  I was too much of a pussy
                        to try anything.  But I kinda want
                        to... you know, change that... 

           Donna smiles. 

                                 DONNA
                        Oh, you mean now that you did a bunch
                        of blow? 

                                 NATE
                        I also sold a bunch of blow.  So
                        maybe we can --    

                                 CLUBGOER (O.S.)
                        BITCH!  ARE YOU CRAZY!?

           Nate whirls to see Campbell spraying bottles of champagne
           all over angry CLUBGOERS.  They shove and yell at her.  She
           is oblivious, having a great time.   

           Nate jumps up to help.  But he is knocked aside by two Bouncers,
           who hurry toward the commotion.  They try to grab Campbell.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Back off, terrorists!  Do you know who
                        I am!?  I dropped a grand at the door!

           Campbell uses her cheap purse like a weapon.  Violently swings
           it, keeping the Bouncers at bay.  It connects with one of
           their bulky physiques, tears.   

           A GIANT CLOUD OF WHITE

           That was the brick of cocaine that Campbell smuggled into
           the club, exploding.  Everyone freezes for a moment, as they
           realize that they are pancaked in expensive blow.  Then -- 

                                 MANNY
                        Let's get out of here! 

           They all take off.  The Bouncers chase.

                                 NATE
                        Fuck!  This way!

           Nate cuts onto the dance floor, frantically pushing bodies
           aside.  The Bouncers get caught up in the dense crowd.        

           EXT. ALLEY, MANSION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Our crew bursts out a back door, races off.  A beat later,
           the Bouncers emerge and hurry after them. 
           EXT. STREET, MANSION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Nate leads the others right into traffic.  Cars swerve to
           avoid them.  Gridlocking the street.  The Bouncers stop at
           the curb and give up, as our crew makes a getaway. 

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET, MIAMI - NIGHT

           Our crew all stop, winded, and look around, to see that the
           coast is clear.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wow.  That was close. 

           Nate grabs Campbell, yanks her around the corner to 

           EXT. SIDE STREET, MIAMI - NIGHT

           Nate drags Campbell to a quiet spot.  Explodes --

                                 NATE
                        ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What?  I don't like people pushing me
                        around.  I tipped those motherfuckers. 
                        I was just trying to have a good time.  

                                 NATE
                        You were carrying a prison sentence
                        in your purse!  For all of us!  We've
                        got a motel room full of drugs!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        If you're so worried, maybe you should
                        keep your voice down.

                                 NATE
                        What's the one thing I said tonight!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You said a bunch of things.  One of which
                        was that you wanted to have "a lot of
                        fun."  So I packed some party favors.  

                                 NATE
                        You were rolling around like Pablo
                        Escobar!  You had a kilo!

           Campbell shrugs. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Maybe I overestimated.  I was excited. 
                        I just thought we were gonna have,
                        like, a crazy time.  And I wanted to
                        be prepared.  What's the big deal? 
                        We got away.  Back off.      
                                 NATE
                        No.  We got away this afternoon, when
                        I came through.  We were celebrating. 
                        But you're such a loser that you don't
                        know how to win.  You just keep creating
                        new problems.  Campbell 2.0?  Fuck
                        that, you'll always be Campbell 0.0. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ok, you're making a snap judgment here
                        based on some bullshit.

                                 NATE
                        A snap judgment!?  I've known you my
                        entire life!  And I've finally realized,
                        on the eve of a drug deal you talked
                        me into, that you will never change! 
                        No matter what city you go to, or Army
                        you join!  You're not stuck in a self-
                        destructive cycle -- you are programmed
                        to self-destruct!  You are a
                        fundamentally broken human being! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        And you're a fundamental piece of shit! 
                        You don't know what you're talking about! 
                        If I'm so fucking broken, how'd I manage
                        to take care of you all these years!? 

           Nate shakes his head, laughs. 

                                  NATE
                        Campbell, you couldn't take care of
                        a pet.  In fact, the dog died because
                        you fed him chocolate cake. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It was his birthday.

                                 NATE
                        Chocolate is toxic to dogs.  And you're
                        toxic to me.  Have a good night.  After
                        tomorrow, I'm staying clear.   

           Campbell looks down at her feet. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, that's what you said... 

                                 NATE
                        This time I mean it.  Get that through
                        your head.  

           Nate walks away.  She waits, expectantly, as if he might
           stop.  He doesn't.  She goes to yell after him... stops. 
           Stands there, inhabiting the dark and lonely street. 
           EXT. ANOTHER STREET, MIAMI - NIGHT

           Nate walks back around the corner.  Looks to Manny. 

                                 NATE
                        Make sure she doesn't get us all arrested. 

           Manny nods and heads off.  Nate takes Donna's hand, tries to
           pull her down the block. 

                                 DONNA
                        Wait, what happened?  Is she ok?

           Nate just brushes it off, coming down from his anger. 

                                 NATE
                        Oh, yeah.  No big deal.  She's fine. 

                                 DONNA
                        No, I should go --

                                 NATE
                        Seriously.  We talked and she wanted to
                        be alone.  She was actually really hard
                        on herself.  Felt awful about what
                        happened.  Didn't want to ruin our night. 

           Donna sizes him up.  

                                 DONNA
                        "Our night?"  Do you even know where
                        we're going?

                                 NATE
                        Actually, no.  I, uh... have a motel room. 

                                 DONNA
                        Yeah, so do I... 

           EXT. SIDE STREET, MIAMI - NIGHT

           Campbell hurries off.  Manny catches up and grabs her. 

                                 MANNY
                        Hey.  Wait a second.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No!  I gotta keep partying.  If I
                        stop now I'll just crash too hard. 
                        So if you're gonna pull some holier
                        than thou shit, get in my way, cast
                        a bunch of fucking stones -- 

                                 MANNY
                        Why would I do any of that stuff? 
                        You wanna party, I'll fucking party.     

           Campbell cracks a smile. 
           INT. HALLWAY, THE STANDARD HOTEL - NIGHT

           Whispers.  A keycard slides into a door.  An electronic CLICK-! 
           The door opens to reveal  

           INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE, THE STANDARD HOTEL - NIGHT

           Nate and Donna hurry inside, laughing.  Shut the door.  She
           hits the lights, illuminating the high-end accommodations.  

                                 NATE
                        Holy shit.  The nicest hotel I've
                        ever stayed in is a Marriot Courtyard. 

           Donna glances at a clock: 2:35 AM.   

                                 DONNA
                        Well, it's ours for about 6 hours,
                        until housekeeping gets here. 

           Nate runs and hops over the couch.  Stumbles to a sliding
           glass door.  Opens it and steps out onto 

           THE BALCONY

           The city is spread out all around him.  A thousand little
           specs of vapory light, reflecting off the water.  

                                 NATE
                        So, this is what Miami is all about?

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Yeah...

           He turns.  In the dimness of the room, Donna sheds clothing.  

                                 DONNA
                        This is what Miami is all about.  

           Nate's eyes: a sublime rush.  He heads for her.   

           INT. ROOM, SUNSHINE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Staticy music blares from the alarm clock radio.  Manny takes
           down a huge line of blow.  Quickly followed by Campbell. 
           They are high out of their minds and speak rapid fire. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Can I ask you to do something for me?

                                 MANNY
                        Anything.  Go ahead.  Do it.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I want you to make me a whole new
                        identity, so I can start fresh after
                        this.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                        And I don't want anyone to be able
                        to find me.  Not the Army or Visa or
                        my family.    

                                 MANNY
                        Done.  I'll make you a rad identity.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'll do everything different this
                        time.  And I'll just change all the
                        shit I screwed up.  Can you get me a
                        PHD in something? 

                                 MANNY
                        Absolutely, doctor. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Brains and looks.  No one will be
                        able to stop me.  

                                 MANNY
                        What do you want your new name to be? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sandy Boulevard. 

                                 MANNY
                        That's a great fucking name.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        And I want to be from Sweet Water,
                        Mississippi. 

                                 MANNY
                        Sounds like a beautiful town. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I just made it up. 

                                 MANNY
                        Perfect.  Totally untraceable.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yep.  My new life is gonna be awesome. 
                        I'll have motherfuckers lined up to
                        be part of it. 

           They both do lines.  

                                 MANNY
                        Hey, Sandy --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        No.  I'm not ready for the name yet. 
                                 MANNY
                        Oh.  Ok.  Hey, Campbell, I think we
                        should take all the money we have
                        left, spread it across the bed and
                        make love in it.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I guess that could be interesting.

           They both do another line.  Campbell digs into her bag and
           hands Manny the envelope of cash.  He upends it all over the
           bed.  A few scattered bills flutter out.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        How much is that? 

                                 MANNY
                        I count like $350.  

           They grab each other and kiss.  But Campbell's highly impaired
           mind is elsewhere.  After a beat, she stops.  Falls onto the
           bed and bounces. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, do you wanna play a board game
                        with me?

                                 MANNY
                        Uh... I thought we just got done
                        playing Candyland, and were about to
                        move on to Trouble. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, we were.  But it's a real bad
                        idea to fuck anyone with more problems
                        than you.  So it's a real bad idea for
                        one of us.  I just can't tell which. 

           Manny laughs.  Shakes his head and does another line. 

                                 MANNY
                        Sure.  Lady's choice.  What are we
                        playing?   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just come on.  

           Campbell does one last line.  Grabs her stuff. 

           INT. SUITE, THE STANDARD HOTEL - NIGHT

           Nate and Donna have sex beneath the expensive sheets.   

                                 NATE
                        I just want you to know... I'm a virgin...

                                 DONNA
                        Oh, god.  Nate, I didn't --
                                 NATE
                        I'm just messing with you.  

           Donna laughs.  Nate slides a hand down, puts it on her ass. 
           Uses his other hand to hold her wrists above her head.  Kisses
           her hard.  The "move" Campbell taught him.  Donna MOANS...  

           INT. K-MART - NIGHT

           A 24-hour store, empty at this hour.  FIND Campbell and Manny
           on the floor of the "Toys & Games" aisle --

           Feverishly playing a HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS game they have
           ripped from the box.  

           As the sun comes up outside --

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. SUITE, THE STANDARD HOTEL - DAY

           Nate wakes beside Donna, the room awash in Miami light. 

                                 NATE
                        How much time do we have left? 

           She glances at a clock. 

                                 DONNA
                        Fuck.  Minutes. 

           They hurry out of bed.  Scour for strewn clothes.

                                 NATE
                        You know, after this is over, maybe I
                        can stay a while.  Or we can go someplace. 
                        First class tickets and stuff.  

           Donna laughs.  Nate finds her dress and tosses it to her.  

                                 DONNA
                        It's one thing for us to sleep together. 
                        But I don't know what your sister would
                        do if I "ran off" with you.  Stole the
                        only consistent man in her life.  She
                        might kill me execution style.     

           Nate brushes this off, continues to look for his clothes. 

                                 NATE
                        It doesn't really matter.  We do
                        this deal today, then she's finally
                        out of my life. 

                                 DONNA
                        Huh?
                                 NATE
                        Yeah, she takes her share and splits. 
                        300 grand should keep her gone a while.   

           Donna stops, concerned.  Holding his pants in one hand.  

                                 DONNA
                        Nate... with 300 grand, she's gonna
                        get herself killed. 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, which is why I'll be far away. 
                        You saw what she pulled last night. 
                        She's a fucking medieval plague. 
                        Can I please have my pants?   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You gotta understand, Campbell means
                        well.  She's just... a dreamer. 
                        With sometimes volatile dreams. 

                                 NATE
                        They're called nightmares!  How long am
                        I supposed to subject myself to that?  

                                 DONNA
                        Pretty much forever.  She's your sister.

                                 NATE
                        Whatever.  Just give me my pants.  With
                        all due respect to our genetic link,
                        fuck her.  She never did shit for me.  

                                 DONNA
                        That's really what you think?

           Donna stares at him.  After a beat, he shrugs.  She pushes
           past him, toward the open balcony door.  Balls up his pants
           and tosses them off.  

                                 NATE
                        Hey!  That's immature!

                                 DONNA
                        Oh, sorry.  It just seemed like
                        something Campbell would do.  

           Donna heads for the door.  It opens and a MAID wheels a cart
           in.  The Maid stops, surprised.  As Donna slips past --

                                 DONNA
                        Call security, that man broke in. 

                                 NATE
                        Oh, come on!

           Nate grabs a sheet and wraps it around his lower half.  He
           gathers the rest of his clothes and hurries out. 
           EXT. POOL AREA, THE STANDARD HOTEL - DAY

           Nate, in the sheet, angrily fishes his pants out of the pool. 
           An ATTENDANT with a skimmer watches him.    

                                 NATE
                        Go on, stand there and don't help! 
                        Fuck you!  You're a pool guy! 

           EXT. STREETS, MIAMI - DAY

           A trail of water... 

           As Nate walks along in his soaked pants, through the empty
           morning streets, head hung low. 

           EXT. SUNSHINE MOTEL - DAY

           The minivan is parked up on the curb, almost touching the
           door to the room.  Nate approaches, shaking his head.  

           Campbell and Manny are passed out in the front seats.  Nate
           raps on the window.  They groggily come to.  Campbell steps
           out, looks at Nate... 

           She bends and throws up.  Manny gets out of the van and holds
           her hair as she continues to wretch.  He shrugs --

                                 MANNY
                        Big night.  Hey, where were you? 
                        You get laid or something? 

           Nate just heads past them, into the room.  Slams the door. 
           Manny helps Campbell back into the van.  

                                 MANNY
                        Come on.  Let's just crash in the
                        back for a while.  

           EXT. 11TH STREET DINER - DAY

           The sun reflects off this steel railway car diner in the Art
           Deco District.  

           INT. 11TH STREET DINER - DAY

           Nate, Campbell and Manny are slumped in a booth.  Campbell,
           brutally hungover, sips from a giant coffee shake.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ugh... I'm gonna heave again...

                                 NATE
                        Obviously.  You should have gotten a 
                        a regular coffee.  Not a fucking
                        coffee milkshake.    
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Then you shouldn't have taken me to
                        a diner.  Because you know I always
                        order ice cream for breakfast.     

                                 NATE
                        Did you need to order a large?  

           Campbell slams the glass, liquid spraying, and stomps off. 
           Manny quietly finishes his breakfast.  A WAITRESS hands Nate
           the bill.  He looks to Manny, who makes no move for his wallet.     

                                 NATE
                        Give me some cash, you deadbeat.  I'm
                        not paying for your fucking Eggs Benedict.   

                                 MANNY
                        Easy.  Let me see what I got. 

           Manny digs into his pants.  Lays down a few crumpled bills
           and receipts.  Something ROLLS from the pocket debris --

           Nate stops it with his hand.  Two small marbles.  

                                 NATE
                        What the hell is this?

                                 MANNY
                        Nothing, man.  Marbles.  Your sister
                        made me play a game with her all
                        night.  And she cheated. 

                                 NATE
                        What game?

                                 MANNY
                        Hungry Hungry Hippos. 

           This strikes a chord.  Nate rolls the marbles in his hand. 

                                 NATE
                        You guys just went out and dropped
                        300 bucks on Hippos last night...?

                                 MANNY
                        What are you talking about?  Hungry
                        Hungry Hippos costs 29.99. 

                                 NATE
                        Sorry.  That's incorrect.  Campbell
                        bought me the game when I was a kid,
                        and it was sort of a day I wouldn't
                        forget, so... 

                                 MANNY
                        Ok.  But why the fuck would it cost
                        that much?
                                 NATE
                        Because it's manufactured in Paraguay. 
                        Do you know what it costs to import stuff? 

                                 MANNY
                        Do you?

           Nate goes to speak.  Stops.  Realizes...

                                 NATE
                        Goddamn.  She lied about the game.

                                 MANNY
                        What'd she do, buy it then make you pay
                        her back?  That's a pretty old con.   

                                 NATE
                        No... I actually think it's the only
                        time she didn't con me.  Fuck... 

           Nate looks down at the marbles, sadly.  Over at the bathroom
           door.  It opens and Campbell stumbles out.  Immediately knocks
           down a BUSBOY carrying a tray of dishes.  Glass shatters. 

           As Nate watches his sister attempt to clean up... he smiles. 
           Seeing her in some new light.  

           EXT. STREETS, MIAMI - DAY

           The minivan heads into an industrial neighborhood.

           EXT. HARBOR - DAY

           The minivan parks, out of sight.  Nate, Manny and Campbell
           emerge.  The place is deserted.    

                                 MANNY
                        This is a setup.  We're gonna get
                        offed.  Did he pick the spot? 

                                 NATE
                        Yeah, but I picked the time.  Don't
                        worry, no one's committing triple
                        homicide at 1:30.  

                                 MANNY
                        Fuck that.  I'm gonna check it out.  

           Manny creeps off.  Nate goes to the back of the van, where
           Campbell unloads the coke duffels.  He looks at her, guilty.    

                                 NATE
                        You know, after we're done... if you
                        want, maybe we can --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sorry, Little Fuck.  I've got plans.  
           Campbell slams the trunk door.  They stand there silently. 

                                 NATE
                        You, uh... wanna hold the gun?

           Nate offers the gun, sweetly.  Campbell just slides on her
           sparkly shades.  Looks away.  A beat later, Manny appears.  

                                 MANNY
                        He's alone.  We're all good.  

           Nate nods.  They each grab a duffel and navigate the
           industrial maze...  

           They turn a corner to find Roberto waiting by his G-55, with
           a fancy piece of wheeled luggage.  He smiles.    

                                 ROBERTO
                        I enjoyed the sample.  A lot of
                        beautiful women did regrettable things.     

                                 NATE
                        We... lost a little bit ourselves. 
                        Knock ten grand off the price.   

                                 MANNY
                        Probably fifteen. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        Between new friends, it's nothing. 
                        Now let me see the rest.   

                                 NATE
                        Let us see the money. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        I asked first.  And I'm here by myself. 
                        You've got your whole little entourage.  

           Nate drops his duffel.  Unzips it and punctures one of the
           bricks.  Roberto does a quick taste.    

                                 ROBERTO
                        White gold. 

           Roberto bends to unzip his luggage.  When he comes up

           HE IS AIMING TWO GLOCKS

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fuck!  We walked into an ambush!

                                 NATE
                        Roberto, be cool!  We're men of
                        business!  Not violence!  

           Roberto takes a deep breath, hands trembling. 
                                 MANNY
                        Aw, shit...

                                 NATE
                        What!?  Is he gonna kill us!?  He
                        looks unbalanced!  

                                 MANNY
                        No!  He's a goddamn narc! 

           Roberto pulls his shit together. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        That's right!  Vice Squad!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nate, you idiot!  

                                 NATE
                        The concierge said he was legit!

                                 ROBERTO
                        Fucking Jorge.  I pulled him over on
                        the Venetian Causeway, getting a
                        blowjob from a 15-year-old.  I own
                        him.  And now I own all of you.  So I
                        want the dump trucks.  I want Bolivia. 
                        And I want the federal agent you offed.    

                                 NATE
                        Roberto, you fuck, I trusted you...  
                            (beat)
                        But not that much.  There's barely enough
                        coke for a sweet sixteen in there. 

           Manny and Campbell trade a look.  Nate grins back at them.  

                                 NATE
                        Never call me an idiot.  I switched
                        most of the stuff out while you two
                        were napping in my van.  Smooth...
                        that's how I do it.      

           Roberto tears at the open duffel.  Finds one layer of white
           bricks and a bunch of towels beneath.  He charges Nate. 
           Jams the Glocks in his face. 

                                 NATE
                        Woah!  Cops can't do this!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Backup!  Where's your backup!? 

                                 ROBERTO
                        I work alone.  
                                 MANNY
                        This guy's lying!  I've been busted
                        by Vice Squad before, and they never
                        work alone!  Who the fuck are you!? 

           Roberto looks at them, caught.  Reluctantly confesses --  

                                 ROBERTO
                        I'm Highway Patrol.  The suit and
                        car are my brother's.  The cash is
                        from the evidence room.  I'm gonna
                        need that back.  Because I'll
                        definitely make Vice off this bust. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We already spent it. 

           Roberto bites his lip.  

                                 ROBERTO
                        Fuck it, the department will
                        understand.  Once I bring in the
                        rest of the coke.    

                                 NATE
                        We're not even drug dealers.  There
                        is no coke.  It was all a -- 

                                 ROBERTO
                        Forgive me if I don't trust you. 
                        Just lead me to it.  I'm pretty far
                        out on the edge here.  And people get
                        popped every day fleeing the police. 

           Roberto pulls back the hammer of one of the Glocks.  CLICK-!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Just tell him, Nate!

                                 NATE
                        Fuck!  Please take that gun out of my
                        face!  It's back at our motel!  I was
                        gonna give you the key and directions!

                                 ROBERTO
                        Now you're gonna take me there. 

           Roberto stows guns.  Reaches into his luggage and tosses
           them two sets of handcuffs.   

                                 ROBERTO
                        Make yourselves a daisy chain.  

           INT. MERCEDES G-55 AMG - DAY

           The door slams behind our crew, handcuffed to each other,
           Campbell in the middle.  Roberto gets in the driver seat and
           pulls off.  He turns on the radio, pumps a Latin rap station.  
                                 ROBERTO
                        Feeling muy bueno.  Muy fucking bueno. 

           The SUV pulls onto a deserted industrial street.  Manny sighs.  

                                  MANNY
                        Well, buckle up everybody, we're
                        going to prison. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Whatever.  We probably all deserve this...

                                 NATE
                        I fucking hate Miami.  I really --  

           A black Cadillac sedan roars out of an alley, skids to a
           stop right in front of the SUV.  Roberto stands on the brakes. 
           Another SCREECH from behind.  Roberto whirls --

           To find the Dodge Demon in back.  They are boxed in.  

                                 ROBERTO
                        What are you guys trying to pull!? 
                        Are these your people!?

                                 NATE
                        No!  Orange car!  Orange shades! 
                        Get us out of here!  Drive right
                        through them!

           Roberto goes to hit the gas --  

           CRACK!-CRACK!-CRACK!  Luiz fires from the window of the Demon. 
           Everyone ducks, screaming.  The SUV heaves, tires deflating.  

           Two suited THUGS emerge from the Cadillac.  Guns drawn.    

                                 MANNY
                        We gotta go!  This is a hit!

           Manny throws open the door and scrambles out, forcing the
           others with him.  Roberto follows out onto 

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - DAY

           Asphalt erupts, as gunshots trail our crew, handcuffed
           together.  They duck into an alley.  Roberto behind them.  He
           flattens himself against the wall, a Glock in each hand.  

                                 NATE
                        Give us the cuff key!   

                                 ROBERTO
                        No!  I can take these guys! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where!?  To traffic court!? 
           Roberto grudgingly tosses the key.  Nate catches it and undoes
           the cuffs.  Manny frantically searches for an exit.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Give me a gun!  I'll help hold them off!

                                 ROBERTO
                        Yeah, that's not gonna --

           Gunshots burst cement from the wall at the mouth of the alley. 

                                 LUIZ (O.S.)
                        Keep this up and you don't make it
                        out alive! 

                                 NATE
                        How did this guy find us!?  Manny,
                        if you fucked us again --

                                 MANNY
                        He's shooting at me, too!  And there's
                        no way out of here!  We gotta get to
                        the alley across the way!  

           Campbell looks to the alley across the street, which seems
           to have an escape. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Are you crazy!?  We won't make it!

                                 ROBERTO
                        Hey, I'm making the decisions here! 
                        We're not -- 

                                 NATE
                        Let's just see what they want!  

                                 MANNY
                        Whatever they want, they will kill us
                        once they get it!  I guarantee you of
                        that!  We make a move or we die!   

           They all realize he is right.  Roberto hands Campbell a Glock. 
           Tosses Manny his cheap handgun.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Ok, we lay down cover and make a
                        fast fucking break.  

           She grabs Nate by the shirt. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Don't worry!  I've been in combat
                        simulations!  It's all good!   

           Roberto nods at Campbell.  They burst out of the alley, Glocks
           spitting fire.  Luiz and the Thugs are forced back behind
           the Cadillac.  It gets shredded.  They return fire --    
           Manny is hit before he gets off one shot.  Blown backward,
           shoulder torn, blood spraying.  Nate struggles to drag him.  

                                 MANNY
                        This is not a flesh wound!

           Nate makes it to the alley and collapses.  He turns back to
           see Luiz rushing Campbell.    

                                 NATE
                        NO! 

           Luiz knocks Campbell back and grabs her.  Roberto whirls and
           fires, as Luiz forces her, fighting wildly, into the Demon.

           The muscle car peels away.  Door still open.  It slows as it
           passes the Thugs.  They jump in, ditching the ruined Cadillac.  

           Roberto fires after the disappearing car.  Nate tackles him. 
           His Glock clatters to the ground.    

                                 NATE
                        My sister is in there!

                                 ROBERTO
                        Let me call backup!  This just got
                        real!  I'll --  

                                 NATE
                        No!  I'm going after her! 

                                 ROBERTO
                        You're not --

           Roberto shuts up.  Manny is hovering above him, aiming the Glock. 
           His other arm hangs limp and bloody.  He looks to Nate, weakly.   

                                 MANNY
                        Come on... let's go...

                                 NATE
                        No offense, Manny, but you're a fucking
                        bullet magnet.  I'm going alone.    

           Manny nods.  Tosses Nate his cheap handgun.  Nate scrambles
           to the Cadillac.  

           INT. CADILLAC - DAY

           Nate jumps into the glass covered driver seat.  Struggles to
           start the engine.  It finally turns over, smoke spewing. 

           Nate peels off.  Head on a swivel.  Frantically scanning the
           deserted neighborhood.  The Demon is long gone. 

                                 NATE
                        FUCK! 
           He pounds the wheel.  Slams his fist into the dashboard.   

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.)
                        Please choose your next destination.  

           Nate hits the brakes.  Looks down at the battered GPS SCREEN. 
           Quickly scrolls through a map of the previous destinations... 

           The NAME of one catches his attention.  His eyes go wide. 
           As he hits the gas --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BLURRY VISION

           Comes into focus.  To find the cavernous barrel of a gun.  A
           finger pulls a trigger.  Water explodes, soaking us.  We're 

           INT. LOFT, HIGH-RISE - DAY

           An expensive place.  Lots of windows, overlooking the ocean. 
           Luiz levels the water pistol.  He has a bruised cheek and
           his Blublockers are crooked.  

                                 LUIZ
                        You got a cheap shot back there...

           REVERSE TO REVEAL Campbell in a chair, hands bound behind
           her back with twist ties.  Luiz sprays her a few more times
           and she comes to, spitting water.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Who the fuck are you... what do you
                        want...?

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What everyone wants.  Narcotics.  As
                        much as we can get our hands on. 

           Campbell painfully turns her head.  Gasps... 

           HARRY STANDS THERE 

           Smiling, sadly.  Gun in his pants.  One of the suited Thugs
           beside him.  Campbell's world inverts.  

                                 HARRY
                        Specifically, I want the load your
                        father screwed me out of.  Ok, kiddo. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Uncle Harry... what are you --

                                 HARRY
                        I tried, Campbell.  I tried to do it
                        nice, and I tried to do it neat.  But
                        you and your brother had to keep
                        running around, playing drug dealer.    
                                 CAMPBELL
                        Since when are you a drug dealer!?

                                 HARRY
                        You think real estate pays for all
                        this?  Take a look at the market. 
                        Your father and I got into the business
                        together.  That Corvette you crashed
                        on the news, we got 'em matching after
                        our first deal.  If he'd have lasted
                        longer, he'd have a brand new one.       

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You don't know what you're saying! 
                        Just let me out of this GODDAMN CHAIR! 
                        What the fuck is going on?!  

                                 HARRY
                        I'm... unburdening myself.  11 years
                        I've felt, well, less than nice about
                        how it went down with your old man. 
                        Figured it was my responsibility to
                        check in on you kids.  
                            (shrugs)
                        But now, it feels good to say, I
                        DON'T GIVE A FUCK!  I've financialized
                        the problem, and you're not worth a
                        million dollars of trouble.     

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wait... "less than nice" about what?   

           Harry shakes his head. 

                                 HARRY
                        Your father had ambition.  Blind,
                        idiotic ambition.  Which seems to be
                        hereditary.  He made a deal, tried
                        to cut me out.  So I put him in a
                        chair like that and... asked him
                        where the load was. 
                            (beat)
                        He had a heart attack before he could
                        answer.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Liar!  That's not what happened! 
                        They told me he -- 

                                 HARRY
                        Kiddo, how much do you think it costs
                        to pay off the goddamn Kissimmee coroner? 

           Campbell wildly struggles against her restraints.  Spittle
           and sweat fly.  Harry just looks on.  Finally, she gives up.  
                                 CAMPBELL
                        All these years... and you're the
                        thing that took my father away...      

                                 HARRY
                        Your father took himself out of the
                        game.  Sorry to break the news, but
                        he was a bad man.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm not such a good girl myself.  

                                 HARRY
                        Well, you're gonna be a dead girl if
                        you don't say something useful.  So
                        where's your brother?  If you don't
                        have my drugs, he does.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        If I tell you that... you'll just
                        kill him.  

                                 HARRY
                        Maybe.  I never really liked him. 
                        But I might let you live.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm not scared of you...

           Harry closes in on Campbell.  Reaches a hand out.  And checks
           her pulse.  He turns to Luiz. 

                                 HARRY
                        She's not lying.  Can we change that? 

           Luiz approaches.  He ditches his Blublockers, to reveal dead
           eyes.  With no warning, he punches Campbell right in the face. 
           Her nose erupts.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        MOTHERFUCKER!

                                 LUIZ
                        Sorry, kid.  I'm not a doctor, but I
                        think it's broken.   

           Tears seep from Campbell's eyes.  Blood from her nose.  

                                 HARRY
                        You keep this up, Vogue won't be
                        calling back.  

           Campbell just laughs.  Her voice cracks as she says --   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That's funny, because it felt like he
                        was applying makeup.
           Luiz takes another swing.  Campbell lowers her head.  His
           fist meets the hard part of her skull.  He howls, hand ruined. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sorry, you piece of shit, but it's
                        definitely broken.  

           Luiz lunges for her.  Harry grabs him.  

                                 HARRY
                        Just put some ice on it.  

                                 LUIZ
                        Fine!  But I wanna dump the body! 
                        Pay some homeboys to go necrophiliac!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'll come back from the dead and
                        break your other hand.  

           Luiz grudgingly heads off.  Harry looks at Campbell with
           something like respect.  As blood stains her clothes --   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Sorry about your little bitch.  It's
                        instinct.  I did a little time in the
                        Army recently.  

                                 HARRY
                        I heard something like that.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's interesting, in basic training
                        they don't teach you anything cool. 
                        You're basically just learning how to
                        be a bullet stopper.  But once you
                        make the Rangers... that's where the
                        hardcore shit happens.    

                                 HARRY
                        You were a Ranger?  "Elite" isn't
                        exactly your style.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Oh, no.  Not me.  But I got mixed up
                        with a real handsome one and he clued me
                        in.  You see, it's all about debilitating
                        injury.  You want to break knees and
                        elbows.  While inflicting blunt trauma
                        with your own knees and elbows.  You
                        meet hadji in the sand, you wanna make
                        sure he's gotta limp into paradise.   

           Harry cracks up.

                                 HARRY
                        This has been real entertaining,
                        Campbell.  As always.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        But now I'm all laughed out.  And
                        two roads are about to diverge in a
                        bullet to the fucking head!  SO WHERE
                        ARE MY DRUGS!?

           Campbell just stares back at him, coldly.  

                                 HARRY
                        I'd hate to pull something too
                        parental, like counting to three, but --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Don't bother.  If I'm gonna go out,
                        I'm gonna go out.  Serve me that
                        gunshot with a Diet Coke chaser, you
                        bleached blond faggot.    

           Campbell spits a bloody loogie in his face.  He slowly wipes
           it off.  

                                 HARRY
                        Ok, honey.  Time for a family reunion.  

           Harry goes for the gun in his pants --  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Actually, there is one last "Ranger
                        fact" you might find interesting...

           As Campbell continues, we see she is methodically wriggling
           her hands out of the twist tie restraints.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        When you're captured, they teach you
                        to play dead and tense up your wrists
                        and muscles... so that in case you're
                        tied up, you can more easily escape.   

           Campbell springs to her feet, hands free, and lashes out
           with quick, precise violence.  All that stuff she was saying
           about breaking bones is on gratuitous display.  

           The first thing she does is snap Luiz's arm at the elbow. 
           Then delivers a concussive blow to the back of his neck. 
           Tosses him, limp, at Harry, as he gets his gun out.

           CRACK!-CRACK!  Harry is bowled over and wildfires.  Shatters
           his own wall of windows. 

           CRACK-!  That one was Campbell, breaking the Thug's knee
           with a brutal kick.  She sweeps out his other leg and he
           topples.  Explodes a glass coffee table. 

           Harry clambers out from under Luiz, gun aimed right at her. 
           But she charges, knocking him back, as the gun goes off.
           INT. CADILLAC - DAY - MOVING

           Nate tears through an expensive neighborhood.  Rapidly
           approaches the GPS location.  Screeches up outside 

           EXT. HIGH-RISE - DAY

           Nate ditches the car in the middle of the street.  Runs for
           the building.  Scrolls through the electronic tenant list,
           finds: HARRY DELVIN, APT 10C.  He yanks the glass entry door. 
           It's locked.  

           Nate casts about, panicked.  Spots a metal trash barrel. 
           Runs for it and hauls it to the door.  Strains to lift it
           over his head.  Tosses it, glass shattering. 

           INT. ELEVATOR, HIGH-RISE - DAY

           Going up.  Nate takes out Manny's gun and steels himself. 
           Jabs impatiently at the 10th floor button.

           INT. LOFT, HIGH-RISE - DAY

           BLOOD.  MOTION.  CHAOS.  Campbell and Harry roll around,
           ferociously trading blows.  As Campbell headbutts him --    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        LIFE!  IT AIN'T ALL BLOWJOBS AND
                        SUNGLASSES!  IS IT, UNCLE HARRY!?    

           She draws back for another headbutt.  But Harry pulls it
           together and cracks her across the face.  She goes flying.  

           Harry scrambles for his gun.  Campbell realizes she is fucked. 
           Staggers to her feet and bounds across the sprawling loft. 
           Headed for the door.   

           INT. HALLWAY, HIGH-RISE - DAY

           Nate takes a breath, gun aimed at the lock of Harry's door. 
           Before he blows it open, he checks the knob.  It's open.   

           Nate takes a breath.  Hears the penetrating ring of a gunshot. 
           Throws open the door --

           INT. LOFT, HIGH-RISE - DAY

           It nails a running Campbell and she drops, just as --

           CRACK-!  The bullet that would have killed her splinters the
           door frame, inches from Nate's head.  He screams and dives
           to the ground.  Campbell pulls him behind a couch with her.   

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Holy shit, Nate!  You saved my life! 
                        Uncle Harry --
                                 NATE
                        I know!  This is fucked!  Let's just --

           CRACK-!  Never hide behind a couch in a gunfight.  Bullets
           can travel right through it.  Like the 9mm round that just
           left Harry's gun, punctured the couch and continued through
           Campbell's chest.  A confetti pop of blood and THUMP-!  She
           is a cut string puppet.  

           Nate absorbs this like 10,000 volts.  Surges up to his feet,
           driven by rage incomprehensible.

                                 NATE
                        YOU KILLED MY SISTER!

           It is impossible to tell whether Nate realizes Harry has a
           gun pointed right at him.    

                                 HARRY
                        Hey, Nate.  I'm actually not gonna
                        mind this.  Oh, and do me a favor,
                        tell princess to go fuck herself. 

           Harry pulls the trigger.  CLICK-!  Empty.  A beat.  Nate
           notices that Harry is staring at him... because he also has a
           gun in his hand.  His arm seems to raise of its own volition.  

                                 HARRY
                        Woah... just walk away... believe
                        me, you don't wanna kill anybody...

           Tears leave Nate's eyes.  But the gun stays fixed.  

                                 NATE
                        You're right.  It just seems like
                        something my sister would do. 

           Nate pulls the trigger.  BANG-!  A crackling muzzle flash. 
           Nate screams.  It turns out Manny's gun shoots about as good
           as it looks.  Because it just backfired.  Nate drops it and
           clutches his scorched hand.     

           Harry charges.  Drops Nate to the ground.  Nate tries to
           fight back, but he is no match.  Harry pummels him.  

           A broken and bloody Nate looks up at Harry, mouth working to
           form words that don't come out.  

                                 HARRY
                        Just shut up!  Do you have ANY IDEA
                        how long I've wanted to karate kick
                        you in the fucking chest!?     

           Harry pulls back and kicks Nate, savagely.  He wheezes.  Harry
           grabs a gun off the floor.  Hauls Nate up and drags him to a
           glass dining room table.  Tosses the lid off a silver bowl.  
           It is FULL OF COCAINE.  Harry upends it all over the table.     

                                 HARRY
                        So, you wanna play drug dealer?   

           Harry shoves Nate's face into the mess of coke.  

                                 HARRY
                        Go on!  Let's play!  Take that down!

           Nate does a small snort of coke.

                                 HARRY
                        Oh, no!  Show me you're a fucking
                        drug dealer!  Convince me!

           Harry presses the gun to his head.  Nate does a bigger snort. 
           Coughing.  Gagging.  Blood marring the white.  

                                 HARRY
                        More, you little piece of shit! 
                        More!  More!  More! 

           Nate does a huge snort.  Harry wipes Nate's face back and
           forth, all over the coke. 

           FROM BELOW THE GLASS TABLE: we see Nate's smooshed, bloody
           face, as he forces back the cocaine.  The world goes soundless
           and dreamy.  Until Nate's eyes bug out, the narcotics causing
           a dangerous chemical reaction.  Full adrenaline overload.  

           Nate shoots up with a primal scream.  Face dusted white. 
           Grabs the silver bowl and slams it into Harry's head.  A
           spritz of blood.  And Harry drops.   

           Nate hyperventilates.  Body wracked by tremors.  He has a
           lethal amount of cocaine in his system.  He staggers and
           grabs Harry's gun.  Aims it down at him.  

                                 NATE
                        FUCK!  YOU!

           Nate squeezes the trigger -- 

           When he hears a COUGH.  Whirls to find his sister's body
           twitching.  He drops the gun.  It hits the ground and --

           CRACK-!  Fires and takes out another window.  Nate barely
           notices.  He frantically scoops up his sister.  Struggles to
           haul her up over his shoulder.  

           The THUMP of Nate's heart can be heard blocks away.  His
           vision is blurred.  He haphazardly scours for car keys. 
           Finds a set and takes off.      
           INT. PARKING GARAGE, HIGH-RISE - DAY

           DING-!  The elevator doors open and Nate bursts out.  Lugging
           Campbell.  A man of singular purpose. 

                                 NATE
                        Don't die, Campbell!  Please don't die! 

           He wades through the cars, hitting the remote's UNLOCK button. 
           Helpless.  Lost.  About to crumple under Campbell's weight.    

                                 NATE
                        WHICH GODDAMN --

           CLICK-!  Taillights blink.  Nate stands, frozen.  He is, of
           course, staring at 

           A LITTLE WHITE CORVETTE

           This one is a brand new ZR1.  The most powerful GM sports
           car ever made.  Nate hustles to it, rips open the door and
           shoves his sister inside.  Climbs in after her and fires the
           ignition.  The MONSTER ENGINE echoes in the lot...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           VARIOUS SHOTS of Miami at midday.  The city our guys came to
           take.  Hot streets.  Fast cars.  Beautiful people.  Sun blazing
           above it all.  And coming at us, over a crest in the road --  

           A distant white blur, like a heat mirage.  Swerving crazily. 
           The ZR1 closes in, blows a light and sends PEDESTRIANS
           clamoring for their lives.  

           INT./EXT. CORVETTE ZR1 - DAY - MOVING

           Welcomes to the world as seen through the eyes of a young
           man about to go into shock from too much cocaine.  For those
           who have been here before, welcome back.  Please call your
           sponsor.  For everyone else -- it's completely FUCKED.  Cars
           look less like cars than bright spots of racing color.  All
           sounds are terrifying and distorted.     

                                 NATE
                        I can't breathe!  I'm gonna suffocate! 

           Nate pops the locks on the targa top, smashes it upward. 

           EXT. STREETS, MIAMI - DAY

           The targa tops flies off.  Explodes against a pole.  The
           Corvette skids left through a red light. 

           INT./EXT. CORVETTE ZR1 - DAY - MOVING

           Nate plows suicidally ahead.  Squinting through the sun and
           delirium.  He grabs a pair of sunglasses and throws them on. 
           Doesn't help much. 
                                 CAMPBELL  (O.S.)
                        AHH!

           Campbell jerks roughly back into consciousness.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I just had the most intense dream... 
                            (sees blood, realizes)
                        Holy shit!  It happened!  I got popped
                        in the chest!

                                 NATE
                        It's cool!  I have it under control! 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Where the fuck are we going!?

                                 NATE
                        To the hospital!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Do you even know where that is!?

                                 NATE
                        No!  I'm looking for it!  Hospital!? 
                        Where are you!?  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Can you please hurry up, because I'M
                        FUCKING DYING HERE!

                                 NATE
                        SO AM I!

           In a brief moment of clarity, Nate roots in Campbell's pockets,
           finds her iPhone and makes a call.  The car's bluetooth picks
           up the call and it comes through the speakers --   

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        What do you want?

                                 NATE
                        I need help!

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Yes, you do.  

                                 NATE
                        Campbell got shot and she's gonna die! 
                        And I'm about to go into aphalaptic shock!  

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Anaphylactic shock?

                                 NATE
                        Yes!  That's the one!  
                                 DONNA  (O.S.)
                        Ok, if you think this will get me to --

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Hey, Donna!  We're totally on the
                        level here!  Help!   

           Nate glances out at a street sign.  In the process, he swerves
           and destroys the side-view mirror of a parked car.  

                                 NATE
                        We're on 4th, just past Clearwater! 
                        Where's the hospital!?

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Oh shit, oh shit.  Ok.  Do you see a
                        Blockbuster?

                                 NATE
                        I think it's a Hollywood Video!

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Turn left onto Bay. 

           Nate is already in the intersection.  He whips the wheel and
           does a skidding u-turn.  Stomps the gas and turns onto Bay.  

                                 NATE
                        I'm on Bay!  What next!?

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Let me think!  I don't know where
                        every area hospital is!

                                 NATE
                        Ok!  Got it!  And I'm sorry that after
                        I screwed you I was such a dick!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        You screwed my friend!?

                                 NATE
                        We made love!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Well done, Little Fuck!

                                 DONNA (O.S.)
                        Ok, just keep going and turn onto the
                        entrance for the MacArthur Causeway! 
                        It'll be empty!  Then make two rights! 
                        And, Nate... I'm not the one you should
                        be apologizing to.

                                 NATE
                        Thanks, Donna!  Gotta keep driving
                        and not die!  I hope to see you again!
           Nate ends the call.  Looks to his sister, who is wildly
           digging through the glove box.  

                                 NATE
                        What are you looking for!?

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Vicodin!  Tylenol!  Anything!  This
                        gunshot kills!  Look out, there's
                        the bridge!

           Nate swerves --

           EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - DAY

           The ZR1 skids off the entrance ramp.  

           INT./EXT. CORVETTE ZR1 - DAY - MOVING

           They are a fucked pair.  Nate in shades, a fat rivulet of
           blood coming from each nostril.  Campbell a grunting,
           screaming mess.  She looks out at the long, empty bridge.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Punch it, Nate!  Punch this bitch!

           Nate drops his dirty sneaker to the floor.  The engine revs,
           madly.  Pinning the siblings to their seats.  

                                 NATE
                        In case you die!  Or I die first and
                        we lose control and plummet into the
                        ocean!  I just want you to know that
                        it's all my fault!  I was supposed
                        to be there for you!  I took so much
                        from you and I never gave shit back! 

           The speedometer climbs to 90 MPH.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        What are you talking about!?  No matter
                        why you did it, you came here!  To sell
                        drugs with me!  You've followed me into
                        the dumbest shit anyone could dream up!   

           They are pushing 150 MPH.

                                 NATE
                        I came because I wanted to!  I always
                        want to come!  I just guilt trip you
                        about it so I don't have to take
                        responsibility!  I'd follow you anywhere!

                                 CAMPBELL
                        That's so fucking sweet!  Do you know
                        how pathetic it is that the only good
                        man I've ever met in my entire life is
                        my brother!?  
           They are at 200 MPH.  Top speed.

                                 NATE
                        We're gonna make it!  I will make it!  

           EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - DAY

           The Corvette blazes down the final stretch.

           INT./EXT. CORVETTE ZR1 - DAY

           Nate rapidly decelerates as he makes the first right off the
           bridge.  It is a one-way street.  He and Campbell scream as
           cars fly at them.  Nate whips another quick right.

           The hospital looms up ahead.  Quickly growing larger.  Nate
           is shaking.  Not from excitement.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Nate, slow down!  

                                 NATE
                        I can't!  Oh, shit!  My leg!  I cant
                        use my --

           Before they crash into the EMERGENCY ROOM sign, Nate cranks
           the wheel right --

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           For an instant.  Then we're

           INT. ROOM, MIAMI HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Nate shoots up.  His purpose still singular.

                                 NATE
                        Where's my sister?

           He climbs out of bed.  Crumples.  One of his ankles is in a
           cast.  He hauls himself up off the floor. 

           INT. HALLWAY, MIAMI HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Nate hobbles to the nurse's station.  A NURSE looks up. 

                                 NURSE
                        Sir, you shouldn't be --

                                 NATE
                        Campbell Burr!  Tell me where she is!

           His desperation is palpable.  The Nurse flips through a
           patient list. 

                                 NURSE
                        I'm sorry... I don't see her name... 
                                 NATE
                        Does that mean she's dead?

                                 NURSE
                        Sir --

                                 NATE
                        IS MY SISTER DEAD!?

           Nate snatches the list and takes off.  The Nurse yells after
           him, but he does not slow.  He realizes something.  Flips to
           the JANE DOE section.  Quickens his pace.  

           INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY, MIAMI HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Nate hurries along.  He sees something in the distance. 
           Without breaking stride, he grabs a chair...

           And slams it over the head of MP Dillon, who was waiting outside
           a room.  He goes down, crutches and all.  Nate pushes into 

           INT. ANOTHER ROOM, MIAMI HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Nate shuts and locks the door.  Dillon bangs --

                                 MP DILLON (O.S.)
                        That was real stupid, kid!  I am
                        gonna fuck the whole family now!

           Nate crosses to the bed, where Campbell lies.  Shakes her awake.  

                                 NATE
                        The MPs are outside!  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I ditched all my IDs weeks ago...
                        how'd they...

                                 NATE
                        I don't know!  But they're here!

           Nate hurries to the window, throws it open. 

                                 NATE
                        Come on!  We're going out the window! 
                        I told you we'd make it!    

           Campbell looks at him.  Then over at the door, which thumps
           from Dillon's fist.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I can't do it, Nate... I can't go
                        out the window anymore...

                                 NATE
                        Yes, you can!  We can! 
                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm sorry... not this time... I'm way
                        too fucked up... they've got us...

                                 MP DILLON (O.S.)
                        I will break down this door!

           Nate knows that this will happen in seconds.  He looks to
           his sister.  Eyes lucid.   

                                 NATE
                        I... love you, Campbell.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Really?

                                 NATE
                        Yes, really!

           Campbell smiles.  And we realize it's the first time he's
           ever said it.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I love you, too, Nate. 

           The door crashes open.  Dillon charge in, trailed by Chavez. 
           As they haul Nate off --

                                 NATE
                        I got this, Campbell!  I got this! 
                        Don't say shit!  

                                                               FADE OUT:

           A clock goes TICK... it sits on the wall of 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MIAMI POLICE STATION - DAY

           Roberto enters and takes a seat.  Across from --

           Nate, Campbell and Manny, bandaged and looking like hell.

                                 NATE
                        My associates and I have an offer.  

                                 ROBERTO
                        You and your associates can go fuck
                        yourselves.  I need to get back out
                        on patrol.  You're in over your heads
                        and I can't do shit for you.  

           Campbell looks to Nate.  He nods that she can speak. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It's not what you can do for us. 
                        It's what we can do for you.  Do you
                        know who Harry Delvin is?  
                                 ROBERTO
                        The real estate guy?  I've seen his
                        benches...

                                 CAMPBELL
                        We'll give him to you.  For drug
                        dealing... and murder.  And being a
                        giant motherfucking cocksucker. 
                        Which I want written on any official
                        police report.  And if he could be
                        placed in a rape friendly jail -- 

                                 NATE
                        There are other conditions.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, I want my military record wiped.  

                                 MANNY
                        My various parole violations need to
                        be swept under the rug.  Speeding
                        tickets, etc.  

                                 NATE
                        My van is in impound.  I'd like that
                        returned.  

           Roberto looks them over, incredulous. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        Sure, this sounds like a great deal. 
                        You'll have plenty of time to keep
                        making your wish list in prison. 
                        Why would I even try to help you?
                            (nods to Manny)
                        This guy held me at gunpoint.

                                 NATE
                        Because he's sorry.  And because
                        I've got a million dollars in coke
                        in a motel room you'll never find. 
                        Between that, and our testimony about
                        Harry, you gotta make Vice Squad.
                            (beat, grandly)
                        Can't you see it, Roberto... you're
                        cruising the streets in a Testarossa,
                        with a slick suit, a fake name, and a
                        hot informant.  Deep cover.     

                                 MANNY
                        Crockett and Tubbs, man.  No rules. 
                        Fucking up bad guys. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Or... you can go back to writing
                        speeding tickets, pulling over party
                        girls for DUIs.  Your choice.  
           Off Roberto, weighing this out --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PARKING GARAGE, MIAMI POLICE STATION - DAY

           Nate slams the door of his minivan, bags loaded inside.  He
           turns.  Donna waits behind him.  He gives her a hug.  

                                 NATE
                        I'll call you as soon as I get back
                        to Kissimmee. 

                                 DONNA
                        You can't just hang out for a few
                        more days?  

                                 NATE
                        I think I need to slow things down
                        for a while... besides, I'm unemployed
                        and broke.   

                                 DONNA
                        Whatever you say.  You still owe me
                        my 60 grand cut.  Don't make me come
                        looking for it.  

           Nate smiles.  Hops in the van.  

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Campbell sits on a bench with Manny, looking out at the water. 

                                 MANNY
                        This is the best thing for me.  I
                        fell off the wagon pretty hard.    

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Wait, you're a recovering addict?

                                 MANNY
                        I like to have a good time... and
                        it's something I've never actually
                        recovered from, so...   

           Campbell nods, sadly. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        It just sucks that the Army was so much
                        easier to deal with than your P.O.

                                 MANNY
                        He always had it out for me.   

           REVEAL that Manny's hands are cuffed.  An OFFICER stands
           guard nearby.  We are right across from the police station.
           Campbell sees the minivan pull up.  They stand.  Manny gives
           her an awkward handcuff hug.  

                                 MANNY
                        In 12-16 months, I'm gonna come visit
                        Sandy.  I hope she's ready for me.  

           Campbell laughs.  She extricates herself from his cuffed
           arms and heads for the minivan.  Climbs in.  

           Nate waves back at Manny.  Then puts the van into gear and
           pulls off, into Miami traffic...

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

           SUPER: One Last Thing...

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

           A quaint, tree-lined block.  Nate and Campbell walk along. 
           She shifts, uncomfortably, in her stiff new Sunday dress.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I look like a giant dork.  If I saw
                        me, I'd commit a hate crime on myself.   

                                 NATE
                        You look fine.  It's just your body
                        adjusting to clothes that aren't
                        from Hot Topic.      

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fuck you.  I haven't shopped at Hot
                        Topic since high school.  My outfits
                        are legit. 

                                 NATE
                        Just focus on what you're gonna say. 
                        Do you have your speech rehearsed? 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Yeah, sure.  "Mom, I'm sorry you're not
                        as much of a bitch as I thought, and
                        that dad probably really sucked.  Can
                        you make me some of that vanilla pudding
                        with the M&Ms, which happens to be the
                        only thing you know how to make?"

                                 NATE
                        I'm serious.  We're gonna sit down,
                        like regular fucking people, and
                        you're gonna have to say something. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Fine.  I'll be sincere as shit.  But
                        she hates me. 
                                 NATE
                        She doesn't hate you. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        She certainly doesn't like me. 

                                 NATE
                        You were awful to her.  For over a
                        decade.  

                                 CAMPBELL
                        She wasn't so great herself...

                                 NATE
                        Well, someone's gotta take the first
                        step.  You're my sister, and I think
                        you're the bigger woman. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        I'm a huge woman.  But this is a bad
                        idea.  I'd rather get shot in chest
                        again.  Motherfucker...

           Campbell slows down.  Uncertain.  Self-conscious.  Confused.  

           Nate goes to say something.  Stops.  Reaches out.  (cid:13)
           And takes her hand.  

                                                            CUT TO BLACK:

                                     THE END
