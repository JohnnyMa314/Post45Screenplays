           FADE IN:

           EXT. RURAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           A rural street with no sidewalks and shabby small houses 
           opposite the green pasture and crumbling fence of a dairy 
           farm.  

           A chicken struts around a baby deer lawn ornament. 

           In another yard an OLD LADY in sponge rollers and a floral 
           muumuu hoses down her lawn.

           EXT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - DAY

           A two-story house with cracking paint and a sagging porch.

           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - DAY

           A pink, frilly little girl’s room: old trophies, award 
           ribbons, stuffed animals, dolls, and ceramic horses.  

           HUNTER’s seventeen-year-old skinny naked torso hovers over 
           someone on the bed, nervous.  

                                 HUNTER
                        But I want your first time to be 
                        special like mine was-    

                                 LAUREL (O.C.)
                        You asked me what I wanted for my 
                        birthday, this is what I want, 
                        Hunter.

                                 HUNTER
                        Right, well I think I broke your 
                        cherry fingering you on Tuesday, so 
                        it shouldn’t hurt too bad-

                                 LAUREL (O.C.)
                        Come on, just go in already-

           He makes a weird squeak as he, um, goes in.

                                 HUNTER
                        Are you okay?  

           Close on LAUREL (30), a peculiar young woman with a gleam of 
           mischief in her eye.  She holds her breath, a look of shock 
           on her face; she’s just lost her virginity.
           Laurel’s knee-length dishwater hair splays out around her as 
           she lies on two twin beds that are pushed together.  One 
           headboard reads “Laurel” the other reads “Audrey.”

           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Laurel and Hunter sit in bed, post-coitus.  She wears a ratty 
           training bra and granny panties. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Wow.  I never thought in a million 
                        years that I’d bang my baby-sitter.

                                 LAUREL
                        Ex-baby-sitter.  EX-baby-sitter.  

           She watches him stare at a bulletin board thick with a 
           rainbow assortment of award ribbons.

                                 LAUREL
                             (re: the award ribbons)
                        Those are all Audrey’s.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Wow.

           Laurel points to a bulletin board with a single pathetic 
           “Participant” ribbon.

                                 LAUREL
                        That’s mine.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Cool.

                                 LAUREL
                        Audrey lost it when we were only 
                        like fifteen. 

           She lays back down on the bed, stares at the ceiling.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        One night she climbs in our window, 
                        wasted on Zima, and is all “I just 
                        lost it while we listened to “Kiss 
                        from a Rose!”  

           Laurel laughs.

                                 HUNTER
                        Who’d she lose it to?  
           She gives him a questioning look.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        I mean, everyone’s different and 
                        loses it at different times and 
                        shit, even twins.

                                 LAUREL
                             (matter of fact)
                        It’s just the way it is. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Is she coming tonight?

                                 LAUREL
                        Of course.

                                 HUNTER
                        Speaking of coming.  Did you?

                                 LAUREL
                             (deadpan)
                        I’m not coming, I’m already here.

           He’s confused.  She’s disappointed he didn’t get her joke.  
           Hunter gets distracted, looks at the clock.

                                 HUNTER
                        Trig quiz first period.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Things aren’t going to be weird 
                        now, right?

                                 HUNTER
                        Laurel, it’s all good.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh. Yeah. Okay.  So are we like 
                        boyfriend and girlfriend now?

           Hunter laughs, she laughs too and pretends she was making 
           another joke.  She wasn’t.

                                 HUNTER
                        See you tonight.

           He gives her a peck then Laurel watches him climb out the 
           window.  She stares at a large tree swaying in the breeze. 
           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel clutches a faded photograph of a WOMAN in a YELLOW 
           DRESS.  The woman holds identical twin baby girls and a huge 
           bunch of colorful balloons.  She flips it over, on the back 
           it says: 

           “Annette’s 30th Birthday, February 2, 1982”

           Laurel opens her closet, runs her hand across the gorgeous 
           vintage dresses: seventies florals and sequins mixed with the 
           bold colors and graphic patterns of the sixties.  She stops 
           on the YELLOW DRESS from the photograph.

           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

           Laurel wears the YELLOW DRESS as she talks to the photograph.

                                 LAUREL
                        I really wish you could be here 
                        today, Mama. 

           Laurel models the dress in her sticker-covered mirror then 
           smiles and pokes her finger into the part of the picture with 
           the balloons.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Pop!

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Laurel smashes raspberries down with a fork into some 
           buttered toast.  

           Grabs a frosty drinking glass out of the freezer, pours milk 
           into it.  

           Puts perfect poached eggs onto a plate with a sprig of 
           parsley and lovingly lines up pastel vitamins on a tray.

           EXT. FRANK’S GARAGE STUDIO - DAY

           A hand holds a paintbrush as it paints a copy of the Mona 
           Lisa.   

           Laurel’s dad, FRANK (late 50’s), wears paint covered overalls 
           as he stands back from the easel.  Frank’s a man of few 
           words, balding with a pony tail and a salt and pepper beard.  
           His junky old garage is filled with canvases and art 
           supplies. 

           Laurel sets his breakfast on the table next to him and waits 
           for him to notice her.  Finally, he glances at her, she looks 
           at him expectantly.

                                 FRANK
                        Happy birthday, porcupine.

                                 LAUREL
                        Thanks, Daddy.

           She models the dress.  

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Do you like it?

           He looks down to her feet, her toes wiggle in her pink crew 
           socks and huaraches.  He grins but offers nothing more, goes 
           back to work.  She’s disappointed.

           Laurel uncovers a canvas and places it on the easel next to 
           Frank’s.  It’s another unfinished copy of the Mona Lisa.

                                 LAUREL
                             (re: the two Mona Lisa 
                              forgeries)
                        What are they gonna say when people 
                        ask where they got the Mona Lisa? 
                             (in a silly voice)
                        “Oh, I just picked this thing up at 
                        the Louvre’s yard sale.” 

                                 FRANK
                        People just want to feel special 
                        even if it’s not real.
                             (re: Laurel’s painting)
                        You should fix her mouth, it’s too 
                        happy.

           She looks dejected.

           MAY, mid-50’s, Frank’s loud-mouthed spinster girlfriend, 
           makes a grand entrance.

                                 MAY
                             (to Frank)
                        I put the cake in the kitchen, but 
                        I need some hands to get the booze 
                        out the car.  
                                 FRANK
                        First let me get a look at you.

           Laurel watches, disgusted as they French kiss and the light 
           glistens off their saliva.  

                                 MAY
                        Oh and happy birthday, you.

                                 LAUREL
                        Thanks, May.

                                 MAY
                        I’ve got a present for you.  I’ma 
                        take you over to Rhonda at the 
                        salon!  Take a yard or two off that 
                        hair, an eyebrow wax, and a little 
                        lipstick and you’ll look just like 
                        Audrey.

                                 LAUREL
                        We’re identical twins, May.

                                 MAY
                        I know but it’s the details that 
                        matter when it comes to ropin’ in a 
                        fella.

                                 LAUREL
                        Who says I need to rope in a fella? 

                                 MAY
                             (laughing)
                        Well, you don’t want to end up old 
                        and unmarried-
                             (she elbows Frank, hint, 
                              hint)
                        like me, do you?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I definitely don’t want to end 
                        up like you, May.

           May grabs Frank from behind, gooses him.

                                 MAY 
                        You should at least smile more.  
                        Men like smilers.  Right Frank?

           May grabs his hand and notices his long paint encrusted 
           nails.
                                 MAY
                        Ooh, baby, we have to cut those 
                        nails, they’re lookin’ like Lee 
                        Press-Ons.  

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Laurel trims Frank’s nails at the kitchen table as he blankly 
           watches an old cartoon on the TV.

           Suddenly AUDREY (30), Laurel’s gorgeous identical twin, 
           bursts through the kitchen door like a ray of light.  Audrey 
           has fiery red hair and wears a fabulous pant suit and 
           platform heels.

           Audrey struts straight to Laurel.  They touch palms and 
           interlace their fingers, looking into each other’s eyes.  

                                 AUDREY
                        Happy birthday, LaLu.  Hey, Dad.

                                 FRANK
                        Audrey.

           Frank and Audrey give each other an awkward perfunctory wave.

                                 AUDREY
                        For you.

           Audrey hands Laurel an old jewelry box.  Laurel opens it, 
           inside a ballerina spins in front of a little mirror, and it 
           holds a gold BROKEN HEART PENDANT attached to two necklaces.

                                 AUDREY
                             (re: the heart pendant)
                        It hasn’t been split yet.

           Audrey grabs the pendant, bends it back and forth until the 
           heart breaks in two, then passes half to Laurel.  The twins 
           put on their half-heart necklaces then Laurel grabs Audrey’s 
           hand and they run up the stairs, giddy.

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Laurel and Audrey burst into their old room, breathless.

                                 AUDREY
                             (sarcastic)
                        It looks different in here.
                                 LAUREL
                        Really?  I didn’t change-

           Audrey laughs.  Laurel smacks her.

                                 LAUREL
                        Don’t make fun of me.  

                                 AUDREY
                        Were you cutting Dad’s nails just 
                        now?  

                                 LAUREL
                        DON’T make fun of me.

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel hands Audrey a MINIATURE REPLICA of Frank and Laurel’s 
           house wrapped in a bow. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Happy birthday.

                                 AUDREY
                        A dollhouse?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, look inside.

           Inside the house there’s a slide projector carousel.

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel plugs the slide projector in, Audrey turns it on.  

           Together they gaze on the wall at an image of themselves as 
           girls wearing matching smocked dresses, except Laurel wears 
           fluorescent pink socks.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I loved those socks.  They were the 
                        perfect thickness.

           Laurel clicks through images of them as children.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        They’re all taken inside our house. 
                                 AUDREY
                        Wow.  I love it.  It’s brilliant.  
                        Just like you.

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s so you can always feel at home 
                        while you’re away.

           Laurel changes the image.  Audrey gives her a funny look.

                                 AUDREY
                        You know I’m not moving back home, 
                        right?  I actually live in another 
                        city.  Permanently.  I’m not ever 
                        coming back, Laur.  We’ve gone over 
                        this so many- 

                                 LAUREL
                        Well, maybe you’ll-

                                 AUDREY
                        No.  I want you to understand.  I’m 
                        not coming back.  Like, ever.  

           Laurel looks really sad.  Audrey clicks to another image of 
           them on Halloween wearing matching homemade Pocahontas 
           costumes.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Balloons.  Streamers.  Soft rock.  A banner reads: “Happy 
           30th Birthday Audrey & Laurel!”  It’s present day but 
           everyone seems straight out of the early nineties.

           Laurel dances a silly jig as she ladles punch for Audrey.  As 
           she finishes Laurel spots Hunter enter with his FRUMPY 
           PARENTS and his LITTLE SISTER (with a mouth full of braces).

           MRS. SHOEMACHER, an avid cross-stitcher in her mid-60’s 
           interrupts.

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        So how does it feel turning thirty 
                        ladies?

           Laurel looks to Audrey to answer for them, she always does.

                                 AUDREY
                        It’s great, right Laur?  No one 
                        really takes you seriously in your 
                        twenties. It’s better for business. 
           Laurel nods.

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        What sort of business, dear?  

           Audrey hands her a card that says: “Audrey Smith, Agent, 
           Dollhouse Realty.”

                                 AUDREY
                        It’s a boutique real estate company 
                        specializing in storybook homes of 
                        architectural significance.  

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        Come again?  

                                 AUDREY
                        Oh you know homes that look like 
                        hobbit holes, witches dens, fairy 
                        tale castles, or village courts.  

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        People sure do like to play 
                        pretend, I guess.  And what are you 
                        up to Laurel?

                                 AUDREY
                        She’s helps our Dad with the 
                        forgeries he sells.

                                 LAUREL
                        They’re not forgeries, they’re 
                        copies.

                                 AUDREY
                        I’m sorry, copies.  Laurel’s an 
                        amazing painter like my Dad.  

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        Oh!  I just finished a cross-stitch 
                        of my Canoodle.  The Lord took him 
                        last June.  I’ll have to bring it 
                        by before you leave, Audrey.

           Hunter approaches Laurel and Audrey in a suave manner.

                                 HUNTER
                        Happy birthday ladies.

                                 AUDREY
                        Thanks...
                          HUNTER
                                                         LAUREL
           Hunter.
                                              Hunter.

                                 HUNTER
                        You look like a model, are you a 
                        model?

                                 AUDREY
                        No.

                                 HUNTER
                        Cool.

           Laurel’s pissed he’s looking at Audrey all googly-eyed.

                                 LAUREL
                        Can I talk to you in the kitchen 
                        for a moment, Hunter?

           Audrey looks at her suspiciously.

                                 HUNTER
                             (still focused on Audrey)
                        What?  Oh yeah, sure.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Laurel drags Hunter into the kitchen.

                                 HUNTER
                        What?  What’s wrong?

                                 LAUREL
                        Please don’t look at my sister like 
                        you want to lick her face. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Baby, you know I only have eyes for 
                        you. 

           He starts to kiss her but she squirms away from him.

                                 LAUREL
                        No, this isn’t right-

           He grabs her boob and squeezes it when suddenly his Mom walks 
           in with an armful of empty beer bottles.  She screams as she 
           sees them and the bottles crash to the floor. 
           EXT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Partygoers watch as Hunter’s Mom drags him by the arm across 
           the front lawn and his Dad and sister scuttle behind.  Audrey 
           marches out after them.

                                 AUDREY
                        Sorry everyone, party’s over.

           People stream out of the house, as they whisper to each other 
           about Laurel.

           EXT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Frank and May clean up inside.  Audrey looks up at Laurel 
           who’s high in the tree outside her bedroom window.

                                 AUDREY
                             (yells)
                        Would you get down please?  

                                 LAUREL
                        No.

           Audrey notices their NEIGHBOR’S light turn on as they stare 
           out their window at them.  She waves, then climbs the tree 
           and joins Laurel on the branch.

                                 LAUREL
                        I didn’t want to be a thirty-year 
                        old virgin waiting forever for some 
                        fairy tale guy that doesn’t exist-

                                 AUDREY
                        You need to get out of this place-

                                 LAUREL
                             (rolls her eyes)
                        Not this again.

                                 AUDREY
                        You’re thirty, you’re screwing a 
                        minor and you act like Dad’s wife, 
                        it’s fucked Laurel-

                                 LAUREL
                        Hunter’s almost eighteen and we 
                        only did it once.  And I don’t act 
                        like Dad’s wife-
                                 AUDREY
                        When I walked in yesterday you were 
                        cutting his fucking fingernails.  

                                 LAUREL
                        So?

                                 AUDREY
                        You cook for him, clean for him.  
                        You’re even jealous of his 
                        girlfriend!  And you wear all of 
                        our dead mother’s old clothes.  Do 
                        you even have a dress of your own?

                                 LAUREL
                        Why would I go buy new clothes if 
                        hers fit me and are still perfectly 
                        good?    

                                 AUDREY
                        Because that’s what normal people 
                        do.  They have their own shit, they 
                        grow up, they have their own life.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Wearing her clothes makes me feel 
                        like she’s still here, okay?  

                                 AUDREY
                        But no matter how much you wear her 
                        clothes she’s never ever-

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m not retarded.  I know what dead 
                        means.  

                                 AUDREY
                        I didn’t say you were retarded.  
                        But you’ve held on long enough.

                                 LAUREL
                        After Mom died you just, you just 
                        left, someone had to take care of 
                        everything-

                                 AUDREY
                        You’re a fucking saint.  Excuse me 
                        for wanting a real life instead of 
                        hanging on to nothing-

                                 LAUREL
                        It was the right thing to do.
                                 AUDREY
                        But look at where it’s got you. 
                        You’re stuck in this fucked make-
                        believe game where you both never 
                        have to face the fact she’s gone-

                                 LAUREL
                        Things aren’t so easy for me, 
                        people think I’m, I’m-     

                                 AUDREY
                        Who cares what people in this 
                        shithole think?  And Dad may be an 
                        emotional cripple but he’s a grown 
                        man, he doesn’t need you.  

                                 LAUREL
                        He can’t even get ice cubes out of 
                        their trays.  

           Audrey and Laurel laugh.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for ruining our birthday.

                                 AUDREY
                        I don’t care about our birthday.  
                        You deserve better than this, you 
                        deserve a life...I want you to move 
                        in with me.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Really?  But, he’ll never let me 
                        go, he needs me.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Audrey and Frank sit at the kitchen table, cartoons on in the 
           background.

                                 AUDREY
                        I’m taking Laurel to live with me, 
                        Dad.  

           He thinks about this for a tiny moment, nods, then looks past 
           her at the TV.
           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Laurel’s been eaveswatching and looks horrified; she rushes 
           up the stairs.

           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Laurel sits on her bed.  She talks to her open closet, upset.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m scared, Mama.  I’m not ready- 

           Audrey enters quietly.

                                 AUDREY
                        Who are you talking to?

                                 LAUREL
                        No one.

                                 AUDREY
                             (searching the room)
                        Hunter’s not in here is he?

                                 LAUREL
                        No.  I don’t see the point of going 
                        with you.  My loserness is too 
                        painfully obvious when I’m with you-

           Audrey grabs her hand.

                                 AUDREY
                        You are not a loser.  We have the 
                        same fucking DNA, Laurel.  And 
                        despite the story you’ve made up 
                        about me, I don’t have everything 
                        figured out- 

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah, right.

                                 AUDREY
                        You’ll see.

                                 LAUREL
                        But what am I going to do?

                                 AUDREY
                        Paint.
                                 LAUREL
                        No, I can’t.  Dad’s always fixing 
                        my work, I can’t-

                                 AUDREY
                        You’re coming home with me.  You’re 
                        doing your own painting, and that’s 
                        that.  

           Audrey grabs Laurel’s mass of hair.  Lets it fall.

                                 AUDREY (CONT’D)
                             (re: Laurel’s hair)
                        But you can’t come home with me 
                        with all this comin’ out your head.

           EXT. FRANK’S GARAGE STUDIO - DAY

           Audrey and Laurel pass by Frank as he paints.

                                 FRANK
                        Where are you two going?

                                 AUDREY
                        It’s a surprise.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not too keen on surprises right 
                        now.

           Laurel looks down, embarrassed.

                                 AUDREY
                        Give her a fucking break, Dad.

           INT./ EXT. LAUREL’S VINTAGE FORD PICK-UP - DAY

           Laurel drives, lost in thought, Audrey’s in the passenger 
           seat.  

                                 AUDREY
                             (re: Frank)
                        Don’t listen to that surly prick.
                             (re: Laurel’s hair)
                        So what do you want to do with it?

                                 LAUREL
                        I don’t know.  Cut it with 
                        scissors, I guess.
           Audrey laughs then her cell phone rings.  Laurel grabs it, 
           looks at the screen.  Audrey snatches it, silences it.

                                 LAUREL
                        Who is Chaaarles?

                                 AUDREY
                        No one.

           Laurel can tell exactly what she means by this response.

                                 LAUREL
                        You didn’t tell me you were dating 
                        someone!

                                 AUDREY
                        I don’t want to talk about it.  

           They stop at a red light. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Oooh, Chinese fire drill! 

                                 AUDREY
                        No.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Come on, don’t be such an old lady! 

           Laurel gets out at the intersection and goes to the other 
           side of the truck, but Audrey locks the door and stares at 
           her, annoyed.  The light turns green.  

           A TINY OLD MAN in the car behind them lays on the horn as 
           Laurel slumps back to the driver’s side.  

           She slams the bottom of her hair in the door.  Her hair flaps 
           in the breeze on the exterior of the truck as they drive.

           INT. SMALL TOWN HAIR SALON - LATER - DAY

           A pair of scissors cuts off Laurel’s long braid and it falls 
           to the floor.  Audrey and Laurel stare at it.

                          AUDREY
                                                         LAUREL
           Ewww.
                                              Ewww.

                                 LAUREL
                        It looks like a squirrel.
           Audrey grabs it in disgust and plops it into a plastic bag.  
           A ROCKABILLY HAIR DRESSER stands by.

                                 ROCKABILLY HAIR DRESSER
                        Whatcha wanna do now, chickadee?

                                 AUDREY
                        Some long layers, nothing too 
                        crazy.  Eyebrows, makeup.

           Audrey’s cell rings, she checks it.

                                 AUDREY (CONT’D)
                             (to Laurel)
                        I’m going to go buy you a dress.  

           She rushes outside and takes the call.

                                 ROCKABILLY HAIR DRESSER
                        Did you bring a picture or 
                        something?

           Laurel shakes her head.

                                 ROCKABILLY HAIR DRESSER (CONT’D)
                        Well, what do you wanna look like?

           Laurel thinks for a moment then sheepishly points to Audrey 
           who talks on her phone outside.  

           INT. SMALL TOWN HAIR SALON - LATER - DAY

           Audrey enters the salon with a shopping bag and pulls a RED 
           SHIRTDRESS with white polka dots out of it.  She holds the 
           dress up.

                                 AUDREY
                        They had slim pickings but I think 
                        it’s cute, felt like you-

           Laurel spins around and the two of them look directly in the 
           mirror.  They look identical with the same cut and color.

                                 ROCKABILLY HAIR DRESSER
                             (suddenly realizes)
                        Wait are you guys twins?

           They nod.
           INT. LAUREL’S VINTAGE FORD PICK-UP - DAY

           Laurel drives and Audrey sits in the passenger seat, livid.  
           Laurel’s new dress and her bag o’ hair sit on her lap.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I really like the dress, the polka 
                        dots are sweet.  Look, I thought 
                        you wanted me to be more like you-

                                 AUDREY
                        No!  I want you to be like you.  I 
                        want you to have a your own-

                                 LAUREL
                        I mean it looks good on you, so I 
                        figured you know it’s gonna look 
                        alright on me-

                                 AUDREY
                        Dad’s gonna flip when he sees you. 

                                 LAUREL
                        I know-

                          LAUREL
                                                         AUDREY
           We haven’t had the same 
           haircut since before Mom 
           died.  
                                              We haven’t had the same 
                                              haircut since before Mom 
                                              died.  

           They laugh, it breaks the ice.

                                 AUDREY
                        Thank God other people aren’t 
                        around when we do that.  It’s 
                        creepy.

                                 LAUREL 
                        So do I get to meet your boyfriend?

           They stop at a red light.

                                 AUDREY
                        Fire drill!

                                 LAUREL
                        Hey, hey, not fair, don’t change 
                        the subject-
           Audrey pops out of the truck and runs around the back and 
           Laurel hesitates then does the same.  They get back into the 
           truck, breathless. 

                                 AUDREY
                        Seat belt!

           Laurel drapes her braid across her torso like a seat belt.

                                 LAUREL
                        Who needs a seat belt when I have a 
                        hair belt?

           Laurel throws the braid at Audrey.  Audrey screams.  The 
           light turns green and Audrey starts to drive forward to take 
           a left turn, laughing.

           Laurel sees a truck barrel towards them as it runs the red 
           light going in the opposite direction.  Everything slows 
           down.  The twins’ eyes meet, they grab each other’s hand.

           CUT TO BLACK

           The sound of metal against metal.  Glass shatters.  The thump 
           of a body as it hits the pavement.  A small explosion.

           LAUREL’S POV

           Laurel sees her truck on fire as if through an opaque milky 
           screen.  Sirens.  Then she blinks out of consciousness again.  

           CUT BACK TO BLACK

           Pitch black with the sounds of the hospital: machines beep, 
           muffled voices yell.  The squeak of sneakers on linoleum and 
           a stretcher as it rolls across the floor.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - DAY

           Laurel’s eyes flutter open painfully.  A fluorescent light 
           blares overhead.  

           It’s a double room and Laurel sees the other bed is empty.  
           The left side of her face is covered in an abrasion; she 
           wears a cast on her left arm and an IV in her right.  She 
           rips the IV out.  
           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Laurel stumbles into the hallway as she looks into each room, 
           searching.  She’s desperate, confused but continues to search 
           until she suddenly collapses.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Laurel sits on the edge of the bed, her eyes glassy.  Her 
           baby-faced doctor, DR. RAO (late 20’s) and Frank sit opposite 
           her.  Frank shows no emotion.

                                 DR. RAO
                        Can you show me two fingers?

           She slowly shows him two fingers.  She strains to talk.

                                 LAUREL
                        My sister-

                                 FRANK
                        You two were in an accident, and 
                        I’m so sorry but she, she passed.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I need to see her-

           Laurel starts to get up.

                                 DR. RAO
                        There was a fire and I’m sorry but 
                        there’s nothing to see.

           She suddenly notices her reflection in the TV screen mounted 
           on the wall; it startles and confuses her. 

                                 LAUREL
                             (pointing to her 
                              reflection)
                        That’s her!  That’s her!

                                 DR. RAO
                        You were twins.
                             (re: her reflection)
                        That’s you, Audrey.

           Laurel looks at them, confused.

                                 LAUREL
                        Audrey?
                                 FRANK
                        That’s your name.

           Laurel looks down, her hospital bracelet says “SMITH, 
           AUDREY.” 

                                 DR. RAO
                        What’s the last thing you remember?

                                 LAUREL
                        A, a party.

                                 DR. RAO
                             (to Frank)
                        With injuries like this people tend 
                        to lose everything around the 
                        accident.

           Close on Laurel as she turns to lie on her side in bed, her 
           back to Frank and Dr. Rao.  He shows Frank a CAT scan image.

                                 FRANK
                        When will she remember who she is?

                                 DR. RAO
                        She has post-traumatic amnesia, 
                        it’s not structural or permanent.  
                        There’s a cerebral contusion, here- 
                             (points to the CAT scan)
                        -in the left side of the brain, the 
                        part of the brain that controls 
                        language and memory.  I don’t think 
                        it’s going to expand so in the next 
                        few days she should expect to get 
                        her bearings as the swelling goes 
                        down.  But we still need to monitor 
                        her closely; she could have 
                        lingering memory problems, 
                        difficulty speaking, difficulty 
                        understanding speech.

           Frank stares at the CAT scan image then back to Laurel.  She 
           turns to face him and they look at each other, blankly.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT/DAY

           Laurel sits in bed and stares straight ahead, frozen.  
           Time fast-forwards: Dr. Rao, Frank, May, NURSES, JANITORS, 
           and PHYSICAL THERAPISTS filter in and out of the room as the 
           light changes day to night, day to night, day to night.  But 
           Laurel never moves, she just stares ahead.

           INT. FRANK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Frank lies in bed, eyes wide open, stoic.  May lies in bed 
           next to him, her arms around him.

                                 MAY
                        We’ll bring her home after supper, 
                        get her situated.  I’m gonna make a 
                        Jello mold for the reception, the 
                        kind with the floatin’ fruit in it.  
                        Laurel told me that it made her 
                        feel peaceful cause it reminded her 
                        of floatin’ in outer space.

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

           A NURSE helps transfer Laurel from a wheelchair into the 
           backseat of Frank’s car.  

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 

           Frank drives.  He checks on Laurel in the rear view mirror, 
           she’s surrounded by all the flowers from her hospital room.  
           She meets his gaze, he looks away.

                                 FRANK
                        May called your work to let them 
                        know what happened.

                                 LAUREL
                        What do I do?

           Frank and May share a glance, concerned.

                                 MAY
                        You sell real estate, honey.  I 
                        talked to Claudia, she’s coming 
                        tomorrow.

                                 LAUREL
                        Claudia?
                                 FRANK
                        Your best friend.  You want me to 
                        invite anyone else?

           Laurel’s distressed by her inability to remember this.

                                 LAUREL
                        No.  I don’t want anyone to come.

           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Frank leads Laurel into her room and helps her into bed.

                                 FRANK
                        Let us know if you need anything.  
                        We’re leaving for the service first 
                        thing in the morning.  

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Frank watches from the door as Laurel traces the outline of 
           their names on their headboards, then sprawls across both 
           beds and buries her face in a pillow and cries into the dark.  
           He considers going back in to comfort her, but doesn’t. 

           INT. LAUREL'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Laurel opens her eyes and finds the photograph of Annette in 
           the yellow dress clutched in the palm of her hand.  She 
           smiles weakly at the photo, still half-asleep.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Laurel’s funeral’s this morning, 
                        Mama, I wish you could be-

           She sits up...wait, wait, wait: Audrey doesn’t talk to their 
           dead mother.  She spots the yellow dress crumpled on the 
           floor, her eyes dart back to the photo in her hand; the truth 
           rushes over her.  She realizes the terrible mistake for the 
           first time, jumps out of bed, paces the room, in a panic.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh no, no, no.  My funeral is this 
                        morning!  My funeral.
           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Laurel rushes out of her room and slides into the hall to set 
           everyone straight.  She stops at Frank’s bedroom door.  May 
           puts on panty hose as Frank ties his tie.

                                 LAUREL
                        I have something to tell-

                                 MAY
                        How are you feeling this morning?

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m okay, I , I-

                                 MAY
                        That’s great.  I was just telling 
                        your father that you’ve always been 
                        so strong, so independent, and I 
                        know it’ll be rough goin’ but I 
                        just know you’ll find some way to 
                        triumph- 

                                 LAUREL
                        Th-thanks-

                                 MAY
                        -And Laurel, Laurel was such a 
                        strange little bird.  Never got 
                        over your Mama, so I just don’t 
                        think she coulda ever got past 
                        losin’ you too.  It’s better that 
                        it happened this way-

           Laurel’s confused and totally caught off guard by this.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh.

                                 MAY
                        And your poor Dad, he was worried 
                        about what people are going to say 
                        about this whole Hunter business.  

           Laurel looks to Frank who is in his own world.

                                 MAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to 
                        upset you.  What was it you wanted 
                        to tell us?
           Laurel stands there, unsure of what to say next.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Um, I just wanted to tell you that 
                        I’m not really.  I’m not really.  
                        I’m actually not-

           May and Frank look at her perplexed.  She considers what 
           she’s about to say.  

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Just that I’m starting to remember 
                        some stuff and, and-
                             (beat)
                        I’m just gonna go get ready for 
                        Laurel’s funeral now.  

                                 MAY
                        Oh, that’s fantastic honey.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s great news.

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah, it’s great.  Really great.  
                        Great news.

           INT. OLD LIMOUSINE - DAY

           Laurel’s eyes are like saucers as she watches the passing 
           scenery stream by between the heads of May and Frank who sit 
           opposite her in the back of the limo. 

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           MOURNERS surround Laurel’s plot, many of the same people from 
           the birthday party.  A droopy-faced PRIEST (late 60’s) 
           presides.

           Laurel stands away from the mourners behind a tombstone.  She 
           stares at people’s shoes to avoid their faces. 

                                 DROOPY PRIEST
                        Would anyone like to say a few 
                        parting words to Laurel?  

           Laurel looks up and scans the crowd, anxious.
                                 DROOPY PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        A shared memory perhaps? 
                             (pause)
                        Anything?  Frank?

           She looks to Frank, who holds his head down, doesn’t respond. 

                                 DROOPY PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Audrey?

           All eyes burn into Laurel, who stares at Frank, heartbroken.

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s too bad Laurel never got a 
                        chance to leave this fucking place 
                        since she didn’t mean shit to any 
                        of you.  And, and it’s too bad that 
                        I’m the only one who ever saw 
                        something good in her and who, who 
                        believed in her.  But now that 
                        she’s gone you assholes can’t hurt 
                        her anymore! 

           Laurel, embarrassed by her outburst, chokes back tears and 
           runs through the graveyard towards the limo.  She trips and 
           falls and while she’s on the ground, watches a flock of white 
           doves fly over head.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The MOURNERS are all at the house including Mrs. Shoemacher 
           and her gaggle of OLD LADY FRIENDS.  Laurel watches them.

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        Wasn’t that awkward?

                                 SQUAT OLD LADY
                        I know, poor thing.  But she sure 
                        did look pretty today.  She was 
                        always so pretty. 

           Mrs. Shoemacher notices Laurel standing by.

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        Audrey, we’re so sorry for your 
                        loss.  

                                 OLD LADIES
                             (in unison)
                        Yes, oh, yes, yes, mmm hmm, yes.
                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        I brought the cross stitch I was 
                        telling you about-

           Mrs. Shoemacher pulls out a cross stitch portrait of a beagle 
           that say “R.I.P. Canoodle” underneath it and displays it for 
           Laurel and her old lady friends.

                                 SQUAT OLD LADY
                        Wow.  It’s got such a likeness to 
                        Canoodle.

                                 LAUREL
                        That’s a beagle dog alright.

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        Yep.  I could make you one for 
                        Laurel, dear.  It’s such a nice way 
                        to honor the departed.

                                 LAUREL
                        Sure, okay, thanks.  

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        I’ll need a low resolution photo. 
                        Because the stitches are just like, 
                        what do you call those things?

                                 LAUREL
                        Pixels.

                                 MRS. SHOEMACHER
                        Pixels, that’s right.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 

           Laurel sits on the couch with TWO FAT BOY best friends (12) 
           who love to bicker with each other.

                                 FAT BOY #1
                        I know you lost your memory but do 
                        you remember that your sister did 
                        it with a little boy?

                                 LAUREL
                             (defensive)
                        He was not a little boy.

                                 FAT BOY #2
                        He’s a teenager, you insensitive 
                        prick.
                                 FAT BOY #1
                        I heard he gets lots of action.

           Laurel gets up and walks away, upset.  Fat Boy #2 punches Fat 
           Boy #1 in the arm. 

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank grabs the Jello mold from the fridge and watches as 
           Laurel exits through the kitchen door.

           EXT. HUNTER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Laurel throws pebbles at Hunter’s window.  He comes to it. 

                                 HUNTER
                        What are you doing here?  My Mom’s 
                        gonna flip if she sees you. 

           INT. HUNTER’S ROOM - DAY

           Laurel and Hunter sit next to each other on his race car bed.  
           A carpet of dirty laundry covers his floor.  Skateboarding 
           and titty posters almost cover his teddy bear wallpaper.  

                                 HUNTER
                        My parents are epically pissed.

                                 LAUREL
                        I heard.

           He puts his head in his hands.  Laurel touches his back.  She 
           extends her arms to hug him.  He falls into her arms and goes 
           straight in for the kiss.  She accepts the kiss, believing he 
           knows her true identity: that she’s Laurel and not Audrey. 

                                 LAUREL
                        I knew you knew.

                                 HUNTER
                        I wasn’t sure, but I felt 
                        something.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I just realized this morning.  

                                 HUNTER
                        I’ve been dreaming of this moment 
                        since I was ten.
                                 LAUREL
                        What?

                                 HUNTER
                        I’ve, I’ve been in love with you 
                        since fourth grade, Audrey.

                                 LAUREL
                        Wait, what?

                                 HUNTER
                        She looked like you but she wasn’t 
                        you.

           Laurel slaps him hard.  He touches his face.  

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand, you kissed me-

                                 LAUREL
                        You were her only friend.  She 
                        loved you. 

                                 HUNTER
                        I liked her too.  But you’re, 
                        you’re like this, this, this... 
                        goddess.

           Laurel pushes him hard off the bed and onto the floor.

           EXT. RURAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Laurel rushes back to the house in a rage, black mascara 
           tears streaming down her face.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Frank sees Laurel go past the window into the backyard.  

           EXT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Frank approaches Laurel as she cries, he stands there for a 
           moment, searching for something to say.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s chilly out here, come inside.
                                 LAUREL
                        Why didn’t you say something today? 
                        She took care of you all those 
                        years.  How could you not say 
                        something, anything? 

           Frank looks around to see if anyone’s watching, then grabs 
           her wrist.

                                 FRANK
                        Let’s take this inside.

           She yanks her wrist away.

                                 LAUREL 
                             (mocking)
                        “Let’s take this inside.”  God 
                        forbid we should ever say anything 
                        about how we feel.  Say something, 
                        Dad.  Now!  Say something!

           He doesn’t know what to do.  She pounds on his chest, crying.

                                 LAUREL
                        Say something!  Say something!

           He’s frozen, taken aback.  She backs away.

           She screams as she stomps toward the kitchen door then grabs 
           a gnome statue and smashes it against the house.  

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Laurel applies Audrey’s make-up as she glances back and forth 
           at a recent photo of Audrey, copying her look: covering up 
           her red nose, and her puffy eyes.

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel closes Audrey’s suitcase.  She opens her closet and 
           runs her hand across her Mom’s dresses.

                                 LAUREL
                        Goodbye, Mama.  It’s better this 
                        way, no one wants me here.

           Laurel slams the closet doors shut.
           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           A suitcase lands on the ground next to Laurel’s feet.  Frank 
           whittles wood as May scrubs the kitchen floor.

                                 LAUREL
                        I have to get back to work.

                                 FRANK
                        In the shape you’re in? 

                                 LAUREL
                        I’ll follow up with my doctors at 
                        home.

                                 MAY
                        What should we do with all her 
                        things?

                                 LAUREL
                        Donate them, I don’t care.  She 
                        didn’t have anything anyway.  

                                 FRANK
                        Wait, I’ve got somethin’ for you.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank gives Laurel her half-finished Mona Lisa copy.  May 
           looks up from scrubbing. 

                                 MAY
                        What about all those other 
                        paintings?  What’re you gonna do 
                        with all those?

                                 LAUREL
                        Which other paintings?

           INT. SHED - DAY

           Frank shows Laurel the shed full of a bunch of Laurel’s 
           paintings that he never sent to customers.  She’s horrified.

                                 FRANK
                        I keep em’ out here when they 
                        weren’t quite right.  You can take 
                        as many of them as you want.
           Laurel pretends this doesn’t crush her.

                                 LAUREL
                        That’s alright, I’ll just take this 
                        one.

           INT. AIRPLANE - LATER - DAY

           Laurel stares ahead in wide-eyed fear.  A SWEET LITTLE GIRL 
           (5) sits next to her and draws a tall stack of smaller 
           animals standing on top of an elephant.

           The little girl looks up and notices that Laurel’s seat belt 
           isn’t fastened.

                                 SWEET LITTLE GIRL
                        Your seat belt.

           The little girl reaches over her and buckles it for her.

                                 SWEET LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        I got your back.

           EXT. DUPLEX - DAY

           A single story duplex with two units that are MIRROR IMAGES 
           of each other.  Laurel fumbles with her keys then finds the 
           door to the unit on the right is unlocked.

           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel enters, the apartment is filled with books: library 
           rows of books and piles of them everywhere.  Laurel meanders 
           through the apartment. 

           She finds BASEL (late 20’s) a scruffy, adorable and self-
           possessed geek, and a lanky Indonesian boy, TIMOR (12), 
           reading on the ground.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Um, is this my apartment?

                                 BASEL
                             (sarcastic)
                        Is that a trick question? 

                                 TIMOR
                        Why can’t you just leave Basel 
                        alone, he doesn’t want to move out!
                                 BASEL
                        Timor, no.  Let me handle this.  
                             (to Laurel)
                        I told you if you want me to move-
                        out you’ll have to pay me the move-
                        out fee; the law is on the tenant’s 
                        side-

                                 LAUREL
                             (realizing)
                        Oh, you’re my tenant.  

           He gives her a look: “duh.”  She holds up her cast.

                                 LAUREL
                        I was in an accident, I’ve got post-
                        traumatic amnesia-

                                 TIMOR
                        Wow, I never met a real live 
                        amnesiac!  

           The front door opens.

                                 TIMOR’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Dinner!  

                                 TIMOR
                             (to Basel, re: a book)
                        Can I take this one?

           Basel nods, Timor writes his name on the card inside the 
           book, hands it to Basel then races away.

           Basel studies Laurel as she self-consciously looks around at 
           his stuff.  She seems lost.

                                 BASEL
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 LAUREL
                             (deadpan)
                        I went through a windshield.  Haha.  

           He smiles, gives her a weird look.  Beat. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess I’ll go check out my 
                        apartment that I don’t remember 
                        anything about.  
                                 BASEL
                        Alright.

                                 LAUREL
                        Um, why did I want to kick you out?

                                 BASEL
                        You wanted to give my apartment to 
                        your sister.  

                                 LAUREL
                             (touched)
                        I did?  Oh.  That’s nice of me.

                                 BASEL
                        Yeah, except the part where you 
                        called me a creepy man-child and 
                        tried to kick me out. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, that.  Well my sister’s not 
                        going to move in because of, um, 
                        extenuating circumstances.  So you 
                        don’t have to leave.  Books.

                                 BASEL
                        Yep, books.

                                 LAUREL
                        So is this like a library or 
                        something?

                                 BASEL
                        I mostly sell stuff online but I 
                        lend to the neighborhood.

                                 LAUREL
                             (she nods)
                        Books.

                                 BASEL
                        Do you, uh, wanna borrow one?

                                 LAUREL
                        I think I need all the brain cavity 
                        space I can get to remember normal 
                        stuff, so maybe later. 

           She looks around, he senses her disorientation.   
                                 BASEL
                        I broke my arm once.  In a jiujitsu 
                        competition.  It ruined my martial 
                        arts career.  But once I was 
                        crippled I started to read a lot-

                                 LAUREL
                        Are you calling me a cripple?

                                 BASEL
                        No, no-

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s okay, it’s true.  Wanna sign 
                        my cast? 

                                 BASEL
                        Um, sure.

                                 LAUREL
                        I was thinking something like “I 
                        hate you. Love, Basel.”

           He laughs but she’s deadpan.  

                                 BASEL
                        No, no, it’d be-

           He scrawls on her cast:

           “I hate you. Hate, Basel”

                                 LAUREL
                        Right.  Much better.

           They laugh and their eyes meet.  He inspects her face.  

                                 BASEL
                        You seem different.

                                 LAUREL
                             (self-conscious)
                        Oh, I do?  What do you mean?

                                 BASEL
                        I don’t know.  Just different.

           The sound of a phone ringing on the other side of the wall.

                                 BASEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s your phone.
                                 LAUREL
                        I should get my phone.

           She stands there staring at him, frozen.  It’s awkward.

                                 BASEL
                        Well, cool.

                                 LAUREL
                        Cool.

                                 BASEL
                        Yeah.

                                 LAUREL
                        Cool.

           He watches her, intrigued, as she hurries away through the 
           rows of books. 

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel opens the unit on the left, she answers the phone.  
           Audrey’s home is a vibrant feminine mix of mid-century and 
           antique with a huge tree in the middle of the living room.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Hello?  Oh, oh, um, hi Charles, my 
                        boyfriend, Charles.  I’m oh-kay.  
                        Remind me what “our place” is 
                        again? Okay, yeah, I’ll I’ll meet 
                        you there.  I, uh, yeah-
                             (mumbles)
                        love you too.

           She hangs up the phone and pauses for a moment on the couch, 
           puts her head in her hands. 

           Suddenly there’s a knock at the door, Laurel jumps.

           EXT. DUPLEX - PORCH - DAY

           CLAUDIA (late 20’s), stands on the porch with a SMALL BOY; 
           they look each other up and down as he knocks on Basel’s 
           door.  Claudia’s brassy exterior barely masks her acute 
           vulnerability.  Basel answers his door and Claudia glares at 
           himd as he let’s the boy in.
                                 CLAUDIA
                             (yells)
                        It’s me, Claudia.

           Claudia picks up the Mona Lisa that Laurel left on the porch.

                                 LAUREL (O.S.)
                        Come in!

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Claudia enters carrying the Mona Lisa painting.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You left this on the porch.

           Laurel takes it and sets it on the couch like a person.  

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        I just talked to your Dad.  You do 
                        remember me, right?  Your Dad told 
                        me you might not remember me.  He 
                        said your phone melted in the 
                        accident, like literally melted.  
                        It’s horrific.  How are you?  I 
                        really mean it, how are you?  

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m okay.  A little turned around. 
                        The doctor said I could have some 
                        memory problems for the next few 
                        months-

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Did you do something to your hair? 

           Laurel nervously touches her hair.

                                 LAUREL
                        Just a trim.

           She goes right up to Laurel, and hugs her; it’s awkward.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Everyone knows at work, Edith says 
                        you can take as much bereavement as 
                        you need.  Your place is a mess.  
                        What’s that smell?

           Laurel points to the vase of dead flowers.  Claudia grabs it.
                                 LAUREL
                        I want to go back to work, just to, 
                        you know, take care of my, uh, get 
                        back to normal-

           Claudia dumps the vase water in the sink and motions to have 
           Laurel follow her out into the joint backyard.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        But maybe you should consider not 
                        going back to work until you don’t 
                        look like you’ve just gone through 
                        a windshield.  

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY

           Claudia holds the vase, Laurel follows as they hear the 
           sounds of kids playing in a swimming pool in another yard.  

           Laurel stops to peek through the slats of the fence. 

           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - DAY

           A DAD barbecues and a MOM lounges on a floating raft with a 
           tropical beverage, while a GIRL and a BOY play Marco Polo.  
           The family and the backyard look straight out of 1962.

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY

           Laurel peers through the fence.  Basel watches her at the 
           open window; he can also hear the family play in their pool. 

                                 BASEL (O.S.)
                             (re: the family)
                        They’re so perfect they seem fake, 
                        like they’re in Technicolor or 
                        something.

           Laurel turns to him, nods.

                                 BASEL
                        I don’t know their real names, I 
                        just call them “The Browns.”    

                                 LAUREL
                        Mr. and Mrs. Brown and their kids 
                        Dick and Jane.
           He smiles.  Claudia re-enters the backyard with the vase.  
           Basel gives Claudia a passive aggressive head nod.  Claudia 
           ushers Laurel back inside.  

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Claudia and Laurel enter. 

                                 LAUREL
                        He seems nice.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Him?  You hate him.    

                                 LAUREL
                        When should I come in tomorrow?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You can’t be serious.

           Laurel gives her an “I am totally serious” look.  Claudia is 
           hesitant.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I’m taking dashiki-lady to see a 
                        new property around two.  I was 
                        going to take her off your hands 
                        and just give you the commish.  I’m 
                        going to do my best to take care of 
                        you for a change-

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I’ll do it.  I’ll go.

           Claudia checks the time.

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (notices the time)
                        Shit, I’ve got to meet a notary in 
                        five but I’m going to come back 
                        over after.  I know I’m the one 
                        who’s always a hot mess but I, I-

                                 LAUREL
                        No, that’s okay.  I have a date.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        With who?

                                 LAUREL
                        My boyfriend.
                                 CLAUDIA
                        Boyfriend?

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah?  What?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You don’t have a boyfriend-

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I have a boyfriend.  A 
                        boyfriend that I’ve got a date with 
                        tonight.  

           Claudia gives her a weird look, feels rejected.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Okay, well I’ll see you tomorrow.  
                        I guess.

           Claudia goes in for a hug but Laurel puts her hand out to 
           shake.  Claudia shakes it, confused.

           INT. SPERANZA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           CHARLES (50’s) distinguished and charming (but dressed too 
           young for his age) grins as he holds the door for Laurel.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Thank you, sir.

           She scans the dining room then waves at a YOUNG HOT GUY who 
           sits at a table by himself.  He looks behind him to make sure 
           she’s waving to him then smiles at her awkwardly.  

                                 CHARLES
                        Audrey?

           Laurel stops to look back at him. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Yes?  

           He touches her waist, taking ownership of her.

                                 LAUREL
                             (realizes it’s Charles)
                        Oh, yes!  Hi, there.  Oh, yeah, 
                        nice meeting, to see you.  You’re 
                        like really old.  Wow.
                                 CHARLES
                        I’m so terribly sorry darling.  I 
                        know how much she meant to you.  

                                 LAUREL
                        You do?

           He hugs her warmly, and gives her a sweet kiss on the mouth 
           then pulls away and looks toward their table.  She stands 
           there in shock and touches her fingertips to her mouth.

           INT. SPERANZA RESTAURANT - LATER

           Laurel and Charles chew mouthfuls of lettuce.  He looks at 
           her lovingly and grabs her hand, caresses it.  She looks down 
           at his caress with fear and excitement.

                                 LAUREL
                        This place is like super close to 
                        my apartment.

                                 CHARLES
                        Yes, yes it is.  
                             (patronizing)
                        You’re funny. 

           Awkward silence.  She’s embarrassed.

                                 CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Is everything alright?  

                                 LAUREL
                        I don’t feel like myself.  I, um, 
                        can’t remember some things-

                                 CHARLES
                        It’s okay.  We’ll take it slow.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I’ve got to go pee to the bathroom.  
                        I mean in the bathroom.

           EXT. SPERANZA RESTAURANT - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Laurel walks outside to catch her breath.  A DISHWASHER 
           squats next to her, smoking a cigarette.  He offers her one, 
           she nods, he lights it with the other one still in his mouth.

           They smoke together for a moment, she coughs a little, 
           doesn’t know how to inhale.  Charles exits looking for her.
                                 CHARLES
                        Hey, are you okay?

                                 LAUREL
                             (she coughs)
                        Yeah.

           Charles brushes her hair off her shoulder, looks in her eyes 
           then kisses her neck.  

                                 LAUREL
                             (freaked out)
                        Ahh.

           He grabs her face and they start to make-out as the 
           dishwasher watches.  She pulls away from him, guilty yet 
           really turned on.   

                                 CHARLES
                        You’re not still mad at me? 

                                 LAUREL
                        No, it’s not you...Wait, why would 
                        I still be mad at you?

           He sticks his hand up her skirt, she closes her eyes.

                                 CHARLES
                        I’m sorry for springing the divorce 
                        on you, darling.  I don’t know what 
                        I was thinking-  

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s okay-
                             (realizes what he said, 
                              pushes him away)
                        Wait, wait we’re married?!

                                 CHARLES
                             (confused)
                        What?  No.  No.  We’re not married.  
                        You don’t remember our fight?

                                 LAUREL
                             (realizes)
                        Oh, you’re married to someone else?

           He starts to kiss her more, but she stops him.

                                 CHARLES
                        Forget the divorce.  We’ll just go 
                        back to our little farce-  
                                 LAUREL
                        Our farce?  

                                 CHARLES
                        A little rendezvous then back to 
                        our real lives.  I get it.  You’re 
                        right, commitment is scary-  

                                 LAUREL
                        Did I break up with you?

                                 CHARLES
                        Yes-

           Laurel turns and marches away down the alley.

                                 CHARLES
                        Audrey?!

                                 LAUREL
                        I deserve better than being 
                        someone’s mistress, someone’s 
                        second choice.  

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Laurel slips into Audrey’s place, with Charles following 
           right behind.  He pounds on the door. 

                                 CHARLES (O.S.)
                        Please, darling, just talk to me!

                                 LAUREL
                        Leave me alone!  Go pay our check!

           EXT. DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Charles bangs on Audrey’s door.  Basel walks up to the porch 
           with a bag of groceries.

                                 LAUREL (O.S.)
                        I’m going to call the cops!

                                 BASEL
                        Audrey, is everything okay?

                                 LAUREL
                        Basel?  Can you make him go away?

           Charles kicks her door.  
                                 CHARLES
                        I’m not going away.  You are my 
                        first choice, don’t you see?  
                        That’s why I wanted the divorce.  
                        To make this real!

                                 BASEL
                        Give her a break man, she’s been 
                        through a lot-

                                 CHARLES
                        This matter doesn’t concern you.

           Charles kicks the door again.

                                 BASEL
                        Hey chill out, dude-

           Basel pushes Charles with his bag of groceries and scoots him 
           off the porch.  Charles shoves Basel and his groceries 
           explode all over the porch.  Eggs break, apples and oranges 
           roll around them.  

           While Basel is distracted by the grocery explosion Charles 
           throws a punch that splits Basel’s cheek open and it starts 
           to gush blood.

                                 BASEL
                        You asshole.

           This is war.  Basel positions himself to use his latent 
           jiujitsu knowledge.  Charles laughs at Basel’s pose then 
           Basel clocks him with a single round house kick that knocks 
           him off the porch.

           With Charles laid out on the front lawn moaning, Basel 
           gathers his groceries.

           EXT. DUPLEX - MOMENTS LATER 

           Basel unlocks his front door while he cups his bloody cheek.  
           Laurel peeks out the front window, and sees Charles limp 
           around the corner out of sight.

                                 LAUREL
                        Do you think he’s okay?

                                 BASEL
                        He’ll live.

           Then she looks at Basel cupping his cheek.
                                 LAUREL
                        Oh my God, are you okay?

                                 BASEL
                        It’s nothing.  He accidentally 
                        punched me in the face.

           She laughs.

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Laurel leads Basel into the apartment; the place is a mess.  
           She enters the bathroom and leaves Basel in the living room.

                                 LAUREL (O.C.)
                        Sorry for the mess.

                                 BASEL
                        It’s cool, I was only judging with 
                        my one eye anyway.  

                                 LAUREL (O.C.)
                        Right, cause your other eye’s all 
                        bloody and disgusting. 

           He sits on the couch next to the Mona Lisa and peers over at 
           it.  He grabs the painting and holds it on his lap with one 
           hand, still cupping his eye with the other.

           INT. AUDREY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Laurel smooths her hair, checks her teeth for food then 
           rummages through Audrey’s medicine cabinet.  

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           As Basel looks at the painting he leans over it a bit.  He 
           accidentally drips his blood on it.

                                 BASEL
                        Fuck!

           He tries to dab it with his sleeve but it only makes it worse 
           and new droplets of blood fall on it.  

                                 BASEL
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck.
           Defeated, he finally throws his head back and waits there 
           helpless with the blood-smeared painting on his lap.

           Laurel enters with peroxide and a towel.

                                 BASEL
                        I was looking at it, and I, I got 
                        some of my blood on it. 

           She stares at the painting, shocked.  She laughs.  Blood 
           continues to drip down his neck and onto his shirt.

                                 BASEL (CONT’D)
                        Hey, can I maybe get a paper towel 
                        or something?

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, sorry.  Tip your head back.

           He closes his eyes and she puts pressure on the wound.  They 
           sit there in silence for a moment.  She examines his face, 
           it’s pretty damn cute.

                                 BASEL
                        I think it’s really good.  The 
                        painting.

                                 LAUREL
                        No it’s not.  

                                 BASEL
                        It’s better than the original.  
                        She’s got a bigger secret, and lots 
                        of, you know, plans for the 
                        weekend.  She’s cool.

                                 LAUREL
                        Riiight.

           She laughs and starts to dress his wound.  

                                 BASEL
                        Is it that hard for you to accept a 
                        compliment?

                                 LAUREL
                        I was going to throw it out, I 
                        don’t even know why I kept it.

                                 BASEL
                        Well since it’s our first 
                        collaboration, can I have it?  
                                 LAUREL
                        I guess.

                                 BASEL
                        You do realize I’m complimenting 
                        you even after your grandpa 
                        boyfriend split my head open?  What 
                        the hell are you doing with that 
                        dude anyway?  I don’t mean to butt 
                        in.  I’m going to shut up now.  

           She smiles as he stares at her wide-eyed.  She puts a bandage 
           over his cut.

           She goes to the kitchen, comes back with a bag of frozen peas 
           for his eye.

                                 BASEL
                        Thanks. 

           They sit in silence for a moment as he ices his eye.

                                 BASEL
                        How’s your arm?  The accident must 
                        have been pretty gnarly.

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah.  My sister died.  In it, in 
                        the accident.

                                 BASEL
                        Fuck, Audrey.

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah.

                                 BASEL (CONT’D)
                        Older or younger?

                                 LAUREL
                        Younger.  By two minutes.

                                 BASEL
                        Your twin died?  

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah.  Laurel.  Did I ever tell you 
                        about her?

                                 BASEL
                        We’ve never actually talked, you 
                        prefer to threaten and/or scowl.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BASEL (cont'd)
                        It’s a fucking miracle I’m sitting 
                        here, right now.

                                 LAUREL
                        Sorry about that.  

                                 BASEL
                        Your twin just died, you don’t have 
                        to be sorry for anything, like ever 
                        again.  

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s my free pass to be a horrible 
                        person?

                                 BASEL
                        Yeah.  You could totally do some 
                        raping and pillaging and I’d 
                        forgive you. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Thanks.

                                 BASEL
                        What was she like?  

                                 LAUREL
                        She still lived at home with our 
                        Dad, took care of him.  We’re from 
                        this small town; everyone thought 
                        she was weird.  She didn’t really 
                        have any friends-  

                                 BASEL
                        Well, I don’t have a lot of friends 
                        and people think I’m weird.  But 
                        I’m actually just super handsome 
                        and amazing.  So she probably was 
                        pretty amazing too.

           She laughs.

                                 LAUREL
                        Do you do that a lot?

                                 BASEL
                        What? 

                                 LAUREL
                        Compliment yourself?

                                 BASEL
                        I don’t know.  Doesn’t everyone?  
                                 LAUREL
                        I think people mostly tell 
                        themselves how much they suck.

                                 BASEL
                        You should try it, it’s a lot 
                        better than telling yourself you 
                        suck.  It should be easy for you, 
                        since you’ve given me every 
                        indication that you’re totally 
                        arrogant-

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, well, I don’t know-

                                 BASEL
                        I dare you.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m so...I’m so...tall.

                                 BASEL
                             (he claps)
                        Bravo.  That’s more like stating a 
                        fact but still, a solid effort.

           EXT. DUPLEX - PORCH - NIGHT

           Basel stands outside, he holds the frozen peas to his eye 
           with one hand and holds the bloody Mona Lisa with the other.  

                                 BASEL
                        We should like hang out again.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Hang out?  You mean like a, a date?

                                 BASEL
                        No, like just friends.

                                 LAUREL
                             (embarrassed)
                        Oh.  Um, I, yeah.  I gotta go, um, 
                        go there, check, check on something-

           Laurel shuts the door on him because she’s so nervous she 
           doesn’t know what else to do.
           EXT. DUPLEX - PORCH - NIGHT

           Basel stands there for a moment unsure of what just happened.

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Laurel notices a blood stain on the couch.  She touches the 
           stain lovingly. 

           EXT. DOLLHOUSE REALTY - DAY

           Laurel stands outside a building that says “Dollhouse Realty” 
           on it.  She’s wearing Audrey’s clothes but mixes different 
           prints in a way that could be seen as either really cool or 
           really lame.

           INT. DOLLHOUSE REALTY - DAY

           Laurel enters to find the WHOLE OFFICE standing in V-
           formation, with looks of sympathy on their faces.  Claudia 
           follows as Laurel floats down the line like a ghost as they 
           all hug her and give their condolences. 

           EDITH (late 40’s) eight months pregnant with a severe bob, 
           stands at the crux of the V resting her hands on her belly 
           like a queen.  Edith warmly grabs Laurel’s hands.

                                 EDITH
                             (phony sincerity)
                        Audrey, darling.  I am so sorry for 
                        your loss.  You look positively 
                        dreadful, I can’t imagine what 
                        you’ve been through.  

           Edith picks a stray hair off of Laurel’s shirt.

                                 LAUREL
                        Um, thanks-

           Laurel looks to Claudia: she has no idea who Edith is.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Edith.

                                 EDITH
                        I insist that you take as much time 
                        as you need.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDITH (cont'd)
                        And I trust that you’ll let me know 
                        if I can do anything for you, 
                        anything at all.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        We’re actually on our way to show 
                        some properties this morning-

                                 EDITH
                        Oh, that’s wonderful, we need her 
                        back in action as soon as we can 
                        get her.   

           INT. AUDREY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Claudia and Laurel enter Audrey’s office which overflows with 
           flower arrangements.  Claudia shuts the door. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (mocking Edith)
                        “Take as much time as you need as 
                        long as you come back to work 
                        immediately.”  She’s a fucking 
                        piece of work.

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah, I know, tell me about it.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        So how was your date?

                                 LAUREL
                        Not a big deal.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        No, it’s a big deal since the only 
                        thing I have to tell you about my 
                        sex life is that our double yeast 
                        infection finally cleared up.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Nothing to report.  It’s over: I 
                        found out he’s married.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        So?  

                                 LAUREL
                        He’s married.
                                 CLAUDIA
                        Never stopped you before.  
                        Sometimes I wish Patrick was 
                        married so I didn’t have to see him 
                        so much-

           Laurel looks at her blankly.

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (offended)
                        Patrick.  My boyfriend.  Of like 
                        almost a decade?

                                 LAUREL
                        Right.  Aren’t we going to be late?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I was thinking we could cancel, 
                        just gossip all afternoon.  Get 
                        mani-pedis, hit happy hour like we 
                        did when my grammy died-

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I’m good.  Let’s go.

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh, okay.

           INT. CLAUDIA’S CAR - DAY

           Claudia drives as Laurel studies an MLS informational sheet 
           about a house.  Claudia pulls to a stop.  Laurel looks from 
           the photo of the house up to the house itself.  She looks 
           worried.

           EXT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - DAY

           Claudia and Laurel walk up to the house, it looks like a 
           cottage from a fairy tale and has a molded roof.

           INT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - DAY

           Claudia and Laurel enter.  It’s filled with light and cheer 
           but is unfurnished.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        The empty ones are always the 
                        hardest to sell.
           Laurel realizes Claudia is looking to her for a response.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, yeah, totally.  So hard to 
                        sell.  Empty ones.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        People have no fucking imagination 
                        sometimes.

                                 LAUREL
                        I know.  No imagination.

           Laurel wanders around aimlessly.  She’s nervous.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Are you okay?

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m cool.

           A knock at the door.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You’ll be great. It’s second nature-

           INT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - LATER - DAY 

           Claudia welcomes MRS. MATTHEWS (60’s) inside, she wears a 
           brightly patterned dashiki and is followed by her two grown 
           sons, DAVID and DARREN.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Hi, Mrs. Matthews, David, Darren.  

                                 MRS. MATTHEWS
                             (re: Laurel’s injuries)
                        Oh my stars, what happened to you?!  

                                 LAUREL
                        I had an accident.  But I’m fine.

           Claudia motions to Laurel to start the tour.  Laurel launches 
           right in, nervous.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        This is the, uh, living room.  

           Mrs. Matthews waits for her to say more.  Laurel looks 
           around, tries to think of something else to say.  She points 
           to a small door to a storage room beneath the staircase.
                                 LAUREL
                        Over there is a little door-

           Mrs. Matthews nods but Laurel’s at a loss for something else 
           to say.  She looks constipated.  Claudia puts on a fake 
           smile, nervous for what’s to come.

           INT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Laurel and Claudia are crammed inside the master bathroom 
           with Mrs. Matthews and her sons.

                                 LAUREL
                        This is the bathroom.

                                 MRS. MATTHEWS
                        Is this original tile work?

                                 LAUREL
                        This is tile work, yes.

           Mrs. Matthews gives Laurel a weird look.

           EXT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Laurel stands in the backyard with a lush English garden.

                                 LAUREL
                        This is the backyard.  With plants.

           INT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

           Laurel pushes the button to open the garage door.

                                 LAUREL
                        And this is the garage. 
                             (long pause)
                        Cars.

           Claudia, Mrs. Matthews and her sons stare at Laurel 
           perplexed.  No one knows what to make of this bizarre 
           informationless home tour.  

           INT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - LATER - DAY

           Claudia puts the key in the lockbox while Laurel stands 
           behind her, mortified.  
                                 CLAUDIA
                        “This is the backyard with plants”?  
                        Seriously?

           Claudia starts towards her car, Laurel follows.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m sorry.  I’m going to figure it 
                        out, I promise.  Just tell me what 
                        I have to do.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Selling a house is not that 
                        complicated.  You point out the 
                        good stuff, minimize the bad, and 
                        pitch them on a potential future 
                        life where all their dreams come 
                        true.  They like it or not and then 
                        you just do the fucking paperwork.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, okay.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        That’s a direct quote from you.  
                        What in the world is going on with 
                        you, Audrey?  

                                 LAUREL
                             (defensive)
                        Well, for starters, I’ve got brain 
                        damage, and can’t remember-

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Of course, of course.  I’m sorry.

                                 LAUREL
                        What do you want to know?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I want to know how you feel about 
                        your sister dying.  

                                 LAUREL
                        How do you think I feel?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I have no idea.  All I know is that 
                        you wanted to bring her back here, 
                        add a third member to our little 
                        crew, and then you came back alone.
                                 LAUREL
                        I told you I wanted her to live 
                        with me?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Yeah, you were so excited for her 
                        to start her own life-

           Laurel looks away, she’s not ready to talk about this.

           INT. CLAUDIA’S CAR - DAY

           Claudia and Laurel sit in the car looking straight ahead, 
           Claudia reaches into her backseat and hands Laurel a box full 
           of brochures.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        There’s this whole like community 
                        for twins whose twin died, and they 
                        have these support groups.  I got 
                        you some brochures.  

           There’s like a thousand brochures in the box, Laurel thumbs 
           through them.

                                 LAUREL
                        Why’d you get me so many?  I’m only 
                        one person.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I don’t know.  It seemed like a 
                        good idea at the time.

           Laurel stares at the box.

           EXT. DUPLEX - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Laurel walks up the front path holding the box as Timor and 
           his friend PETER (10) jog up behind her.

                                 TIMOR
                        Hey, Audrey?

                                 LAUREL
                        What?  Yeah?

                                 TIMOR
                        Do you remember me?
                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah, I remember all the new stuff.

                                 TIMOR
                             (to Peter)
                        This is the girl I told you about, 
                        the one who has amnesia.

                                 PETER
                        Hi.

                                 LAUREL
                        Hi.

           Timor shares a knowing look with Peter.

                                 LAUREL
                        What?

                                 TIMOR
                        Nothing.

                                 PETER
                        Basel thinks you’re prettier now 
                        that you’re not a bitch.  

                                 TIMOR
                        Peter!

                                 PETER
                        Someone’s got to have some balls.

                                 LAUREL
                        Really?  He said that I’m prettier 
                        now?

                                 TIMOR
                        Ooooh, do you like, like him?

           Basel comes out to greet the boys.

                                 BASEL
                        Hey guys, what are you doing?

                           PETER
                                                          TIMOR
           Nothing!
                                              Nothing!

           Out-of-her-mind-nervous, Laurel rushes into Audrey’s 
           apartment, and slams the door behind her.

                                 BASEL
                        What did you say to her guys?
                           PETER
                                                          TIMOR
           Nothing!
                                              Nothing!

           They giggle as they run into his duplex.  Basel looks at 
           Audrey’s door, amused.

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel looks through the peep hole at Basel standing on the 
           porch.  He looks into the peep hole as if he knows she’s 
           watching him.  He stares intensely for a moment then makes a 
           funny face, then gets serious again and goes into his duplex.

           Laurel looks through the peep hole at the empty porch.  

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - LATER - DAY 

           Laurel lies on the couch covered by a blanket of unfolded 
           support group brochures, crying.  During a pause in her 
           crying jag she hears children’s voices play-fighting outside 
           and takes the brochure off of her face.  

           She gets up and brushes the brochures off her body and goes 
           out the back door to follow the voices.

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY

           Laurel looks through the slats in the fence into the 
           neighbor’s backyard, longingly.

           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - DAY

           The boy and girl wrestle on the grass near the pool as their 
           Mom and Dad load up their vintage Airstream with camping 
           supplies.  The kids run and pile into the Airstream. 

                                 LAUREL (O.S.)
                        No, don’t leave!

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY

           Laurel watches through the slats as their Airstream trailer 
           pulls out of their backyard parking spot.

           Suddenly Audrey’s phone rings.  She goes in to answer it.
           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM / AUDREY’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Frank sits on the crack between the two twin beds.  

                                 FRANK
                        Hello?

                                 LAUREL
                        Hi, Daddy.  I mean, Dad.

                                 FRANK
                        May and I are gettin’ married at 
                        the end of the month.  It’s just a 
                        little courthouse thing so we hope 
                        you’ll come be our witness.

           They’re quiet for a moment as Laurel tries to suppress her 
           feelings about this.

                                 LAUREL
                        Don’t you think it’s a little soon, 
                        Dad?  She just died.  

                                 FRANK
                        Life’s too short to wait round any 
                        longer.  I been alone a long time.

           Frank starts to choke up but tries to hide it.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Dad?  Are you okay?  

                                 FRANK
                        It’s just I get to paintin’ in the 
                        morning and all of the sudden I get 
                        really hungry and realize I’m 
                        waitin’ for her to bring me 
                        breakfast.  She used to smash 
                        raspberries down on my toast cause 
                        she said jam-

                                 LAUREL
                        -was too sugary.   

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                             (yells)
                        Frank!  Frank!

                                 FRANK
                        Seeing me upset makes her uneasy.
                                 LAUREL
                        Dad?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah?

           Beat.  She considers telling him.

                                 LAUREL
                        Nothing.

                                 FRANK
                        I know we stopped talkin’ after you 
                        moved outa here but...now that 
                        we’re all that’s left of our little 
                        family, how bout we try to talk 
                        sometimes?

                                 MAY (O.S.)
                             (yells)
                        Frank!

                                 FRANK
                             (yells)
                        Coming!
                             (to Laurel)
                        I gotta go.

           He hangs up and stares at the twin beds for a long moment, 
           sad.  Then he looks out the window at May on the lawn holding 
           a rake next to a huge pile of leaves. 

           Laurel stares through the slats of the fence into the empty 
           back yard.

           INT. RECREATION HALL - DAY

           A sign reads “Twinless Twin Support Group.”  Laurel enters 
           hesitantly.  A group of MEN AND WOMEN sit in a circle, the 
           meeting has already began.  The group leader, MARGUERITE 
           (late 30’s), motions Laurel to join them.

           INT. RECREATION HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel sits in the group’s circle.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        Our new members always start by 
                        introducing themselves.
           Laurel pulls up a chair.

                                 LAUREL
                        My name is, my name is-

           She considers what she will say.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Laurel.

           She throws her hand over her mouth like she’s said an 
           unforgivable thing.

                                 GROUP
                        Hi, Laurel.

           Hearing them say her name, physically hurts.

                                 MARGUERITE
                        What’re you feeling, dear?

           She can barely talk, suddenly overcome with emotion.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m having...a, a...really hard 
                        time letting my sister go-

           Everyone looks at her, nodding their heads like this is the 
           truest thing they’ve ever heard.  

           INT. AUDREY’S CAR - DAY

           Laurel breathes heavy in the car.  She catches a glimpse of 
           herself in the rear-view mirror then flips it up so she can’t 
           see herself.  She puts her head on the steering wheel and 
           hugs it.  

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Laurel swigs from a giant bottle of tequila as she drunk 
           dances to the music playing inside Audrey’s apartment as she 
           drags out a bag of trash.  She hears splashing noises and 
           moves to peek through the slats of the backyard fence into 
           her neighbor’s yard. 
           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Their pool glows turquoise in the night.  A man dives off the 
           diving board into the pool.  When he comes up from the dive 
           she sees it’s Basel.  She pops her head over the fence.

                                 LAUREL
                        Did they say you could do that?

                                 BASEL
                        No.  Come on over.  Come in!

                                 LAUREL
                        I can’t.

           She holds up her cast over the fence.

                                 BASEL
                             (re: the cast)
                        So what?

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Laurel wears a vintage one-piece swimsuit and has a plastic 
           bag tied around her cast sealed with tape.  She spills over 
           the top of the fence.  She’s pretty drunk.

           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Laurel lands on her butt on the grass.

                                 BASEL
                        Ouch.  

           She laughs and walks to the edge of the pool.  Basel stares 
           up at her.  She looks down into the water.

                                 BASEL
                             (re: the plastic bag on 
                              her cast)
                        Nice work.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Thanks.

                                 BASEL
                        Come in.  
           He watches her as she reluctantly descends the pool stairs, 
           holding her cast above her head.

                                 BASEL
                        I think it helps to just go for it, 
                        go under all the way.  Really 
                        commit.

           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - POOL - UNDERWATER

           Laurel dunks her head under, still holding her cast above 
           water.  She looks around underwater at the pool lights and 
           Basel’s torso.  Hot.

           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - POOL

           Basel watches her as she holds her cast above water until she 
           emerges.

                                 LAUREL
                        Hi.

                                 BASEL
                        Hi.

           Laurel looks down.

                                 BASEL
                        What?  What’s wrong?

                                 LAUREL
                        I think, I...I think I might, um, I 
                        think I might-

           Laurel doesn’t say anything just shyly looks away.

                                 BASEL 
                        Mrs. Brown, thank you for joining 
                        me for this delightful midnight 
                        swim.  

           Laurel gives him a questioning look.

                                 BASEL (CONT’D)
                        Pretend with me, it’ll make it 
                        easier if we’re, you know, already 
                        married.

           Laurel smiles.
                                 LAUREL
                        No, thank you for joining me for 
                        this delightful midnight swim, Mr. 
                        Brown.

                                 BASEL
                        My pleasure, Mrs. Brown.

                                 LAUREL
                        I think I might need you-  
                             (beat)
                        -I think I might need you to take 
                        the kids to school in the morning. 
                        I need to bake those sugar- 

                                 BASEL
                        -cookies for the bake sale. I’ll go 
                        ahead and make their lunches, put a 
                        little note in there then-

                                 LAUREL
                        -staple the brown paper bag shut 
                        with one single staple.

                                 BASEL
                        The note will say “I hope you know 
                        how much I-

                                 LAUREL
                        -“adore your mother?”

           He nods yes.  Then she grabs his face and kisses him 
           awkwardly on the mouth.  Then she starts to follow his lead 
           as if he’s teaching her how to kiss.  

           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Basel and Laurel tumble into bed, dripping wet from the pool.  
           They’re kind of spastic in their movements and the plastic 
           bag that houses her cast makes crinkly noises.  

           They stop making out so that he can take the bag off her 
           cast.  As he unwraps the tape she taps her fingertips down 
           his chest toward his “area.”  He shivers a little then almost 
           says something but stops and laughs at himself.  She quickly 
           pulls her hand away, embarrassed, unsure.

                                 LAUREL
                        What?  Am I doing something wrong?
                                 BASEL
                        No, no.  It’s stupid.  I was about 
                        to say something stupid.

                                 LAUREL
                        Say it.

           He hesitates.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Say it!

                                 BASEL
                             (shy)
                        It just feels...good when you touch 
                        me.

           She puts her finger in his ear.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Even in your ear?

           He laughs.  They kiss again.

                                 BASEL
                        Wow, how did this happen?  Wow.

           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX - NEXT MORNING - DAY

           Basel and Laurel lie naked in bed draped by a sheet.  Basel’s 
           asleep but Laurel’s wide awake and looking at him sweetly. 

           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel and Basel read side by side.

                             (out of nowhere)
                        Beep.

           Basel continues to read but joins in the game.  

                                 BASEL
                        Beep.

           Laurel continues to read then looks up from her book and 
           smiles at him.

                                 LAUREL
                        Beep.
           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel enters and does a little dance.  Her face in a moment 
           of perfect contentment.

           EXT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY

           Laurel leaves the store carrying brushes, paints, an easel 
           and a few canvases, full of youthful excitement.  

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - LATER - DAY

           Laurel unloads her art supplies and sets up an easel outside.

           INT. VIET NOODLE BAR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Claudia, and her boyfriend PATRICK (30’s in a suit with 
           gelled hair and a really loud voice), sit on one side of a 
           long communal table and Laurel and Basel sit opposite.  They 
           look at menus.  

           Patrick sucks snot up his nose loudly.

                                 LAUREL
                        What’re you gonna have Mr. Brown?

                                 BASEL
                        I don’t know, wanna split 
                        something, Mrs. Brown?

           Claudia is disgusted by their cheesiness.    

                                 PATRICK
                             (to Laurel, loud)
                        It’s so crazy that your twin died.  
                        Did you know Elvis’ twin died at 
                        birth and he never got over it?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Jesus, Patrick!

                                 PATRICK
                        What?  It’s true.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You have the subtlety of a monster 
                        truck.  Sorry, Audrey.
           Laurel shrugs.  They all go back to looking at their menus.  

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                             (re: the menu)
                        Noodles.  Asian noodles. 

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Claudia and Patrick sit stiffly on a bench and watch Basel 
           and Laurel merrily swing on the swing set as they drink 
           forties in paper bags.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        She shouldn’t be having so 
                        much...Fun.  It’s not right.

                                 PATRICK
                        It’s not right to have fun?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Not when you’re supposed to be 
                        mourning your twin.

                                 PATRICK
                        You want her to be like wearing 
                        black and wailing all the time?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        No.  But she seems different to 
                        you, right?

                                 PATRICK
                        She’s still hot.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Fuck you, Patrick.

                                 PATRICK
                        You need to stop obsessing over 
                        her, babe.  You’re acting like a 
                        jealous boyfriend.  She’ll come 
                        around. 

           Claudia gives him a dirty look.  He just doesn’t understand.

           Laurel straddles Basel on his swing.  They laugh.  Claudia 
           and Patrick look at them, wistful and jealous but for 
           different reasons.  He sucks his snot up his nose again.  
           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Basel watches Laurel sleep then gently shakes her awake.   

                                 BASEL
                        Hey, it’s time to get up Mrs. 
                        Brown.  We need to beat the crowds.

                                 LAUREL
                             (groggy, smiling)
                        But who’ll watch the kids?

           EXT. MANSION - DAY

           Laurel and Basel arrive at an estate sale.  Everything is out 
           on the sprawling front lawn: furniture, clothes, art, books, 
           etc.  It’s laid out according to rooms in the house; as if 
           the walls of the house disappeared.  

           RALPH, a paunchy, snarky bookseller, approaches them.  He 
           speaks to Basel but stares at Laurel sleazily.

                                 RALPH
                        Too little too late, already 
                        snatched up their first editions.

           Basel looks to Laurel, rolls his eyes.

                                 BASEL
                        Hey Ralph.  Guess we’ll just have 
                        to take your scraps.

                                 RALPH
                        And who is this?

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m his wife, Mrs. Brown-

           Basel gives her a weird look.

                                 RALPH
                             (to Laurel)
                        Enchanté.  
                             (to Basel)
                        Don’t you think she’s a little out 
                        of your league?

           Ralph laughs.  Basel looks like he wants to bitch slap him.
                                 RALPH
                        You two enjoy the scraps. 

           Ralph walks away. 

                                 LAUREL
                        What a dick face.  

                                 BASEL
                        Why’d you do that?

                                 LAUREL
                        Do what?

                                 BASEL
                        Lie to him.

                                 LAUREL
                        I was just pretending-

                                 BASEL
                        But I know that dude-  

                                 LAUREL
                        So?

                                 BASEL
                        There’s a difference between 
                        pretending and lying.

                                 LAUREL
                        I know.

           She turns away to take a deep breath and hide the guilty look 
           on her face.

                                 BASEL
                        Okay, it’s just I-

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I understand.

           He looks at her back, concerned.

           EXT. DUPLEX - LATER - DAY

           Laurel and Basel unload the books from the car.
           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Basel shelves books, joyfully then looks out the window into 
           the backyard as Laurel paints in her bathing suit.

           EXT. DUPLEX - BACKYARD - DAY

           Laurel paints an abstract painting of two people in a pool at 
           night: shapes and shadows of turquoise, pale blue and black. 

           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX - DAY

           As Basel continues to shelve the new books, suddenly there’s 
           a knock at his door.

           EXT. DUPLEX - PORCH - DAY

           Basel answers the door to find Claudia glaring at him. 

                                 BASEL
                        She’s out back, she probably didn’t 
                        hear you.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        No, I came by to talk to you.  

                                 BASEL
                        Oh.  Okay.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Does she ever talk to you about 
                        Laurel?

                                 BASEL
                             (He’s lying)
                        Of course.  Why?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        She won’t talk about her with me, 
                        and I just wanted to make sure 
                        someone is there-

                                 BASEL
                        Well, I’m here.  I got it.  
                                 CLAUDIA
                        She seems like she’s perfect but 
                        she’s not.  She’s lonely and messed 
                        up like the rest of us.  

                                 BASEL
                        What do you want Claudia?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Normally, she only dates married 
                        guys.  Did you know that?

                                 BASEL
                        Oh, yeah?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        If you fuck someone else’s husband, 
                        you never get hurt, never have to 
                        commit.  She usually has her guard 
                        up, wants everyone to believe she’s 
                        got it all together.  And now, I 
                        can tell she’s let her guard down 
                        with you.  And if you hurt her I 
                        swear I will murder your face.  

           Basel nods.  She starts to tear up and turns her head away.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s great that she found you and 
                        all but I feel like I lost my best 
                        friend.

                                 BASEL
                        I’m sorry.

           He pats her shoulder awkwardly.  She looks at his hand, angry 
           at herself for showing her cards.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        And it’s all very strange because 
                        just a few weeks ago we were 
                        laughing about your B.O.

           At that, she turns and hurries to the car.

                                 BASEL
                        You have a nice day, too. 

           He self-consciously smells his armpit as she drives away.
           EXT. PERFECT FAMILY’S BACKYARD - POOL - NIGHT

           Laurel and Basel swim on their backs in the pool, side by 
           side, head to foot.

                                 LAUREL
                        It’s like we’re womb mates.

                                 BASEL
                        I wish.  But there’s still that 
                        stupid fucking wall between our 
                        apartments.

                                 LAUREL
                        Not room mates, wooomb mates.

           He gives her a worried look.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 BASEL
                        I was just, um, why don’t you ever 
                        talk about her?

                                 LAUREL
                        Everything’s so great with us.  I 
                        don’t want to mess it up.

                                 BASEL
                        You think I won’t like you if you 
                        show me how you feel?  

                                 LAUREL
                        I don’t know.  Maybe.

                                 BASEL
                        It feels like there’s so much that 
                        you’re not saying and that’s not 
                        the type of relationship I want.

                                 LAUREL
                        Me either.

                                 BASEL
                        Everyone keeps pointing out how 
                        you’re too good for me-

                                 LAUREL
                        Who?  That assface at the yard 
                        sale?
                                 BASEL
                        It doesn’t matter who-

                                 LAUREL
                        I thought you were Mr. Confident-

                                 BASEL
                        I’m a human being; I don’t feel the 
                        same way all the time.  And I’ve 
                        never dated a girl like you-

                                 LAUREL
                        Like me?

                                 BASEL
                        You never gave me a second look, 
                        Audrey.  I’m not the type of guy 
                        who gets a girl like you.  

                                 LAUREL
                        No, no, no.  I’m not the type of 
                        girl who gets a guy like you.

                                 BASEL
                        Is that supposed to be a joke?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I’m serious.  If only you knew 
                        how much-  

                                 BASEL
                        I just want it to be real.  I want 
                        everything.  And if it’s not, if 
                        it’s just me and my imagination, my 
                        stupid wishful thinking, I need to 
                        know before you totally crush me.  
                        If this is going to work I just 
                        really need you to be totally 
                        honest with me about you, about who 
                        you are.   

                                 LAUREL
                        I want to be honest with you.  I 
                        do.  I want this to be real more 
                        that anything.  But I’ve never done 
                        this before.  I’m not sure what the 
                        real me looks like.

                                 BASEL
                        I do, at least I’ve got a glimpse 
                        of her, and that’s what I want, 
                        that’s who I want.   
                                 LAUREL
                        Me too.  Me too.

           INT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - DAY

           Laurel gives a home tour to a YOUNG COUPLE, the WIFE is 
           really short and the HUSBAND is almost seven feet tall.  
           Claudia watches.  Laurel shows them the secret nook with the 
           tiny door under the staircase.

                                 LAUREL
                        Your little ones can make a 
                        clubhouse in here.

           Laurel crawls into the little nook then turn and looks out at 
           them on all fours, smiling.

                                 LAUREL
                        Isn’t this awesome?

                                 TALL HUSBAND
                             (joking)
                        I’ll never be able to get in there.

                                 SHORT WIFE
                        But I can.

           The Short Wife gets on all fours and crawls in the nook to 
           join Laurel.  They both giggle and smile at Claudia and the 
           Tall Husband from the doorway of the nook.  

           EXT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - BACKYARD

           Laurel and Claudia shows the couple the lush English garden.

                                 LAUREL
                        You can plant a vegetable garden 
                        every spring, and eat the harvest 
                        together, as a family. 

           The couple loves this idea and wander off to explore the 
           garden together discussing what they will plant.  Claudia 
           looks at Laurel, perplexed and amazed.

           EXT. EMPTY STORYBOOK HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER

           Laurel and Audrey lock up the house, smiling.
                                 CLAUDIA
                        Wow, that was a fucking work of 
                        art, I’ve never seen you like that- 

                                 LAUREL
                        Shit, girrl, let’s go draw up the 
                        offer!

           INT. DOLLHOUSE REALTY - DAY

           As Laurel and Claudia enter the office giddy from their 
           successful tour, Laurel spots Charles as he waits in the 
           reception area.  He smiles and waves at her nonchalant.  

                                 LAUREL
                             (to Claudia)
                        Can you give me a minute?

           Claudia nods and hangs in the background.

                                 LAUREL
                             (to Charles)
                        What are you doing here?  

                                 CHARLES
                        I’m not here to see you, darling.

           Edith walks up behind them.

                                 EDITH
                             (to Laurel)
                        Hi, dear.  How’s everything going?

           Edith picks a piece of lint out of Laurel’s hair.

                                 LAUREL
                        Just got an offer on the new Story 
                        Book-

                                 EDITH
                        Fantastic!  
                             (to Charles)
                        Audrey is recovering from a nasty 
                        accident.

                                 CHARLES
                        I see, that, that’s too bad.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh no, I know him, he’s my-
                                 CHARLES
                             (to Edith, nervous)
                        Come on, honey, let’s go, we’ll be 
                        late for our appointment.

           Edith looks from Charles then back to Laurel suddenly sensing 
           the weird energy afoot.  Charles tries to shuffle Edith out 
           of the office but she holds her ground.

                                 EDITH
                        What’s going on here?  Charles?

                                 CHARLES
                        We’ll talk about this on our way-

           Edith looks to Laurel who seems confused then back to 
           Charles.

                                 EDITH
                             (to Charles, her voice 
                              cracks)
                        What part of “please keep your dick 
                        out of my office while I’m 
                        pregnant” did you not understand?

                                 CHARLES
                        Edith, let’s discuss this in the 
                        car-

                                 EDITH
                             (loudly, so everyone can 
                              hear)
                        No!  We’ll be discussing this right 
                        now.  
                             (to Laurel)
                        I’ll be back at three from my 
                        ultrasound and I expect there to be 
                        no trace of you left here. 

                                 LAUREL
                        I didn’t know, I didn’t know you 
                        were married-

                                 EDITH
                        That’s preposterous-

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I swear, I had no idea-  

           Everyone looks at Laurel like she’s crazy.  Edith starts to 
           leave but Charles stands there looking at Laurel’s devastated 
           face.
                                 CHARLES
                             (to Laurel)
                        I’m sorry.  I didn’t realize-

                                 EDITH
                             (motions for Charles to 
                              follow)
                        Charles!  

           He looks down and follows Edith like a dog.  Laurel looks 
           around and finds the whole office staring at her.

           INT. CLAUDIA’S CAR - DAY

           Laurel sits in the passenger seat crying as Claudia drives.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Audrey had to go and fuck 
                        everything up, that’s my fucking 
                        job.

           Claudia looks at her, confused.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You’ll find another job, but first  
                        I think you need to take some time 
                        off so you can start to let Laurel 
                        go-

                                 LAUREL
                        I don’t want to take time off.  I 
                        don’t want to sit around and think 
                        about how half of me is fucking 
                        dead for fucking ever.  Does that 
                        sound like fun to you?     

                                 CLAUDIA
                        No, not really.  I’m sorry.

           They ride in silence.  Claudia is scared by her outburst, 
           doesn’t know what to say or how to support her.

           EXT. DUPLEX - DAY

           As Claudia waits in the car watching, Laurel throws the box 
           of her office belongings on the porch and bangs on Basel’s 
           door, hysterical.  No one answers.
           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel paces frantically in the living room.  She’s bleary-
           eyed as she crosses to look in the full length mirror and 
           talk to herself. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Everything was going so great until 
                        you went and fucked everything up, 
                        I’m supposed to fuck it up, I’m 
                        supposed to fuck it up.  Not you!   

           Basel comes in through the cracked front door and finds 
           Laurel in a puddle of tears, talking to herself.  He puts his 
           arms around her and holds her.

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - KITCHEN - LATER

           Basel sets a cup of tea on the table in front of Laurel.  She 
           looks like shit.  They stare at the floral wallpapered wall 
           that separates their apartments.

                                 BASEL
                             (re: the wall)
                        It’s the only thing preventing us 
                        from living together.  I’ve never 
                        lived with a girl before.  

                                 LAUREL
                        You want to live with me even if I 
                        screwed my boss’ husband?

                                 BASEL
                        Well, you’re not fucking him now, 
                        right?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I never actually fucked him.

                                 BASEL
                        What?  

                                 LAUREL
                        Nothing.

                                 BASEL
                        We could just go get ice cream.

                                 LAUREL
                        Ice cream won’t fix this.  
                                 BASEL
                        Mrs. Brown, ice cream fixes 
                        everything.  

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Basel and Laurel eat ice cream cones on the curb.  She’s 
           distracted as she eats her rainbow sherbert.

                                 BASEL
                        Do you have a quarter?

           She passes him a quarter.  He puts it in a vending machine 
           and out pops a metal ring inside a plastic bubble.

                                 BASEL
                        Mrs. Brown, I know we’re already 
                        married and have two amazing kids 
                        but I was wondering if we could 
                        maybe renew our vows.  

           She looks at him in disbelief.

                                 LAUREL
                        What?!

           He gets down on one knee, she looks around to see if anyone’s 
           watching.

                                 BASEL
                        Will you marry me, Mrs. Brown?  

                                 LAUREL
                             (skeptical)
                        Are you serious?  

           He nods.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        You’re cute and all but you have 
                        the worst timing in the world-  

           He takes the ring out of the bubble and puts it on her ring 
           finger.

                                 BASEL
                        I’ve loved you since the day I met 
                        you, Audrey.  

           This is like a punch in the face to Laurel and makes her jump 
           back.
                                 LAUREL
                        But I thought you hated me then?

                                 BASEL
                        I made that story up, the one where 
                        I hated you.  I made it up because 
                        I thought I could never have 
                        someone like you.

                                 LAUREL
                        Please take it back.  Take it back! 

                                 BASEL
                        Take what back? 

                                 LAUREL
                        The part about loving me before the 
                        accident.

                                 BASEL
                        What difference does it make?

                                 LAUREL
                        I need you to love me for me, for 
                        who I am.  I need it to be my love.

                                 BASEL
                        It’s okay if you didn’t love me 
                        then-

                                 LAUREL
                        If you loved me before it means you 
                        don’t love me.  

                                 BASEL
                        Audrey, what’s wrong?  Where is 
                        this coming from?  

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m not AUDREY!

                                 BASEL
                             (confused)
                        You mean you’re Mrs. Brown?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I’m not Mrs. Brown, and I’m not 
                        Audrey.  And you’re too busy hiding 
                        in your house of make-believe to 
                        realize it. 
                                 BASEL
                        I don’t understand.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m her twin.  I’m Laurel.  

                                 BASEL
                        What?

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m Laurel.

                                 BASEL
                        If you’re Laurel, where’s Audrey?

                                 LAUREL
                        She’s dead.  

                                 BASEL
                        But everyone thinks you’re dead?
                        Why would you do that?  

                                 LAUREL
                        It should have been me; everyone 
                        wanted to believe it was me.    
                        Including you.  I’m the one who 
                        should have died.  She, she was the 
                        one, she was the one- 

           He looks at her, heartbroken.  

                                 BASEL
                        So this was all just a big lie?   

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I know how it sounds...but I’ve 
                        never been more myself with anyone 
                        else in my whole life.  For the 
                        first time, I actually want to be 
                        myself when I’m with you.  I don’t 
                        want to be anyone else.  I want 
                        this to be mine.

           He stares at her, a look of total confusion on his face, then 
           he gets up and she watches him walk away as she remains on 
           the curb, her rainbow sherbet melting down her hand.

           EXT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - DAY

           A beat-up yellow cab drops Laurel off in front of her house.  
           She knocks on the door.  Waits.
           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Frank opens the door, his hands are covered in paint.  May is 
           vacuuming but stops when she sees Laurel.  

                                 MAY
                        The wedding’s not till next week, 
                        honey.

                                 LAUREL
                        Can I come in? 

                                 MAY
                        Come in, come in!  

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Frank and May sit on the couch opposite Laurel.

                                 LAUREL
                        We made a huge mistake.
                        You guys were wrong.  At the 
                        hospital.  You were wrong-

                                 FRANK
                        Wrong about what?

                                 LAUREL
                        Who I am.  Audrey’s dead.  Audrey’s 
                        the one who died.

                                 MAY
                        What?

           They let this sink in for a moment then Frank races to her, 
           undulating waves of relief and grief on his face-

                                 FRANK
                        Porcupine, we all thought...but 
                        your hair, I don’t understand, I’ve 
                        always been able to tell you apart-

                                 LAUREL
                        We got the same haircut that day 
                        and at first I didn’t remember 
                        that, and I didn’t remember who I 
                        was and then I did remember who I 
                        was.  
                                 MAY
                        You poor child.  When did you 
                        finally remember?

                                 LAUREL
                        The morning of the funeral.

           She braces herself.

                                 MAY
                        You went to your own funeral, on 
                        purpose?

                                 LAUREL
                        Yep.

                                 MAY
                        Is this funny to you?! 

                                 LAUREL
                        No, it’s not funny to me-

           Frank stares at her in slack-jawed, utter disbelief.  May 
           gets a crazy look in her eye and looks to Frank.  

           Frank picks Laurel up off the ground in an enormous bear hug.  
           She’s surprised.  Then he pulls away from the hug and slaps 
           her hard across the face, then calmly walks out of the room.

           Laurel holds her cheek, hot with embarrassment.

           EXT. FRANK’S GARAGE STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Frank rummages through a large box of painting supplies.  
           Laurel approaches him as May stands in the background pacing.

                                 MAY
                             (pleading, desperate)
                        Frank, Frank, do something, do 
                        something-

                                 FRANK
                        I can’t find my fucking cerulean.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m sorry, Daddy-

                                 FRANK
                        Stop!  There is no excuse.  This is 
                        beyond-
                                 LAUREL
                        Everyone loves her, no one cared 
                        that I was gone-

                                 FRANK
                        How can you say that?  I care, I 
                        cared that you were gone.  You, you 
                        were my porcupine, we did 
                        everything together-

                                 LAUREL
                        I know, Daddy, but you didn’t even 
                        have anything to say-

                                 FRANK
                        Give me a goddamn break!  I was in 
                        shock for chrissakes.  I had just 
                        lost my baby girl.  Excuse me if I 
                        wasn’t Shakespeare-

                                 LAUREL
                        I just needed to know that you, 
                        that you loved me. 

                                 MAY
                        Oh my lord, we have to have another 
                        funeral.  It’s unforgivable.  What 
                        are people gonna say-

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t give a hot damn what they 
                        say.

                                 MAY
                        Well don’t get all snippy with me, 
                        I’m not the one-

                                 FRANK
                        Can you two just leave me be for a 
                        moment?

                                 MAY
                        Well, I never!

           May grabs a glass jar full of dirty paint water and throws it 
           at Frank’s head and quickly runs away.  Frank ducks just in 
           time and it smashes on the wall behind him.  Frank and Laurel 
           are stunned in her wake.

                                 LAUREL
                        Wow.  I think she’s mad.
           He gives her an admonishing look and gets up to leave.  She 
           watches him walk away.  She crosses to the shards of glass 
           and starts to pick them up.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        That went well.

           INT. LAUREL & AUDREY’S ROOM - DAY

           Laurel returns to her room, everything looks exactly how she 
           left it.  She sits on her bed and looks around devastated and 
           unsure of what to do with herself.

           INT. MOM N’ POP GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Laurel stands in line.  The double-chinned, gum-chewing 
           CHECKER (late 50’s) glares at her as she rings her up.  
           PEOPLE in the store point and stare at Laurel.

                                 LAUREL
                        If y’all have something to say to 
                        me go ahead and say it.

           No one says anything, they just look away.

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

           Laurel paints another nighttime pool painting.  She looks out 
           her window and can see Frank painting a Van Gogh self-
           portrait outside his studio.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Laurel watches, amazed as Frank cracks an ice cube tray over 
           his glass.  They eat in silence at opposite ends of the 
           table, both of them in a pathetic state.

                                 LAUREL
                        Daddy?

           He doesn’t answer.

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Daddy?!  

           He looks at her but doesn’t say anything and stands up and 
           takes his plate to the kitchen.  She follows him.
           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Frank cleans his plate at the sink as Laurel enters.

                                 LAUREL
                        I’ll do that.

                                 FRANK
                        I got it.

                                 LAUREL
                        But I always do the dishes.

                                 FRANK
                        But I been doin’ them since you 
                        left.  ‘Bout time.  

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, okay.

           She starts to leave the room, feeling dejected, useless.  She 
           watches for a moment as he cleans the dishes. 

                                 LAUREL
                        What can I do to stop you from 
                        hating me?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know when I’m gonna find it 
                        in my heart to forgive you on this, 
                        porc.  I’m glad you’re back and all 
                        but...now here I am mourning a 
                        whole other child and goddamnit if 
                        it’s not confusing as all hell.

                                 LAUREL
                        I understand.

                                 FRANK
                        Nah, I don’t think you do.  You’re 
                        not a widower, you don’t have no 
                        children.  You have no idea what 
                        I’ve been dealin’ with here.

           He goes back to washing dishes.

                                 LAUREL
                        But I want to, I want to know.  

           He pauses.
                                 FRANK
                        If there’s anything I took from 
                        your being dead, it’s that I wished 
                        you’d stopped worrying ‘bout me so 
                        much and got on with your life.  
                        You need to start worrying ‘bout 
                        what you’re dealing with.

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Laurel sits in front of her open closet, looking at her Mom’s 
           dresses.  They sway as if there’s a breeze in the room; the 
           sequined dresses sparkle in the moonlight.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Laurel applies brown hair dye in the mirror.

           Laurel finishes blow drying her freshly dyed brown hair, she 
           gives her reflection a little smile.

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           Laurel, Frank and May walk toward the mourners gathered 
           around Audrey’s gravestone.  Laurel faces the stares and 
           whispers of funeral goers as she approaches; their attitudes 
           range from awe, to disbelief, to total condemnation.  

           Claudia, Hunter, and his family are there in addition to all 
           the mourners that came to the first funeral.  It’s presided 
           by the same priest.  Everyone bows their heads in a moment of 
           silence.  

           Suddenly all the faces are on Laurel and she looks down, not 
           able to meet their stares.  

                                 LAUREL
                        This is a certifiably weird place 
                        I’ve put everyone in, huh?  Nothing 
                        I say really matters; you’re still 
                        going to think something’s wrong 
                        with me, and you’d be right.  So 
                        I’ll just say this:  Audrey was 
                        everything to me.  She was the much 
                        bigger half of our whole.  And I 
                        couldn’t let her go.
           EXT. CEMETARY - LATER

           Everyone leaves the grave site and walks towards their cars.  
           Laurel and Frank walk together.  

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A repeat event, all the funeral goers are at their house 
           again.  Laurel sits by herself on the couch, watching 
           everyone mingle.  Hunter taps her on her shoulder. 

                                 HUNTER
                        Hey, um, that was pretty cool, all 
                        that stuff you said back there.    

                                 LAUREL
                        Thanks.

                                 HUNTER
                        Your hair looks cool.

           Hunter notices what Basel wrote on Laurel’s cast.

                                 HUNTER (CONT’D)
                        Who wrote “I hate you” on your 
                        cast?

                                 LAUREL
                        This guy.

                                 HUNTER
                        Do you think you might want to go 
                        up to your room and talk?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, I don’t think that would be 
                        appropriate.  

                                 HUNTER
                        Yeah, you’re probably right.

           Hunter’s Mom spots them talking.

                                 HUNTER’S MOM
                        Hunter!

           He gets up from the couch and looks Claudia up and down as he 
           walks to his mother, who grabs his arm and chastises him. 
           Claudia comes up to Laurel with a party plate with some 
           chocolate cake. 
                                 CLAUDIA
                        At least the cake is good.  Wanna 
                        give me the official tour?

           INT. LAUREL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Claudia and Laurel enter the room.

                                 LAUREL
                        And this is our room.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        The children’s quarters, how 
                        quaint.

           Claudia walks the perimeter of the room looking at the 
           memorabilia of the twins’ shared childhood.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                             (mock real estate voice)
                        The room has such a lovely spirit, 
                        a real old-timey je ne sais quoi.

           Claudia opens the closet and admires the vintage dresses, 
           running her hand across them as Laurel sometimes does.

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (re: the dresses)
                        Are these yours? 

                                 LAUREL
                        No, they were our Mom’s.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        They’re beautiful.

           Claudia starts to cry as she grasps an armful of the hanging 
           dresses as if she’s hugging a person.  Laurel walks over to 
           her and puts her hand on her shoulder.  Claudia turns and 
           buries her head in Laurel’s chest and Laurel embraces her.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You’re a real asshole, you know? 

                                 LAUREL
                        I know.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Do you know who you really remind 
                        me of?
                                 LAUREL
                        Do you know who you really remind 
                        me of?

                          CLAUDIA
                                                         LAUREL
           Audrey.
                                              Audrey.

           They laugh together.  Laurel sits underneath the hanging 
           dresses in the closet, Claudia joins her.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I thought I was going crazy back 
                        there; I knew it wasn’t her.    

                                 LAUREL
                        I know.  You more than anyone.  You 
                        must have really loved her.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Yeah.  I worshipped her.  I wanted 
                        to be strong like her.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I guess we have more in common than 
                        we thought. 

           Claudia reaches her hand out towards Laurel’s face.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Can I?

           Laurel closes her eyes as Claudia touches her face feeling 
           its shape.  Claudia pulls her hand away.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You’ve got some major balls to do 
                        that.

                                 LAUREL
                        Yep.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        So are you staying here?

                                 LAUREL
                        No.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        This isn’t exactly the abode of a 
                        woman in her thirties.
                                 LAUREL
                        Well done captain obvious.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I’m just sayin’.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m coming back to the city, and 
                        think it’s best if we remain 
                        friends despite our past 
                        disagreements.  

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I agree.

                                 LAUREL
                        Good.

           INT. LAUREL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           Laurel, Frank and May clean up from the party.  Frank stops 
           May, grabs her from behind and gives her a sweet kiss.  
           Laurel gives a small sad smile as she stuffs trash in a trash 
           bag. 

           INT. LAUREL BEDROOM - DAY

           Laurel takes the bulletin board with the “Participant” ribbon 
           off the wall and hangs one of her “Night Swim” paintings in 
           its place.  She looks down at her cast where it says “I hate 
           you, hate, Basel” and buries her head in her arms.   

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                             (re: the night swim 
                              painting)
                        Nice.

           Laurel whips her head up, finds Frank in the doorway.  Frank 
           goes up to the painting and inspects it closely.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Good technique, beautiful palette.  
                        You got more?

           She nods.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You should show ‘em.
                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah, I was thinking of taking them 
                        around.

                                 FRANK
                        ‘Bout time you did your own work.  

                                 LAUREL
                        I always tried to do a good job for 
                        you, Daddy-

                                 FRANK
                        Just because you’re not good at 
                        copying doesn’t mean you’re not a 
                        good painter.  Now me, I’m a 
                        craftsman, I can make something 
                        look like something else but that’s 
                        about the limit of my abilities.  
                        But you, you could never keep your 
                        little flourishes from sneaking in.  
                        Cause porcupine, you’re a true 
                        original. You’re not Audrey, you’re 
                        not your mother, you’re you. 

           Laurel takes this in.  It’s the greatest thing he’s ever said 
           to her.

           INT. SMALL TOWN CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Laurel enters the store and approaches the plump STORE OWNER 
           (late 60’s).  The store is full-on decorated for Halloween: 
           spiderwebs, jack-o-lanterns, skeletons, etc.

                                 LAUREL
                        My twin sister was in here a while 
                        ago and bought a dress.  It was red 
                        with polka dots, do you, by any 
                        chance, still have it?

                                 STORE OWNER
                        I believe I do.

           INT. SMALL TOWN CLOTHING STORE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Laurel tries on the RED DRESS and admires herself in the 
           mirror.  
           INT. SMALL TOWN CLOTHING STORE - MOMENTS LATER 

           The Store Owner rings Laurel up.  Laurel still wears the 
           dress but also buys a stack of other clothes.  She starts to 
           rip the tag off the dress.

                                 STORE OWNER
                        Let me get it.

           She cuts the tag off for Laurel, and starts to ring her up.

                                 STORE OWNER 
                        So doll, you got your costume?

                                 LAUREL
                        No, this is just a regular dress.

           The Store Owner laughs.

                                 STORE OWNER
                        No, for Halloween.

                                 LAUREL
                        Oh, no.  No.  

                                 STORE OWNER
                        Better get on it, you only got a 
                        couple of days.  Sather’s has some 
                        stuff on sale but it’s all that 
                        ‘Made in China’ crap, not like the 
                        homemade ones we used to make for 
                        the kids.  I’m gonna be a pumpkin 
                        again, I guess.  Cause I got the 
                        figure for it. 

           The lady grabs her ‘pumpkin-like’ spare tire, smiles.  Laurel 
           smiles back.

                                 STORE OWNER
                        So, you the girl everyone’s talkin’ 
                        about?

           Laurel nods.

                                 STORE OWNER (CONT’D)
                        I always wished my sister woulda 
                        come back.  Took me close to a year 
                        before I really believed she 
                        wouldn’t.

           The lady touches Laurel on the hand, tenderly.
                                 LAUREL
                        Thank you.

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           Laurel wears the red dress as she sets flowers on Audrey’s 
           grave and lies down on the grass in front of it so that the 
           gravestone looks like a head board.

                                 LAUREL
                        Dad’s getting married today.  
                             (pause)
                        I wish you and Mama could be here.
                             (laughs)
                        Well, I guess that wouldn’t be such 
                        a good idea if Mom was here.  
                             (pause)
                        So, I’m in love.  With a real live 
                        grown-up who laughs at my jokes 
                        like you did.  I know you didn’t 
                        really like him so maybe this is an 
                        instance where it’s good you’re 
                        dead.  I didn’t mean that.  There’s 
                        no instance where it’s good you’re 
                        dead.  I just hope he can forgive 
                        me.  

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Laurel, surrounded by moving boxes, looks in the rear-view 
           mirror as she watches Frank and May’s “Just Married” truck 
           disappear into the night in the opposite direction, empty 
           cans tied to the bumper, clanging along the asphalt behind. 

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Laurel drives through their town: past the hair salon, the 
           dress shop, and through the intersection of the accident.

           EXT. DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Laurel arrives back at Audrey’s place.

           INT. AUDREY’S DUPLEX - NIGHT

           Laurel unpacks a box of things from her room: ceramic horses, 
           vintage dolls, old books.
           EXT. DUPLEX - DAY

           It’s Halloween and kids are roaming the neighborhood.  THREE 
           COSTUMED KIDS run from Basel’s door, holding their candy 
           loot. 

           EXT. DUPLEX - DAY

           Laurel rings Basel’s doorbell.  He howls as he answers the 
           door wearing a wolf mask then stops when he realizes it’s her 
           and slams the door shut.  

                                 LAUREL
                        No, wait!

           INT. BASEL’S DUPLEX / EXT. DUPLEX - PORCH 

           Basel looks out the peep hole.  He stares at Laurel’s fish-
           eyed forehead.  

                                 BASEL
                        What do you want?  

                                 LAUREL
                        You.  I want you, please.  May I 
                        please have you?

                                 BASEL
                        You think I’m that easy?  

           She laughs.

                                 LAUREL
                        No.  I know you’re not that easy.  

           Another GROUP OF COSTUMED KIDS come up the porch.  

                                 LAUREL
                             (to the kids)
                        Hey, sup?

           Basel answers in his wolf mask.

                                 KIDS
                        Trick or treat!

           They grab handfuls of candy as he takes off his mask and 
           glares at Laurel.  The kids promptly run away.  
                                 BASEL
                        So, who are you dressed as?

                                 LAUREL
                        Myself.  

                                 BASEL
                        So this is what Laurel looks like?

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah, this is what I look like.
                             (beat)
                        I told everyone at home about the 
                        whole, you know, identity thing.

                                 BASEL
                        How’d that go?

                                 LAUREL
                        I’m still alive.  

                                 BASEL
                        Yes, you seem to be but you never 
                        know with the two of you.

           She laughs.

                                 LAUREL
                        So, um, I know I messed up and that 
                        I’m a fucked up kind of person but 
                        despite all that-

                                 BASEL
                        Yeah?

                                 LAUREL
                        Despite all that, all in all I 
                        think I’m like a pretty cool girl.

                                 BASEL
                        Nice work complimenting yourself.

                                 LAUREL
                        Thanks.  I want you to know why I-

                                 BASEL
                        I understand why you did it.  

                                 LAUREL
                             (surprised)
                        You do?
                                 BASEL
                        I wish I fucking didn’t, but I do.  
                        Pretending to be someone you’re not 
                        is a lot fucking easier than being 
                        yourself, I’ve done it my whole 
                        life.

                                 LAUREL
                        My cast comes off tomorrow, you’ve 
                        never seen this glorious forearm 
                        before. 

                                 BASEL
                        It’s probably all atrophied and 
                        will never be as muscular as your 
                        other one.

                                 LAUREL
                        Gee, thanks.

                                 BASEL
                        So did you like inherit the duplex 
                        or what?

                                 LAUREL
                        Yeah.  And I was thinking of doing 
                        some construction.

                                 BASEL
                        Like what?

                                 LAUREL
                        Tear down the wall between the two 
                        apartments.  Make it one.

                                 BASEL
                        Oh yeah?

                                 LAUREL
                        Then maybe we could add a second 
                        story.

           Basel puts his wolf mask back on and rests his head on her 
           shoulder and together they watch the candy-high neighborhood 
           kids run from house to house on their favorite night of the 
           year.

           THE END
