           FADE IN:

           INT. LABORATORY - DAY

           It’s dark in here.

           In the shadows of this small, but well appointed lab we meet 
           ROBERT BLOCK, 41, who, even when COVERED IN BLOOD, still has 
           an air of scientific genius about him. 

           Maybe it’s the clinical way he’s pouring gasoline from a 12 
           gallon can. Making sure he hits all the corners. Making sure 
           that when he strikes the match, the entire place incinerates 
           much like the tinderbox of which he now calls his life.

           He looks toward the door and drizzling gas behind him, heads 
           upstairs.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           It’s brighter up here, but not by much. The house is early 
           19th century with modern touches. Robert splashes gas along 
           the walls, walking backward toward the foyer.

           He’s careful where he steps and turns the corner into his --

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           He methodically splashes gas for maximum burn. Suddenly,

           A SHADOW PASSES, crossing his path, but only briefly.

           Robert turns. Nothing. A trick of the light combined with his 
           own exhaustion.

           He continues splashing the gas over his once beautiful 
           furniture.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           CLOSE ON - Robert staring down at...

           The GASOLINE spreads across the hardwood floor and meets a 
           thick PUDDLE OF BLOOD. The blood begins to mix with the 
           gasoline creating a grim kaleidoscope.

           We follow Robert’s slowly moving gaze, tracking the mixture 
           of blood and gasoline until we fall on...
           CLOSE ON - A CORPSE, face down, A BASEBALL TROPHY IMPALED 
           THROUGH THE BACK OF ITS SKULL.

           It’s unclear if it’s a man or woman. There’s too much blood 
           and the hair is all matted.

           Again, the SHADOW FLICKERS against shards of broken glass and 
           the wood floors CREAKS nearby. But Robert has only one 
           directive at this point. He plants his foot on the back of 
           the CORPSE’S NECK and --

           PULLS THE TROPHY FREE with a sticky THUCK!!!

           Robert holds the trophy up. HE WIPES SOME OF THE GORE FROM 
           THE SMALL MAN HOLDING THE BAT and carefully places it back on 
           what remains of a demolished trophy case.

           Next to the replaced trophy is a TEAM PHOTO. We move in 
           slowly on the photo, into ONE BOY’S FACE, slowly, until we 
           are TIGHT ON HIS EYES and we stay there for a moment...

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           CLOSE ON - THOSE SAME EYES, but when we pull out, the 
           photograph is of A PERFECT BABY BOY. Over this image we hear 
           the voice of Robert Block. There’s a sureness to his words, a 
           confidence that suggests he understands deeply what he’s 
           talking about.

                                 ROBERT (V.O.)
                        They say beauty is only skin deep.

           The stillness of the boy’s flushed cheeks. Full lips and 
           perfectly new hair.

                                 ROBERT (V.O.)
                        But here, we sell the idea that 
                        beauty can translate into altruism.

           The clear blue eyes. Starbursts of sunlight floating spectral 
           like behind his beaming toothless smile.

                                 ROBERT (V.O.)
                        Still that’s all it is. An idea.

           Robert, a different entity from the beaten, dragged down, 
           blood covered guy we just met, sits at his desk, perfectly 
           studious in his laboratory whites. The photo we’ve been 
           looking at...a screen saver on his laptop. A keystroke 
           extinguishes it from the screen and Robert types some data 
           into a spreadsheet. He rolls on his chair, ACROSS THIS VERY 
           HIGH TECH R&D LABORATORY to,
           A STRING OF CAGES all containing RATS. Robert stops at CAGE 
           #R&D 18. A big female, clearly pregnant, sniffs lazily around 
           the cage. Robert speaks to her as if she’s a colleague. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Can looking younger make us better 
                        people? Or is that all an illusion? 
                        Thoughts, Gracie?

           The rat, Gracie, sniffs the air in Robert’s direction. She 
           couldn’t give a shit what he has to say.

                                 ROBERT
                        Well, if this works then you’re 
                        going to be the prettiest rat the 
                        world has ever seen. But will it 
                        make you any nicer?

           He reaches into the cage and Gracie tries to bite him. Still, 
           Robert grabs her without incident. 

           Under her EAR an IMPLANT extends directly into her brain. 
           Robert connects the implant to an intravenous tube and 
           administers...

           A DOSE OF A VISCOUS FLUID labeled - ARGENTUM “A” TRIALS.

           He places Gracie, lovingly, back in her cage.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE COSMETICS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The hub of a cosmetics giant. Laurant DeMonde caters to all 
           things beautiful.

           Robert sits amongst several colleagues. He’s scribbling in a 
           small notebook. Something tells us that he works better with 
           rats than he does with people.

           HAILEY DEMONDE, 28 and strikingly gorgeous, leads the 
           meeting.

                                 HAILEY
                        Robert.

           Robert looks up.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m sorry?

                                 HAILEY
                        I asked how it was going with 
                        Argentum.
                                 ROBERT
                        Too soon to tell.

           He goes back to his scribbling.

                                 HAILEY
                        Excuse me?

           He looks up.

                                 ROBERT
                        These meetings are really just an 
                        extraordinary waste of time for me, 
                        Ms. DeMonde.

                                 HAILEY
                        These meetings are a necessary evil 
                        to prevent our investors from 
                        upending this company through a 
                        proxy vote. So if you wouldn’t mind 
                        giving a real update from R&D 
                        instead of scribbling your life 
                        away.

           Robert turns the notebook for everyone to see. A molecular 
           stew of drawings.

                                 ROBERT
                        This...scribble...represents the 
                        molecular breakdown of a protein 
                        that will be the difference between 
                        treating a grandma and watching her 
                        face melt off into a puddle of 
                        liquefied flesh or witnessing the 
                        miracle of agelessness.
                             (beat)
                        So, when I say it’s too soon to 
                        tell, I mean it. Argentum is only 
                        in rat trials. And we just got 
                        there. I mean just got there. That 
                        being the case, I guess you need to 
                        tell your proxy voters to hold 
                        their horses...they do all have 
                        horses, don’t they?

           Robert turns back to his drawings. Hailey stares at him 
           hatefully.

           She sits back down next to DeMonde’s CFO, RICK NATALE, 45 and 
           ruggedly charismatic. Whispers to him...

                                 HAILEY
                        Why can’t we fire him?
                                 RICK
                        Because he’s a genius.

                                 HAILEY
                        Fuck.

           Rick leans forward.

                                 RICK
                        Alright, thank you everybody.

           The employees gather their things and get up. Robert pushes 
           away from the table.

                                 RICK
                        Bob? Quick chat?

           Robert rolls his eyes.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Rick and Robert stroll past framed GLOSSY PHOTOS that display 
           DeMonde’s rich history of making women beautiful. The decor 
           is modern minimalism at its most cliche.

                                 RICK
                        Can you try to not be such an 
                        asshole? I have to answer to that 
                        woman everyday about why not to 
                        fire you.

                                 ROBERT
                        Let her fire me, then. I’ll make 
                        some other spackle merchant a cool 
                        trillion.

           Rick rubs his eyes. This is a pointless conversation.

                                 RICK
                        You weren’t this impossible before 
                        Lainey.

                                 ROBERT
                        Yeah, well, Lainey destroyed my 
                        faith in humanity. So, now I’m 
                        impossible.

                                 RICK
                        You hear from her?

                                 ROBERT
                        That would be counterproductive to 
                        doing a silent meditation retreat.
                                 RICK
                        Seriously?

                                 ROBERT
                        Apparently my nonsense drove her to 
                        seek out a wordless existence.

                                 RICK
                        That’s really depressing.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re telling me.

                                 RICK
                        How’s Derrick taking it?

                                 ROBERT
                        Put it this way, Lainey traveled 
                        halfway around the world for peace 
                        and quiet when my house could be 
                        the silent meditation retreat. It’s 
                        always the mother who gets the 
                        wings in these situations. I work 
                        twenty four/seven and she’s the 
                        good guy.

                                 RICK
                        He’ll come around. They key is you 
                        gotta give him everything he wants. 
                        That’s how I get my kids to like me 
                        better than their mother.
                             (beat)
                        So when can we check out Argentum?

           They get to an elevator. Robert hit the down button.

                                 ROBERT
                        Soon. Maybe this year.

                                 RICK
                        Don’t fuck with me.

           The elevator doors open and Robert steps in. He just smiles 
           at Rick as the doors close.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Robert enters. GAIL, 28, all business research assistant, 
           stands up from in front of Gracie’s cage.

                                 GAIL
                        Our little girl is all grown up.
           Robert approaches.

                                 ROBERT
                        Gracie gave birth?

                                 GAIL
                        Twelve tiny miracles.

           Robert looks in on the cage. GRACIE cuddles as cute as a rat 
           could with her TWELVE miniscule offspring.

                                 ROBERT
                        Excellent. Let’s do hourly updates. 
                        I want to see if Argentum has any 
                        effect on that baby weight. And 
                        lets track her milk production. If 
                        it gets low bring in the big guns.

                                 GAIL
                        Mama Jamma?

           CLOSE ON - In another cage, a big, fat, rat feeding several 
           babies.

                                 ROBERT
                        She could feed a rat army.

           Robert looks at his watch.

                                 GAIL
                        Derrick?

                                 ROBERT
                        Yep. I’ll see you tomorrow.

           Robert grabs his bag and walks out.

           EXT. MONROE HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

           Robert pulls his Porsche Carrera into the school parking lot. 
           It’s pretty empty.

           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - DUSK

           He spots DERRICK, 16, handsome, fit and athletic, wearing a 
           baseball uniform, making out with a CHEERLEADER near the gym 
           entrance.

           Robert waits impatiently for the pawfest to chill out, but it 
           doesn’t look like it’s ever going to end. Finally, HE LAYS ON 
           THE HORN.
           Derrick, cooly, holds his hand up, “WAIT!”, and gives the 
           cheerleader a final tongue lashing. Derrick pulls away and 
           the cheerleader, SAMANTHA, 17, oh so hot, waves.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hi, Mr. Block.

           Robert delivers a weak wave as Derrick smoothly jogs over to 
           the car and gets in.

                                 DERRICK
                        Alright.

           He whips out his phone and texts...

                                 ROBERT
                        What are you doing?

                                 DERRICK
                        Texting Samantha.

           Robert notices her look at her phone. She looks up and 
           smiles.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I LOVE YOU TOO!!!

           Robert just rolls his eyes and eases out of the parking lot.

           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - NIGHT

           Robert takes easy turns as Derrick busily texts away on his 
           phone.

                                 DERRICK
                        You drive this animal like a nerd, 
                        dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        I am a nerd.

                                 DERRICK
                        Yeah, but with a Porsche.

                                 ROBERT
                        Which makes me a cliche.

           They pull into a long driveway that leads, at the end, to a 
           quaint FARMHOUSE with very modern amenities.

                                 ROBERT
                        Besides, with all your texting, I 
                        didn’t think you’d notice.
                                 DERRICK
                        I’m a varsity short stop. I notice 
                        everything.

           Robert parks.

                                 ROBERT
                        What do you want for dinner?

           Derrick is out of the car...

                                 DERRICK
                        I already ate.

           ...and slams the door in his father’s face. Not much respect 
           going on here.

           Robert gets out of the car and makes the walk to his front 
           door. He’s about to open it when...

           A BARKING DOG, a mutt, around 35 lbs., startles him.

                                 ROBERT
                        Go home.

           The dog growls at Robert.

                                 ROBERT
                        I swear, one day...

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Outside, the dog continues RANTING while Robert walks past a 
           TROPHY CASE filled with baseball trophies that dominates the 
           hallway. 

           He puts down his bag and wanders into the -- 

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Robert sinks into an Eames Chair and rubs his tired eyes.

           A shining diamond deep in the rural backwoods of Northern New 
           Jersey.
           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Robert stands over Gracie’s cage. The look on his face is one 
           of disgust.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you sure they didn’t escape?

           Gail actually seems emotional.

                                 GAIL
                        They weren’t even ambulatory.

                                 ROBERT
                        There’s no blood.

                                 GAIL
                        There’s no nothing.

           ON GRACIE - Looking good for a rat. She’s alone in her cage. 
           No sign of her twelve offspring. She sniffs the air 
           innocently.

           Robert kneels to her level.

                                 ROBERT
                        You sick, twisted bitch.

           Gracie licks her chops. Robert straightens up.

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t know how it’s even possible 
                        for an animal her size to 
                        completely devour twelve newborns. 
                        That’s over half her body weight.
                             (beat)
                        Has she had a bowel movement yet?

                                 GAIL
                        No. And I’m not looking forward to 
                        seeing what comes out.

                                 ROBERT
                        Let’s weigh her.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Gracie is placed on a scale. She seems oddly docile.

                                 GAIL
                        She weighs less than before she was 
                        pregnant.
                                 ROBERT
                        And what’s the status on her milk 
                        supply.

                                 GAIL
                        What milk supply?

           Robert turns to Gail.

                                 ROBERT
                        This is an excellent sign.

                                 GAIL
                        I know. It’s reversing the aging 
                        process.

                                 ROBERT
                        More like eradicating it.

           Gail picks up Gracie and puts her back in her cage.

                                 GAIL
                        When should we introduce her into 
                        general population?

           Robert looks at the other rats in their respective cages.

                                 ROBERT
                        Let’s give her a few days under 
                        observation. If she’s tracking 
                        well, we’ll jump into the 
                        behaviorals.

           EXT. LAURANT DEMONDE - OUTDOOR CAFETERIA - DAY

           Robert is eating alone. Rick sits with him.

                                 RICK
                        You mind?

                                 ROBERT
                        Join me.

                                 RICK
                        I heard you had some progress with 
                        Gracie.

           Robert digs into his lunch. Social awkwardness works to his 
           advantage.

                                 ROBERT
                        Where’d you hear that?
                                 RICK
                        I gave Gail a raise.

                                 ROBERT
                        You are a sneaky sumbitch, aren’t 
                        you? 

           Rick can only deliver a shit eating grin.

                                 ROBERT
                        We’re seeing some early effects 
                        that seem promising.

                                 RICK
                        Human trials?

                                 ROBERT
                        Let’s first see if the rat dies.

                                 RICK
                        I thought Gracie was your pride and 
                        joy. You talk about her as if she 
                        doesn’t matter.

                                 ROBERT
                        Never get too close to the ones you 
                        love. They’re bound to disappoint.

           Gail follows Robert to his car.

                                 ROBERT
                        You don’t have to be here all 
                        night.

                                 GAIL
                        I just want to monitor Gracie for a 
                        few more hours.
                             (beat)
                        Robert, this is very exciting.

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s big.

           He opens the door to his Porsche. Throws his stuff on the 
           passenger seat.

                                 ROBERT
                        Now I get to be berated by my 
                        ungrateful son. Spend the day 
                        inventing agelessness and go home 
                        to thanklessness.
                                 GAIL
                        Life is so unfair.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re preaching to the choir.

           He gets in the car, revs the engine and takes off. Gail heads 
           back inside.

           INT. MONROE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           It’s dark and empty. We hear voices drifting from the locker 
           rooms.

           We follow.

           INT. GIRLS LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Derrick, Samantha and another couple, HARRISON, 17, and LYNN, 
           15, are all half naked and drunk, playing strip poker. A 
           solid after practice party gone sexily awry.

           Samantha throws down a full house.

                                 SAMANTHA
                             (to Harrison)
                        Boxers, bitch.

           Harrison looks at her with faux concern.

                                 HARRISON
                        You’re sure you’re ready for it? 
                        Derrick, you might want your 
                        girlfriend to reconsider because 
                        once she catches a gander of the 
                        python she’ll be shouting my name 
                        every time you bone down.

           Derrick shoots a shot of cheap whiskey.

                                 DERRICK
                        I’m not too worried.

                                 HARRISON
                        Alright then...

           Harrison stands up, starts stripping off his boxers. They 
           come off.

           On Samantha...
                                 SAMANTHA
                        What is that? It’s not that cold in 
                        here, is it?

           Lynn cracks up.

                                 LYNN
                        C’mon, Harry, you’re supposed to 
                        represent.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I really expected...more?

                                 HARRISON
                        Shut up and deal.

           He sits back down on his naked ass.

                                 HARRISON
                        And no cheating. I want to see 
                        those love pillows once and for 
                        all.

           A cell phone PINGS. Derrick reaches for his pants. Harrison 
           checks out his cards.

                                 HARRISON
                        Oh, yeah. That bra is coming off.

           Derrick checks his phone.

                                 DERRICK
                        Oh, shit, my dad is outside.

                                 HARRISON
                        Fuck you, Derrick.

           Derrick starts putting on his pants.

                                 DERRICK
                        Party’s over, douches.

           Samantha starts to put on her shirt.

                                 HARRISON
                        No. No way.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You heard the man.

           Harrison throws down his cards.

                                 HARRISON
                        I had straight flush. Dealt.
           Derrick looks at Samantha.

                                 DERRICK
                        He had a straight flush, baby.

           Samantha takes a beat.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Fine.

           She pulls down her bra and flashes Harrison her tits. He 
           stares in wonder.

                                 HARRISON
                        Those are awesome...

           And Lynn smacks him upside the head.

           EXT. MONROE HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Derrick, Samantha, Harrison and Lynn all walk toward the 
           lonely Porsche in the parking lot.

           Harrison is still going off.

                                 HARRISON
                        I wasn’t saying that hers are 
                        better than yours.

                                 LYNN
                        We need a non partial opinion.

                                 HARRISON
                        Bitches be sensitive.

                                 LYNN
                        Did you just actually say that? 
                        We’ll get Derrick’s dad to judge.

           Derrick laughs at that.

                                 DERRICK
                        Unless it’s a rodent with c-cups I 
                        don’t think my old man’ll have much 
                        interest.

           They get to the car and Derrick opens the door.

                                 DERRICK
                        Hey, Dad.

           Robert signals for him to get in the car.
                                 ROBERT
                        We’ve got to go. I still have work 
                        to wrap up at home.

                                 DERRICK
                        Hey, Dad, can we give these guys a 
                        ride back to our house?

                                 ROBERT
                        How are they going to get home?

                                 HARRISON
                        My Mom’ll come pick us up later. No 
                        probs.

           Robert thinks about it. Somewhere is Rick’s voice telling him 
           to bend over backward for his kid.

                                 ROBERT
                        Sure. We’ll have to put the roof 
                        down to fit you kids in the back.

           Robert starts putting roof down.

                                 DERRICK
                        Dad. Can I drive?

           Derrick nods toward Samantha.

                                 DERRICK
                        Please.

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s dark.

                                 DERRICK
                        I know, but I’m with you. C’mon. It 
                        would be doing me a solid.

           Robert hesitates.

                                 ROBERT
                        There are reasons that a learner’s 
                        permit doesn’t allow you to drive 
                        at night.

                                 DERRICK
                        C’mon. Please. I mean, I get it if 
                        you say no, but...

                                 ROBERT
                        Forget it. Just be careful.
           EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

           Samantha, Harrison and Lynn are squeezed in the back seat as 
           Derrick deftly handles the Porsche down a winding road.

           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - NIGHT

           Robert watches Derrick with slight concern, but is actually 
           loosening up in the presence of these kids, so alive and 
           vital.

                                 LYNN
                        This car is amazing.

           Robert turns around. The look on her face is pure joy. 
           Harrison winks at him.

                                 HARRISON
                        I don’t care what they say about 
                        old dudes and fast cars, Mr. Block. 
                        This ride is the tits.

           Robert winces at Harrison’s forwardness, but goes with it.

                                 ROBERT
                        Thanks. I think.

           Samantha leans forward and gives Derrick a kiss on the cheek.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You’re so Bourne.

           Derrick looks in the rearview at his laughing, ecstatic crew 
           and then sees --

           A LOOK OF HORROR ON HARRISON’S FACE.

           He turns back to the road just as --

           A DEER, dead center, is frozen in the headlights.

           INT./EXT. ROBERT’S CAR - NIGHT

           Derrick tries to swerve. Everyone screams. The DEER barely 
           twitches.

           The handling on the Porsche is clutch as it FISHTAILS around 
           the DEER into the oncoming lane.

                                 HARRISON
                        NICE DRIVING, SLICK.
           Robert looks back as...

           THE DEER bounds off into the woods, but is suddenly 
           ILLUMINATED.

           He turns back around. A MINI-VAN in the oncoming lane turns 
           the corner and -- 

           SLAMS HEAD ON INTO THE PORSCHE.

           The DRIVER of the Mini-Van punches through the windshield --

           LYNN is also jettisoned from her seat and the two meet 
           midair...

           SMASHING FACE FIRST INTO EACH OTHER in an explosive spray of 
           blood and spine.

           The Mini-Van launches over the hood of the Porsche, and a 
           sharp braid of twisted metal...

           HOOKS HARRISON through the chest, tearing him out of his seat 
           and as the Mini-Van flips, and WHIPS HARRISON through the 
           night air, saving his rib cage as a grim souvenir.

           And then as time catches up to the collision, the Porsche 
           flips, almost gaining momentum as it skids off the road like 
           a skipping stone.

           Robert looks over at Derrick as the SEATBELT slices through 
           his neck and ARTERIAL SPRAY is caught in a moment of anti-
           gravity, frozen like raindrops in a snow globe.

           The Porsche flips again, now tail over nose, and SAMANTHA is 
           catapulted from the back seat into the trees, right before 
           the car DROPS onto its top and spins lazily to a silent 
           finish.

           There’s not a single sound, just the steady heartbeat of a 
           fickle brakelight...and then that goes dark.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Pandemonium. Too bright lights. Doctors shouting orders. 
           Nurses barking back.

           Robert is being wheeled through the small country hospital 
           EMERGENCY ROOM. He can only see peripherally, immobilized by 
           the paralyzing spinal brace keeping his neck in traction.

           To his left, SAMANTHA, a web of deep cuts crisscrossing her 
           face, is wheeled through, tubes jutting out of her nose and 
           throat. A respirator thumping next to her...
           A woman, this is Sam’s mother ELIZABETH, 39, is running next 
           to her.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Is she going to be okay? Can you 
                        help my little girl?

           She’s wheeled past. And Robert’s SPUN, putting him to face 
           DERRICK, laying unattended on a gurney, and staring at the 
           ceiling. 

           And then Derrick’s head FLOPS to its side. Half his face is 
           torn off, left on the road. He stares at Robert with dead 
           eyes.

           ROBERT SCREAMS.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Robert SITS UP IN BED, SCREAMING.

           A NURSE runs in. She puts her hands on his shoulders and gets 
           him to lay back down.

                                 ROBERT
                        My son.

           The Nurse puts her hand on his head. Strokes his hair.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m terribly sorry.

           He eases back, tears streaming down his face.

                                 ROBERT
                        Anyone else?

                                 NURSE
                        Only you and the girl, Samantha 
                        Leach. But she’s critical.

           Robert closes his eyes. Washed over by anguish, he falls back 
           to sleep.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Robert wakes up. Painfully, he gets out of bed. Miraculously, 
           there’s nothing very wrong with him except for the massive 
           concussion he’s about to experience as he...
           ...puts his feet to the floor and the room SPINS like a 
           carnival top. Robert sways and goes crashing into his side 
           dresser.

           But he finds his feet and manages to stumble to the door. He 
           opens it.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Empty except for Robert. He stalks painstakingly toward the 
           elevators. The desperation on his face is palpable. He 
           clearly has a goal in mind.

           A NIGHT NURSE turns the corner and Robert ducks into the 
           stairwell.

           INT. HOSPITAL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           It’s much brighter in here. The bruises on Robert’s face and 
           body are so much more pronounced. As the Nurse passes the 
           door, he looks down the stairwell.

           Dizzy, he begins his descent.

           INT. HOSPITAL - BASEMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The stairwell door opens and Robert, sweaty and exhausted 
           exits. He turns down the hallway and walks unbalanced toward 
           the...

           HOSPITAL MORGUE

           Robert stands in front of the swinging steel doors and 
           enters.

           INT. HOSPITAL - MORGUE - NIGHT

           Robert walks along the cool metal cabinets, reading names and 
           numbers until he reaches.

           DERRICK BLOCK/AGE 16/WT 185/HT 6’1”

           Robert stands in front of the cabinet. Emotionless, he pulls 
           it out and is faced with the contents of...

           A BLACK BODY BAG.

           Robert grabs onto the zipper and slowly unzips the bag. 

           ON ROBERT looking down on his son. Then...
                                 ROBERT
                        Wake up.

           He waits. Almost as if he’s fully expecting Derrick to sit 
           up.

           The MORGUE TECHNICIAN enters. He stands frozen in the doorway 
           as...

           Robert grabs the body bag and shakes it. Robert can sense the 
           tech, but he doesn’t look up. Only explains...

                                 ROBERT
                        He won’t wake up. He’ll be late for 
                        school.

           The Morgue Tech cautiously approaches. He lays a hand on 
           Robert’s shoulder and --

           ROBERT promptly passes out.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Seeing it in its entirety for the first time, the hospital is 
           slightly podunk, not quite the metropolitan, slammed type of 
           urgent care facility and similarly not backwoods. Just small 
           and efficient.

           A nurse pushes Robert past the ICU where he sees --

           ROBERT’S POV - Elizabeth sits next to Samantha, who’s hooked 
           up to an onslaught of machines.

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - DAY

           Rick waits. He spots the nurse wheeling Robert toward him. As 
           they approach...

                                 ROBERT
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 RICK
                        What are friends for?

           He accompanies Robert to the door. The Nurse stops and Rick 
           helps Robert to his feet.

           He leads him out of the sliding glass doors into the bright 
           sunlight of a new day.

           The DOORS CLOSE BEHIND THEM.
           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Rick’s Mercedes pulls up to the front gate. Robert steps out 
           of the passenger side. He leans into the car.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ll walk from here.

                                 RICK
                        You sure?

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ll see you tomorrow.

                                 RICK
                        Robert.

                                 ROBERT
                        I need my work, Rick. Or I’ll die. 
                        I swear.

                                 RICK
                        They want you to take a few days.

                                 ROBERT
                        Tell them to drop dead.

                                 RICK
                        You know I can’t do that.

                                 ROBERT
                        Fine. Tell them I’m working or I 
                        quit.

           Robert leaves Rick hanging. He walks to the gate and punches 
           a security code.

           THE GATES SLOWLY OPEN. Robert walks onto his property and 
           Rick watches him go as...

           THE GATES CLOSE BEHIND HIM.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           The shades are drawn and apart from some low lights it could 
           be night or day.

           Robert sits in a chair in the living room, staring at his 
           phone. Time ticks on. He’s probably been like this for hours.

           He finally reaches over and picks up the receiver. Dials. 
           Waits.
           The expectation on his face conveys a punchy combination of 
           fear and dread.

           The ringing on the other end becomes a woman’s voice and then 
           a BEEP.

                                 ROBERT
                             (into phone)
                        Lainey, it’s Robert...Lainey, 
                        there’s been a terrible accident. 
                        Please call me as soon as you get 
                        this message. Please.

           He hangs up. Was that the right thing to do? To leave her 
           hanging like that?

           EXT. MCPHERESON FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           A cab pulls up and Robert gets out. He walks up the front 
           steps.

           INT. MCPHERESON FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           ANGUS MCPHERESON, 35, walks amongst the dozen or so caskets 
           that McPhereson’s has to offer.

                                 MCPHERESON
                        This is the Royalty Senior. Silk 
                        lined with down feathering. Hand 
                        stitched and solid rosewood. Apart 
                        from the detail it is also has the 
                        benefit of titanium casing and is 
                        polymer sealed.

           Robert is only half listening, but hears...

                                 ROBERT
                        Why is that a benefit?

                                 MCPHERESON
                        Excuse me?

                                 ROBERT
                        The titanium casing? Is that so my 
                        son isn’t eaten by worms?

           McPhereson is taken aback.

                                 MCPHERESON
                        Some customers prefer that peace of 
                        mind, Mr. Block.
                                 ROBERT
                        Well I’m not the customer am I? My 
                        son is the customer. Are you 
                        suggesting I question what he 
                        wanted? I don’t think he ever 
                        thought he was going to die. I 
                        think he thought he was going to 
                        live forever. Didn’t you think that 
                        when you were sixteen years old?

                                 MCPHERESON
                        I did, sir.

                                 ROBERT
                        I believe life should find its own 
                        way. I believe that, that is 
                        something I would have been able to 
                        teach my boy, if I had the time. If 
                        I gave him the time...

           McPhereson can tell that Robert is about to come apart.

                                 MCPHERESON
                        Would you like some time, Mr. 
                        Block, to be alone here? Make your 
                        choice in private.

           Robert stares at him and his practiced sympathy.

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t want to be alone. A month 
                        ago I was married to the woman I 
                        loved and had a beautiful sixteen 
                        year old boy. Does that sound like 
                        the life choice of someone who 
                        wanted to be alone? Yet, here I am. 
                             (beat)
                        Something simple. No fucking 
                        polymer casing. You got a pine box?

                                 MCPHERESON
                        Um, no, ah, we don’t offer those.

                                 ROBERT
                        Then build one. I’ll pay for this 
                        monstrosity if you build me a pine 
                        box. Understand?

                                 MCPHERESON
                        Yes sir?

           Robert walks out.
                                 MCPHERESON
                        So I should put you down for a 
                        Royalty Senior?

           EXT. MCPHERESON FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Robert walks out. Across the street is a GMC DEALERSHIP. He 
           walks toward it.

           EXT. LAURANT DEMONDE - DAY

           Robert pulls up in spanking new black Denali. He parks the 
           beast in his reserved space.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Robert walks past several colleagues on his way to the lab. 
           He nods and responds robotically as people extend their 
           condolences. But Robert hears nothing, only the steady hum of 
           the fluorescent lights and his own heart beating.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Robert enters his domain. Gail turns as he walks through the 
           door.

           She walks over to him and puts her arms around him.

                                 GAIL
                        It’s good to have you back.

                                 ROBERT
                        Thank you. And thanks for the 
                        flowers. And the food.

                                 GAIL
                        Have you figured everything out? 
                        The arrangements, I mean. If you 
                        need any help.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m waiting to hear from his 
                        mother.

                                 GAIL
                        Oh, my God, you mean she doesn’t 
                        know?
                                 ROBERT
                        I...I can’t get in touch with her. 
                        She’s on some damn retreat. No cell 
                        service. No fucking talking.

                                 GAIL
                        What are you going to do?

                                 ROBERT
                        Bury him without her. She’s the one 
                        who left us. Let her regret that 
                        till the day she dies.

           Gail is dumbfounded by his words, swallowing any response. 
           Turning away, Robert walks over to Gracie’s cage. Pauses for 
           a beat. 

           It’s EMPTY.

                                 ROBERT
                        Where’s Gracie?

           Now Gail is nervous, walking on eggshells here...

                                 GAIL
                        I was going to call you. I didn’t 
                        think the timing was right.

           He gets it and he’s hardly pleased.

                                 ROBERT
                        God damnit.
                             (beat)
                        When?

                                 GAIL
                        Two days ago. I’ve got her in cryo. 
                        I assumed you’d want to do the 
                        autopsy.

                                 ROBERT
                        You assumed correctly.

           Robert walks out of the lab without another word.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           He’s back in his chair, phone in hand. He dials. Waits. 
           Lainey’s voice mail picks up.
                                 ROBERT
                        Lainey. You’re going to hate me for 
                        this, but no less than I already 
                        hate myself. So here it goes. 
                        There’s no easy way to say this, 
                        but Derrick is dead. I’m sorry. I’m 
                        so sorry. I’m burying him tomorrow 
                        and for that, for robbing you of 
                        that closure...I have no words.

           He hangs up. And then he THROWS THE PHONE AGAINST THE WALL.

           INT. CHAPEL - DAY

           Robert sits in a pew, alone. At the front of the chapel is 
           Derrick’s simple PINE BOX COFFIN.

           Robert’s eyes are red. In his hand he holds Derrick’s 
           baseball cap. He gets up and OPENS THE COFFIN, and places the 
           baseball cap on Derrick’s chest. He closes the coffin.

           He feels a presence and turns --

           ELIZABETH WARREN, 43, an attractive woman beleaguered by the 
           duties she’s been saddled with recently. Her tired eyes say 
           it all...

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re Samantha’s mother.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re Derrick’s father.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you here to vilify me? Everyone 
                        else has.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        No. I saw you had no one.

                                 ROBERT
                        His mother couldn’t be here. I 
                        can’t give to others what she’ll 
                        never have. So...it’s just me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        May I sit with you?

           Robert doesn’t know what to say. It’s been so hard...

                                 ROBERT
                        Thank you.
           EXT. CEMETARY - LATER

           Close On - A SIMPLE PINE BOX being lowered into the ground.

           Pull back to...Robert and Elizabeth watch as a cemetary 
           worker operates the crank. He stops as the box nestles into 
           the soft earth. No minister. No undertaker. A grim 
           triumvirate.

           Elizabeth walks over to a mound of freshly unearthed soil. 
           She grabs a handful and tosses it over the box.

           She turns to look at Robert. He has TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS 
           FACE.

           Elizabeth grabs another handful of soil and walks to Robert. 
           She takes his hand and opens it, placing the soil in his 
           palm. She nods to him that it’s “okay”.

           Robert walks over to the edge of the grave. He looks in for a 
           long time and then opens his hand...

           The DIRT falls through space before pelting the hard bland 
           wood of Derrick’s coffin.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The place has a comfy, woodsy feel and is pretty packed. The 
           kind of joint where you can get a great steak and where the 
           whiskey is flowing. Elizabeth and Robert sit at a small table 
           near the bar.

           Robert drinks a beer. Elizabeth is sipping wine.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sam’s father died when she was just 
                        six, so it’s been pretty much the 
                        two of us since then. Hal’s parents 
                        were involved, helping us out and 
                        all for about five years after he 
                        passed away, but then his mom got 
                        sick and they needed to move to 
                        Arizona for her health. I decided 
                        that we were going to stay here 
                        where Sam had her life.

           The relevance of that decision hangs between them. Elizabeth 
           looks at Robert with the shared compassion that exists 
           between parents who’ve experienced an immense loss.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I would’ve done the same thing, 
                        Robert. It’s not your fault.
                                 ROBERT
                        I didn’t follow my gut. I...I 
                        wanted to be a good dad.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Our kids were just being kids. 
                        Maybe the other parents have their 
                        right to be angry, but I don’t 
                        know, I...I don’t know.

                                 ROBERT
                        We make bad decisions every day. 
                        It’s just sometimes those decisions 
                        take time to gestate and by the 
                        time we witness the consequences, 
                        history has erased the kernel from 
                        which that decision was made. I 
                        never thought a bad choice would 
                        have such immediate repercussions.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You talk like a scientist. You know 
                        that?

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s one of my natural faults. I 
                        tend to pontificate over people’s 
                        heads. My wife hated it.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think it’s sweet.

           Elizabeth drinks her wine. Robert looks at her strangely. Did 
           she just hit on him?

                                 ROBERT
                        Well then, I’ll keep it up.

           Elizabeth finishes her glass.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have to go back to Sam. I’ve been 
                        sitting with her until eleven and 
                        then they kick me out.

           She reaches into her bag for cash. Robert reaches across and 
           puts his hand on her arm.

                                 ROBERT
                        Please. I’ve got it.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe we can do this again. It’s 
                        nice to talk.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’d like that.

           Elizabeth gets up. She takes pause.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How come you didn’t have a ceremony 
                        for Derrick? No prayers? No sermon?

           Robert doesn’t hesitate.

                                 ROBERT
                        I won’t pander to a god, real or 
                        imaginary, for stealing my son. My 
                        final memories aren’t going to be 
                        some practiced speech by a stranger 
                        in a suit burying him for good. I 
                        promised myself that I will 
                        preserve his memory in a different 
                        way. A real way.

           Elizabeth nods.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Samantha loved him. I like that. 
                        That’s my memory. Her happy like 
                        that.

           She leans down and kisses Robert on the cheek and walks out.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           A VACUUM SEALED CANISTER pops with a rush of air. Robert 
           reaches in with a pair of stainless steel tongs. He slowly 
           extracts...

           GRACIE, frozen in cryo rigor. He carefully places the dead 
           rat on a medical tray.

           Robert speaks into a sound activated recorder.

                                 ROBERT
                        Argentum trials one point five. Lab 
                        specimen code name Gracie post 
                        mortem autopsy.

           Robert stares at the rat. All that work, down the drain.

                                 ROBERT
                        Gracie’s reaction to a standard 
                        dose of Argentum was at first 
                        positive. Minor behavioral quirks 
                        but generally good health. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        This autopsy should determine cause 
                        of death.

           Robert turns a video camera to detail the autopsy. He picks 
           up a scalpel and --

           CUTS INTO THE BACK of Gracie’s skull. He peels her fur back 
           and grabs a tiny BONE SAW.

           The WHIR of the saw devolves into a wicked grinding as Robert 
           cuts through Gracie’s skull, removing the bone and revealing 
           her tiny brain.

                                 ROBERT
                        Her brain matter seems normal at 
                        first glance. We’ll see what cross-
                        section images reveal.

           He’s about to cut into her brain with his scalpel when --

           GRACIE’S PAW TWITCHES.

           But Robert doesn’t notice. He lowers the scalpel into her 
           brain and SUDDENLY --

           GRACIE’S ENTIRE BODY wracks with SPASM. Robert drops the 
           scalpel.

           Startled, he sits rigid in his chair. He leans down and looks 
           at Gracie’s peaceful face. HER EYES POP OPEN.

                                 ROBERT
                        HOLY FUCK!!!

                                 GAIL (O.S.)
                        That doesn’t sound terribly 
                        scientific.

           Robert spins around. Gail stands behind him with a coffee in 
           her hand. Gracie is just out of her eyeline.

           Robert looks at Gracie. The RAT cocks her head at him. He 
           turns back to Gail.

                                 ROBERT
                        You mind getting me a cup of 
                        coffee?

           Gail hasn’t noticed the strangeness going on. She moves to 
           hand Robert her cup.

                                 GAIL
                        Have mine. I’m coffee’d out anyway.
                                 ROBERT
                        Is that decaf?

                                 GAIL
                        No. High octane.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’d like a decaf.

                                 GAIL
                        I asked you, before. You never hear 
                        a thing I say...

           Gail rolls her eyes and heads out.

           Robert turns his attention back to Gracie. She’s on her feet 
           now, sitting up on her hind legs. He doesn’t know what to do. 
           Gail is about to come back and this development is beyond his 
           level of expertise...

           He GRABS GRACIE and shoves the rat back into the cryo tube. 
           It’s kind of awful, hearing her scratch at the metal 
           interior.

           Robert quickly connects the tube to a LIQUID NITROGEN PUMP 
           and injects a blast of gas into the tube. The scratching 
           stops. He shoves the TUBE into his satchel.

           Gail enters. She goes to hand Robert his coffee.

                                 ROBERT
                        Changed my mind.

           Robert throws the satchel over his shoulder and heads out. 
           Gail simply drops the coffee in the trash.

           EXT. LAURANT DEMONDE COSMETICS INTERNATIONAL - DAY

           Robert walks quickly to his car. He gets in.

           INT. DENALI - DAY

           He carefully puts his satchel on the floor of the car when 
           SUDDENLY --

           There’s a RAP on his window. He turns to face --

           SHERIFF DAN COOPER. Robert swallows hard and rolls down his 
           window.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Bob.
                                 ROBERT
                        Dan.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Bob, we’ve got a problem.

           INT. POLICE STATION - SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Robert sits across from the Sheriff.

                                 SHERIFF
                        We should clarify a few things, 
                        Bob. The accident that night...it 
                        got a lot of folks riled.

                                 ROBERT
                        My son is dead, Dan. Don’t you 
                        think I know how angry “folks” are 
                        getting?

                                 SHERIFF
                        I was willing to overlook the fact 
                        that Derrick was driving after dark 
                        and in clear violation of his 
                        learner’s permit. But...

           He hands Robert a toxicology report. Robert reads it. He 
           stares at the numbers, digesting the facts.

                                 ROBERT
                        This suggests his blood alcohol 
                        level was 1.8%.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Seems he was pretty intoxicated.

                                 ROBERT
                        I was with him. He wasn’t drunk.

           Robert throws the report on the Sheriff’s desk.

                                 SHERIFF
                        He was almost two points over the 
                        limit, Bob. Now that makes those 
                        kids deaths a homicide.

                                 ROBERT
                        So, what? You’re going to charge 
                        Derrick with murder?
                                 SHERIFF
                        No. 
                             (beat)
                        You were the responsible adult.

                                 ROBERT
                        Yeah?

                                 SHERIFF
                        I’m going to make this simple. 
                        You’re going to need a very good 
                        lawyer, because I have to charge 
                        you with Involuntary Manslaughter.

                                 ROBERT
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 SHERIFF
                        You lost your boy, Bob, and I know 
                        that you need time to grieve. So 
                        I’m gonna sit on this. Take my time 
                        to push the paperwork upstate. But 
                        in about a week this shit’s gonna 
                        stir and you need to be prepared.

           Robert looks at the Sheriff and the gravity of his situation 
           dawns on him.

                                 ROBERT
                        May I go?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Gracie paces in a cage on the kitchen table. She stares with 
           red eyes at Robert. He doesn’t know what to do.

           He walks out of the kitchen in a hurry.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - NIGHT

           Robert lays a wooden plank on a worktable. Kept orderly are 
           rows of tools hanging from a nearby pegboard.

           Robert then lays several strips of FLAT NYLON CABLE next to 
           the plank.

           He pulls Gracie from her cage. She doesn’t show any 
           aggression toward him. He holds her down on the plank and 
           places one end of the nylon cable on one side of her neck and 
           STAPLES IT IN PLACE. 
           Then Robert tightens the cable, pushing Gracie down onto the 
           wood and staples the other end, effectively limiting her 
           movement.

           He fastens a cable over her back and then her hind legs.

                                 ROBERT
                        Sorry, Gracie.

           He picks up a scalpel and gets to work.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

           Sun’s just coming up and Robert’s been up all night. He 
           types, taking dictation from his notes that are repeated back 
           to him via his recorder.

                                 ROBERT (V.O.)
                        Hour three. I have removed all of 
                        Gracie’s internal organs and she 
                        still shows normal signs of life. 
                        The organs themselves seem to 
                        possess a certain reanimation, 
                        reacting to electric stimulus. The 
                        subject is clearly alive even 
                        without a heart or the flow of 
                        blood. Lastly, I am going to sever 
                        the brain stem and remove the 
                        cerebral cortex.

           There is a long beat as Robert leans back from his writing. 
           Off camera, from the recorder comes an INHUMAN SQUEAL...and 
           then silence.

           Robert leans into the keyboard again as his voice drifts over 
           the scene.

                                 ROBERT (V.O.)
                        The subject, Gracie, Argentum 
                        trials experimental animal has 
                        reacted in a negative way to the 
                        cutting of the brain stem and 
                        subsequent removal of all brain 
                        matter. The body appears to be 
                        dead.
                             (beat)
                        Yet the proteins in the flesh still 
                        seem somewhat alive. Alive beyond 
                        any normal cellular sustenance.

           Robert looks to his left. In a SMALL METAL PAN lies GRACIE’S 
           TINY, BUT STILL SLOWLY BEATING HEART.
           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Robert stands at his outdoor grill. He places a COFFEE CAN 
           over the grates and pours lighter fluid into the can. He sets 
           the thing on fire and watches it burn.

           Over the warped heat he stares at Derrick’s BICYCLE leaning 
           up against the back SHED. Through the rising, warbling flames 
           he can almost make out his son playing as a little boy in the 
           backyard.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - DAY/NIGHT

           Robert tosses tools and wood into a pile at one end of the 
           room.

           Robert CLEANS EVERYTHING, scouring the floors, tables, 
           benches with a bleaching fluid.

           Robert staples PLASTIC SHEETING to everything that could 
           contain bacteria.

           Robert switches the fluorescent lights for bacteria 
           identifying blacklights.

           He connects computers and equipment that is typically seen 
           only in a laboratory. Heart monitors. Medical gear.

           It’s taken several days, but finally...Robert stands by the 
           door looking at --

           The Workroom has been transformed into a makeshift working 
           lab. its centerpiece, a STAINLESS STEEL table. The far side 
           of the room is dominated by a LARGE FLOOR MOUNTED FREEZER 
           UNIT...large enough to hold a body.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DUSK

           Robert lines the back of his Denali with plastic sheeting. He 
           lays three bags of LIME into the back of the truck and puts 
           in several digging tools. A shovel. A pick-axe.

           EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT

           Standing at Derrick’s grave, plumes of cold breath drift from 
           Robert’s mouth and nose. His nervousness evident from his 
           breathing.

           He brings the shovel down against the freshly laid soil.

           LATER...
           Robert is deep in the grave when he hits the hard wood of the 
           pine box. He falls to his knees and rubs the dirt away from 
           the top of the box. He leans his head against it.

                                 ROBERT
                        If I can make this right, isn’t it 
                        my duty?

           He looks up. An atheist searching for an answer that only 
           science can give.

           And with that, HE CRANKS OPEN THE LID OF THE COFFIN.

           The stench hits him first, but then he’s looking at his 
           son...

           Not what he expected. Derrick’s face, previously broken and 
           destroyed, now sunken and haunted. Lack of muscle tone and 
           resiliency in the skin combined with the onset of rigor 
           mortis has left him a stiff shell of his former self. 

           And suddenly Robert has second thoughts. He slams the coffin 
           shut and with panicked urgency CLIMBS OUT OF THE GRAVE.

           But just as he picks up the shovel again...

           HEADLIGHTS TRACK OVER THE CEMETARY GROUNDS as a groundskeeper 
           drives slowly, making his rounds.

           Robert slips back into the grave. 

           Waiting, he sees a MILLIPEDE trying to make its way into the 
           slightly ajar coffin.

           Robert reaches down and grabs the worm. Stares at it 
           wriggling between his fingers.

           EXT. DENALI - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON - Derrick’s FACE as...

           Robert pours LIME over his son’s body. Finished, he covers 
           him with the dark plastic sheeting. Before he slams the rear 
           hatch, he throws Derrick’s baseball cap in the back of the 
           car.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Gail is crunching numbers at the computer, but she seems 
           bored. Fed up with the lack of research amidst Robert’s 
           absence --
           She walks to the cryo chamber and opens it up...looking for 
           Gracie’s cryo tube. It’s not there. She checks again.

                                 GAIL
                        Fucking hell.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Robert stares into the mirror. He opens the cabinet and grabs 
           a pill container marked ADDERALL. There’s a bottle of Xanax 
           next to it labeled for Elaine Block.

           Robert opens the Adderall and pops four pills. Puts them back 
           and slams the cabinet shut.

           Again...his face staring back at him. Who is he?

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - DAY

           Lit only by overhead fluorescent lighting, Robert, wearing a 
           laboratory issue coveralls, attends to all of his 
           equipment...running numbers, checking levels. He monitors his 
           backup generators.

           He prepares several syringes filled with pharmaceutical 
           morphine and lays them on a rolling try.

           Finished with his basic preparations, Robert slowly 
           approaches the freezer unit and opens it. Dry cold air pours 
           out.

           Robert attaches a pulley system to the interior of the 
           freezer and turns it on.

           SLOWLY, Derrick’s NAKED BODY rises, buoyed on a flexible 
           stretcher. 

           Robert pulls the stretcher on a ball bearing ceiling mounted 
           track over to the stainless gurney and gently lays Derrick on 
           the table.

           He carefully slides the stretcher out from under him so that 
           Derrick lays on the cold steel.

           Then Robert REVEALS from the other side of the table what 
           looks like a fully realized BODY BRACE. He lowers it over 
           Derrick’s body and fastens it in place...a nest of graphite 
           that completely encases Derrick.

           He wheels a COMPRESSOR and places it next to Derrick’s head.
           Next, Robert INSERTS about a dozen needles into DERRICK’S 
           MAIN ARTERIES and runs the tubing through the compressor. 

           He fixes the MAIN INTRAVENOUS TUBE into the base of Derrick’s 
           skull, UP INTO HIS BRAIN STEM.

           He pulls from a portable fridge a large metal and glass TUBE 
           filled with what we recognize as ARGENTUM.

           Robert SCREWS the bottom of the Argentum Tube into the top of 
           the compressor and as it clicks into place he takes a deep 
           breath and flips the compressor ON.

           BLACK BLOOD begins to fill the tubes extracting plasma from 
           Derrick’s body, literally emptying him and then running...

           Through the tubes...into the compressor...mixing with the 
           Argentum in its mounted tube...back through the compressor 
           and now...a mix of almost purplish substance, running back 
           through the tubes and into Derrick’s body.

           Finished, Robert switches off the compressor. He pulls 
           another TUBE OF ARGENTUM from the fridge, snaps off the now 
           empty, used tube and replaces it with a full dose. He flicks 
           the switch and repeats the process.

           LATER --

           Several tubes discarded, Robert repeats the process again 
           until now, the blood mixing back into Derrick’s body is DEEP 
           RED. The blood of life.

           Robert checks machines. Looking at his monitors. Desperately 
           waiting for some sign of life.

           Yet, nothing. 

           He pops more pills.

           The SUN SETS. And THE SUN RISES.

           Robert stands over his son’s body. He methodically begins to 
           unhook him from the monitors.

           Once again, Robert raises Derrick on the pulley and leads him 
           to the freezer. He slowly lowers him into the freezing abyss 
           and...closes the lid. 

           Leaving, he hits the lights. Only the flickering blacklights 
           stay on.
           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Robert opens the medicine cabinet. He grabs the XANAX with 
           Elaine’s name on it. Dolls out three and downs them dry.

           He looks in the mirror.

                                 ROBERT
                        We tried. At least we tried.

           Flicks off the lights.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Robert sleeps coma-esque. And then in a moment of fitfulness 
           turns over...seemingly fighting something. He moans and then 
           speaks.

                                 ROBERT
                        Who are you?

           But it only lasts a brief moment before he descends back into 
           slumber.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           We track through the house. The HALLWAY outside his bedroom 
           is empty.

           Down the stairs...all is quiet.

           Half eaten meals litter the kitchen.

           The living room is empty and SUDDENLY -- THE PHONE RINGS. On 
           the Caller ID we read -- ELAINE BLOCK.

           Over the ringing phone we enter the basement to...

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - NIGHT

           The hum of the blacklight fluorescent sound deafening as we 
           move slowly toward...

           THE FREEZER.

           BAM!!! The LID IS PUNCHED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE!!!
           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           The morning sun is seeping through the curtains as we slowly 
           fall on Robert in bed...SHIVERING.

           Under the covers, he shakes uncontrollably, teeth chattering. 
           His eyes pop open.

           He turns in bed and sees --

           DERRICK, pale blue from the freezer lays with his back to 
           Robert.

           Robert FALLS OUT OF BED. Wearing only boxers, he scuttles 
           backward across the floor till he hits the wall. He stares at 
           his son in bed and...

           He slowly gets up and walks over to the bed, crawls across 
           the sheets and gently PEALS the covers from atop Derrick. He 
           tries to get a look at Derrick’s face when --

           DERRICK TURNS to him. His once ravaged face, now a quilt of 
           fresh healing skin. He looks at Robert with tired eyes.

                                 DERRICK
                        Dad?

           Robert rushes to Derrick, but contains himself, careful not 
           to come on too strong. He holds out his hand, almost as if 
           approaching an animal, but touches his shoulder.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’re so cold.

           Derrick just looks at him with lost eyes. Robert climbs onto 
           the bed and WRAPS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS SON. He pulls him 
           close, warming him, almost happy again.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Robert is rifling through the closet, tearing out blankets 
           when he finds what he’s looking for...

           An ELECTRIC HEATING BLANKET. He turns just as --

           DERRICK walks past him, seemingly dazed. Naked, he walks down 
           the stairs. Robert just watches...and then follows.

           Derrick walks through the house, touching furniture, books, 
           the walls as if it’s the first time.

           He walks into the...
           KITCHEN

           Bright in here, the sun hits Derrick’s face. Under his skin 
           we can see the freeway system of capillaries crisscrossing 
           and repairing. 

           Robert comes up slowly behind him and Derrick SNIFFS the air. 
           He spins around on his father.

           Robert is unfazed by Derrick’s behavior. He touches Derrick’s 
           face, tracing the healing skin.

                                 ROBERT
                        Incredible.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - DAY

           Derrick is wearing the electric blanket around his shoulders, 
           pacing while Robert works at the computer.

                                 DERRICK
                        How long was I dead?

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s been ten days.

           As Derrick moves into the light we see his face is healing 
           even more rapidly. The skin that seemed patchwork is now 
           blending nicely.

           Robert gets up from the computer and inspects his son’s 
           complexion.

                                 ROBERT
                        Exponential.

                                 DERRICK
                        Where’s my phone?

           Robert can’t believe this is actually a concern.

                                 ROBERT
                        You can’t call anyone.

                                 DERRICK
                        I need to call Samantha. If she 
                        thinks I’m dead...

           Robert takes pause. He makes a decision.

                                 ROBERT
                        Derrick...I was the only survivor.
           Derrick backs up against the wall, not wanting to hear this.

                                 DERRICK
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 ROBERT
                        Why would I lie to you? You need to 
                        trust me. This thing...this is 
                        bigger than both of us.

           Derrick buries his face in his hands. His body wracks with 
           emotion.

                                 DERRICK
                        I’m not an experiment, dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        Quite the contrary. You’re what 
                        might be called Test Subject Zero.

                                 DERRICK
                        Why zero?

                                 ROBERT
                        Because, scientifically, you don’t 
                        exist.

                                 DERRICK
                        You might want to work a little on 
                        your bedside manner.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m being pragmatic, Derrick. We 
                        accomplished something here that’s 
                        beyond everyday science. It’s a new 
                        step toward...

                                 DERRICK
                        Immortality?

                                 ROBERT
                        I suppose you could say that.

                                 DERRICK
                        So do what you did to me for 
                        Samantha.

                                 ROBERT
                        You know I can’t do that.

                                 DERRICK
                        No. Actually I don’t.
                                 ROBERT
                        The ethical implications are too 
                        great.

                                 DERRICK
                        But you had no problem using me as 
                        a guinea pig?

                                 ROBERT
                        I did this out of love. Now we need 
                        manage it, correctly.

                                 DERRICK
                        How’s that?

                                 ROBERT
                        Start a new life elsewhere.

                                 DERRICK
                        No. We can make this work somehow. 
                        I know it. Dad...I don’t want to 
                        leave everything I know.

                                 ROBERT
                        Even if we could, we can’t. You 
                        were drunk that night. The 
                        crash...was my fault, for letting 
                        you drive.

                                 DERRICK
                        So what are they gonna do, arrest 
                        me?

                                 ROBERT
                        No, they’re going to charge me 
                        instead. If we stay, Derrick, I’m 
                        going to jail.

                                 DERRICK
                        That’s bullshit and you know it.

                                 ROBERT
                        This isn’t a debate, Derrick. We 
                        need to be careful. We need to be 
                        discreet. And we need to leave.

                                 DERRICK
                        I have a life. And what about Mom?

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ll deal with your mother, 
                        somehow.

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        But your life, what was your 
                        life...now it’s time to 
                        reevaluate...redefine.

           Derrick isn’t hearing him. How can who he was be no more?

                                 DERRICK
                        What have you done to me?

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RICK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ah, the splendor of being the COO of a huge cosmetics 
           corporation. Rick sits behind his monstrous desk shooting off 
           emails.

           His computer pings and he reaches to his intercom...

                                 RICK
                        Send her in.

           He wipes the hair off his forehead as GAIL enters.

                                 RICK
                        Please tell me you have good news.

           Gail sits across from Rick.

                                 GAIL
                        When’s the last time you spoke to 
                        Robert?

                                 RICK
                        Alright, that’s not how you begin a 
                        good news conversation.

                                 GAIL
                        Because it’s not.

                                 RICK
                        What’s going on?

           The gravity of Robert’s offense weighs on Gail, but she won’t 
           turn him over just yet.

                                 GAIL
                        He’s just gone of the grid 
                        and...I’m concerned.

                                 RICK
                        Gail, the guy lost his kid. For 
                        fuck’s sake, he buried the boy 
                        alone. Zero emotional support.

                        I’m just pleased he’s taking a few 
                        days to recoup. Let him. And in the 
                        meantime, you take the lead.

                                 GAIL
                        I wish I could.

                                 RICK
                        And why not?

                                 GAIL
                        Robert changed all the passcodes to 
                        get into the research.

           Rick thinks this over.

                                 RICK
                        Well, he’s always been proprietary 
                        over his work. 

                                 GAIL
                        True.

                                 RICK
                        But if you don’t hear from him in 
                        the next two days -- 

                                 GAIL
                        I’ll let you know.

           She leaves. Rick rubs his eyes.

                                 RICK
                        Don’t fuck me, you sonofabitch.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Derrick sits on the couch, playing video games. Robert 
           enters. He sits next to Derrick, but Derrick puts up a wall, 
           moving further away from his father...

                                 ROBERT
                        I know this is difficult. I promise 
                        you that it’ll get better, but 
                        we’ve got a lot of work to do to 
                        get there. Are you willing to do 
                        the work with me?

           But Derrick is antagonistic.

                                 DERRICK
                        You’re getting what you’ve always 
                        wanted, aren’t you? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DERRICK (CONT'D)
                        You hated it that I was different 
                        from you. That I couldn’t think 
                        like you. And now you’ve looped me 
                        into you world. What if I don’t 
                        want to be part of it? What if I 
                        want to be myself?

                                 ROBERT
                        I want to give you that chance 
                        again. I do. But think, Derrick. If 
                        you go out there unprepared, people 
                        won’t understand. Derrick, you are 
                        dead out there. People won’t be 
                        able to grasp it. Like it or not 
                        you are exceptional now.

                                 DERRICK
                        And I wasn’t before?

                                 ROBERT
                        Before? Average doesn’t make you 
                        special.

                                 DERRICK
                        I wasn’t average. I was special.

                                 ROBERT
                        But now you’re a miracle.

           Robert’s words hurt, but they’re doing the trick.

                                 DERRICK
                        Mom always said I was a miracle.

                                 ROBERT
                        The glow a child has in a mother’s 
                        eyes does not inform the shine you 
                        have on the world, son. I want you 
                        to change the world and together we 
                        can do just that.

           Off Derrick’s look we cut to...

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Gail drives up in her truck. She gets out and walks to the 
           front door.

           She rings the doorbell. Waits. Then slams her fist against 
           the door.

                                 GAIL
                        ROBERT!!!
           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

           Robert glances toward the sound of Gail’s voice. Ignores it. 
           Turns back to --

           Derrick jogs on a treadmill. Robert watches him with an 
           analytical eye. He keeps track of Derrick’s speed and time on 
           a digital tablet.

                                 ROBERT
                        That’s fifty minutes at a four mile 
                        minute.

           Derrick hasn’t broken a sweat.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you the slightest bit thirsty?

                                 DERRICK
                        No. 
                             (re: the pounding on the 
                              door)
                        Are you just going to ignore that 
                        forever?

                                 ROBERT
                        Now’s not the time for taking 
                        visitors.

           He continues jogging. Shakes his head like this is total 
           insanity.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - DAY

           Robert takes blood from Derrick’s arm. The BLOOD spurts into 
           a test tube. Robert detaches the tube and replaces it with a 
           new one.

           LATER --

           Robert examines Derrick’s blood under a microscope. He speaks 
           into his voice recorder.

                                 ROBERT
                        After six hours of exercise there 
                        is no sign of dehydration. Normal 
                        cellular function. Accelerated 
                        healing is...

           Robert uses a thin heating coil to --
           POV MICROSCOPIC IMAGE OF DERRICK’S BLOOD SAMPLE as Robert 
           touches it with the heating coil. The BLOOD reacts, damaged, 
           but then rapidly reconstitutes...healing itself.

                                 ROBERT
                        ...clearly evident. The addition of 
                        Argentum has created a cellular 
                        memory. A perfect recall to an 
                        ideal cellular structure.

           INT. DERRICK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Derrick sits on his bed listening to music. He stares at the 
           computer on his desk. He gets up and walks over and tries to 
           get online.

           A FIREWALL blocks him from getting out.

                                 DERRICK
                        Fucking asshole.

           SUDDENLY, he wracks with pain, BENDING OVER AT THE WAIST. He 
           grips his twisting gut. Agonizing.

           Derrick stumbles off his bed. He knocks over a lamp with a 
           loud crash and weaves toward the bathroom.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Derrick falls before the toilet. With shaking hands he 
           manages to get the lid open and --

           PUKES A TORRENT OF BLACK BLOOD into the toilet.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert races up the stairs toward the noise.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Robert rushes into the bathroom to find Derrick cleaning 
           himself off. There’s no sign of the blood.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you alright? I heard something 
                        fall.

           Derrick throws a towel into the corner of the bathroom.
                                 DERRICK
                        I’m fine. I was just having a bad 
                        dream.

                                 ROBERT
                        So you slept? That’s an 
                        improvement.

                                 DERRICK
                        Does everything have to prove some 
                        theory with you? Yeah, I was tired. 
                        I slept. I had a bad dream. I woke 
                        up. It’s not fucking rocket 
                        science.

                                 ROBERT
                        Anything else?

                                 DERRICK
                        I think I’m hungry.

           Derrick walks past Robert.

                                 ROBERT
                        This is good.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Derrick sits at the kitchen table staring at...

           A SIMPLE PLATE OF FOOD. A roasted CHICKEN LEG. Some 
           vegetables.

           He looks up at Robert who watches with interest.

                                 DERRICK
                        I don’t want it.

                                 ROBERT
                        You blood work suggests a 
                        deficiency in proteins. Your body 
                        is experiencing ketosis. If you 
                        don’t eat...your metabolism will 
                        find nutrients within your own 
                        muscle mass.

           Derrick pushes the dinner away.

                                 DERRICK
                        I don’t want it.

           Robert pushes the food at him.
                                 ROBERT
                        You have to try.

           A beat. Derrick picks up the chicken leg.

           CLOSE AS - He opens his mouth and takes a bite.

           REPULSED, Derrick spits the chunk of meat back onto his plate 
           and pushes it away.

                                 DERRICK
                        I can’t. It’s, there’s something 
                        about it. It’s disgusting.

           Robert writes something down.

                                 DERRICK
                        What are you always writing?

           Robert’s phone rings. He looks at the CALLER ID...

           CLOSE ON - The CALLER ID reads, LAINEY.

           Robert stares at it. His world is closing in.

                                 DERRICK
                        Who is it?

                                 ROBERT
                        Nobody.

           He HITS END. The ringing stops.

           Suddenly...THE DOORBELL CHIMES. Robert looks toward the door.

                                 ROBERT
                        Stay here.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert opens the door to REVEAL --

           ELIZABETH stands on his front step.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m sorry to come over. I just need 
                        to talk. I tried calling, but...

           Robert steps outside. He shuts the door behind him.

                                 ROBERT
                        No. That’s fine.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I thought maybe you had gone out of 
                        town.

           She begins to cry. Robert doesn’t know how to react. Should 
           he hold her?

                                 ROBERT
                        I’ve been consumed with work. I 
                        think it’s a reaction to 
                        everything.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s better to take your mind off 
                        things.
                             (beat)
                        Can I come in for a minute.

                                 ROBERT
                        No. I mean, not being rude or 
                        anything, I’ve been kind of the 
                        bachelor lately. Ah, the place is a 
                        mess. I’d feel judged.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Don’t be silly.

                                 ROBERT
                        Maybe we can talk out here.

           The setting is awkward and Elizabeth reacts to his strange 
           mood. But she knows he’s kind of a strange man and relents.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’d like that.
                             (beat)
                        I wanted to talk to you because I 
                        need to make a decision about 
                        Samantha.

           Robert looks toward the house.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m not sure I’m the right person 
                        to talk to about this, Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s silly, I know, but the other 
                        night...I felt something between 
                        us. I mean I’m not getting all 
                        crazy. Don’t think I’m getting 
                        crazy, Robert, please.
                                 ROBERT
                        Of course not.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And I know what grief does. It 
                        clouds emotions, but...you felt it, 
                        didn’t you.

           He did. Robert can’t help being touched by her.

                                 ROBERT
                        Elizabeth, we’re going through a 
                        lot, separately and in a strange 
                        way together. It would be wrong for 
                        us to --

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know. I know that. It’s just...I 
                        haven’t anyone else to talk to. 
                        There are the doctors and the 
                        nurses and...a woman from the 
                        insurance company came over today. 
                        There are just so many voices in my 
                        head and I can’t decide what the 
                        right thing is to do.

                                 ROBERT
                        What right thing?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Samantha’s not getting better. Her 
                        activity levels dropped last night.

                                 ROBERT
                        How bad is it?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She’ll never regain consciousness.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Derrick is standing next to the door, listening.

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        Her body will shrivel and die. Only 
                        machines will keep her alive...if 
                        that’s even living. It’s not. It’s 
                        monstrous to condemn her to that.

           Derrick is slowly reaching for the door handle. Perhaps if he 
           reveals himself, his father won’t have a choice other than to 
           help her.
           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Elizabeth falls into Robert’s arms.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’m going to take her off of life 
                        support.

           And then she pushes away from him.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I think I just needed to hear 
                        myself say it.

           She turns to leave.

                                 ROBERT
                        Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have to go Robert.

           She walks quickly away. Robert watches her leave and then 
           turns as the front door opens. Derrick looks pissed.

           Robert pushes past him into the house.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Derrick slams the door.

                                 ROBERT
                        What were you going to do? Make 
                        some grand pronouncement? Hey. Look 
                        at me. I’ve risen from the dead.

                                 DERRICK
                        You lied.

                                 ROBERT
                        I was protecting you.

           Derrick is shaking with anger. He tempers it...

                                 DERRICK
                        You can save her.

                                 ROBERT
                        I can’t. Not like this. The science 
                        is unproven.

                                 DERRICK
                        This is my life.
                                 ROBERT
                        Spoken like a true sixteen year 
                        old.

           Derrick begins to beg.

                                 DERRICK
                        I love her, Dad. I love her so much 
                        and she’s going to die and you can 
                        change that.
                             (beat)
                        Look at me. Look at what you can 
                        do. You’re like a god.

                                 ROBERT
                        I know how you feel. I felt that 
                        way before...a long time ago, but 
                        it’ll change. If we act on our 
                        impetuous notions of love and 
                        emotion --

                                 DERRICK
                        We actually live. Try to remember 
                        what it’s like to be really alive, 
                        Dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m not willing to shoulder that 
                        responsibility.

           Derrick lashes out.

                                 DERRICK
                        Fucking shoulder it, asshole.

           Robert is shocked. Derrick gets in his face.

                                 DERRICK
                        Step up for once in your sad life 
                        and do something for your family.

           He pushes Robert, becoming more and more agitated.

                                 DERRICK
                        Like you have never done before. 
                        Can you do that? Can you be a man?

                                 ROBERT
                        Stop it Derrick.

                                 DERRICK
                        If you won’t help her. I’ll expose 
                        you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DERRICK (CONT'D)
                        I’ll walk right down Franklin Ave., 
                        and tell every last person in this 
                        town what you are.

                                 ROBERT
                        And what am I?

                                 DERRICK
                        You create monsters, dad. I am 
                        living proof.

                                 ROBERT
                        They’ll take you and cut you up 
                        into a million slide samples for 
                        the study of mankind. You won’t be 
                        any kind of hero. You’ll be as dead 
                        as Samantha.

                                 DERRICK
                        Then that’s exactly what I want. I 
                        don’t want to live another second 
                        without her.

           Derrick goes for the door. Robert stops him and Derrick 
           turns...

                                 DERRICK
                        Get out of my way.

                                 ROBERT
                        I can’t let you go.

           Derrick grabs Robert by the neck and with a display of 
           extreme strength...

                                 DERRICK
                        I don’t want to repeat myself.

           He THROWS Robert across the room. Robert hits the far wall 
           and collapses in a heap.

           Derrick throws open the front door and walks out.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

           Derrick runs down the road at a steady clip.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert stirs. He touches the back of his head and pulls his 
           hand away.
           Stares uncomprehendingly at the blood on his fingers.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Robert stumbles into the bathroom. He goes to the mirror and 
           tries to get a look at the nasty gash on the back of his 
           skull.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert walks to the kitchen. He’s pretty out of it, holding a 
           wet towel to his head.

           He enters the bright kitchen...

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           He’s stopped dead in his tracks.

           ON THE TABLE - The uneaten CHICKEN on Derrick’s plate is 
           making a wet sticky sound.

           Robert walks slowly over to the plate. The look on his face 
           is of total revulsion. He POKES at --

           THE CHICKEN LEG and it PULSES, FLEXING at Robert’s touch.

           Startled, Robert HOLLERS. He leaps back from the plate. And 
           then gets closer, clinically examining what’s taking place. 

           The Chicken Leg almost leaps off the plate. Robert jumps 
           back. Stares at this recent development.

                                 ROBERT
                        Oh, no.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Derrick stands outside the small community hospital. It’s 
           very quiet. Little action in this tiny hamlet.

           He walks toward the front doors.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Robert shouts for Derrick.
                                 ROBERT
                        DERRICK!!!

           He sees a light come on in a nearby house. The neighbor’s dog 
           begins to bark and then he sees his neighbor’s back door 
           open.

           The BARKING DOG races across two lawns, running straight for 
           Robert.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT

           One of five critically ill patients...

           Samantha lies in her bed surrounded by life support machines. 
           Bandages have been removed from her face and her wounds are 
           in the process of healing.

           Deep open cuts crisscross her cheeks and split lips.

                                 DERRICK (O.S.)
                        I am so sorry.

           REVEAL - Derrick stands at the end of her bed. He moves 
           around to her side. Looks around, taking note of the quiet 
           hallway before he sits.

           Derrick puts his hand on Samantha’s.

                                 DERRICK
                        I know he’s right. It just hurts 
                        too much to think I’m losing you.
                             (beat)
                        Please, Sam, give me a sign that 
                        you can hear me. Something...

           Nothing. Derrick lays his head on her bed and begins to cry.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - NIGHT

           The DEAD DOG lays on the steel table in the center of the 
           room.

           Robert is at his workstation. He speaks into his recorder.

                                 ROBERT
                        Using a sample of Derrick’s 
                        saliva...

           Robert pushes away with a SYRINGE filled with some compound.
                                 ROBERT
                        ...we can test the compound 
                        degradation.

           Robert injects the DEAD DOG with the fresh compound. He sets 
           his watch to time the possible transformation.

                                 ROBERT
                        If I theorize correctly, then I 
                        will have no choice other than to 
                        destroy what I’ve created.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Elizabeth walks down the hall flanked by TWO DOCTORS AND A 
           NURSE. The walk slowly toward the ICU.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT

           Derrick hears footsteps approaching. He gazes with 
           desperation at Samantha.

           He hears Elizabeth mutter through anguished sobs.

                                 ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                        I’m sure.

           Derrick takes Samantha’s hand. Whispers.

                                 DERRICK
                        I will get you back. I promise you 
                        that. Death’s got nothing on me.

           He leans over and kisses Samantha deeply.

                                 DERRICK
                        I love you.

           He kisses her again and then backs away as...

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Elizabeth, the Doctors, and the Nurse turn from the hallway 
           into the ICU.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT

           Elizabeth and the medical team enter. Samantha lay 
           unaccompanied in her bed. There’s no sign of Derrick.
           Elizabeth holds the doctors back and approaches Samantha’s 
           bed. She leans very close to her ear.

           ON SAMANTHA’S LIPS - Glistening wet, not the dry cracked skin 
           of a dying girl. Leftover from a passionate kiss, yet the 
           WOUND SPLITTING HER LIP seems to be ever minutely 
           healing...turning from gash to scar.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        My dear, sweet, angel. I’ve heard 
                        you in my heart. I know it’s time.

           She lays her head on Elizabeth’s chest. A Doctor puts his 
           hand on her shoulder for comfort.

                                 ELIZABETH
                             (to Doctor)
                        But her heart sounds so strong.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                        It’s the machines. It’s all the 
                        machines.

           She pulls away.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Then turn them off.

           She kisses Samantha on the forehead.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        God’s speed, love.

           Doctor #1 nods to Doctor #2 and with a practiced sense of 
           finality, TURNS OFF SAMANTHA’S LIFE SUPPORT.

           The HEART MONITOR beats weakly. The RESPIRATOR stutters.

                                 DOCTOR #2
                        She’s on her own, now.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        How long?

                                 DOCTOR #2
                        Minutes. Not long.

           Elizabeth is breaking down. The weight of the moment coursing 
           through her veins like a runaway train. Did she do the right 
           thing? Did she just murder her daughter? She collapses, the 
           cries coming from her, ANGUISHED AND PRIMAL.

           The HEART MONITOR FLATLINES. The RESPIRATOR FALTERS and 
           STOPS.
           It’s over. Elizabeth stares at the flaccid machines as if 
           they are her daughter. A representation of something that was 
           once alive. She can’t find the words when...

           BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. The Heart Monitor ticks back to life.

           Elizabeth turns to the Doctors for an answer...

                                 DOCTOR #2
                        I’m sorry. This is typically 
                        routine. It’s not a sign of brain 
                        function.

           Doctor #1 leans over Samantha. He opens her eyes. They are 
           unmoving...completely dead and then --

           SAMANTHA’S EYES DART, from left to right, SHAKING IN THEIR 
           SOCKETS like pachinko balls searching for an exit.

           AND THEN SHE WRACKS WITH A DEEP DESPERATE BREATH.

           The Doctor leaps back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What is it?

           As the Respirator hums back to life.

                                 DOCTOR #1
                        We need to get this girl for a 
                        brain scan.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’s happening?

                                 DOCTOR #1
                        I think your daughter is finding 
                        her way back.

           Off Elizabeth’s shocked, but jubilant expression.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - NIGHT

           The DOG GROWLS a low menacing growl at --

           ROBERT. He stands several feet from the chained animal, 
           holding an AXE. He’s nervous to use it. He steps closer to 
           the dog.

           The Dog is practically clawing his way through the floor. 
           It’s not clear who he’s growling at, but there’s something 
           very NOT RIGHT about it.
           When Robert gets closer, it can’t seem to sense his presence, 
           but rather is going berserk for some other unseen, unknown 
           reason.

           Robert raises the axe high.

           The DOG YANKS hard at the chain and SUDDENLY, the CHAIN RIPS 
           FROM THE WALL.

           And the Dog launches through the air, but misses Robert as he 
           pinwheels out of the way. It runs to the door, trying, 
           seemingly to escape.

           Robert stumbles, preparing to protect himself, but is puzzled 
           by the Dog’s lack of interest in him.

           The Dog slams again, and again, and again into the door. Wood 
           begins to splinter. If he gets out, he’ll escape so...

           Robert walks up to the oblivious animal and raises the axe. 
           He SWIFTLY BRINGS THE AXE DOWN UPON THE DOG. 

           But the dog doesn’t even register pain. It continues to growl 
           through the beating...as Robert decapitates the animal...its 
           growls turning to garbled, warped pops in it’s throat. And 
           then nothing.

           Robert stares down at the dead Dog, still twitching on the 
           stone floor. 

           A SLAM from above...inside the house. Derrick is home.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert comes up from the basement workroom and closes the 
           door behind him.

           Derrick stands in the dim light of the hallway.

                                 DERRICK
                        She’s gone.

           Robert lowers his head. He looks up at his son. So much pain. 
           He walks to him and HUGS HIM.

           Derrick falls into his father’s arms. He holds him tightly, 
           finding warmth and love that maybe hasn’t been there for 
           years.

                                 DERRICK
                        It was all my fault.
                                 ROBERT
                        I should have told you. I thought I 
                        could spare you that pain. I 
                        already felt that pain by losing 
                        you...I didn’t want you to have to 
                        feel that ever.

           Derrick cries into his father’s shoulder. Robert hugs him 
           harder. And then SUDDENLY - DERRICK’S EYES OPEN WIDE with a 
           sudden awareness.

           He looks at Robert’s NECK...the flesh beckoning him. His lips 
           pull back, much like the snarling dog. His breath sharpens. 
           Entire body stiffens as he bends his neck, his TEETH just 
           grazing his father’s vulnerable throat.

           And, Derrick pushes Robert away from him. Hard.

                                 ROBERT
                        What is it?

                                 DERRICK
                        There’s something wrong.

           Robert stares at him, trying to decipher his son’s mood. He 
           already knows there’s something wrong, but to what extent?

                                 ROBERT
                        Tell me.

                                 DERRICK
                        It’s difficult to explain. It’s 
                        more like a craving.

                                 ROBERT
                        For what?

           Derrick can’t convince himself to say it.

                                 DERRICK
                        You know how that chicken...I found 
                        it gross...inedible.

                                 ROBERT
                        Yes.

                                 DERRICK
                        I haven’t wanted to eat anything 
                        until right now.

                                 ROBERT
                        What then? What is it?
           Derrick steps forward. He sniffs the air and looks straight 
           at his father.

                                 DERRICK
                        You.

           Robert runs this through his bank of memory. Something is 
           beginning to add up. Then Derrick notices the blood splatter 
           on Robert’s clothes.

                                 DERRICK
                        What happened to you?

                                 ROBERT
                        We have a small problem.

           Suddenly Derrick collapses in agonizing pain, bent over at 
           the gut. Robert runs to him. Grabs his elbow and helps him to 
           the living room where he sits him on the couch.

                                 DERRICK
                        Why do I feel this way?

           Robert kneels before Derrick. He studies him, but no longer 
           with that clinical glare, but fatherly.

                                 ROBERT
                        When we first tested the product we 
                        did rat trials. Something the rat 
                        did which we found odd but not 
                        concerning was eat all her young.

                                 DERRICK
                        You didn’t find that concerning?

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s common with rats.

                                 DERRICK
                        You know what I’m beginning to 
                        think? I’m beginning to think that 
                        you’re not as good a scientist as 
                        you claim to be.

                                 ROBERT
                        I missed all the signs. I didn’t 
                        follow protocol. I made decisions 
                        with my emotions instead of my 
                        mind.

                                 DERRICK
                        So what happened to the rat?
                                 ROBERT
                        She died. But then she came back to 
                        life. Which gave me the idea --

                                 DERRICK
                        To dig me up. Not terribly clear 
                        headed dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        No. Not clear headed at all. And 
                        then there was the dog.

                                 DERRICK
                        What dog?

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - NIGHT

           Robert stands over the still twitching corpse of the Dog. 
           Derrick stares dispassionately at the carnage.

                                 ROBERT
                        It was clearly feral, but it had no 
                        interest in me. Which makes me 
                        think...

                                 DERRICK
                        What?

                                 ROBERT
                        It was hungry for something else.

                                 DERRICK
                        What?

                                 ROBERT
                        Dog meat.
                             (beat)
                        If the proteins in the 
                        reconstituted cellular makeup are 
                        controlling the activity in the 
                        brain, then they trigger what we 
                        consider...cravings. Now lets 
                        assume that the proteins need to 
                        match up with familiar proteins, 
                        you will be less inclined to 
                        satiate with any food source other 
                        than those marked with a common 
                        cellular fingerprint.

                                 DERRICK
                        So the rat ate rat. The dog wanted 
                        dog and I got wicked craving for...
                                 (MORE)
                                 DERRICK (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 ROBERT
                        Which explains the ketosis. Your 
                        body is eating itself. If I can 
                        replicate a food source that would 
                        mimic human flesh. 

                                 DERRICK
                        Fucking disgusting. I won’t eat 
                        that.

                                 ROBERT
                        There’s one other thing.

                                 DERRICK
                        Yeah?

                                 ROBERT
                        Your condition is...infectious.
                        It seems to have properties that 
                        are, well, viral in nature.

                                 DERRICK
                        So I can give it to people?

                                 ROBERT
                        Theoretically, yes. It was your 
                        saliva that I injected into this 
                        dog. The only thing is that the 
                        dog, when it reanimated, wasn’t 
                        right.

           Derrick leans back against the wall. He slowly crouches down. 
           Hands over his face.

                                 DERRICK
                        This is unbelievable. What am I, 
                        not supposed to come in contact 
                        with anyone?

                                 ROBERT
                        Just let me figure it out. Until 
                        then. Stay quarantined.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S CAR - NIGHT

           Elizabeth drives as she dials a number on her cell. She looks 
           elated. 

           She waits a beat as the phone rings.
           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - WORKROOM - NIGHT

           Robert is crunching data when his cell rings. He looks at the 
           caller ID and answers.

                                 ROBERT
                        Elizabeth. Are you alright?

           INTERCUT WITH ELIZABETH IN THE CAR.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have wonderful news, Robert. 
                        Absolutely amazing.

                                 ROBERT
                        Tell me.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I mean, I was prepared. I’ve never 
                        been more scared in my life. Just 
                        the thought of losing her...but 
                        there was a miracle.

                                 ROBERT
                        A miracle?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        The doctors switched off the 
                        machines...

           ON ROBERT as Elizabeth’s voice drifts off. He looks upstairs. 
           Something’s not right.

           INT. DERRICK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Robert storms in. Derrick sits up in bed.

                                 ROBERT
                        What happened when you went to see 
                        Samantha?

                                 DERRICK
                        It’s personal, Dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        Did you touch her?

                                 DERRICK
                        Well, yeah, barely though.

                                 ROBERT
                        Did you kiss her?
                                 DERRICK
                        Of course I kissed her.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT

           Samantha lay in her bed. She’s breathing on her own.

           SUDDENLY - She wracks with pain. But she’s still asleep. As 
           her body straightens out.

           HER EYES POP OPEN. There’s something unfocused about them. 
           She turns her head and --

           Stares at the patient next to her. A STRING OF DROOL drips 
           off her lips.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert and Derrick race out of the house to Robert’s car. 
           They jump in.

           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - NIGHT

           Robert starts the car, slams on the gas and tears out of the 
           driveway.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A DOCTOR walks toward the ICU...

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT

           The DOCTOR enters and notices --

           Samantha’s EMPTY BED. Her I.V. hanging off its frame, 
           dripping blood and solution onto the tile floor.

           He quickly scans the ICU and sees SAMANTHA hunched over 
           another patient at the far end of the room.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Samantha.

           She doesn’t answer. He slowly approaches.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Honey. We really need you to get 
                        back into bed.
           As he gets closer he can make out the slow, slurpy, chewing 
           noises. He strains for a clearer look.

           Samantha’s muscles RIPPLE under her garment. Her JAW is 
           working hard, masticating.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Sam...

           A BLOOD STAIN BLOSSOMS across the white sheets and Samantha 
           turns.

           BLOOD DRIPS OFF HER CHIN as if she’s been face deep in the 
           abdomen of the DEAD PATIENT that lay before her.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Oh, my God. What have you done?

           Samantha cocks her head.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I was...
                             (searching for the word)
                        ...starving.

           The Doctor backs away. He bumps into a bed and falls onto his 
           ass.

           Samantha walks toward him. Her tongue is slow. She can’t find 
           the words. There’s something wrong with her mind.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Take it easy, Sam. We’ll get some 
                        help.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I...want...go...home.

           The Doctor gets to his feet, backing away.

                                 DOCTOR
                        We’ll call your mom. It’ll be okay.

           Samantha makes a jerky motion, like she’s going to run at 
           him.

           The Doctor reacts. Samantha smiles.

                                 DOCTOR
                        HELP!!!

           He turns and runs into the --
           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The Doctor turns out of the ICU, running hard when,

           SAMANTHA follows, bare feet tracking blood, she’s faster and 
           on the Doctor before he can get halfway down the hallway.

           She reaches for him and...GRABS HIM BY THE HAIR. Samantha 
           puts on the brakes and in a feat of speed and strength, she 
           whips the Doctor clear off his feet and --

           SMASHES HIS SKULL into the hard floor.

           Then she flips over on top of him, straddling him and GOES 
           FOR THE THROAT.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           WE HEAR THE SMASHING OF GLASS as...

           SAMANTHA leaps out the third story window. SHE LANDS ON HER 
           FEET AND --

           Her right knee POPS like snapcracker, bending dramatically in 
           a very wrong direction, but she stands up and as she walks...

           THE KNEE SEEMS TO GRIND AND CRACK AND SNAP BACK INTO PLACE. 

           She limps away, in the direction of the woods.

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING AREA - NIGHT

           The Sheriff walks up to the front desk. Leans across to the 
           SENIOR CITIZEN manning the phones.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Eloise. Word is that Samantha Leach 
                        is coming to.

                                 SENIOR CITIZEN
                        They’re keeping a sharp eye on her.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Mind if I head on up? Sit with her 
                        for a beat?

                                 SENIOR CITIZEN
                        Go right ahead, Sheriff. I’m sure 
                        she’d like that.

           The Sheriff raps on the desk with authority and heads toward 
           the elevators.
           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - NIGHT

           Robert turns to Derrick. He watches the trees pass in the 
           dark, but really he’s staring at his reflection in the 
           window.

                                 DERRICK
                        What are you going to do when we 
                        get there.

                                 ROBERT
                        I need to determine if Samantha is 
                        a danger.

                                 DERRICK
                        Why would she be a danger?

           Up ahead, the sign for the HOSPITAL looms.

                                 ROBERT
                        We need to avoid an outbreak. It’s 
                        possible she might not have your 
                        self control.

                                 DERRICK
                        Let me deal with her.

                                 ROBERT
                        If she can be dealt with at all.

                                 DERRICK
                        Can you not be so fucking clinical?

           Robert turns into the Hospital parking lot. It’s relatively 
           empty. Dead quiet. He spots the Sheriff’s PATROL CAR.

                                 ROBERT
                        Just work with me here, Derrick. 
                        It’s all I can do to keep this 
                        situation under control.

                                 DERRICK
                        You make it sound like I’m going to 
                        let you down, like I’m unreliable.

                                 ROBERT
                        Honestly, collaborating with a 
                        hormonal sixteen year old boy who 
                        only cares about seeing his 
                        girlfriend and demands personal 
                        freedoms works against the basic 
                        concept of a controlled test 
                        environment.
           Robert parks close to the entrance.

                                 DERRICK
                        Helps explain why I failed biology.

                                 ROBERT
                        Actually it doesn’t. It would seem, 
                        however, that those worries are now 
                        in the past.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS - NIGHT

           Robert and Derrick enter through the waiting room. It’s 
           eerily empty. No one at the admission’s desk. No security.

           Just the dim hum of machines and hospital technology. Robert 
           looks down the hallway.

                                 ROBERT
                        Hello???

           He turns to Derrick.

                                 ROBERT
                        Where was Samantha.

                                 DERRICK
                        Third floor.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Robert and Derrick ride up to the third floor. It’s slow 
           going.

                                 DERRICK
                        It’s a skeleton staff anyway. 
                        Probably no more than two or three 
                        doctors on duty.

                                 ROBERT
                        Probably. 

           The ELEVATOR DINGS. The doors open.

           The HALLWAY IS EMPTY. THE NURSE’S STATION...EMPTY. LIGHTS 
           FLICKER FROM THE ICU down the hall.

           Robert and Derrick step out of the elevator.
           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As the elevator doors close, Robert takes note. Then he 
           shoots a glance down the hallway.

                                 ROBERT
                             (down the hall)
                        HELLO???

           No answer.

                                 ROBERT
                        ANYONE???

           Still nothing. Derrick notices something...

                                 DERRICK
                        Blood?

           He slowly approaches the pool of blood in the hallway.

           Then a MAN’S VOICE...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Help me...

           Robert turns to --

           A SECURITY GUARD, 35ish, bleeding badly, but walking is 
           stumbling toward them. His gun hangs loosely from his right 
           hand. 

           The Security Guard lifts his arm. Aims.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You one of them?

           Robert cautiously approaches. He holds his hands up.

                                 ROBERT
                        We can help.

           The Security Guard laughs.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        There ain’t no one left to help, 
                        buddy. Everyone’s dead...or 
                        something like it.

           DERRICK’S POV - DOWN THE HALL, a FEMALE PATIENT, completely 
           nude, exits the ICU. She seems to be dragging something.

           The Woman turns and we see that this was the patient Samantha 
           had been feeding on. 
           She takes shaky steps and yes, that thing she’s dragging are 
           her own intestines roped out behind her.

           The Security Guard takes a few cautious steps forward, 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Speak up, lady, or I will put you 
                        down.

           But the Woman doesn’t answer. Instead, she SNIFFS the air and 
           begins walking quickly toward the Security Guard.

           She’s deadlocked on him. Security Guard raises his gun. Aims 
           at her shoulder.

           Robert NOTICES A FIRE AXE HANGING IN A CASE.

           Now she’s walking FAST. Her lips are curled in a snarl. Pure 
           hunger.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I fucking warned you.

           She’s unfazed and keeps coming.

                                 ROBERT
                        Shoot her in the head.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        And who the fuck are you?

                                 ROBERT
                        Do it.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I said, stop right the fuck there, 
                        lady.

           The Woman is getting closer, faster. Her bloody entrails 
           creating a slick on the floor.

           Security Guard doesn’t have a choice. He fires a round --

           INTO HER SHOULDER. She JERKS from the impact, but doesn’t 
           stop. 

                                 ROBERT
                        In the head.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        What?

                                 ROBERT
                        Shoot her in the head.
           He aims for the head, but the bullet tears into her neck. She 
           JERKS again, but keeps moving, faster and with more 
           determination.

           Robert presses himself against the wall as she races past him 
           and Derrick. She kind of glances at Robert, sniffing, but the 
           Security Guard must smell tastier.

           When she’s almost upon him.

           Robert STOMPS DOWN ON THE TRAIL OF INTESTINES and...

           The Woman is PULLED OFF HER FEET and lands SMACK ON HER BACK 
           and looks up just as --

           ROBERT SWINGS THE FIRE AXE right at her head, cleaving her 
           neck and cutting her head clean off.

           Her body TWITCHES, still alive, but directionless. The head 
           dies.

           Security Guard looks down on her.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        What is happening?

                                 ROBERT
                        Your welcome.

           The Security Guard hits the button for the elevator.

                                 ROBERT
                        Have you been bitten?

           The elevator doors open.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        No. And I don’t plan on it.

           He turns to the elevator, but...

           THE DOCTOR, his throat eviscerated, appears from behind the 
           nurse’s station and is on him and sinks his teeth into the 
           Security Guard’s throat.

           A GEYSER OF BLOOD sprays out and he drops the gun.

           ROBERT PICKS UP THE GUN and AIMS IT AT THE DYING, SCREAMING 
           SECURITY GUARD and with one shot --

           BLOWS BOTH THEIR HEADS OFF.

                                 DERRICK
                        Holy shit.
           Robert hands Derrick the axe.

                                 ROBERT
                        We’ve got a mess to clean up.

           Derrick stares at the carnage.

                                 DERRICK
                        Badass.

           Derrick follows Robert toward the ICU. Gruesome sounds echo 
           down the hallway. Sounds like a pack of wolves at an all you 
           can eat buffet.

           Robert raises the gun.

                                 DERRICK
                        Dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        Samantha. I know. But you see what 
                        this has become?

                                 DERRICK
                        It’s my problem. Alright?

           Robert looks at his son. There’s a new found respect brewing 
           both ways.

           And they enter the ICU.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ICU - CONTINUOUS

           If they haven’t been devoured, they’ve been turned. Two 
           PATIENTS, four NURSES and three DOCTORS are busy feeding on 
           several dead patients.

           The carnage is ankle deep. As soon as Robert and Derrick 
           enter, the flesheaters smell them and are distracted from 
           their orgiastic food fest.

                                 ROBERT
                        Dan!!!

           The SHERIFF turns. They’ve eaten away his eyes. He chews 
           what’s in his mouth with hungry relish and sniffs the air for 
           fresh meat.

                                 DERRICK
                        Holy shit.
                             (beat)
                        On the bright side --
                                 ROBERT
                        Don’t say it.

                                 DERRICK
                        Okay, but you know what I’m 
                        thinking.

           A NURSE is the first to pounce. She separates from the group, 
           her RIGHT HAND a mess of ripped flesh and torn ligaments and 
           completely ignoring Derrick, RUNS right at Robert.

           Robert raises the gun, but is off balance. He fires off a 
           shot that goes wild and then another that PINGS OFF the side 
           of the Nurse’s skull.

           It doesn’t slow her down and now the others are moving toward 
           him, some quicker than others.

                                 DERRICK
                        Dad!!!

                                 ROBERT
                        Run, Derrick, run.

           But they ignore Derrick as they pass him, hungry for Robert.

           He fires off another shot. This time nailing the Nurse right 
           in the center of her forehead.

           She goes down. But the others are too many. His nerves 
           getting the best of him, he fires recklessly and when they 
           are just about on him, trapping him against the wall...

                                 ROBERT
                        Derrick, I’m sorry.

           He holds the gun under his chin, ready to pull the trigger.

           SUDDENLY, Derrick comes in swinging the fire axe. Oddly, the 
           flesheaters don’t even acknowledge him.

           Derrick grabs one patient, closest to Robert, a PONYTAILED 
           WOMAN, by her hair and whips her into some monitors. But 
           starved for meat, she quickly gets to her feet, all the 
           while...

                                 ROBERT
                        Get them in the head or neck. Aim 
                        for the brain stem.

           Robert takes aim again. Closer is better and he puts a slug 
           right through the eye of a FEMALE DOCTOR.
           The Sheriff runs blindly toward them, tripping over beds to 
           get to Robert. He climbs atop a mattress and launches himself 
           at Robert who --

           GRABS AN IV STAND and PLUNGES IT THROUGH THE SHERIFF’S EYE.

           Derrick swings the axe, taking out two DOCTORS in three quick 
           hacks.

           Robert shoots another NURSE, and as PONYTAIL crawls in blood 
           toward Robert, he places the gun as close to the back of her 
           head and pulls the trigger, putting her down.

           Derrick lowers the axe. He looks at his father just as...

           THE PATIENT they were feeding on, is hobbling toward them. An 
           obese bypass patient, the SCAR ON HIS CHEST pulling at the 
           stitches, he stands on half eaten legs.

           Robert turns. He raises the gun and walks toward BYPASS. But 
           Bypass is three generations of the virus in. He’s only 
           focused on eating and it’s motivating him. He’s fast. 

           Robert pulls the trigger. Nothing. Empty.

           He turns as DERRICK, runs at him with the raised axe and 
           PLANTS IT RIGHT IN BYPASS’S SKULL.

           Bypass stands there. Dull surprise across his dead face. And 
           then he drops to his knees.

           Derrick pulls the axe out of his head.

                                 ROBERT
                        Thank you.

                                 DERRICK
                        No problem.

           INT. HOSPITAL - SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

           Robert searches for chemicals. He finds what he needs.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Derrick loads the last of the dead into the open elevator. 
           Robert is carrying a gallon bottle.

                                 DERRICK
                        What’s that?
                                 ROBERT
                        Basically, a bomb.

           Robert douses the dead bodies with the liquid.

                                 DERRICK
                        You can’t just set the hospital on 
                        fire.

                                 ROBERT
                        The elevator shaft will keep the 
                        blaze contained. At least long 
                        enough for the fire department to 
                        get here.

                                 DERRICK
                        We were lucky, weren’t we?

                                 ROBERT
                        Not if we don’t find Samantha 
                        before she does this again and we 
                        can’t control it.

           He lights the bodies on fire. They go up in a WHOOSH of 
           flame.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Samantha walks with determination, her bare feet stomping 
           broken twigs and desiccated leaves.

           ON HER FOOT - as it is IMPALED by sharp branch.

           Samantha looks down. Not even feeling the pain, she tears the 
           branch from her foot. She continues on.

           Ahead, the lights of a neighborhood dot the treeline.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE -  BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Elizabeth is showering. Thick steam fills the bathroom as she 
           washes the day off her body.

           She THINKS she hears a sound. She sticks her head out of the 
           shower and listens.

           Then she reaches over to check her phone. No new messages.

           She slips back into the shower and we move out of the 
           bathroom...THROUGH THE...
           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           To the top of the stairs, where we hear as steady KNOCKING on 
           the front door.

           And then we’re moving down the stairs toward the door. It’s 
           very dimly lit, only illuminated by the moonlight streaming 
           through the windows. The knocking doesn’t change its rhythm, 
           just a constant rapping of knuckles against the wooden frame. 
           It stops.

           And SUDDENLY, Elizabeth, covering herself with a towel, 
           rushes past us to look through the peephole --

           ELIZABETH’S POV - There’s no one out there.

           Elizabeth opens the door. A cool wind blows leaves into the 
           house.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Hello???

           No answer. She quickly slams to the door to REVEAL --

           SAMANTHA STANDING BESIDE HER. Her head dropped and shoulders 
           hunched, she looks up under the crest of her brow.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mommy.

           Elizabeth is shocked, but a mother’s instinct throws her 
           toward her daughter.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Samantha.

           She tentatively grabs Samantha by her shoulders.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Are you alright? How did you leave 
                        the hospital?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Mommy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yes, love?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m sooooo...hungry.

           Elizabeth hugs Samantha. She pulls away.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        I should call the hospital.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        So hungry.

           And now Elizabeth is beginning to recognize that something’s 
           wrong with Sam. She lifts up her face. Stares into her eyes.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Come, sweetie, let’s get you sat 
                        down.

           She tries to lead Sam to the living room, but Samantha stands 
           rigid, her lips PEELING BACK aggressively.

           Elizabeth FLICKS ON THE HALLWAY LIGHT.

           Samantha turns to her mother, eyes fluttering, teeth bared. 
           Elizabeth is distracted by the copious amount of BLOOD 
           COVERING SAMANTHA’S BODY.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Sam?

           Samantha lunges.

           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - NIGHT

           Robert drives fast, taking country road turns, crossing over 
           the double line.

                                 ROBERT
                        Just from basic observations, it 
                        seems that the molecular 
                        regeneration deteriorates 
                        generationally. Each of those 
                        people back there displayed a 
                        unique level of cognisance the 
                        lowest level driven simply to 
                        attack and eat.
                             (beat)
                        But, they didn’t attack you. They 
                        must sense the change in you.

           He looks over to Derrick. He’s staring out the window.

                                 DERRICK
                        Because, really, I’m no different 
                        from them.
                                 ROBERT
                        I will fix it. I promise. Can you 
                        forgive me, Derrick?

                                 DERRICK
                        You’re only doing what you know.

           Robert stares off down the dark road.

                                 ROBERT
                        I always wanted us to spend more 
                        time together.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I did things the wrong way. 
                        Put too much time into my work...

                                 DERRICK
                        It’s okay, Dad.

                                 ROBERT
                        No. It’s not. You live your life 
                        thinking all those moments are 
                        going to amount to some great 
                        meaning, but really all those 
                        moments are lost in time. The only 
                        thing that matters is what’s 
                        happening in the present.

                                 DERRICK
                        Well it looks like we’re finally 
                        getting that quality father and son 
                        time after all. Personally, I would 
                        have preferred a fishing trip.

           Robert laughs. Derrick laughs as well. And soon the two of 
           them are in hysterics.

           Robert crosses the double line and SUDDENLY, ONCOMING FIRE 
           TRUCKS SCREAM AROUND THE CORNER AND INVADE HIS LANE!!!

           Robert cranks the wheel, just missing the trucks, their 
           SIRENS wailing into the distance. Derrick kicks his feet up 
           on the dash.

                                 DERRICK
                        Don’t worry, Dad, if you die I’ll 
                        just pump you full of your magic 
                        potion and then the two of us can 
                        hang out all we want.

           Robert gathers himself behind the wheel.

                                 ROBERT
                        Special times.
           EXT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Robert drives slowly down the driveway toward the dimly lit 
           house.

           He parks behind Elizabeth’s car. He and Derrick get out and 
           begin walking toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR.   

           Robert quickens his pace.

                                 DERRICK
                        Dad, if she is here, let me deal 
                        with it.

           But Robert’s not listening. As he runs up to the door...

                                 ROBERT
                        ELIZABETH!!!

           Derrick comes up behind him. The house is dark and seemingly 
           empty.

                                 DERRICK
                        You don’t think --

                                 ROBERT
                        I don’t know.
                             (beat)
                        ELIZABETH!!!

           Robert’s voice echoes through the house.

                                 DERRICK
                        You check upstairs. I’ll check 
                        Sam’s room.

           Robert starts off.

                                 DERRICK
                        If you see her...call for me. 
                        Promise me.

                                 ROBERT
                        I promise.

           As Robert ascends the stairs...

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Derrick walks slowly toward Samantha’s room.

                                 DERRICK
                        Sam???
           He stands in front of the door and afraid of what might be 
           inside, his hand hovers over the doorknob.

           Finally, he opens it and ENTERS THE ROOM.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - SAMANTHA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Memories of a life that once was. Derrick walks amidst the 
           perfectly made bed, the rows of photographs, collages. 
           Derrick’s friends who not two weeks earlier were alive and 
           happy.

           Derrick picks up a photo of his crew. Samantha is kissing the 
           side of his face. Pure bliss.

           A TEAR forms in Derrick’s eye.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           BARE FEET run with determination, slapping against the wooden 
           floor.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - SAMANTHA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Derrick picks up Samantha’s pillow. He buries his face in her 
           scent.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Samantha clears the corner and sprints for her open door.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - SAMANTHA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Derrick puts down the pillow and HEARS FOOTFALLS SPRINTING 
           down the hallway, he turns just as...

           SAMANTHA bursts into the room and LEAPS at Derrick and --

           CLINGS ONTO HIM. She wraps her legs around his waist and 
           clutches onto his neck.

           He stands there, holding her, not sure what to do, when she 
           pulls away from him and stares into his eyes. It’s hard for 
           her to articulate...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        My...love.

           Derrick grasps onto her. Decimated by her affection.
                                 DERRICK
                        Sam, I missed you so much.
                             (beat)
                        Are you alright?

           But she just nestles into Derrick’s shoulder. A child 
           searching for warmth.

                                 DERRICK
                        I’ve got you now. I’ll take care of 
                        you.

           She holds on tighter.

           Suddenly ROBERT APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY. He’s holding a large 
           BUTCHER’S KNIFE.

           Samantha, spins off of Derrick and LUNGES FOR ROBERT, but 
           Derrick grabs her and holds her back.

                                 ROBERT
                        She’s not the same girl you fell in 
                        love with.

                                 DERRICK
                        Mom’s not the same girl you fell in 
                        love with. Does that give you the 
                        right to kill her?

                                 ROBERT
                        There’s something wrong with her 
                        Derrick.

                                 DERRICK
                        Then fix her.

                                 ROBERT
                        I wish I could. I just don’t know 
                        how. And right now, she’s 
                        dangerous. You know that.

           Samantha is snarling. Derrick turns on her.

                                 DERRICK
                        STOP IT!!!

           And oddly enough, Samantha obeys. A cloud of lucidity wafts 
           over her features.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        We can live.

                                 DERRICK
                        And we will.
                                 ROBERT
                        Don’t make this choice, Derrick.

                                 DERRICK
                        It’s already been made. It was made 
                        when you dug me out of that 
                        cemetary.

                                 ROBERT
                        I take the blame. That’s without 
                        question. But you, you’re talking 
                        about a dead future. Do you really 
                        think you can control her?

                                 DERRICK
                        I love her.

                                 ROBERT
                        You loved what she once was.

                                 DERRICK
                        You forget, Dad, that I’m not who I 
                        used to be either.

                                 ROBERT
                        If this gets out of control, 
                        Derrick, we’re talking pandemic. We 
                        need to stop it now. Put aside your 
                        high school crush. Please. Think 
                        about the position you’re putting 
                        me in.

                                 DERRICK
                        You don’t get it. You think you 
                        understand me, but you have no idea 
                        who I am.

           Robert takes a step toward them. He tightens his grip on the 
           handle of the knife.

                                 ROBERT
                        You sound like a teenager.

                                 DERRICK
                        I am a teenager.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’ll come to understand why I 
                        have to do this.

                                 DERRICK
                        Dad, don’t.
           Robert rushes Samantha, the KNIFE HELD HIGH, and is about to 
           bring it down against her lily white throat when --

           Derrick grabs Robert’s hand, takes his father by the throat 
           and THROWS HIM WITH AWESOME STRENGTH against the wall. 

           Robert slams into the plaster, but fueled by adrenaline, and 
           possibly the need to save the world, launches at Samantha 
           again.

           Derrick STEPS FORWARD and DELIVERS a HUGE PUNCH to the side 
           of Robert’s head. Robert’s eyes dim like the lights have been 
           switched off. He stumbles and falls onto the floor. 
           Unconscious.

           Derrick begins to grab clothes for Samantha. She stands 
           there, looking at Robert.

           A STRING OF DROOL drips from her lips. Derrick notices. And 
           then the pain comes. He doubles over, grabbing his stomach.

           Samantha croaks out...

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You need...to eat.

           She nods to Robert. Derrick stares at his father. He grabs 
           Samantha by the hand and races out of the room, slamming the 
           door behind them.

           INT. GAIL’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Gail enters from a morning jog. Out of breath, she checks her 
           phone. Walks through her house to the kitchen. We see the 
           fridge is decorated with children’s artwork...

           Frustrated, she dials a number.

           INT. RICK’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

           Rick’s cell phone rings. He stirs from his sleep and reaches 
           over to answer it.

                                 RICK
                        Gail. What is it?

           INTERCUT WITH GAIL --

                                 GAIL
                        I’m sorry to call so damn early.
                                 RICK
                        Come on then, what’s the problem? 
                        Is it Argentum?

                                 GAIL
                        You could say that. It’s Robert. 
                        There’s something I haven’t told 
                        you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - SAMANTHA’S ROOM - DAWN

           Rays of sunlight stream through the window, landing across 
           Robert’s face. Robert’s eyes flutter, responding it seems to 
           the constant beat of a body SLAMMING into the door. 

           He slowly comes to. Grabs his head in agony and looks up at --

           THE BEDROOM DOOR. It rattles on its hinges every time it’s 
           slammed up against.

           Robert gets to his knees and falls back again. Stares at the 
           door. He’s afraid.

           But he pulls himself up. Rubs the side of his head, tracing a 
           huge lump.

           He looks to the window. Seems quiet out there. Back to the 
           door. It shudders against the weight.

           Robert puts his hand on the doorknob and tests it, sure it’s 
           locked...

           But the knob twists and as the LATCH PULLS BACK INTO THE 
           DOOR,

           ELIZABETH SLAMS THROUGH THE DOOR and into the room.

           Robert falls back against the wall. Elizabeth turns to him.

           ROBERT’S POV - In the MIRROR, we see Elizabeth’s BACK, a 
           scarred, ground beef mess of sinew and spine.

           Yet, from the front she looks normal. Just plain mad.

           She runs full bore at Robert. He dives for the KNIFE ON THE 
           FLOOR. Grabs it. Turns.

                                 ROBERT
                        Please forgive me.
           Elizabeth leaps at him and ROBERT PLUNGES THE KNIFE UP 
           THROUGH HER JAW and out the back of the neck.

           Still, she claws at him, but he TWISTS THE BLADE, cracking 
           through her spinal column. It’s as if her face goes dead, but 
           her body continues its attack, in spasm. 

           Robert scuttles away from her. He watches with a deep sadness 
           in his eyes.

           EXT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Robert steps outside. He notices his truck is missing, but 
           sees Elizabeth’s car parked in the driveway.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Robert finds Elizabeth’s purse. Grabs her keys.

           INT. GAIL’S TRUCK - DAY

           Gail drives Rick down the country roads. Rick tries 
           calling...

                                 RICK 
                             (into phone)
                        Robert, it’s important. Call me 
                        back ASAP. I got DeMonde crawling 
                        up my ass and your job on the line.

           He hangs up.

                                 RICK
                        Motherfucker.

                                 GAIL
                        He’s had a rough time.

                                 RICK
                        Agreed. The board, however wants 
                        results, not liabilities. I’ve done 
                        just about everything to protect 
                        his arrogant ass, but stealing 
                        highly sensitive scientific 
                        materials is too goddamn much.

                                 GAIL
                        We’ll go over there and talk to 
                        him.
                                 RICK
                        One ounce of uncooperative bullshit 
                        from him and I’m calling in a 
                        private fucking army to end him.

           Gail is quiet. She lays on the gas.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Gail pulls her truck to the front of the house and parks next 
           to Robert’s truck. She and Rick get out.

                                 GAIL
                        His truck is here. That’s 
                        promising.

                                 RICK
                        If we find him smeared in his own 
                        feces, you get to deal with it.

                                 GAIL
                        I’m sure it’s not going to be that 
                        bad.

                                 RICK
                        I always expect the worst. That way 
                        I’m always pleasantly surprised.

           They approach the front door. Rick rings the doorbell. They 
           wait. He looks at Gail.

                                 RICK 
                        For the record I don’t expect him 
                        to answer the door.

           Gail knocks and the door CREAKS OPEN. They just stand there 
           listening to the emptiness of the house.

                                 GAIL
                        What was your worst case scenario?

                                 RICK
                        Smeared in feces.

                                 GAIL
                        Hmm.

           She pushes the door open and steps inside.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Gail enters. Rick follows. Rick smells something...
                                 RICK
                        Smells like jungle rot in here.

           They step further into the foyer as we ANGLE UP.

           REVEAL - SAMANTHA hovers above them, spreadeagle, holding 
           onto the walls and ceiling with her hands and feet.

                                 GAIL
                        ROBERT???

                                 RICK
                        BOBBY!!!

           Now they’re directly underneath Samantha. Her teeth shred 
           back in a wicked snarl.

           Suddenly, Derrick steps into the hallway.

                                 DERRICK
                        Hello, Uncle Rick.

           Gail gasps. Rick steps forward. He turns to Gail, not even 
           acknowledging the phenomena before him.

                                 RICK
                        How’s this possible?

           Gail realizes.

                                 GAIL
                        Argentum.

                                 DERRICK
                        I am the world’s most successful 
                        regenerative face creme test 
                        subject.

           He steps forward. Rick takes a step back.

                                 DERRICK
                        That’s right, Uncle Rick. You 
                        should go. Before things 
                        get...complicated.

           Derrick is struck by the hunger. He creases at his waist. The 
           pain looks excruciating.

           Gail runs to him. He holds his hand out to stop her.

                                 DERRICK
                        Don’t come any closer.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DERRICK (CONT'D)
                        Trust me when I say you should 
                        leave.

                                 RICK
                        Where’s your father?

                                 DERRICK
                        We had a falling out.

                                 RICK
                        I’m not going anywhere until I see 
                        Robert.

           Derrick recovers, but is still in pain.

                                 DERRICK
                        Aren’t you even the slightest 
                        intrigued by this turn of events? 
                        You both saw me dead and buried. 
                        Are you so callous that this...
                             (re: himself)
                        is just another day at the office? 
                        What the fuck is wrong with you 
                        people?

                                 RICK
                        Frankly, I’d say this is a 
                        testament to your father’s pure 
                        genius. However, you are currently 
                        the property of DeMonde.

           Derrick looks at Rick like nothing could be more 
           preposterous.

                                 DERRICK
                        Oh. Sure. Let me just grab some 
                        clothes.
                             (beat)
                        I should mention something. There’s 
                        a side effect to being resurrected 
                        from the dead. Something I’ve been 
                        avoiding that maybe I need to come 
                        to terms with. After all. My 
                        girlfriend has...

           Samantha drops down from the ceiling. Rick spins to face her 
           and SHE LUNGES AT HIM.

           Rick SCREAMS as Samantha bites into his throat. Gail stares 
           in horror, suddenly splattered by blood.

           Samantha looks up at Gail, working her esophagus to swallow 
           down a huge chunk of meat. 
           Gail turns to Derrick.

                                 GAIL
                        Gracie. She ate all her young.

                                 DERRICK
                        Charming, isn’t it?

           Gail runs. She bolts into the heart of the house, but Derrick 
           is on her.

           She races up the stairs, taking five at a time. Turns the 
           corner. 

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Gail looks behind her. Derrick is fast, but almost not 
           trying.

                                 GAIL
                        Derrick, please. Maybe I can help 
                        you.

                                 DERRICK
                        What makes you think I need help?

           Gail looks around, searching for an escape.

                                 GAIL
                        You said yourself you don’t want to 
                        do this.

                                 DERRICK
                        I think you’re making more of it 
                        than I meant.
                             (beat)
                        What I really meant to say is that, 
                        well, I’ve always been a picky 
                        eater.

           Gail shudders at the thought. And that lights a fire under 
           her ass. She bolts for a smaller door that leads up toward 
           the...

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - ATTIC - DAY

           Gail slams the door behind her and locks it from the inside. 
           She runs up the stairs.

           The DOOR at the base of the stairs splinters off its hinges. 
           Derrick tears the pieces away.
           Gail sees her only way of escape, which could mean her death. 
           She runs hard for a STAINED GLASS WINDOW in the peak of the 
           attic.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Gail EXPLODES out the stained glass window, REACHING for the 
           close branches of a massive tree.

           DERRICK’S HAND falls onto her ANKLE and grasps it in a death 
           grip.

           Gail’s fingers skim the branches, but are then YANKED BACK --

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           And Derrick rips Gail back inside and with awesome strength 
           whips her through the room like a human boomerang.

           Gail SMASHES AGAINST the attic’s wooden beams. Out.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Derrick tosses Gail across the floor to --

           Samantha. She looks up, her face drenched in Rick’s blood.

                                 DERRICK
                        You do it. I...can’t.

           Samantha straddles Gail. As Gail’s eyes flutter open, 
           Samantha pulls back her fist and...

           PUNCHES A HOLE right through Gail’s chest. In a painfully 
           slow move, she grips onto and PULLS GAIL’S HEART OUT.

           Gail gasps and dies.

           Samantha holds the still beating heart out to Derrick. He 
           takes tentative steps toward her. Kneels before her and...

           BURIES HIS FACE IN HER HAND, WOLFING DOWN THE HEART. Finally 
           satiated. He looks up and GRINS, blood cascading down the 
           sides of his face. Happy.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

           Robert drives Elizabeth’s car, heading north.
           INT. ELIZABETH’S CAR - DAY

           Robert drives in silence. Finally he picks up his phone and 
           dials...

                                 ROBERT
                        Rick Attison’s office, please. It’s 
                        urgent.

                        Fine. Give him this message. Tell 
                        him Argentum has gone off the rails 
                        and we need to --

           Driving past his house he sees Gail’s truck parked next to 
           his Denali in the driveway. He throws down the phone and 
           SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

           Robert turns the car around and drives slowly up to his 
           house. He parks near the edge of the street.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S CAR - DAY

           Robert looks around the car, seemingly for a weapon. He hefts 
           her CLUB in his hand. Not pleased, he reaches for the glove 
           compartment. Opens it and hits the button for the trunk.

           He goes to close the glove, but notices...

           He moves some of the car’s documentation around to REVEAL...A 
           SMALL HANDGUN. A Sig Sauer. He grabs it and looks up at his 
           house in the distance.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Derrick cleans the blood off of Samantha. He’s gentle with 
           her, responsible for her, in love with her. But her eyes are 
           lost, controlled by her hunger.

                                 DERRICK
                        We can survive, Sam, but you’ve got 
                        to do what I tell you.
                             (beat)
                        We can’t just hurt people. It needs 
                        to be thought out. Planned.

           She looks down at him as he cleans the blood from her 
           stomach.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Or we...can live.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Robert runs along the treeline and then beelines for the 
           backyard.

           He sneaks along the edge of the house and slips around to the 
           back patio.

           He glances through the window into the kitchen.

           ROBERT’S POV - All clear.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Robert enters. He quietly shuts the door behind him. He can 
           hear the water running upstairs and carefully walks into 
           the...

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           He stops dead, seeing at the end of the hallway Gail’s body. 
           Strangely, or not so, Rick is missing. Robert, however, 
           doesn’t know that.

           He looks into the living room and spies the tools for the 
           fireplace.

           INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Robert stands over Gail’s corpse. In his right hand he holds 
           the fireplace shovel.

           He places it against her neck and with all his might --

           SLAMS HIS FOOT DOWN on the shovel. Again. Again. And Again. 
           Until with a CRACK, Robert severs her head.

                                 DERRICK (O.S.)
                        She wasn’t going to turn.

           Robert spins around. Samantha stands poised behind Derrick on 
           the stairs. She wears one of his mother’s prettier dresses.

                                 ROBERT
                        You fed.

           Derrick nods. Slightly ashamed, but rejuvenated.
                                 DERRICK
                        It didn’t have to go down the way 
                        it did. But it shows how Sam and I 
                        can survive without creating more 
                        of us.

                                 ROBERT
                        One mistake and that notion is 
                        dead. And then what?

                                 DERRICK
                        I promise you. All I ask is that 
                        you have some faith in me.

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s a lot to ask.

                                 DERRICK
                        Let me prove it to you.

           Robert looks at Samantha. She’s putting on a show...smiling 
           at him.

                                 ROBERT
                        You seem to have 
                        Samantha...controlled.

                                 DERRICK
                        She listens to me. Really, Dad, I 
                        can handle this thing.

           Robert puts the shovel down. Leaning it against the wall.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’ll need to go far away. And 
                        what will you do for food?

                                 DERRICK
                        We’ll be smart about it. Something 
                        I’ve figured out, if we can’t smell 
                        it, the hunger doesn’t really hit 
                        us.

                                 ROBERT
                        Until your body needs food.

                                 DERRICK
                        And then we’ll eat.

                                 ROBERT
                        Do I have a choice?

                                 DERRICK
                        No, Dad. You don’t.
           Robert holds his gaze. Beat.

                                 ROBERT
                        Then you’ll be careful.

                                 DERRICK
                        I’ll be careful. I mean, we. We’ll 
                        be careful. I mean it.

           Robert hangs his head. Defeated. He goes to the bottom of the 
           stairs and...

           HOLDS OUT HIS ARMS.

           Derrick walks down. He turns to Samantha and gestures for her 
           to stay put.

           He stands in front of Robert and then like a son who 
           desperately needs his father’s love, falls into his arms. 
           Robert hugs him, trying to inhale every bit of Derrick that 
           he can. To remember him as long as he lived...

           Because as he grasps at him with his left hand, he pulls 
           Elizabeth’s GUN and shaking, holds it to the side of 
           Derrick’s head.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m sorry it has to be this way.

                                 DERRICK
                        Don’t be sorry, Dad. We’ll be fine.

                                 ROBERT
                        I know we will.

           And ROBERT PULLS THE TRIGGER.

           Samantha SCREAMS and launches off the stairs. SHE SLAMS INTO 
           ROBERT, clinging onto his back and goes in for a nasty bite.

           Robert spins with her. Samantha watches in horror as Derrick 
           drops to the floor in a splash of blood. The look of 
           desperation in her eyes turns to seething hatred as...

           Robert slams Samantha into a large MIRROR. He desperately 
           holds her gnashing teeth away from him. He grabs her by the 
           neck and --

           FLIPS HER OVER. Her body TWISTS unnaturally, like a 
           contortionist. Robert stumbles back and Samantha charges him.

           He raises the gun, HER FOREHEAD IN HIS SIGHTS and FIRES.
           But Samantha just flicks her head to the left and bullet 
           grazes her skull, digging a trough through her bone, yet not 
           slowing her down at all.

           Robert tries to get off another shot, but Samantha is on him 
           and SLAMS HIM INTO THE SHATTERED MIRROR. 

           The GUN falls to the floor.

           She SHIMMIES up Robert’s torso and wraps her legs around his 
           neck and...

           PULLS HER HAND BACK as if she’s going to punch a hole through 
           his face.

           Robert RUNS straight at the far wall and just as she’s about 
           to hammer her fist into his forehead he slams her into the 
           TROPHY CASE --

           GLASS RAINS DOWN AROUND THEM and Robert stands there, waiting 
           for Samantha’s fist to hit him.

           Robert looks up at her, tentatively assessing the surprise on 
           her face her arm falls to her side and her mouth goes slack. 

           He backs away from the broken trophy case and turns to REVEAL  
           -- DERRICK’S MVP TROPHY sticking out the back of Samantha’s 
           head.

           And then, suddenly, she falls from Robert’s shoulders and 
           smacks, back first on the floor. The MVP TROPHY PUNCHES RIGHT 
           THROUGH THE BRIDGE OF HER NOSE.

           Robert backs away. He falls against the door, staring at the 
           carnage around him. He turns, gazing with incomparable 
           sadness at Derrick, still twitching, in a pool of blood.

           EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

           Robert exits. He’s covered in blood. The gun hangs in his 
           hand.

           In his other hand is an empty GAS CAN. The final drops spill 
           on the front stoop.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        What have you done?

           Robert raises his head --

           LAINEY BLOCK, 44, an emotional wreck of a woman, is standing 
           several feet off the front of the porch. She’s shaking, 
           seething with anger and confusion.
           Robert CLOSES THE FRONT DOOR.

                                 ROBERT
                        Lainey.

           His appearance doesn’t stop her from walking up the steps and 
           SLAPPING ROBERT across the face. And then she slaps him 
           again. And again. And then she just stands there, her tears 
           drying in the dark hollows of her eyes.

                                 LAINEY
                        What have you done, Robert?

                                 ROBERT
                        Things...got away from me.

                                 LAINEY
                        Take me to his grave. I want to see 
                        my son.

           Robert takes pause. Not the simplest request. Not the best 
           timing.

                                 ROBERT
                        Lainey...I have to do something 
                        right now.

                                 LAINEY
                        It can wait.

                                 ROBERT
                        It can’t.

           She stares at him.

                                 LAINEY
                        Then I’ll wait for you.

                                 ROBERT
                        No. Come with me. And then we can 
                        see Derrick. I promise.

                                 LAINEY
                        Fuck you, Robert. Fuck you. 
                        You...you killed my son, you 
                        fucking asshole. You killed him and 
                        now what do I have? You? I’m better 
                        off dead.
                             (beat)
                        Go. Do whatever you need to do. 
                        I’ll wait here.

                                 ROBERT
                        I can’t let you do that.
           Now she notices him, really, for the first time. The BLOOD. 
           The GUN. The EMPTY GAS CAN.

                                 LAINEY
                        What are you doing? Why do you have 
                        a gun?
                             (beat)
                        Are you going to burn down our 
                        house?

           Robert says nothing.

                                 LAINEY
                        I knew you were sick. I told people 
                        how you weren’t all there. I knew 
                        it.

                                 ROBERT
                        Then why did you leave Derrick with 
                        me? If you knew I was so sick...

                                 LAINEY
                        Don’t blame me, Robert.

           Robert holds up his hand, but he’s looking pretty crazy with 
           a gun against his palm.

                                 ROBERT
                        Let’s not do this. Not now. Come 
                        with me. Just for a little while.

                                 LAINEY
                        I’m not going anywhere with you.

           She pushes past him and he tries to grab her, but she’s a 
           powerful person and PUSHES him. Robert stumbles off the edge 
           of the porch, landing on the walkway.

           Lainey opens the door.

                                 ROBERT
                        Lainey. NO.

           And she’s confronted by the carnage in the foyer. It takes a 
           moment for her to realize than amongst the dead, lies 
           Derrick.

           And she SCREAMS.

           Robert’s POV - As Lainey stands in the doorway, screaming 
           when SUDDENLY, RICK, fully turned, TACKLES LAINEY out of our 
           line of vision. Her screams of anguish turn to howls of 
           terror as...
           Robert gets up. He picks up the gun and walks inside the 
           house and CLOSES THE DOOR. 

           SFX - TWO FINAL GUNSHOTS RING into the dawn.

           INT. ROBERT’S CAR - DAY

           Robert TWISTS the ignition. He lays the gun on the passenger 
           seat and HITS THE GAS.

           We pull back on Robert driving out of his driveway to...

           REVEAL -- ROBERT’S HOUSE GOING UP IN FLAMES. Windows popping 
           from the heat. Wood buckling and cracking. Hell fire.

           EXT. LAURANT DEMONDE COSMETICS - DAY

           Robert pulls up in his Denali. He parks directly in front. 
           Gets out.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE COSMETICS - DAY

           Robert enters the lobby. He’s a mess. He walks straight to 
           the elevators. A Security Guard steps between him and the 
           elevator.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Mr. Block, Miss DeMonde wants to 
                        see you immediately.

                                 ROBERT
                        Miss DeMonde will have to wait.

           The Security Guard stares at him. The elevator doors open.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You don’t look too good, Mr. Block.

                                 ROBERT
                        Noted.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I can’t let you down there without 
                        seeing Ms.--

           Robert SHOOTS the Security Guard right in the leg and then 
           pushes him into the elevator.
           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           The Security Guard is screaming as the elevator goes down. 
           Robert just looks ahead.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Jesus, fuck, I’m bleeding to death.

                                 ROBERT
                        There’s worse fates.

           The doors open and Robert steps into the hallway. The 
           elevator doors close on the screaming Guard.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - HALLWAY

           Robert walks toward Research and Development.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - LOBBY - DAY

           Cops raid the lobby. Hailey DeMonde greets them at the door. 
           She makes several mad gestures to get her point across.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Robert POURS a HIGHLY FLAMMABLE LIQUID all throughout the 
           research facility. He covers all of the equipment, test 
           animals cower at the odor.

           Then he runs to his computer and...

           PULLS UP ALL HIS FILES. A secretive man, he possesses 
           everything and begins the process of erasing it all.

           He pours the flammable liquid all over the desk and then 
           finally --

           ALL OVER HIMSELF.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - HALLWAY

           COPS burst from the stairwells and the elevator, followed by 
           Hailey DeMonde and several gawker employees.

           They race down the hallway toward R&D.
           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

           Robert stands in the center of the room and drenched in 
           highly combustible liquid he...

           LIGHTS A MATCH.

           INT. LAURANT DEMONDE - HALLWAY - DAY

           The Cops stampede toward Research and Development and Hailey 
           punches in the security code to open the door.

           The door opens to REVEAL -

           Robert stands with his back to the group. He’s rigid. Cops 
           take positions. Guns are cocked and ready.

           Hailey enters. A Cop tries to grab her.

                                 COP
                        You need to stand back.

                                 HAILEY
                        Fuck off.

           She pushes past him.

                                 HAILEY
                        Robert?

           Robert doesn’t move.

                                 HAILEY
                        Let’s talk about this Robert.

           As she gets closer, we push in on Robert. Around him. The 
           match in his hand is but a whisp of smoke, BURNED PAINLESSLY 
           INTO HIS FINGERTIPS.

           And then around his left side where we finally see it...a 
           BITE MARK, clearly Samantha’s parting gift.

           Around him until we’re back on Hailey DeMonde slowly 
           approaching.

                                 HAILEY
                        C’mon, Robert. Violence is not the 
                        answer.

           She puts her hand on his shoulder and on his face now, he 
           sniffs her presence and...
           SPINS on her, TEETH CLAMPED DOWN ON HER CHEEK. Hailey screams 
           as --

           A DOZEN COPS tear Robert off her. He bites one and then 
           another and then they fire on him, but he keeps coming until 
           one cop finally puts a bullet right in Robert’s EYE.

           He falls back against the cages of test animals. As we push 
           in on him, the mayhem spurned from Robert’s attack drifts 
           into the background like white noise.

           Closer on Robert until his ragged face is all there is and --

           SMASH CUT TO TITLE:

                      SUBJECT: ZERO

                                         The End
