                                 By Michael Vukadinovich

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

           The bus, full of impatient travelers, is stopped in traffic 
           on a snowy road. PETE, a sweet but antsy seven-year-old, sits 
           playing a handheld video game. His GRANDFATHER, in his 60s 
           with a slightly mischievous look, sits next to him. The 
           DRIVER makes an announcement on the PA:

                                 DRIVER
                        Get comfortable, folks. Looks like 
                        we’ll be stuck here awhile as they 
                        clear the snow.

           There’s a collective groan.

                                 PETE
                        Great, now we’ll never get there 
                        and we’ve already been driving for 
                        like a 100 years. 

                                 GRANDFATHER
                             (looking at his watch)
                        Has it been that long?

                                 PETE
                             (laughing)
                        I was exaggerating, Grandpa.

           The grandfather winks at him. He considers something and 
           after a moment reaches into his bag and pulls out a large, 
           wooden book that’s beautifully carved.

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        I wasn’t going to do this until 
                        later but now that we’re stuck we 
                        may as well begin.

                                 PETE
                        What is that?

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        I’m going to tell you a story, 
                        Pete. Which means you need to turn 
                        off the game.

           Pete gives him a look like he’s crazy.
                                 GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
                        I know what you’re thinking. Stuck 
                        on a bus with your grandpa and no 
                        video games to play? That’s how 
                        kids die of boredom. But I think 
                        you’re going to like this one.

           Pete looks at the wooden book and considers.

                                 PETE
                             (not convinced)
                        Well, what’s it about?

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        It’s a true story full of 
                        misfortune, love and adventure. A 
                        story it’s about time you heard, 
                        because it’s partly your story.

                                 PETE
                        My story?

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        Yes, indeed. One thing I’ve learned 
                        is that it takes a great deal of 
                        occurrences, marvels, and 
                        curiosities for each of us to end 
                        up on this earth, and if we never 
                        learn these stories we never really 
                        learn who we truly are. Now the 
                        hero of this story lived a life 
                        full of great misfortunes.

                                 PETE
                        It’s not sad, is it?

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        Like all good stories it’s sad in 
                        parts and happy in others. Just 
                        like lives tend to be. Is that 
                        okay?

           Pete nods and puts the game away. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
                        Good. Now let’s see...

           He opens the book to a page reading:

           THE FIRST MISFORTUNE

           The text continues underneath. On the opposite page is a 
           beautifully detailed woodcarving of a woman lying in a 
           hospital room.
                                 GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        The first misfortune came in 
                        youth... 

           We CLOSE IN on the wood panel as it FADES into reality:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           We begin in the year 1919 in rural America. In a bright room 
           the woman, EVE, gives birth with great ease. Outside the 
           window the sun shines. Her husband, ADAM, watches nervously 
           as the DOCTOR works. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        ...though he was born into bliss.

           The DOCTOR hands Eve a beautiful, shining baby boy.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s a boy.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, thank god.

           He clears his throat as Eve shoots him a look.

                                 EVE
                             (looking down at the baby)
                        He’s beautiful.

                                 ADAM
                        He’s perfect.

           The new parents share a look of complete happiness. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Have you thought of a name?

                                 EVE
                        Geppetto Henri Pedro Nikolai 
                        Woodmaker.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It suits him perfectly.

           They all look down at Geppetto, beaming.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        It was a collection of the names of 
                        their tour guides from each of the 
                        countries the young parents had 
                        visited together.

                        They figured it would give their 
                        son a personality combined from the 
                        best traits around the world.

           We FLASH through a series of black and white photographs:

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        The joy of life from Italy.

           -Adam and Eve stand in front of the leaning tower of Pisa as 
           a very Italian tour guide tosses a pizza happily. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        The intellectualism of France.

           -Adam and Eve eat a baguette in front of the Eifel tower as a 
           very French tour guide smokes nearby, reading Descartes.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        The carefreeness of Mexico.

           -Adam and Eve lounge on the gulf of Mexico eating tacos in 
           hammocks as a Mexican tour guide catches a fish for them.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        And the hardiness of Russia.

           -Adam and Eve stand in a snow storm wearing soviet hats and 
           eating a bowl of goulash as a Russian tour guide is passed 
           out drunk on the ground with a bottle of vodka.

           INT. HOSPITAL

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But it would be the boy’s family 
                        name, Woodmaker, that would define 
                        him most in his life.

           We PULL BACK from the happy family and move down the hall, 
           passing rooms full of wounded WWI vets, coming to a much 
           darker room where another boy is born. There are horrible 
           screams of pain. Outside the window is a terrible rain storm. 
           The ugly MOTHER struggles on the bed as the DOCTOR works.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        At that very moment another boy was 
                        brought into the world under very 
                        different circumstances. 

           The child is finally born. The doctor holds him up with a 
           disgusted look, quickly handing him off to the mother.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Have you thought of a name?

                                 MOTHER
                        Edmund. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Edmund Vile.

                                 MOTHER
                        It’s pronounced Ve-lay!!!

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        As if to cancel all the goodness in 
                        Geppetto’s small heart, this child 
                        was born evil and dark.

           Thunder crashes outside. The doctor backs out of the room.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well I’ll let you two have some 
                        alone time.

           He turns and runs. The mother looks down at the new baby, 
           EDMUND.

                                 MOTHER
                        This world is hard, tough and 
                        unfair. You will need to do 
                        everything you can to get ahead or 
                        you will die in a gutter like your 
                        father.

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S HOME - DAY

           A beautiful house in the country. Geppetto, 4, plays in the 
           front yard with a dog as his parents watch from the porch.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Geppetto’s first years of life were 
                        perfection itself and his life 
                        seemed to be excessively blessed.

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           Geppetto, 11, skips a stone on the surface of a beautiful 
           lake. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        He was surrounded by nature.

           It seems to skip endlessly.
           INT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Geppetto is the only student raising his hand as the TEACHER 
           looks over the students.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        He excelled at school.

                                 TEACHER
                        Yes, Geppetto.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        76,486,233 and 7/8ths.

                                 TEACHER
                        Correct!

           All of the girls give him love eyes, but he only pays 
           attention to one special girl, JULIA MOON, who shyly looks 
           away from him. In the corner Edmund scowls at him.

           EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND

           Edmund pitches to Geppetto with the bases loaded in the 
           bottom of the 9th. The score is tied. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And exceeded at sports.

           Edmund throws the ball and Geppetto hits a home run. A CROWD 
           OF GIRLS cheer his full name: Geppetto Henri Pablo Nikolai 
           Woodmaker!

           Edmund throws his glove down angrily. From the stands Julia 
           gives Geppetto a little wave as he runs the bases. He smiles 
           back. Her FATHER, a stern man, sees the exchange and 
           immediately leads her away by the hand, disapprovingly.

           EXT. PARK - EVENING

           A group of kids watch a Charlie Chaplin movie projected onto 
           the side of a building. They laugh and have a great time. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And he found at a young age what 
                        many search for their whole lives.

           Geppetto looks up at a large, two-story house and sees Julia 
           looking down at them longingly from her bedroom window. A 
           girl sitting next to him, SCARLET, sees him looking at her.
                                 SCARLET
                        Forget about Julia Moon or her 
                        father will kill you.

           In the window Julia’s father scolds Julia and closes the 
           curtains shut.

                                 SCARLET (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be your girlfriend, Geppetto.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Sorry, Scarlet.

           Geppetto looks back up at the closed window. Scarlet is 
           disappointed.

           EXT. JULIA’S HOME - LATER

           Geppetto climbs a rain gutter up the side of her house, 
           almost falling on the trash cans below. Finally, he makes it 
           to her window and knocks. She smiles when she sees him.

           INT. JULIA’S ROOM - LATER

           Julia’s room is full of delicately made paper objects, such 
           as animals and flowers. Geppetto has a mustache drawn on, a 
           little cane, and a hat and acts out the movie for her, 
           attempting to perform Chaplin’s great vaudeville moves in 
           front of a hanging sheet. Julia can’t help but laugh.

           Julia’s father enters and Geppetto dives into a wardrobe. Mr. 
           Moon looks at Julia and then at the shaking wardrobe. He 
           opens it to find Geppetto covered in Julia’s clothes. 
           Geppetto smiles innocently.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Good evening, sir.

           Mr. Moon takes the cane from his hands and holds it up.

                                 MR. MOON
                        I’m going to beat you blue!

           He swings the cane at him but Geppetto jumps between his legs 
           just in time and runs up to Julia.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m sorry, I have to be getting 
                        home now.

           He kisses her and something happens when their lips meet, a 
           shared feeling that their love is fated. 
           Geppetto pulls back with a look of complete wonder on his 
           face while Julia smiles as wide as possible -- the best 
           moment of her life.

                                 MR. MOON
                             (running at Geppetto 
                              furiously)
                        Stay away from her!

           Geppetto kisses her again quickly.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Just wanted to make sure the first 
                        time wasn’t a fluke. 

                                 JULIA
                        Was it?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No.

           He jumps out the window just as Mr. Moon slams the cane down 
           on the windowsill, shattering it. Geppetto slides off the 
           roof and lands on the trash cans below. Mr. Moon and Julia 
           watch as he gets up covered in garbage and runs down the 
           street with a huge foolish grin on his face, people staring 
           as he passes by.

                                 MR. MOON
                             (shouting)
                        Never step foot on my property 
                        again you ragamuffin!

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (turning back)
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Moon, but I don’t 
                        think that will be possible since 
                        I’m going to marry your daughter. 
                        That’s a promise.

           Mr. Moon is flabbergasted as Julia beams.

                                 JULIA
                             (calling after)
                        You’re a prince, Geppetto. And I’m 
                        a princess.

           Her father looks down at his daughter, troubled and confused 
           by her reaction, but she just keeps watching Geppetto run 
           away with a smile on her face. He’s won her heart.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And it might as well have been 
                        true. 
           I/E. GEPPETTO’S HOME - NIGHT

           Geppetto lays in bed holding a tin can attached to a string 
           to his ear. We follow the string out the window, through the 
           front yard, over a gate, down a path to a dirt road and 
           through the town past people kissing, drinking and fighting. 
           We pass a speakeasy where a man gives a secret knock, opening 
           the door and revealing happy people inside. We then pass a 
           church where everyone looks depressed inside. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        They say when you find the love of 
                        your life your heart begins to beat 
                        a little differently.

           We follow the string up the side of Julia’s house and into 
           her bedroom window where she lays in bed holding the can to 
           her heart. Her heart has an unusual, almost musical beat.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        This was true of Geppetto and 
                        Julia.

           EXT. TOWN STREET - NIGHT

           Edmund cuts the string with scissors.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But by nature of being so good 
                        Geppetto made a true enemy for 
                        himself.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Geppetto rides with his parents, sitting in the back seat. 
           They laugh and smile as happy as can be listening to the 
           radio.

                                 RADIO
                        That’s right folks, this analyst 
                        says invest, invest, invest! The 
                        twenties are rolling, the cash is 
                        flowing and there’s no end in 
                        sight. 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Ahead of the car, in front of a railroad crossing, Edmund 
           sees them coming and throws nails onto the road. He then 
           hides behind a tree. The car drives over the nails, popping 
           all the wheels, and comes to a stop on the railroad track.
           INT. CAR

           The family looks at each other with concern as the car lowers 
           from the escaping air. Adam hits the gas and revs the engine 
           but it doesn’t budge. A train approaches in the distance. 

                                 RADIO
                        Wait a minute folks, this just in! 
                        The markets have crashed!!! We’re 
                        ruined! RUINED!!!

           Adam keeps trying the gas but the car won’t budge. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Now any reasonable person caught in 
                        such a predicament would simply 
                        exit the car. And Geppetto’s young 
                        parents were no doubt reasonable 
                        people.

                                 FATHER
                        Everyone out!

           Geppetto gets out but his parent’s stay put.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But at that exact moment genetics 
                        had other plans. For Geppetto’s 
                        father had a family history of 
                        heart attacks.

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           1. Geppetto’s grandfather has a heart attack while scoring a 
           monster film as part of an orchestra in a movie theater.

           2. Geppetto’s great grandfather, a doctor, has a heart attack 
           while listening to a patient’s heart with a stethoscope.

           3. Geppetto’s great, great grandfather has a heart attack 
           while working atop a lighthouse. He falls onto the light, 
           shining it directly onto a ship and collapses, turning the 
           light off. The ship crashes into shore in the background.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        And at that moment he followed in 
                        the tradition.

           We CLOSE IN on Adam as he has a heart attack.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        And poor Geppetto’s sweet mother 
                        had a family history of going 
                        catatonic at the most unfortunate 
                        of times. A condition known as 
                        short term inconvenient catatonia.

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           1. Geppetto’s grandmother gets married in a church, going 
           catatonic when it’s her turn to speak. Thinking she’s changed 
           her mind the groom runs out crying.

           2. Geppetto’s great grandmother goes catatonic while skiing 
           down a mountain. 

           3. Geppetto’s great, great grandmother steers a ship. The 
           lighthouse in the distance blinds her eyes before turning off 
           and she goes catatonic, crashing into shore.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        And at that moment she followed in 
                        tradition.

           We CLOSE IN on Eve as she goes catatonic.

           Geppetto watches helplessly as the train approaches, its horn 
           blowing. He tries to get his parents out but there isn’t 
           time. The train smacks into the car! Poor Geppetto is 
           devastated. The world as he knows it comes to an end.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        I will say, however, that poor, 
                        little Geppetto was fortunate in 
                        this: the history of heart attacks 
                        on his paternal side and the 
                        propensity for short term 
                        inconvenient catatonia on his 
                        maternal side cancelled each other 
                        out so he’d never have to worry 
                        about either ailment for the rest 
                        of his days. Though that was of 
                        little consolation in the moments 
                        after his parents were pummeled by 
                        a train.

           EXT. FUNERAL - DAY

           It rains heavily as Geppetto and the gathered townspeople 
           watch his parent’s caskets being lowered into the ground. He 
           looks up to see Julia. They share a moment much beyond their 
           years. Edmund moves in next to Julia and gives Geppetto a 
           look of victory.
                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Edmund had gotten what he wanted.

           Geppetto then looks past them at a craggy, old woman. This is 
           his AUNT EUNICE.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        After the death of his parents 
                        Geppetto would have to go live very 
                        far away with his aunt Eunice. A 
                        horrid and foul woman.

           She gives him a yellow, rotting smile.

           EXT. GEPPETTO’S HOME - DAY

           Geppetto drags his over-stuffed suitcase as he sadly walks 
           away from his childhood home. Eunice waits in the back seat 
           of her jalopy car for him. Before he gets to the car Julia 
           runs up.

                                 JULIA
                        Geppetto! Wait!

           Geppetto stops, happy to see her.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Julia, what are you doing here? 
                        Your father--

                                 JULIA
                        --I brought you this.

           She hands him a beautifully made, carefully folded, detailed 
           and colorful paper heart.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you might need a new one.

           He takes it carefully. It’s the most important thing he’s 
           ever been given and he cherishes it immediately.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (with great emotion)
                        I’ll always keep it with me.

                                 JULIA
                        Write me everyday until you can 
                        come find me. And I’ll do the same.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        I promise, Julia. 
                             (beat, from his heart)
                        I need you more than ever.  

           Shouting from the car:

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Hurry up you hormone infested brat.

           Julia gives Geppetto a kiss.

                                 JULIA
                             (whispering in his ear)
                        You will always have my heart.

           She turns and runs away. He watches her for a long moment and 
           then looks down at the heart.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Mine too.

           EXT. CAR

           Geppetto ties his suitcase to the top of the car. Eunice 
           rolls down her window.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        You’re driving.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        But I’m 11. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Geppetto drives the car, swerving every which way in the rain 
           and almost colliding into trees and other cars. Eunice reads 
           a bad romance novel, taking no notice of the near accidents. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        It wasn’t too far on their long 
                        journey that Geppetto realized Aunt 
                        Eunice was not good with children, 
                        having none of her own and her 
                        husband many years dead.

           He nearly drives off the edge of a cliff.
           INT. ROADSIDE DINER - NIGHT

           A classic roadside diner right out of an Edward Hopper 
           painting. Geppetto and Eunice sit at a table as a WAITRESS 
           takes their order.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        For dinner the boy will have a cup 
                        of coffee, black, and some corn.

           Geppetto looks over jealously at a display case full of fancy 
           desserts. 

                                 AUNT EUNICE (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll have the steak.

           EXT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A dilapidated old home standing alone on an unfriendly dirt 
           road. The car parks in front, the motor steaming.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Finally. I’ve seen a drunk monkey 
                        drive better than you. 

           INT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Geppetto walks into his new home. It’s dark and scary looking 
           and has the cold, unfriendly feeling of a dank museum.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Your bedroom is up the stairs.

           INT. BEDROOM

           Geppetto drags his suitcase into his new bedroom. He turns on 
           the light to find it’s covered in taxidermy animals with 
           frightening faces. He screams.

                                 AUNT EUNICE (O.S.)
                        Quiet boy! I’m trying to release my 
                        bowels.

           When he sees the animals are stuffed he relaxes a little and 
           opens his bag. The first thing he does is hang up Julia’s 
           paper heart on the wall. He then takes out a framed picture 
           of his parents and puts it next to his stiff, dusty bed.
           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Geppetto lays in bed wide awake as Eunice’s snores fill the 
           house.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Geppetto lay in bed that night 
                        unable to sleep because of Eunice’s 
                        snoring, the shadows of the dead 
                        zoo all around him, and all the 
                        coffee he had to drink. He thought 
                        of only two things: his parents 
                        whom he missed more than anything. 
                        And Julia Moon whom he missed a 
                        touch more. 

           Geppetto can’t take it anymore. He gets out of bed and walks 
           through the dark house. He sees a door under the staircase. 
           He tries to open it but it doesn’t budge as if it hasn’t been 
           opened in years. He puts his shoulder into it and pushes as 
           hard as he can, finally managing to open it inch by inch.

           He walks into the dark, musky room and finds the light. He 
           turns it on to see that it’s a magnificent workshop full of 
           all kinds of tools, machines and wood all covered in dust.

           He’s in complete awe as he looks everything over. The various 
           saws, wedges, vices, etc. He picks up a small wedge and a 
           piece of wood and begins to carve.

           INT. WORKSHOP - MORNING

           The block of wood is now a carving of Julia. He holds it up 
           proudly.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Geppetto became so focused on 
                        transforming the block of wood into 
                        something new that he didn’t notice 
                        the snores of his aunt had ceased.

           REVEAL: Eunice looks down at him disapprovingly. Geppetto 
           feels her breathing angrily and turns around slowly.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m sorry, Aunt Eunice. I should 
                        have asked permission. 

           He stands there ready for the worst.
                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But before she could punish the boy 
                        in the worst ways imaginable she 
                        was taken away to another time by 
                        the sight, smells and sounds of the 
                        workshop.

           Eunice’s face slowly turns from an evil scowl to something 
           much softer as she looks around the workshop and is filled 
           with memories. Her eyes stop on an unfinished writing desk in 
           the corner, long discarded.

           We CLOSE IN on her.

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           A young, handsome man works in the pristine shop making the 
           beautiful writing desk. This is Eunice’s husband, PETER. 
           After a moment a much younger Eunice enters. She’s beautiful, 
           before the tragedies of her life have gotten to her. She 
           brings her husband a cup of coffee.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Take a break, Peter. You’ve been in 
                        here for hours.

                                 PETER
                        If you say so but I want to finish 
                        your desk so you can begin writing.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        You’re so silly. I’m no good.

                                 PETER
                        You write the best poems I’ve ever 
                        read.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Well you’re very poorly read.

           He puts his work down.

                                 PETER
                        I can’t work when you’re around, 
                        anyway. It’d be dangerous with such 
                        a beautiful woman in here. I 
                        wouldn’t be able to concentrate.

           Eunice laughs happily.
                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        You’re a fool.

                                 AUNT EUNICE (CONT’D)
                        I brought you a cup of coffee. 

           He takes the cup and sips from it.

                                 PETER
                        You could make me a cup of coffee 
                        and a bowl of corn for dinner for 
                        the rest of my life and I’d be 
                        happy. As long as it was you making 
                        it.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                             (playfully)
                        Like I said, a fool!

           He grabs her and kisses her.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. WORKSHOP - MORNING

           Eunice looks down at Geppetto cowering. Without a word she 
           walks out. Geppetto looks down at his carving curiously.

           EXT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Geppetto opens the mailbox and finds a letter from Julia. He 
           rips it open quickly and begins to read.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        He and Julia kept their promise to 
                        each other, writing everyday, 
                        sharing all of their secrets and 
                        all the details of their young 
                        lives. And before long he could 
                        tell her mood simply by the curve 
                        of her writing. The way it looped 
                        when she was happy.

           INSERT: a letter from Julia with looping handwriting.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        Slanted when she was nervous.

           INSERT: a letter from Julia with slanted handwriting.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        And dipped when she was sad.
           INSERT: a letter from Julia with dipping handwriting.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        So that as the years passed they 
                        felt they knew each other better 
                        than if they had been together the 
                        whole time. 

           INT. GEPPETTO’S ROOM - DAY

           CU: Geppetto’s hand as he writes a letter to Julia: “Will you 
           marry me?”

           PULL BACK to see Geppetto, now 23, a handsome and strong 
           young man. Behind him are thousands of letters organized into 
           volumes. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And they made secret plans to run 
                        away and marry as soon as he had 
                        enough money. 

           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           The workshop is now full of all kinds of magnificently made 
           objects: hearts, clocks, puppets, tables, chairs, shelves, 
           and many, many carvings of Julia.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        For they both new Mr. Moon would 
                        never allow her eldest daughter to 
                        marry an orphan carpenter.

           A man hands Geppetto a stack of bills and walks out satisfied 
           holding a wooden chair. Geppetto pulls an envelope of money 
           from his pocket and adds the bills.

           Aunt Eunice, now an old woman, enters with a letter. 

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Another letter.

           Geppetto stops his work and takes the letter from her. He 
           opens it and reads eagerly. As he reads his face falls.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        The handwriting had the sharp edges 
                        of desperation.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JULIA’S HOME - DAY

           Julia, a beautiful young woman, with her parents and four 
           little sisters, watches sadly as their furniture is 
           repossessed by two movers. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Mr. Moon had lost everything and 
                        things had become dire.

           EXT. JULIA’S HOME - DAY

           Edmund, an unscrupulous young man, approaches the house with 
           a smirk on his face. He saunters into the front yard, 
           watching approvingly as the men carry a couch out. 

                                 EDMUND
                        Lift with your backs, men. That’s 
                        the way.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Meanwhile, Edmund Vile had become 
                        very wealthy and powerful, as evil 
                        men do in difficult times, taking 
                        advantage of people at their most 
                        vulnerable.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           A FATHER, MOTHER and their THREE CHILDREN watch sadly as an 
           auction takes place on the front yard of their humble home. 
           They’re poor and hopeless and about to walk away. 

           Just then several friends and neighbors approach and each 
           hand the father a few dollars, as much as they can afford, so 
           they he can save his home. The father is shocked and looks 
           back at his family happily. He then makes a bid, confident 
           they’ll get the house back. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        He purchased houses from families 
                        who could no longer afford to pay 
                        for them.

           Then Edmund steps forward. To the AUCTIONER:

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ll give you a dollar more.
                                 AUCTIONER
                        Sold!

           The family is devastated. Edmund smiles as he wins the house.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Edmund watches as construction workers work on the house.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And he turned them into several 
                        room tenements buildings.

           INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Edmund shows the same family of five a tiny single room 
           apartment in their former home.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Renting the rooms to the same 
                        families he stole from at a very 
                        nice profit.

           The father and mother look at each other sadly. It’s their 
           only option.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. JULIA’S HOME

           Edmund knocks on the door and enters.

                                 EDMUND
                        Anyone home? Well not for long 
                        anyway. 

           The Moon family instinctively takes a step away from him as 
           he walks in.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I brought the contract we 
                        discussed, Mr. Moon. Now in these 
                        times 1/28th of the original price 
                        isn’t so bad. You’re practically 
                        stealing from me.

           He looks over the family.
                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Why is everyone so glum? When the 
                        papers say there’s a depression 
                        going on this isn’t what they mean.

           He approaches Mr. Moon with the contract and a pen. 

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Well, have you made a decision?

           Mr. Moon looks down at it with a pained expression. He looks 
           back at his family -- what should he do?

                                 MR. MOON
                        We could starve.

                                 EDMUND
                        Then don’t be a fool and SIGN IT!

           As Mr. Moon considers it:

                                 JULIA
                        How can you be so cruel?

           Edmund looks at Julia and walks over to her.

                                 EDMUND
                        The only cruel thing here is how 
                        beautiful you are.

           He offers her a rose. 

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        A rose for a rose.

           She recoils from him. Undeterred he looks back at Mr. Moon.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (to Mr. Moon)
                        I’m not a cruel person, Mr. Moon. 
                        I’m sure we can work something out.

           He looks back at Julia and smiles. Her younger sisters all 
           hide behind her.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        He promised to save the family in 
                        exchange for Julia’s hand in 
                        marriage. And Mr. Moon had no other 
                        choice but to agree.
           INT. JULIA’S HOME - NIGHT

           Julia writes secretly by candle light as everyone else 
           sleeps. Tears fall from her eyes onto the letter.

                                 JULIA (V.O.)
                             (as she writes)
                        Please come for me, Geppetto. I 
                        cannot bear the thought of having 
                        to marry that man. Come for me and 
                        we will run away together.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. EUNICE’S HOUSE

           Geppetto sadly finishes the letter. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (reading)
                        Your love, Julia.

           His heart sinks and he collapses. Eunice runs to him.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                             (worried)
                        Geppetto! Geppetto?!

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I have to save her.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        Oh thank god. I thought you were 
                        suffering from inconvenient short 
                        term catatonia. 

           INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

           Geppetto builds different oddly shaped machines out of wood 
           and household objects.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Geppetto prepared to leave 
                        immediately, but knowing his aunt 
                        had grown dependent on him in her 
                        old age, could not leave her 
                        helpless. 
           INT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Geppetto shows Eunice the completed machines proudly. One 
           machine washes and dries the dishes, another machine does the 
           laundry, a third makes cakes. All of them are operated by 
           puppets and have a Rube Goldberg quality to them. Eunice is 
           amazed. She looks at Geppetto with wonder.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And before he could start his 
                        journey history intervened.

           EXT. PEARL HARBOR - MORNING

           Dozens of Japanese planes approach the unsuspecting, sleeping 
           naval base and begin to drop hundreds of bombs. They explode 
           on the ships, causing them to burst into flames as men jump 
           for their lives. The air raid siren goes off and the US 
           soldiers, totally unprepared, try to fight back as the ships 
           begin to sink.

           INT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Eunice and Geppetto, with his packed suitcase from childhood 
           next to his feet, sit listening to President Roosevelt on the 
           radio with a grim seriousness. 

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (on the radio)
                        December 7, 1941—a date which will 
                        live in infamy—the United States of 
                        America was suddenly--

           INT. JULIA’S HOME - DAY

           Julia and her family huddle around their radio. Her face is 
           pale with worry.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                             (on the radio)
                        --and deliberately attacked by 
                        naval and air forces of the Empire 
                        of Japan.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Julia knew instantly what the news 
                        meant for Geppetto.

                                 JULIA
                        I’m feeling unwell. Excuse me.
           She walks out. As soon as she’s out of sight she runs to her 
           room where she changes her clothes, putting on pants and 
           pinning her hair up under a hat. She draws on a mustache with 
           make-up. She stops for a moment when she notices it looks 
           like a Chaplin mustache and smiles at the memory of Geppetto.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           A soldier posts a notice that reads “All Men Report for Duty 
           Immediately. Or Face the CONSEQUENCES.”

           INT. JULIA’S ROOM - LATER

           Now dressed as a man, Julia puts a pillow under her covers to 
           make it look like she’s sleeping and then climbs out her 
           window.

           EXT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Geppetto stands across from Eunice holding his suitcase.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        War took my Peter from me. Don’t 
                        let it have the satisfaction of 
                        taking you too.

           Geppetto gives her a hug.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Goodbye, Aunt Eunice. I’ll always 
                        be grateful to you for taking me 
                        in.

                                 AUNT EUNICE
                        I may not have always been good to 
                        you but I taught you how to drive 
                        when you were eleven and that’s 
                        something.

           Geppetto hugs her. He walks away as Aunt Eunice watches him 
           go, tears in her eyes.

           INT. EUNICE’S HOUSE

           Eunice walks into her house to see the writing desk finished 
           and beautiful. She is shocked. 
           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Geppetto walks down a dirt road among hundreds of young men 
           all going to report for duty. Some sing patriotic songs while 
           others are quiet and focused. They hold American flags and 
           pass around bottles of cheap alcohol. Women hand them cups of 
           water as they pass. Children salute them and tell them to 
           give Hitler what he has coming. A PREACHER runs along beside 
           them praying for their safety.

           The men stop on seeing an ugly old WITCH standing in the road 
           selling different potions.

                                 WITCH
                        Turn invisible. Make your enemy see 
                        spiders and snakes all around. 
                        Confuse them with a potion of 
                        dizziness. All for mere dollars.

                                 PREACHER
                        Get away with your evilness! Away 
                        witch! These men have god on their 
                        side.

           He holds his bible up. The soldiers join in on chiding her.

                                 WITCH
                        You think god gets involved with 
                        such follies of man? You will see 
                        soon enough, there is no god where 
                        you’re going. Mark my words, most 
                        of you will not return home and 
                        your women will come to me looking 
                        for help with the grief they’ll 
                        feel.

           She disappears into the woods to hisses and jeers but the men 
           continue on silently, considering her warning.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Julia, dressed as a man, goes to hop on the back of a pick-up 
           truck with a group of men. A man, ANDERSON, stops her.

                                 ANDERSON
                        You smell like a woman.

           Julia gets tense. After a moment the man grins.

                                 ANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        I got a lotta lovin’ from my woman 
                        too. Best part about going to war 
                        if you ask me. Name’s Anderson.
                                 JULIA
                        Ju...James.

           Julia grunts and spits.

                                 ANDERSON
                        Nice to meet you, James.

           EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY

           Geppetto gets to a town full of chaos. Old men read the 
           headlines declaring war on Japan and Germany while children 
           play war in the streets, pretending to shoot Hitler. 

           Groups of young men shout war slogans like “Avenge Dec. 7” 
           and “Hitler’s next.” They take turns buzzing their heads, say 
           goodbye to mothers and lovers and jump in army buses and on 
           the back of trucks, sticking their heads out of the windows 
           and waving goodbye excitedly. Worried women run after them 
           reminding them to eat well and to take care of themselves. 
           Everyone is full of energy, excitement and nervousness. The 
           depression is forgotten. 

           Geppetto watches the scene. A couple YOUNG MEN run past him 
           slapping him on the back.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        What are you waiting for?

                                 YOUNG MAN 2
                        Don’t you want your shot at killing 
                        Hitler?

           Geppetto walks forward.

           INT. RECRUITING OFFICE - DAY

           Geppetto enters a small room stuffed full of young men. He 
           walks to the counter where a fat SERGEANT sits. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        The name’s Geppetto Henri Pablo 
                        Nikolai Woodmaker. I’m reporting 
                        for duty. 

                                 SERGEANT
                        You don’t say. Can you shoot a gun?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Yes.
                                 SERGEANT
                        Next of kin?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What?

                                 SERGEANT
                        Who do you want us to tell if you 
                        get yourself killed?

           A moment.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Julia Moon.

           The sergeant writes it down.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Welcome to the war. Next! 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           A DOCTOR examines Edmund as a NURSE watches, holding a clip 
           board. Edmund tries to bribe him slyly with hundred dollar 
           bills but the doctor doesn’t notice.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Strong pulse, healthy kidneys, 
                        perfectly red tongue ... I can’t 
                        find anything wrong with you.

                                 EDMUND
                        Then pease, doctor, LOOK A LITTLE 
                        HARDER!

           He throws a bunch of bills at him. The doctor looks at them 
           and then back up at Edmund.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’m afraid you’re in no condition 
                        to be fighting a war with your flat 
                        feet, weak eye sight and feminine 
                        hands. You’d be putting your fellow 
                        soldiers at risk.

                                 EDMUND
                        A true shame.
                             (beat)
                        Leave that last one out.

           The nurse looks at them skeptically and then writes on her 
           clipboard.
           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Edmund walks into the lobby smugly to find a very large man 
           named HOTSPUR fighting with several doctors. 

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Let me fight!!!

                                 DOCTOR
                        You failed every intelligence test.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        I’ll intelligence you!

           Hotspur picks up the doctor and tosses him across the room. 
           Edmund smiles.

                                 EDMUND
                             (to himself)
                        Perfect.

           Edmund approaches Hotspur who looks down at him angrily.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        You’re grossly enormous.

           Hotspur snorts threateningly.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Easy, I mean it as a compliment. 
                        What’s your name?

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Hotspur.

                                 EDMUND
                             (reviling in his name)
                        Hotspur. Brilliant. Hotspur, today 
                        is your lucky day. I am going to 
                        give you a job. 

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Why would I want a job from you?

           Edmund looks him up and down.

                                 EDMUND
                        Let me guess, you have nowhere to 
                        go since not even the army will 
                        take you in wartime.

           Hotspur is quiet.
                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Dead parents?

           Hotspur nods and wipes away a tear.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        No schooling?

                                 HOTSPUR
                        I had schooling!

                                 EDMUND
                        Past the age of ten?

           Hotspur is quiet.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Some jail time for petty crimes?

           Hotspur looks down at the ground.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        I didn’t mean to.

                                 EDMUND
                        You’ll take the job from me because 
                        your only other option is joining 
                        the circus, and I believe they 
                        already have an elephant. Come with 
                        me. Now that there’s a war going on 
                        there’s money to be made and I need 
                        a strong man.

           EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY

           Julia walks through the crowd, getting knocked around. She 
           looks desperately for Geppetto, worried she’ll never find him 
           in the chaos. Finally, her eyes light up as she sees him 
           getting onto a bus in the distance. 

           I/E. BUS

           Geppetto gets on the bus and makes his way to the back to 
           find a seat. As he does he hears a voice call his name.

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Geppetto!
           He knows the voice instantly. He runs to a window, pushes the 
           man sitting there aside and sticks his head out trying to 
           find her. As he scans the crowd he doesn’t see her because 
           she’s dressed like a man.

                                 JULIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Geppetto! Over here!

           He looks and finds her in the crowd letting down her hair and 
           rubbing away the mustache. Geppetto can’t believe it. 
           Anderson sits next to him shocked, seeing Julia’s not a man.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (amazed)
                        Julia! My god you’re so beautiful.
                             (then concerned)
                        Are you real? Please be real.

                                 JULIA
                             (laughing happily)
                        Yes! I’m real.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JULIA
                        I had to see you before you left.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Hold on, I’ll come to you. Don’t 
                        move. Don’t disappear.

           He gets up as the bus starts.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (to the driver)
                        Wait! Stop the bus!

           The driver just grunts and begins to drive. 

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Stop!

           Geppetto runs to the door but two higher ranking SOLDIERS 
           hold him back. He tries to push them aside but they knock him 
           to the ground.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Take a seat, soldier.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        The love of my life is out there.
                                 SOLDIER 2
                        You’re property of the US Army now.

           Geppetto runs back to the open window. Julia runs after the 
           bus as it begins to drive away.

                                 JULIA
                        They’ve already set a date.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What?! When?

                                 JULIA
                        The evening of summer solstice. 
                        June 21st. It’s the most time I 
                        could get.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (crushed)
                        But that’s only 6 months away.

                                 JULIA
                        I’ve never seen my father so 
                        desperate. You can’t let me marry 
                        Edmund. I’d rather die.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I won’t let it happen, Julia. Not 
                        even this war will stop me. I 
                        promise, I’ll come for you. 

                                 JULIA
                        Just please stay safe. If anything 
                        were to happen to you...

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Nothing will happen to me.

           He hangs out of the bus as far as he can and cups her face in 
           his hand.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        You’re the most beautiful woman in 
                        the world. Nothing could keep me 
                        from you.

           A tear falls from her eye onto his hand. She can’t keep up 
           anymore. Their hands separate. 

           As if the simple truth of it should make the bus stop, the 
           war end and make everything right:

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        But I love you.
                                 JULIA
                        I love you, too.

           They watch each other disappear in the distance, looks of 
           desperation on their faces, the world so much bigger than the 
           two of them.

           His hand suddenly stings and he looks down at it to find the 
           teardrop burning a little hole. He looks at it curiously. 

           EXT. TOWN STREET - LATER

           The last of the trucks and busses carrying the soldiers leave 
           the dusty town behind. The only residents left are the 
           children, elderly and women. They have nothing to do now but 
           wait. Slowly, one by one they go home. Julia is the last one 
           waiting in the street, having fallen to her knees.

                                 JULIA
                        I don’t care what happens to me, 
                        just bring him back.

           INT. BUS - NIGHT

           Geppetto looks down at the paper heart, Anderson next to him.

                                 ANDERSON
                        You better forget about her. She’ll 
                        only cause you trouble where we’re 
                        going.

           Geppetto folds the heart and puts it into his coat pocket.

           INSERT: The wooden book to a page reading:

           A MISFORTUNE AVERTED

           On the opposite page is a woodcarving of a dilapidated theme 
           park located on a small, rocky island surrounded by crashing 
           waves. 

           We CLOSE IN on the wood panel as it FADES into reality:

           EXT. PLEASURE ISLAND - DAY

           A destroyed sign on the ground reads “Pleasure Island.” Bums, 
           drunks and various vagabonds and outcasts happily make their 
           home here. There are crumbling carnival games, a huge 
           rollercoaster missing pieces of track, a ferris wheel leaning 
           to one side, a water ride full of sludge, discarded food 
           carts, etc. 
           A friendly elderly man, GEORGE, leads Edmund and Hotspur 
           through the park.

                                 GEORGE
                        Before the crash and war, Pleasure 
                        Island was a grand place for 
                        children. They had dreams about 
                        coming here. It was a dream. They 
                        loved the games, screamed on the 
                        rides, and ate cotton candy until 
                        they turned pink. But after my wife 
                        died I just didn’t have it in me to 
                        keep up the work. Then the 
                        depression came and the children 
                        stopped coming. The result is what 
                        you see before you now.

           They come to a stop and look back on the decaying island.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ll take it, George. I’ve always 
                        wanted my own island.

                                 GEORGE
                        If I’m going to sell it to you I 
                        need your word that you’ll keep it 
                        affordable, clean fun. It was 
                        created in the belief that all 
                        children deserve an innocent world 
                        and I want to make sure that spirit 
                        lives on. The children need it more 
                        than ever.

                                 EDMUND
                        You have my word, George. Believe 
                        me, I’m about to be a married man.

           He smiles wildly and shakes George’s hand.

                                 GEORGE
                        Great, then I’ll get the contracts.

           George walks away. Then to Hotspur:

                                 EDMUND
                        Just think of all those returning 
                        young vets with army checks looking 
                        to blow off some steam. We put in 
                        some bars, casinos, and brothels 
                        and the money will start rolling 
                        in. And entertainment. Some quality 
                        entertainment. 
           In the background he sees a BUM holding a whiskey bottle and 
           trying to pet a cat. The cat is blind and takes a step 
           forward every time the man attempts to pet him. 

                                 BUM
                        Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

           The cat moves away a little more and the man follows until 
           he’s under a roof. Just then a fox jumps from the roof and 
           lands on the man’s face. He screams and tries to hit the fox 
           off. He drops the bottle which the cat, only pretending to be 
           blind, rolls away. The fox jumps off the man and joins the 
           cat in licking the booze from the bottle. The bum gathers 
           himself and walks away. Edmund is delighted at the scene.

                                 EDMUND
                        What magnificent creatures!
                             (to Hotspur)
                        Bring them to me.

           INT. JULIA’S HOME - NIGHT

           Julia lays in bed reading a letter from Geppetto. 

                                 GEPPETTO (V.O.)
                        My dearest Julia. I hope this 
                        letter finds you since I don’t know 
                        when I’ll be able to write again.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Geppetto and a few other soldiers take cover as a bomb lands 
           nearby.

                                 GEPPETTO (V.O.)
                        You mustn’t believe everything you 
                        read in the papers. The truth is 
                        that none of this war business is 
                        as bad as the wretched feeling deep 
                        in my soul of being apart from you.

           The bomb lands, tossing soldiers like rag dolls. Geppetto 
           runs to one of them who lands dozens of feet away. It’s 
           Anderson. He’s severely injured, his blood draining fast. 

                                 ANDERSON
                             (weakly)
                        Geppetto.
                                 GEPPETTO
                             (trying to keep it 
                              together)
                        You’re going to be okay, Anderson. 

           Anderson coughs up blood. There’s no way he’s going to live 
           and Geppetto knows it.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Everything is going to be okay.

           EXT. BOMBED OUT VILLAGE - DAY

           A deserted and destroyed village. It looks haunted with only 
           the skeletons of buildings remaining. Geppetto and several 
           other soldiers chase a starving chicken through the streets.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        They take care of us and we have 
                        plenty to eat

           One of the soldiers shoots the chicken.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

           A gray, smoky battlefield on what was once a golf course. 
           Hundreds of US soldiers wait behind a barricade nervously, 
           smoking cigarettes, flipping coins, playing cards, and 
           writing letters to pass the time. We come up to Geppetto 
           looking down at the paper heart, lost in thought. He looks a 
           little shell-shocked.

                                 GEPPETTO (V.O.)
                        We mostly just wait around, having 
                        fun telling stories.

           Suddenly a wave of planes fly overhead dropping bombs. The 
           soldiers all take cover. 

                                 GEPPETTO (V.O.)
                        Sometimes I think that our love is 
                        so strong that I can stop it all. 
                        That everyone will freeze in their 
                        tracks and just stop and I’ll be 
                        able to walk home to you. For how 
                        can wars go on when such love 
                        exists in the world?

           As Geppetto looks over the barricade he holds up the paper 
           heart and everything freezes: the falling bombs, the planes 
           overhead, the soldiers firing next to him and even the 
           explosions. He climbs over the barricade, ready to walk home. 
           Then suddenly everything starts again and one of the soldiers 
           next to him pulls him down, saving his life. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Geppetto falls to the ground and puts the paper heart in his 
           pocket.

           EXT. FOREST- DAY

           In the middle of a battle Geppetto emerges from the smoky 
           forest carrying two wounded soldiers to safety as bombs 
           explode all around. Medics run up to him and take the men as 
           Geppetto collapses from exhaustion. 

                                 GEPPETTO (V.O.)
                        I will find a way to make it home 
                        to you, my love, and all will be as 
                        it should be. 

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Geppetto sits in a field on a sunny day writing the letter, 
           now with a medal pinned to his uniform. 

                                 GEPPETTO (V.O.)
                        I will not let Edmund Vile marry 
                        you. If there was justice in this 
                        world such men would not even be 
                        able to look at you. I love you. 
                        Geppetto.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. JULIA’S HOME

           Julia finishes the letter and falls back on her bed. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But the wedding was only a month 
                        away and she knew what he wrote 
                        about the war was a lie from the 
                        slant of his writing. She began to 
                        make plans to run away.

           Julia’s mom enters holding two different wedding dresses.

                                 MRS. MOON
                        Look what I’ve got...
           She sees the letter in her hand. 

                                 MRS. MOON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Julia, you must give up on 
                        childish notions. Do you want your 
                        sisters to be out on the streets?

                                 JULIA
                        Of course not.

           A car honks outside.

                                 MRS. MOON
                        He’s here. Try and behave yourself 
                        this time. We’re lucky he fancies 
                        you. It’s the only chance we have.

           INT. JULIA’S HOME

           Edmund looks at both the dresses hanging. Julia, her parents 
           and Hotspur stand behind him as he decides.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s difficult. I want everyone to 
                        know I’m marrying a beauty but I 
                        don’t want to be upstaged on my big 
                        day.

                                 JULIA
                        It won’t matter because Geppetto 
                        will stop the wedding. 

                                 MRS. MOON
                             (scolding)
                        Julia!

                                 EDMUND
                        No, no it’s okay. This terrible war 
                        is affecting us all in strange 
                        manners.
                             (he turns to Julia)
                        Just promise me that when he dies 
                        you’ll forget about him. I can be a 
                        terribly jealous lover.

                                 JULIA
                        He’s not going to die.

           Edmund looks her straight in the eye.

                                 EDMUND
                        I wouldn’t put money on it.
           She steps back, fearing he knows something she doesn’t.

           INT. CONGRESSMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           A roughed up CONGRESSMAN sits behind his desk as Edmund and 
           Hotspur stand across from him. A plaque on the desk says 
           CONGRESSMAN O’NEIL. 

                                 CONGRESSMAN
                        I can’t just have a man sent to the 
                        front lines for no reason?

                                 EDMUND
                        Hotspur, give him a reason.

           Hotspur cracks his knuckles and picks up the congressman.

                                 CONGRESSMAN
                             (cowering)
                        Okay, okay, okay ... just keep him 
                        away from me.

                                 EDMUND
                             (smiling)
                        Democracy is a beautiful thing.

           EXT. COAST OF FRANCE - DAY

           A huge battle. Thousands of US and German soldiers run at 
           each other firing their guns on the edge of a cliff 
           overlooking the ocean. Machine guns shoot down at them from 
           all sides. It’s pure chaos as men die by the dozens.  

           Geppetto bravely runs in the middle of it all toward a 
           machine gun taking out their men. As he runs he collides with 
           the Germans. The battle turns into hand to hand combat. 
           Geppetto takes a couple men out with the butt of his gun but 
           stops on seeing one large German aiming a gun right at him. 

           He thinks he’s done for and pulls out the paper heart, 
           holding it tightly, looking resigned. The German sees 
           Geppetto clutch the heart and a look of recognition flashes 
           across his face. Instead of firing, he knocks him hard across 
           the head with the gun causing his dogtags to fly off and land 
           on the body of another soldier. Geppetto falls off the edge 
           of the cliff toward the water.

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           Geppetto crashes into the water, unconscious. He sinks into 
           the dark as bullets shoot through the water all around. 
           He suddenly comes to and opens his eyes to see he’s in front 
           of a large whale. It’s an eerie moment - is he awake? Dead? 
           Next to the whale is a baby whale, dead from being shot by 
           dozens of bullets. Blood seeps from the several holes.

           The father whale nudges the baby with his nose but there’s no 
           response. It’s too late. The father whale lets out a deep, 
           haunting sound of mourning. He then spots Geppetto and turns 
           toward him angrily. Geppetto swims as fast as he can toward 
           the surface with the whale following, threateningly. Geppetto 
           struggles to swim as the whale begins to suck in water.

           Just as the whale is about to swallow Geppetto a bullet 
           grazes his side. He slows and retreats as Geppetto gets to 
           the surface, filling his lungs with air. He then looks around 
           for something to float on. He sees a few planks nearby. He 
           brings them together and pulls himself on top, passing out.

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           Geppetto lays on his back, floating on the planks in the 
           middle of the ocean. The wound on his head swells. We CLOSE 
           IN on him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JULIA’S HOME - DAY

           Geppetto runs toward the house as Julia comes outside to meet 
           him. She’s pregnant with his child and smiles at him happily. 
           As he’s about to touch her he-- 

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. OCEAN

           --comes to and realizes he’s in the middle of the ocean with 
           nothing around. His mouth is parched and the sun beats down 
           intensely. He’s at the mercy of the tides.

           EXT. OCEAN - LATER

           We see Geppetto passed out on the makeshift raft through a 
           BLACK AND WHITE CAMERA. He’s having troubled dreams.

           Pull back to reveal a Frenchman (34) filming Geppetto with a 
           large, water proof camera from a boat. This is JACQUES 
           COUSTEAU. 
           The side of the boat reads “CALYPSO” and is fitted with all 
           sorts of research and scientific equipment. A very well put-
           together man named TOMA who’s always smoking hangs off the 
           side of the boat.

                                 TOMA
                        Il est mort, no?

                                 COUSTEAU
                        L'amour le maintient en vie. 
                        (Love keeps him alive.)

                                 TOMA
                        Stupide américaine.

           Toma shrugs and throws a bucket of water onto Geppetto who 
           wakes up, coughing weakly. He slowly comes to and sees the 
           boat with the men looking down at him. He takes a defensive 
           position. 

                                 COUSTEAU
                        It is okay, we are French. We do 
                        not believe in war.

                                 TOMA
                        Which is why we always lose them.

           Geppetto looks at all the odd instruments on the boat and 
           then at the camera.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Who are you?

                                 COUSTEAU
                        Le Commandant Cousteau. Explorer 
                        and documentarian. And this is my 
                        associate, Toma.

           Toma nods his head slightly. Geppetto rubs his eyes.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        At first he thought it was a dream.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        Will you be boarding or do you 
                        prefer your current vessel?

           INT. CALYPSO - NIGHT

           Geppetto, now with a bandage over his head, sleeps in a 
           hammock as Toma takes away an empty soup bowl. Geppetto wakes 
           up and looks at Toma.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        What’s the date?

                                 TOMA
                        May 19th.

           Geppetto passes out.

                                 TOMA (CONT’D)
                             (shaking his head)
                        Stupide américaine.

           EXT. CALYPSO - DAY

           Toma helps Cousteau get out of the water in his full diving 
           gear. He holds an underwater camera.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        The footage is amazing, Toma.

           Geppetto walks out onto the deck weakly in new clothes.

                                 COUSTEAU (CONT’D)
                        So you decided to return to the 
                        land of the living. 

           Geppetto falls over. 

                                 TOMA
                        Stupide américaine.

           INT. CALYPSO - NIGHT

           Cousteau, Toma and Geppetto dine together in a room 
           overlooking the water. The walls are covered with books, maps 
           and photographs of past adventures. Toma smokes as he eats.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        My crew all deserted me months ago 
                        either to fight or because they’re 
                        scared of encounters with U-boats.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What about you?

                                 COUSTEAU
                        I am an explorer at heart. I do not 
                        stop because of men’s follies. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Don’t you want to fight?
                                 COUSTEAU
                        I’m afraid the sea is man’s only 
                        hope. Now more than ever before. 
                        This very war is being fought in 
                        the seas and the advances we are 
                        making will determine the outcome. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (to Toma)
                        What about you?

                                 TOMA
                        I am here for the money.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        The money?

                                 TOMA
                        What better time to be making films 
                        on shipwrecks than when so many are 
                        being wrecked?

                                 COUSTEAU
                        And you, Geppetto? What keeps you 
                        going through all this madness?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        The love of my life is being forced 
                        to marry another four weeks from 
                        now. I am going to rescue her.

           A moment as Cousteau and Toma examine him.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        I am a captain without a crew and 
                        you are a traveler without 
                        transportation. I think we can make 
                        a deal, as the Americans say. 
                        There’s an island not too far off 
                        the East Coast of the states. I can 
                        take you as far as that but you 
                        will have to work for it and it 
                        will be dangerous. No waters are 
                        safe these days.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (with determination)
                        I’ll do anything to get back to 
                        her.
           EXT. JULIA’S HOME - DAY

           A soldier walks stoically up to Julia’s house and knocks. 
           After a moment Julia answers and he hands her a letter and 
           Geppetto’s dogtags. She looks at the man and then down at the 
           letter. There’s a moment of disbelief or unwilling to believe 
           and she smiles slightly as if it’s a joke. Then it hits her 
           and she crumbles to the ground in grief, wailing as tears 
           stream down her cheeks. The soldier walks away.

           INT. EDMUND VILE’S MANSION - DAY

           All sorts of plans for Pleasure Island are pinned to the 
           walls featuring bars, casinos, rides, shows, etc. The cat and 
           fox sleep on the floor nearby. Edmund reads an article in the 
           newspaper about the financial success of the new Pleasure 
           Island, his picture front and center.

                                 EDMUND
                        Excellent.

           He then scans an article listing the soldiers who have died 
           in battle while stuffing his face with roasted chicken. 
           Geppetto’s name is listed. Edmund smiles on seeing it, food 
           falling out.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I suppose we won’t need to be 
                        inviting him to the wedding.

           He cracks himself up and tosses a piece of chicken on the 
           ground. The cat and fox fight over it causing Edmund great 
           delight.

           MONTAGE:

           1. Geppetto scrubs the deck of the Calypso. 

           2. Geppetto films a shipwreck underwater in full diving gear. 
           It’s haunted looking. Toma is next to him, smoking even in 
           his diving suit.

           3. Geppetto, Toma and Cousteau quietly and tensely monitor a 
           German U-boat below them on the radar. 

           4. Julia has all of Geppetto’s letters spread out across her 
           room, up the walls and even across the ceiling so that the 
           entire room is covered. She lays in the middle, crying. 

           5. Geppetto, Toma and Cousteau watch a projected film strip 
           of Cousteau swimming under water with all sorts of amazing 
           sea creatures.
           6. The Calypso passes a burning boat in the night. 

           7. Geppetto carves a new wooden steering wheel for the ship.

           8. Julia looks out her window as the sun rises. She holds out 
           her palm in front of her as if she’s trying to push down the 
           sun but it continues to rise. She can’t stop time from 
           passing.

           I/E. CALYPSO - NIGHT

           A German boat chases the Calypso in the dark sea, lighting it 
           up and tearing it apart with bullets from a machine gun. 
           Geppetto and Toma run around the deck throwing items 
           overboard, taking cover as the bullets hit all around them. 
           Cousteau steers the boat as fast as he can.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        We’re still too slow. Throw 
                        everything over!

           Geppetto picks up a camera to throw it over.

                                 TOMA
                        Not the cameras!

           A line of bullets hit the deck all around Toma. It’s a 
           miracle he isn’t hit. He looks down with amazement and lights 
           a new cigarette.

                                 TOMA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, maybe the cameras too.

           Geppetto is about to throw it overboard when he stops and 
           looks at it. He then looks at the thick fog on the horizon. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’ve got an idea.

           EXT. CALYPSO - LATER

           Geppetto sets up the projector off the back of the boat and 
           aims the lens carefully at the fog. The Germans are closer 
           now. Two Germans on the ship pick up a torpedo. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Okay, turn it on.

           Toma plugs in the projector. It turns on and projects a film 
           of several powerful ally ships approaching on the surface of 
           the water. 
           Against the thick fog they appear to be real ships, or 
           something much sinister: ghost ships. Cousteau approaches and 
           looks at the projection.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        Brilliant.

           They wait a moment in anticipation. The German ship turns 
           around. The three men celebrate, Cousteau and Toma messing 
           Geppetto’s hair and slapping him on the back. 

                                 TOMA
                        I need a drink.

           Geppetto looks proud.

           EXT. PLEASURE ISLAND - DAY

           The Calypso docks at the island which has a much more 
           sinister feeling now. The rundown rides and attractions have 
           been replaced with sleazy bars, casinos and brothels. It has 
           the feeling of a twisted Bourbon street.

           EXT. PLEASURE ISLAND - LATER

           Geppetto stands on the dock saying goodbye to Cousteau and 
           Toma as ships come and go in the background.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        Go to the bar next to the theater 
                        and ask for a man named 
                        Mangiafuoco. If it’s after 9am 
                        he’ll be there. But go before 2 or 
                        he’ll be drunk. He’s what they call 
                        a shady man but he will help you.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Thank you.

                                 TOMA
                        When you get there tell Layla I 
                        said hello. But don’t let Lola hear 
                        or she’ll get jealous.

                                 COUSTEAU
                        Stay away from them, trust me. Now 
                        good luck, my friend. True love 
                        always finds a way.

           They hug. He then moves to Toma.
                                 TOMA
                             (now with love)
                        Stupide américaine. 

           They hug. Geppetto leaves them behind. 

           EXT. PLEASURE ISLAND - LATER

           Geppetto walks through the island, looking for the bar. Young 
           soldiers on leave run around drunk and full of lust. They 
           gamble and fight over money and they drink and fight over 
           women.

           INT. BAR - DAY

           Geppetto walks into the dark, smoky bar which is full of all 
           kinds of odd performers like Siamese twins, a contortionist, 
           a fire breather, a man covered in tattoos, a ventriloquist 
           with an evil looking puppet, etc. A person dressed half as a 
           woman and half as a man plays the piano in the corner and 
           signs a duet, sounding like a man when showing his male side 
           and sounding like a woman when showing her female side. As 
           Geppetto looks around a BEARDED WOMAN approaches.

                                 BEARDED WOMAN
                        Well hello, handsome. 
                             (moving closer)
                        Need some company?

           Geppetto recoils at first but pulls himself together.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No, I was just looking for 
                        Mangiafuoco. 

                                 BEARDED WOMAN
                        Mangiafuoco? What do you want from 
                        Mangiafuoco?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I was told he could help me.

           The CONTORTIONIST approaches by flipping over several times, 
           almost hitting Geppetto who ducks.

                                 CONTORTIONIST
                        You think you’ll find help from 
                        such a twisted man? 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m trying to get home. I have 
                        someone waiting for me.
           The VENTRILOQUIST uses his puppet, PUNCH, to speak. 

                                 PUNCH
                        Waiting gets old fast when you’re 
                        lonely. I got tired of waiting for 
                        my old owner so I took on this 
                        idiot here.

           The contortionist flips back upright. 

                                 CONTORTIONIST
                        Punch is right.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I need to get home.

                                 PUNCH
                        Home is wherever people will pay to 
                        see you perform. So you better get 
                        a skill, jack. 

           The TATTOOED MAN turns around from the bar.

                                 TATTOOED MAN
                             (tapping Geppetto on the 
                              chest)
                        Stay away from ink because that’s 
                        my bag.

           Geppetto backs up landing in the lap of the Siamese twins, 
           LOLA and LAYLA.

                                 LOLA
                        He’s cute. Don’t you think, Layla?

                                 LAYLA
                        Not bad. Shall we share him?

                                 LOLA
                        Maybe I want him all for myself.

                                 LAYLA
                        Not fair, you got the sailor, Lola. 

                                 LOLA
                        I can’t help that he preferred me.

                                 LAYLA
                        You kept me up the whole night. 
                        Tramp!

                                 LOLA
                        Hussy!
           They begin to fight with each other, each using an arm. 

           The FIRE BREATHER shoots fire from his mouth catching 
           Geppetto’s sleeve on fire. Geppetto begins to panic as the 
           freaks move in on him and steal money from his pockets. 
           Suddenly a very round man with a thick beard picks him up and 
           pats the fire out with his hands. This is MANGIAFUOCO. 
           Everyone freezes when they see him. He looks around at the 
           performers. In a thundering voice:

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Back to rehearsal!

           Everyone leaves the bar, giving Geppetto the stink eye. 

                                 PUNCH
                        Dummy.

           Mangiafuoco holds up Geppetto so their eyes are even.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        One day I’m going to fire them all 
                        and start a marionette show just to 
                        save me the trouble. Now what do 
                        you want?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I need help getting home. I was 
                        told you could help.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Do you have money?

           Geppetto looks through his pockets, and irritated, realizes 
           his money was stolen. He shakes his head “no.”

                                 MANGIAFUOCO (CONT’D)
                        I am in show business, not charity. 
                        Besides, there are no passenger 
                        boats navigating these waters.

           Mangiafuoco drops him to the ground and walks to the bar 
           where he downs a drink.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Jacques Cousteau said you’d help.

           Mangiafuoco stops.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        You know Jacques Cousteau?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I sailed with him.
                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Why didn’t you say so? That man 
                        saved my life on sixteen separate 
                        occasions.

           Mangiafuoco slaps him on the back to be friendly but Geppetto 
           goes flying. He gets up smiling.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO (CONT’D)
                        Now where did you say you needed to 
                        get to?

           EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

           Geppetto stands in an empty whiskey barrel as Mangiafuoco 
           holds the lid. 

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        It won’t be the most comfortable 
                        way to travel but it’ll get you to 
                        where you need to go.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Thank you.

           Mangiafuoco is about to put the lid on but stops.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                             (with a new seriousness)
                        One day I will need a favor in 
                        return. Do not forget what I have 
                        done for you.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Of course not.

                                 MANGIAFUOCO
                        Very well then. Safe travels.

           Mangiafuoco flashes a foreboding grin and closes the lid.

           INT. BOAT

           The cargo area of the boat. Three deck hands sit around 
           drinking and playing poker on top of the barrel as Geppetto 
           waits inside uncomfortably.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And so it was Geppetto made his way 
                        back, slowly getting closer to his 
                        love who believed him to be dead.
           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Julia cries in her wedding dress as a seamstress makes 
           adjustments.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But believing Geppetto to be dead 
                        Julia gave up on running away and 
                        resigned herself to marrying 
                        Edmund. Her life had no meaning 
                        without Geppetto and if she could 
                        not be happy herself ever again, 
                        she could at least save her family.

           INT. BOAT - LATER

           One deck hand remains and is passed out drunk. Geppetto opens 
           the top of the barrel and sneaks out. 

           EXT. BOAT - EVENING

           Geppetto sits atop the sail looking out over the dark ocean. 
           In the distance he sees land and smiles.

           EXT. DOCKSIDE BAIT STORE - DAY

           Geppetto looks at a newspaper. The date in the corner: 
           Thursday, June 19. He’s takes it in for a moment before 
           opening the paper. He keeps turning pages until he finds the 
           headline he’s looking for:

           EDMUND VILE AND JULIA MOON TO BE MARRIED ON SATURDAY 
           AFTERNOON IN GRAND CEREMONY, ANYONE OF IMPORTANCE TO ATTEND, 
           THOSE DEEMED NOT IMPORTANT TO WATCH JEALOUSLY FROM A DISTANCE

           Geppetto gets a determined look on his face.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        He only had three days to travel 
                        1,000 miles. But, he thought, he 
                        had already come half-way around 
                        the world so what was 1,000 miles?

           MONTAGE:

           1. Geppetto walks away from the sleepy coastal town with a 
           new determination.

           2. Geppetto walks down the side of a highway as a chain gang 
           hits rocks with mallets. A truck approaches and he puts his 
           thumb out for a ride but it doesn’t stop.
           3. Edmund and Julia have their wedding portrait painted. 
           Julia sits sadly while Edmund lays across a pillow 
           flamboyantly, holding the fox and cat.

           4. Geppetto runs along the side of a train and manages to 
           jump into one of the box cars where several other men hide.

           5. Geppetto walks over a grassy hill as a fighter jet flies 
           overhead.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - EVENING

           Geppetto comes up to a tent revival in full swing, the gospel 
           music filling the night.

           INT. TENT REVIVAL

           Geppetto watches as the choir sings enthusiastically. The 
           congregation moves along with passion. As he gets lost in the 
           spectacle and feeling an ominous BLIND MAN sitting nearby 
           turns toward Geppetto.

                                 BLIND MAN
                        You’re going to have three great 
                        misfortunes in your life.

           Geppetto looks around.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Are you talking to me?

                                 BLIND MAN
                        The first has happened. Prepare for 
                        the remaining two. 

           Geppetto looks into the man’s face and then turns away, 
           leaving quickly.

           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Geppetto drags himself along, exhausted, hot and hungry from 
           the journey with night approaching fast. As he walks a hot 
           air balloon approaches from the sky behind him rather 
           quickly. In fact, it’s coming right at him really fast.

           Two men in the basket yell at Geppetto to watch out. Geppetto 
           turns and sees it. Shocked, he jumps off the side of the road 
           right before he’s hit and lands in a thicket of thorny 
           bushes.
           The balloon flies by and goes back up into the air. As 
           Geppetto gets up and brushes himself off he looks up confused 
           only to see the balloon coming right back at him! 

           Again Geppetto has to jump off the side of the road not to be 
           hit. The balloon lands on the road. On the side is a painted 
           logo that reads: THE AMAZING, SUBLIME, MIND BENDING, GARY AND 
           JERRY VAUDEVILLE TEAM SPECIALIZING IN MAGIC, HUMOR AND 
           ILLUSION

           The two men stick their heads out to see Geppetto laying in 
           the bushes. They are, of course, GARY and JERRY, two 
           eccentric vaudeville performers. Gary is short and fat while 
           Jerry is tall and thin.

                                 GARY
                        You killed him, Jerry. Nice job.

                                 JERRY
                        You’re the one steering, Gary

                                 GARY
                        This is no time for blame. A man’s 
                        dead and it’s all your fault.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (on the ground)
                        I’m not dead. I’m fine.

           Gary and Jerry look at each other a moment then rush to 
           Geppetto. They stand him up and brush him off quickly. 

                                 GARY
                        You should be more careful.

                                 JERRY
                        You could get hurt.

                                 GARY
                        Walking in the road like that.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Well I didn’t think I’d be attacked 
                        from above.

                                 GARY
                        There you are.

                                 JERRY
                        Good as new.

           They each pat Geppetto on the back causing him to fall back 
           down the ledge. They look at each other and rush down to get 
           him, standing him back up.
                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        You should be more careful.

                                 GARY
                        Standing on a ledge like that.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Just leave me alone!

           He pushes their hands away and begins walking down the road 
           angrily. Gary and Jerry look after him a moment and then rush 
           up to catch him.

                                 GARY
                        So you’re just going to walk away 
                        without even a thank you?

                                 JERRY
                        Let alone a cash prize of 
                        gratitude?

           Geppetto stops and turns toward them.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Why would I thank you? Now leave me 
                        alone! I have somewhere to be.

           He turns and keeps walking. 

                                 GARY
                        So he’s one to hold a grudge, is 
                        he?

                                 JERRY
                        Must be Irish.

                                 GARY
                        At least let us make it up to you.

           Gary catches up to Geppetto, reaches behind his ear and pulls 
           out a white dove. Geppetto can’t believe it.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        How did you do that?

                                 GARY
                        Same way I do this.

           He pulls out a handkerchief, holds it up so Geppetto can see 
           it and then shakes it, turning it into a cane. He then turns 
           the cane into a bowling ball, which he drops on Jerry’s foot. 
           Jerry begins to cry and Gary turns the ball back into a 
           handkerchief which he hands to him to wipe his tears. Jerry 
           applauds loudly as Garry bows.
                                 JERRY
                        Bravo! Bravo!

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Who are you?

                                 GARY
                        I’m glad you asked.

                                 JERRY
                        For we are--

           They come together theatrically.

                                 GARY AND JERRY
                        The amazing, sublime, mind bending, 
                        Gary and Jerry Vaudeville team 
                        specializing in magic, humor and 
                        illusion.

           A beat.

                                 GARY
                        Not to be confused with the 
                        amazing, sublime, mind bending, 
                        Gary and Terry Vaudeville team 
                        specializing in magic, humor and 
                        illusion.

                                 JERRY
                        There was a case in the courts.

                                 GARY
                        Now we have to specify.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Why not just change your name?

           Gary and Jerry just look at each a moment. Obviously they’ve 
           never thought of this. Then:

                                 GARY
                        It’s already painted on the 
                        balloon.

           Jerry sighs, relieved they have a reason.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I see. Well you two are surely 
                        talented but I’m afraid I have to 
                        keep going. 

                                 GARY
                        Where are you headed?
                                 JERRY
                        Let us give you a lift.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (with seriousness)
                        I’m going to Edmund Vile’s wedding.

                                 JERRY
                        That’s where we’re going, isn’t it 
                        Gary?

                                 GARY
                        Exactly the place.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s meant to be.

           Geppetto stops.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (interested)
                        You are?

                                 JERRY
                        What a monstrosity!

                                 GARY
                        Wrong word.

                                 JERRY
                        What a coincidence!

                                 GARY
                        Better! Now what do you say, show 
                        some sense and let us give you a 
                        ride. 

           Geppetto looks them over, still unsure. He then looks down 
           the dark, uninviting road.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Okay, but I have to get there fast 
                        for my whole life depends on it.

                                 GARY
                        No need to worry for the amazing, 
                        sublime, mind bending, Gary and 
                        Jerry Vaudeville team specializing 
                        in magic, humor and illusion are 
                        performing at the reception and 
                        they have never once been late to a 
                        gig.
                                 JERRY
                             (quickly)
                        Not to be confused with the 
                        amazing, sublime, mind bending, 
                        Gary and Terry Vaudeville team 
                        specializing in magic, humor and 
                        illusion. 

                                 GARY
                        Are you on the bride or the groom’s 
                        side?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Neither, I’m going to stop the 
                        wedding.

           This stops Gary and Jerry who look at Geppetto curiously.

                                 GARY
                        Stop the wedding?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Yes.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        When they saw his face they 
                        understood the situation 
                        immediately for such true love is 
                        impossible to hide.

           Gary puts his arm around him.

                                 GARY
                        Come, we will get you there in 
                        time.

           They lead him to the balloon.

           I/E. HOT AIR BALLOON - NIGHT

           Geppetto holds on to the basket nervously as they float high 
           over the land. A few lights twinkle below them.

           EXT. WEDDING - DAY

           A grand event under a huge white tent. Everyone rich and of 
           importance is present and dressed to kill. The guests walk 
           through the entrance with an air of superiority as the 
           ragamuffins, hobos and general population look on jealously. 
           In the background the balloon makes a crash landing. 
           EXT. WEDDING - LATER

           Gary and Jerry struggle to carry a huge wood crate up to the 
           entrance where Hotspur keeps the uninvited out with a 
           menacing look and crossed arms. They stop when they get to 
           him and put the crate down.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Invitation.

                                 GARY
                        Invitation? Do you have any idea 
                        who were are?

           Hotspur just stares at them.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                             (to Jerry)
                        I have the feeling he doesn’t have 
                        many ideas at all. 

           Jerry laughs loudly but stops quickly when Hotspur looks down 
           at them, cracking his knuckles threateningly.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Well, good sir, it pleases me to 
                        tell you that we are:

           They come together theatrically.

                                 GARY AND JERRY

                                 JERRY
                        We are performing for these very 
                        guests.

                                 GARY
                        The elite of the elite.

                                 JERRY
                        The cream of the ocean.
                                 GARY
                        Wrong word.

                                 JERRY
                        The cream of the crop. 

                                 GARY
                        Better.
                             (sotto to Hotspur)
                        He has a condition.

           Jerry looks embarrassed. Hotspur looks them over.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        No one gets in without an 
                        invitation. Not even mothers.

           He gestures to where Edmund’s mom waits sadly outside the 
           tent with a group of people struggling to get a view.

                                 GARY
                        Very well. Let me see, where did I 
                        put that...

           He begins to search through his pockets but can’t find it.

                                 JERRY
                        Where’s the last place you left it?

                                 GARY
                        That’s sort of the point, isn’t it?

           Gary then looks up at Hotspur.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Ah ha! There it is!

           He reaches behind Hotspur’s ear and pulls out the invitation.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I knew I had it.

           Jerry applauds wildly. Hotspur snorts and takes the 
           invitation. He looks it over and then moves aside for them to 
           pass. Gary and Jerry give each other a nod, pick up the heavy 
           crate, and start to walk in. Just when they think they’ve 
           made it:

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Wait.

           They stop nervously.
                                 HOTSPUR (CONT’D)
                        What’s in the crate?

           Gary and Jerry look at each other. Then:

                                 GARY
                        Well, sir, if you must know in the 
                        crate we have something absolutely 
                        terrifying.

                                 JERRY
                        Exceedingly ferocious.

                                 GARY
                        Upmost dangerous.

                                 JERRY
                        The sight of it makes woman faint.

                                 GARY
                        Men cry.

                                 JERRY
                        Children go mad.

           Inside the box Geppetto tries to growl convincingly. Hotspur 
           takes a step back.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        Well what is it?

                                 GARY
                        Our greatest and most dangerous 
                        trick.

                                 JERRY
                        Perhaps the world’s most dangerous 
                        trick.
                             (to Gary)
                        Too much?

                                 GARY
                        Not at all, for it is true. In this 
                        crate we have a wild, East African, 
                        saber-toothed, tri-horned, poison-
                        skinned, venom-shooting, web-
                        spinning, guerilla-monkey, spotted 
                        leopard. 

                                 JERRY
                        The most deadly animal known to 
                        man.
                                 GARY
                        Which we, Gary and Jerry, two 
                        humble vaudeville performers and 
                        simple magicians, this very night 
                        will turn into the most beautiful--

                                 JERRY
                        --Elegant!

                                 GARY
                        --Stylish!

                        --Fur coat the lady in waiting has 
                        ever seen.

                                 GARY
                        With only the stroke of a wand. 

                                 JERRY
                        As a wedding gift.

                                 GARY
                        From us!

                                 JERRY
                        Jerry and Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Gary and Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                             (sotto)
                        Would you like to see it?

           Geppetto shakes and growls more. Hotspur gulps.

                                 HOTSPUR
                             (scared)
                        I better not. On the job, you know.

                                 GARY
                        We understand.

           They bow, pick up the crate and walk into the tent just as 
           the orchestra begins to play.

           INT. WEDDING - LATER

           Gary and Jerry watch the ceremony sitting on the crate in the 
           back of the tent. Edmund stands on stage smugly next to a 
           PRIEST. Julia’s parents sit in the front row. 
                                 EDMUND
                             (to the priest)
                        Tonight is going to be incredible.
                             (beat)
                        You’ll just have to take my word on 
                        it.

           The music starts and Julia enters looking absolutely 
           beautiful. Everyone’s breath is immediately taken away by her 
           beauty. She looks at Edmund with hesitation and then at her 
           family. She walks forward as the crowd stands in complete 
           awe. 

           Jerry whispers to Gary while pointing to Geppetto in the 
           crate:

                                 JERRY
                        She’s way out of his league.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (from the crate)
                        What’s happening?

                                 GARY
                        I think you’re aiming too high. 
                        Have you ever considered a bar 
                        maid?

                                 JERRY
                        Or a disgraced nun?

           Guests look back at Gary and Jerry, annoyed by their talking, 
           but they just look over their shoulders to see what they’re 
           looking at. 

           Julia gets to the podium and looks up at Edmund. There’s a 
           sadness in her face for he’s not the one she loves. The 
           priest begins solemnly.

                                 PRIEST
                        Dearly beloved, we are gathered 
                        here today to witness as...

           He pauses, takes a piece of paper from his pocket and reads 
           from it. As he reads Edmund mouths the words silently along.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        ...the handsome but manly, dashing 
                        but approachable, athletic but not 
                        in a gross way, amazingly 
                        intelligent but not in a weird way, 
                        good-hearted but not a pansy, 
                        Edmund Vile.
                                 EDMUND
                        Veee-laaay!

                                 PRIEST
                        Edmund Veee-laay! takes the hand of 
                        Julia Moon in marriage. 
                             (beat)
                        Now if there’s anyone here today 
                        who knows of any reason why these 
                        two shouldn’t be joined in holy 
                        matrimony, let them speak now or 
                        forever hold their peace.

           He looks over the guests but everyone is quiet. In the back 
           Gary and Jerry sit on the crate, crying, moved by the 
           ceremony. Geppetto struggles to shake them off of the crate 
           but they don’t notice.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        It was Geppetto’s moment, what he 
                        had traveled thousands of miles to 
                        do, but Gary and Jerry were so 
                        moved by the beauty of the 
                        ceremony, the idea of two people 
                        eternally promising their love to 
                        each other, and the smell of the 
                        delicious buffet currently being 
                        prepared outside that they forget 
                        they were sitting on Geppetto.

                                 GARY
                        It’s so beautiful.

                                 JERRY
                        Makes me want a wife.

           Back at the front:

                                 PRIEST
                        No one? No reason is too small you 
                        know. Don’t be self-conscious.
                             (beat)
                        Perhaps you think they’re ill-
                        suited? 
                             (beat)
                        Their interests too dissimilar that 
                        you worry they will grow apart over 
                        time, eventually taking other 
                        lovers to fill the holes in their 
                        hearts, which would be a disgrace 
                        to the institution of marriage.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRIEST (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps you find one the most 
                        beautiful, gentle, lovely person in 
                        the world and the other a mule’s 
                        ass.

           No one speaks. Edmund gives the priest an angry look.

                                 EDMUND
                             (sharply)
                        Get on with it then.

           The priest looks at Mr. Moon in the front row. He just stares 
           at the ground. He then looks at Julia and sighs.

                                 PRIEST
                        Very well. Then I shall continue...

           Julia’s face falls, her fate sealed. 

           Inside the crate Geppetto pushes against the top as hard as 
           he can. It’s his only chance and he gathers all his strength. 
           Finally, the lid of the crate flies off. Gary and Jerry 
           scream as they tumble off, having forgotten all about 
           Geppetto. Geppetto jumps out.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You can’t marry him!!!

                           JULIA
                                                         EDMUND
                 (happily)
                                                (angrily)
           Geppetto!
                                              Geppetto!

           Shock all around. The guests whisper “He’s alive” and “It’s a 
           miracle.”

                                 PRIEST
                        Thank god.

                                 JERRY
                             (with relief)
                        Oh that’s right. For a second I 
                        thought it was a wild, East 
                        African, saber-toothed, tri-horned, 
                        poison-skinned, venom-shooting, web-
                        spinning, guerilla-monkey, spotted 
                        leopard. 

           We CLOSE IN on Julia who’s overtaken with the miracle of it 
           all.

                                 JULIA
                        I thought you had died.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        I promised I’d come, didn’t I? Not 
                        even a war could stop me.

           She nods, wiping away tears. Geppetto, astonished by her 
           beauty, forgets for a moment that she’s about to marry 
           someone else.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        You look even better than in my 
                        dreams.

                                 EDMUND
                             (mocking)
                        “You look even better than in my 
                        dreams.” Can’t you even die 
                        properly?

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (to the crowd with 
                              authority)
                        I came to stop the wedding for I’m 
                        afraid the bride’s heart belongs to 
                        another.

           Geppetto pulls out the paper heart. Julia beams with 
           happiness.

                                 EDMUND
                        This is absurd. Someone arrest him.

           The priest looks to Julia who smiles widely.

                                 PRIEST
                        Is this true?

                                 JULIA
                             (unable to contain her 
                              happiness)
                        Yes! I love him insanely, madly and 
                        truly!!!

           The crowd is stunned silent.

                                 EDMUND
                        I am feeling extraordinarily angry 
                        AT THIS MOMENT! This being my 
                        wedding day and my bride apparently 
                        IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER MAN! A DEAD 
                        MAN!
                             (to Julia)
                        And we were getting on so well.
                                 JULIA
                        I don’t love you, Edmund Vile. And 
                        I never could.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s pronounced Veee-laaaaay! Veee-
                        laaaaay! Veee-laaaaay! Veee-
                        laaaaay!!!

           He pulls out a small gun and aims it at Geppetto.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        You never, ever go after another 
                        man’s woman, unless you’re French, 
                        and you look much too pleased with 
                        yourself to be French.

           As he fires Julia pushes his arm up into the air so the 
           bullet pierces the tent. The crowd goes crazy, running every 
           which way. 

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (to Julia’s father)
                        You’re a ruined man!

                                 MR. MOON
                        No, this will save me.
                             (to Julia)
                        Forgive me. I see now that Geppetto 
                        is the only one who deserves you. 
                        Seeing you smile again makes me 
                        rich enough for a lifetimes.

                                 EDMUND
                        Has everyone gone mad?! You can’t 
                        buy food with smiles.

           Julia runs to Geppetto in the chaos.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Sorry to ruin your wedding and not 
                        even bring a gift.

                                 JULIA
                        You get a year.

           They kiss madly, having waited years for this, but their 
           moment of reunion is ruined by another a gun shot.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Let’s get out of here.
                                 EDMUND
                             (to Hotspur)
                        Stop them!

           Geppetto pulls her through the chaos, ducking as Edmund 
           continues after them, firing shots. They look for a way out 
           but every way is blocked by panicking guests or Hotspur 
           coming after them angrily.

                                 JULIA
                        We’re trapped.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        There’s always a way out.

                                 GARY
                             (calling)
                        Geppetto! Over here!

           Geppetto looks up and sees Gary and Jerry waving them over. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        See.

           He takes Julia by her hand and runs across the chairs toward 
           them. Edmund fires another shot at Geppetto, just missing.

                                 GARY
                        Hurry, get in the box.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Are you crazy?

                                 JERRY
                        Only clinically. NOW IN THE BOX!

           They push Geppetto into the crate and then look up at Julia.

                                 GARY
                        Excuse us, miss.

                                 JERRY
                        Apologies.

           They grab her and stuff her into the crate, putting the lid 
           over it just as Edmund walks up. The crate shakes a little as 
           Gary and Jerry stand in front of it.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ve got you now you imbecile. 
                        Really, you must have a faulty 
                        brain if you think you can hide in 
                        there. I’ll almost feel bad about 
                        killing you, but not quite.
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDMUND (CONT'D)
                             (to Gary and Jerry)
                        Now move aside!

           They do.

                                 GARY
                        As you say.

                                 JERRY
                        Your wish granted.

                                 GARY
                        But they’re not in the box.

                                 EDMUND
                        You must take me for an idiot.

                                 GARY
                        We take you for nothing, sir.

           Edmund pushes them aside and lifts the top open on the crate. 
           It’s empty.

                                 EDMUND
                        How in the world...

           Gary and Jerry step forward and bow as the guests applaud at 
           their trick.

                                 GARY AND JERRY
                        We are the amazing, sublime, mind 
                        bending, Gary and Jerry Vaudeville 
                        team specializing in magic, humor 
                        and illusion.

           A beat.

                                 GARY
                        Not to be confused with-- 

           Edmund loses his temper and grabs Gary.

                                 EDMUND
                        TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE BEFORE I 
                        KILL YOU TOO!

           Gary motions with his head to outside the tent. Edmund shoots 
           a hole in the tent and rips it open with his hands. In the 
           very far distance Geppetto and Julia run away, making their 
           escape. The guests applaud again.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (to everyone)
                        Oh shut up will you?! 
           INT. WOODS - DAY

           Geppetto and Julia stop and hide behind a tree as Edmund and 
           Hotspur drive by looking for them. Once they pass they relax. 

                                 JULIA
                        You saved me. You did it.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Did you doubt I would?

                                 JULIA
                        It seemed impossible.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What seemed impossible was how much 
                        I missed you.

           Julia sees the scar on the side of his head. She runs her 
           fingers over it.

                                 JULIA
                        You were wounded?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It’s nothing--

           She kisses the scar. 

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        Well it did hurt.

           She kisses it again. A moment passes as they look at each 
           other, amazed just to finally be together alone. 

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (seriously)
                        There’s something I have to tell 
                        you. Something I couldn’t write.

                                 JULIA
                             (concerned)
                        What is it?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        This.

           He takes her in his arms and kisses her madly, falling onto a 
           pile of leaves. We hear the musical beating of her heart. 
                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Though their love was true and a 
                        misfortune was adverted don’t for a 
                        second think all will end well, for 
                        that’s just not how these stories 
                        go.

           Geppetto pulls out a beautiful wooden ring and slips it on 
           her finger. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Now I have a childhood promise to 
                        keep.

           She pulls him close and they continue kissing passionately.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           We come up to a small hut with oddly colored smoke coming 
           from the chimney. Edmund’s fox and cat wait outside for him. 
           A sign on the outside reads: FOR ALL YOUR WITCHERY AND 
           PSYCHIC NEEDS

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        For that very night, still in his 
                        wedding suit, Edmund went to a 
                        woman with no name who was rumored 
                        to be able to cause strange curses. 

           INT. HUT - NIGHT

           There are odd relics hanging from the walls and shelves of 
           jars full of colorful powders, dead animals and strange 
           plants. As Edmund considers a handwritten menu of curses on 
           the wall, the witch approaches with a dead bat.

                                 EDMUND
                        What evil are you going to cause 
                        with that?

                                 WITCH
                        Evil?

           She takes a bite out of it.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        This is dinner.

           Edmund is disgusted.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        So have you made up your mind yet?
                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t know, how about just 
                        KILLING THEM?!

                                 WITCH
                        No can do. That goes strictly 
                        against the 1923 League of Witches 
                        Charter which clearly prohibits 
                        curses causing death in order to 
                        better the name of withes and 
                        witchery.

                                 EDMUND
                        Give them some terrible, puss 
                        filled boils!

                                 WITCH
                        I don’t do anything found in Job. 
                        You just can’t do it better.

                                 EDMUND
                        Make their hair turn into snakes.

                                 WITCH
                        Come on. Stop thinking so obvious.

                                 EDMUND
                        I don’t hear you making any 
                        suggestions.

                                 WITCH
                        Well if they really love each 
                        other, and it’s true love which is 
                        a very rare thing, then the way to 
                        hurt them most, to truly add 
                        sadness to their lives, isn’t to 
                        make them ill or ugly, for true 
                        love conquers those things. 

                                 EDMUND
                        Go on.

                                 WITCH
                        The only way to truly curse them is 
                        to make their love feel incomplete.

                                 EDMUND
                        How do I do that?

                                 WITCH
                        What do all couples deeply in love 
                        want most?

           Edmund is stumped.
                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        The physical manifestation of love 
                        itself, the result of passion.

           Edmund still has no idea.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        A child.

                                 EDMUND
                        Genius! We’ll give them dozens of 
                        children. Gross little grubby 
                        nagging children.

           The witch puts her hand to her forehead.

                                 WITCH
                        No, you fool.

                                 EDMUND
                        No?

                                 WITCH
                        We’ll make them unable to produce 
                        any children. Their marriage will 
                        bear no fruit so at the center of 
                        it will be a hole they cannot fill. 

           Edmund flashes an evil smile.

                                 EDMUND
                        Make it so. Or if they do have a 
                        child it can have snakes for hair 
                        so they constantly get bit.

                                 WITCH
                        Let me handle this. There’s a 
                        special power to true love.

           She starts gathering ingredients for the curse.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        She had come across true love only 
                        one time before.

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. HUT - DAY

           Many years earlier. A young Eunice sits across from the witch 
           in all black.
                                 WITCH
                        I’m afraid there is no way to bring 
                        him back and because of man’s 
                        follies there will be many more 
                        like you.

           Eunice bursts into tears, a show of emotion that surprises 
           the witch. The tears fall on the ground and burn little 
           holes.

           INT. HUT - LATER

           Eunice has left. The witch scoops up the tears into a small 
           vile she has labeled “Tears of True Love.”

                                                       BACK TO PRESENT:

           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           A dark, quiet church. The same priest now eagerly marries 
           Julia, still in her wedding dress, and Geppetto. There are no 
           guests and it couldn’t be more different from the earlier 
           wedding. They look at each other with a huge amount of 
           happiness. They’ve been waiting this moment for years. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        So while Julia married for the 
                        second time in one day, this time 
                        to her true love, she had no idea 
                        of the curse being placed on her at 
                        that very moment. 

                                 JULIA
                             (simply from the heart, 
                              with great honesty)
                        I will love you, Geppetto, as I 
                        always have: with my whole body, my 
                        whole soul, and my whole being. If 
                        we run out of room in this world to 
                        contain my love for you we will 
                        make a new one. And when that one 
                        fills up we’ll make another one. 
                        We’ll make a whole world just for 
                        the love I feel for you on a rainy 
                        afternoon. Another for the love I 
                        feel for you when you laugh. And 
                        feel sad. And the way you get happy 
                        when you see a dog. It will take 
                        1,000 worlds just to contain the 
                        love I feel for you.
           Geppetto’s heart swells. As he speaks Julia becomes overcome 
           with emotion.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (with great conviction)
                        And I will love you, Julia, as I 
                        always have: as if everything 
                        depended on it. The street lamps 
                        lit by it, the cable cars powered 
                        by it, and all the people living 
                        given the hope to get out of bed 
                        because of it. I will love you 
                        forever and the lights will never 
                        flicker, the cars never stall, and 
                        the people will never give up 
                        because my love for you in 
                        unfailing. It will be the thing of 
                        stories, the envy of poets.

           They both feel the enormity of the moment. This is everything 
           they’ve ever wanted and have fought for.

                                 PRIEST
                        You may now kiss the bride.

           Geppetto kisses her. It’s the happiest moment of both their 
           lives. Then she suddenly grabs her stomach, doubling over in 
           pain. Geppetto holds her.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (concerned)
                        What is it?

                                 JULIA
                        Nothing. Just a passing pain. 

           She smiles at him.

           INSERT: The wooden book to a page reading:

           THE SECOND MISFORTUNE

           On the opposite page is a woodcarving of Julia and Geppetto 
           outside an unfinished house Geppetto is building. It’s hidden 
           in the side of a hill. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        The Second misfortune came in the 
                        spring of Geppetto’s life...

           We CLOSE IN on the wood panel as it FADES into reality:
           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - DAY

           Geppetto and Julia hang a wooden plaque with their initials 
           on the door.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Believing Edmund Vile would never 
                        cease in his quest for revenge, 
                        Geppetto took his new bride and 
                        retreated deep into the woods where 
                        they created their own paradise. 

           After hanging it they step back from the house and take it 
           all in with a great deal of happiness. He takes her hand.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Geppetto and Julia lay on their backs in the grass looking up 
           at the stars. The house behind them is closer to being done.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        The first year passed happily 
                        because they were together freely 
                        for the first time in their lives.

                                 JULIA
                        You think there’s anyone up there 
                        looking down on us?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Of course. Don’t you?

                                 JULIA
                        There’s so much misfortune in the 
                        world I don’t see how there could 
                        be.

           Geppetto tilts Julia’s head so she’s looking up at the sky 
           sideways. He then uses his finger to trace a shape by 
           connecting the stars, leaving a white line between them. The 
           shape becomes a cricket.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        See, there’s an enormous cricket. 
                        Everyone is preoccupied with the 
                        other constellations that they miss 
                        the giant cricket. 

           Julia laughs.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        It’s right there for you to see.
                                 JULIA
                        And what does the cricket do up 
                        there?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        He keeps an eye on us I suppose, to 
                        make sure we do the right thing and 
                        not the wrong thing.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But just as the witch had planned, 
                        there was one thing missing.

           A star shoots across the sky.

                                 JULIA
                             (pointing)
                        A shooting star!

           They watch it until it disappears.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Did you make a wish?

                                 JULIA
                        Of course.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What did you wish for?

                                 JULIA
                        If I tell you it won’t come true.

           She kisses him.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        But you should have a pretty good 
                        idea by now.

           They continue to kiss as we PAN UP to the sky.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Geppetto and Julia wake happily in each other’s arm.

                                 JULIA
                        I dreamt of a name last night.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        A name?

                                 JULIA
                        For our son.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        You know we’ll have a son?

                                 JULIA
                        I am sure of it.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        And what makes you so sure?

                                 JULIA
                        A blue fairy, whose face I couldn’t 
                        see, appeared before me in my dream 
                        and said to name our son Pinocchio.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (laughing)
                        Pinocchio?

                                 JULIA
                        Yes!

                                 GEPPETTO
                        If you dreamt it then it is the 
                        perfect name.

           He kisses her as she laughs.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But the curse was not to be broken.

           MONTAGE:

           1. Geppetto and Julia visit a doctor who holds up a chart and 
           shakes his head “no.” They look at each other disappointed.

           2. Geppetto downs a bottle of fertility elixir almost 
           spitting it out. He then smiles at Julia sure it will work.

           3. Geppetto chases the elixir salesmen trying to get his 
           money back.

           4. Julia wears a contraption that shakes her belly. Though 
           she’s really uncomfortable she looks up at Geppetto and 
           smiles hopefully. 

           5. Geppetto and Julia visit another doctor getting more bad 
           news. They look at each other hopeless.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Geppetto and Julia, now 33, lay on a blanket looking up at 
           the stars. 
                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And as the first year became the 
                        first decade the disappointment 
                        became a misfortune.

           A shooting star flies across the sky but neither of them make 
           a wish.

           EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY

           Edmund walks carrying two sacks of cash away from the bank. 
           As he passes different TOWNSPEOPLE they point and snicker at 
           him behind his back. Edmund feels them looking at him.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Meanwhile, Edmund found that the 
                        curse did not satisfy his desire 
                        for revenge. He had been made a 
                        fool of by an orphan carpenter and 
                        he was certain it had made him a 
                        laughing stock of society.

           He turns around angrily.

                                 EDMUND
                        What the hell are you all looking 
                        at?!

           No one’s there. He pulls himself together and keeps walking.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And being a vain man it grew worse 
                        and worse in his mind.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Edmund sits in the back of a large car with two cheap women 
           fighting over him. They are Scarlet, the girl from Geppetto’s 
           youth, and SAMANTHA. Hotspur drives.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Then one night his opportunity 
                        finally came.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I don’t see why Samantha has to be 
                        here.

                                 SCARLET
                        I knew him before you did, 
                        Samantha. We went to school 
                        together.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        You went to school?

                                 EDMUND
                        Ladies, please, there’s no reason 
                        to fight over me. I have an arm for 
                        each of you, do I not?

           He holds out an arm to each of them. Scarlet and Samantha 
           look at each other then each grab an arm. 

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s eat lobster and 
                        champagne. Hotspur, to the Coral 
                        Gables. We’ll close the place down!

           The girls giggle with excitement and begin to put make-up on. 
           Hotspur confirms with a grunt and starts to drive. As they 
           drive forward Edmund sees Mr. Moon, Julia’s father, selling 
           apples for a nickel on the corner.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        STOP!!!

           The car comes to a screeching stop causing the make-up to go 
           all over the girl’s faces. Edmund looks at Mr. Moon.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hey, what’s the problem?

                                 SCARLET
                        I’m trying to put make-up on here.

                                 EDMUND
                             (to himself)
                        Well if it isn’t my ex-future-
                        father-in-law. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You’re married? Figures.

                                 SCARLET
                        He’s not married, he was left at 
                        the altar by Julia Moon.

           Edmund pushes them away.

                                 EDMUND
                        Get away from me.

                                 SCARLET
                        What’s the idea?
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah, what about dinner?

                                 EDMUND
                             (calmly)
                        Well, I’d suggest you eat it 
                        everyday.
                             (then furious)
                        NOW GET OUT!

           He opens the door and throws a bunch of money on the ground 
           which they immediately scramble to pick up.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (calmly)
                        Thank you, ladies. Shall we say 
                        next Thursday at the same time?

           He slams the door on them, looks back at Mr. Moon and grins.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        As he saw the broken man a new 
                        insidious plan began to grow in his 
                        heart.

           Edmund rolls down the window.

                                 EDMUND
                        Get back in the car, Scarlet.

                                 SCARLET
                        Bye, Samantha.

           She smiles proudly as she opens the door.

           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Julia sleeps as Geppetto looks through a wooden box of his 
           memories. There are photographs of him and his parents and 
           other objects from childhood. 

           As he looks he sees the paper heart. He takes it out but as 
           he does part of it accidently gets caught on a splinter on 
           the box and it tears in half. He looks shocked and can’t 
           believe what he’s done. He makes sure Julia is still asleep.

           INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

           Geppetto works on making a new paper heart identical to the 
           old one. Behind him is a wooden cradle and carved baby toys 
           long discarded or left unfinished.
           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE

           He walks back into the house holding the heart. As he does 
           Julia wakes up.

                                 JULIA
                        What were you doing?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Just checking on the workshop.

           She sees the heart.

                                 JULIA
                        Were you doing something with the 
                        heart?

           A beat.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No, I just wanted to look at it.

                                 JULIA
                             (concerned)
                        Is that a new one? It seems 
                        different.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No, it’s the same as always.

           She looks at the heart and then at his face.

                                 JULIA
                        I must just be tired.

           Geppetto smiles at her but a flicker of regret flashes across 
           his face.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Go back to sleep my love.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        It seemed a simple lie, for he knew 
                        she would take the broken heart as 
                        a bad sign, but the consequences of 
                        a lie are never simple.

           EXT. FANCY CLOTHING STORE - DAY

           Edmund walks up to the store with Scarlet who’s dressed like 
           a prostitute. The fox and cat follow them. 
                                 EDMUND
                        Stay.

           The cat and fox sit at the door. 

                                 SCARLET
                        Say, why is that fox and cat always 
                        following you around?

                                 EDMUND
                        Because, my dear, I FIND HUMANS TO 
                        BE EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT! 

           He opens the door.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Now don’t embarrass me.

           INT. FANCY CLOTHING STORE

           The WOMAN behind the counter looks shocked as Scarlet enters.

                                 SCARLET
                        Wow, this is real fancy stuff.

                                 EDMUND
                        Don’t touch anything.
                             (to the woman)
                        Can you make her look respectable? 
                        I realize it won’t be easy.

                                 SCARLET
                        Hey, what’s that supposed to mean? 

           Geppetto holds up a wad of cash.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’ll make it worth your while.

           EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY

           Scarlet, now dressed up and looking like a respectable young 
           woman, walks up to Mr. Moon selling apples. She now speaks in 
           a very proper tone.

                                 SCARLET
                             (RE: the apples)
                        Those look beautiful.

                                 MR. MOON
                        They were picked just this morning. 
                        Did it myself.
                                 SCARLET
                        How much?

                                 MR. MOON
                        Nickel each.

                                 SCARLET
                        I’ll take one.

           She takes out a nickel and gives it to him. She takes her 
           apple and is about to leave but stops.

                                 SCARLET (CONT’D)
                        You look familiar. Are you Julia 
                        Moon’s father?

                                 MR. MOON
                             (sadly)
                        She used to be my little girl, yes.

                                 SCARLET
                        I thought it was you. Remember me, 
                        Scarlet Shaw? I was classmates with 
                        Julia.

           He looks at her a moment, trying to remember.

                                 MR. MOON
                        I believe I do.

                                 SCARLET
                        It’s a shame about them not having 
                        children. Two people meant to be 
                        together like that. 

                                 MR. MOON
                             (suspicious)
                        How do you know?

                                 SCARLET
                             (acting embarrassed)
                        My husband’s a doctor and he tried 
                        to help them. I’m sorry, I 
                        shouldn’t have said anything. It’s 
                        none of my business.
                             (beat)
                        But you know, I might know someone 
                        who can help them. Jim would kill 
                        me for getting involved but I just 
                        feel so bad for her. We were such 
                        good friends once upon a time. 

           She takes a piece of paper, writes on it and hands it to him.
                                 SCARLET (CONT’D)
                        Give this to Julia. She’s not what 
                        you’d call traditional but she’s 
                        helped a lot of girls I know. Maybe 
                        she can help Julia too. 

           Mr. Moon looks down at the paper.

                                 MR. MOON
                        Thank you.

                                 SCARLET
                             (losing the proper tone)
                        So long mister.

           She takes a bite of the apple and walks away. As he watches 
           her the cat and fox take an apple behind his back.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        A less broken man might have 
                        noticed her break in character.

           Scarlet walks to where Edmund hides behind a corner holding 
           out a wad of cash. She takes it.

                                 SCARLET
                        Thanks a bunch. That was the second 
                        easiest 50 bucks I ever made.

           The fox and cat bring Edmund the apple. 

           EXT. ALLEY - EARLY MORNING

           Mr. Moon ties a letter to the foot of a pigeon. 

                                 MR. MOON
                        Bring this letter to my daughter. 
                        Be safe with it for its contents 
                        may change the course of their 
                        lives.

           He releases the bird and it flies away with purpose.

           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Julia watches impatiently as Geppetto reads the letter from 
           her father. The pigeon sits on her window sill. Geppetto 
           finishes reading and looks at her.

                                 JULIA
                             (anxiously)
                        Well?
                                 GEPPETTO
                        It’s not something we should be 
                        getting involved in.

                                 JULIA
                        But we’ve tried everything else.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        We will let it come naturally. 
                        There’s a new doctor in town and I 
                        think--

                                 JULIA
                        --Every doctor has told us the same 
                        thing. There is nothing less 
                        natural about this method if it 
                        works. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t you want a child as badly as 
                        I do?

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (pained)
                        It’s all that I want for us.

                                 JULIA
                        Then we must at least try before 
                        it’s too late. Do it for me, 
                        Geppetto.

           Geppetto looks at her a long moment. 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Geppetto and Julia walk through the dark woods.

                                 JULIA
                        We already came this way. I 
                        remember that tree.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It looks new to me.

           There’s a loud howling sound in the distance.

                                 JULIA
                        What was that?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Let’s keep moving.

           They walk a little faster. Finally, they come upon the 
           witch’s hut where colored smoke floats from the chimney. 
           They share a moment of hesitation but Geppetto walks to the 
           door and knocks.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (calling)
                        Hello? Witch?

           After a moment the witch, looking more disgusting than ever, 
           answers and looks them over.

                                 WITCH
                        What can I do for you?

           Geppetto and Julia are taken back by her appearance. Then:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        We’re trying to have a child. 
                        Perhaps we came to the wrong--

                                 WITCH
                        You wouldn’t believe the cases of 
                        sterility I’ve been getting these 
                        days. Must be something in the 
                        water. Come in.

           Geppetto and Julia relax.

           INT. HUT - LATER

           Geppetto and Julia sit across from the witch pleading.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        As Geppetto and Julia told their 
                        story with passion, the witch 
                        realized this was the young couple 
                        Edmund had been bested by and who 
                        she had cursed a decade before. She 
                        could see that their love was true 
                        and felt torn for the first time in 
                        her life. Causing a terrible spell 
                        across space and time was one thing 
                        but to actually meet the recipient 
                        of such a spell was quite another. 

           Julia and Geppetto finish.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        So can you help us?

                                 JULIA
                        You’re our only hope.
                                 GEPPETTO
                        We’ve tried everything else.

           The witch thinks a moment.

                                 WITCH
                        I think I can help.

           Julia and Geppetto smile at one another, full of hope.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        But it was not so easy for she had 
                        guaranteed Edmund her curse. It was 
                        therefore unbreakable.

                                 WITCH
                        But I’m afraid it won’t come 
                        naturally.

                                 JULIA
                        What do you mean?

                                 WITCH
                        The child cannot be born.

           Julia and Geppetto share a disappointed look.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Geppetto, you’re a carpenter, 
                        yes?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I am.

                                 WITCH
                        I am glad to hear it. There’s a 
                        moving forest far away from here, 
                        and hidden in this forest is a 
                        magic tree, that’s twisted and 
                        knotted and bears no fruit. If you 
                        carve from the wood of this tree a 
                        boy puppet, as real looking as you 
                        can, he will become flesh and bone 
                        and be like any other real child. 
                        This is how you might have a child. 
                        The only way I’m afraid.

           They consider this unexpected option.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        How do I get to this tree?
                                 WITCH
                        I hope you’re serious about your 
                        desires because it’s a long and 
                        dangerous journey up cliffs of 
                        death, over glaciers of despair, 
                        and through rivers of peril. 

           Geppetto shares a look with Julia. Then:

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I am.

                                 WITCH
                        Good.

           She pulls out a blank map and unrolls it across the table. 
           Geppetto looks down at it.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It’s blank.

                                 WITCH
                        If your heart is true the map will 
                        reveal the way to you. Whenever you 
                        doubt your way close your eyes and 
                        think of that which you cherish 
                        most.

           EXT. HUT - LATER

           Geppetto and Julia leave the witch, their hope for a child 
           renewed.

           PAN to Hotspur watching as Geppetto and Julia walk away from 
           the hut, his eyes narrowing.

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Geppetto and Julia come out of the woods to their hillside 
           home. Hotspur watches from a distance as they enter. 

                                 HOTSPUR
                        You’ve done good, Hotspur.

           He turns and runs.

           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Geppetto packs a small bag of water, food, the map and an axe 
           which hangs from his belt as Julia watches worried.
                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Geppetto prepared for the long 
                        journey ...

           INT. EDMUND VILE’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Edmund sits at his desk in front of a blazing fire signing 
           notices of foreclosure.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        ... while Edmund learned of their 
                        whereabouts.

                                 EDMUND
                             (as he looks through 
                              notices)
                        Oh the poor crippled Billy. How 
                        could I possibly toss him out on 
                        the streets? 
                             (he signs it)
                        Because what cripple buys a two-
                        story house? An idiot one!

           Hotspur walks in.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        I’ve found them.

                                 EDMUND
                             (greatly pleased)
                        Excellent.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - MORNING

           Geppetto stands at the door, saying goodbye to Julia.

                                 JULIA
                             (realizing the tragedy of 
                              it)
                        Why is it so much of our life is 
                        saying goodbye to each other?

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (his voice faltering from 
                              emotion)
                        This will be the last time. When I 
                        come back we will have a child. I 
                        promise you this.

           He kisses her and walks away from the house.
           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Geppetto follows a stream coming to a fork in the road with a 
           sign with two arrows. One says COMFORT AND CIVILIZATION and 
           points to the right while the other says DANGER AND DISTRESS 
           and points to the left. Geppetto goes to the left.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - MORNING

           Edmund and Hotspur watch from a distance as Julia hangs 
           laundry in the sun. A satisfied look flashes across Edmund’s 
           face. He approaches the house with purpose.

           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Julia enters the house with her laundry basket. She turns 
           around to find Edmund standing there with an evil smile, 
           Hotspur behind him.

                                 EDMUND
                        Hello, my dear. It’s been far too 
                        long.

           She screams and tries to close the door on him but he blocks 
           it open and grabs her.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Now what kind of greeting is that 
                        for the man you almost married? I 
                        know we didn’t exactly end things 
                        amicably, you leaving with another 
                        man and me shooting at you and all, 
                        but isn’t that all water under the 
                        bridge?

                                 JULIA
                        Leave me alone.

                                 EDMUND
                        Very well.

           Edmund pushes her away and looks around the home.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        It’s quaint. Of course, if you 
                        stayed with me you’d have your own 
                        mansion full of servants. But this 
                        is nice too. Maybe I’ll buy it.

                                 JULIA
                        Get out of my home!
           He gets in Julia’s face.

                                 EDMUND
                        You might also have a child if you 
                        stayed with me.

           She slaps him.

                                 JULIA
                        How dare you.

                                 EDMUND
                        Feisty, just like I always imagined 
                        you’d be. Of course we never got to 
                        that, did we? Luckily I wasn’t 
                        waiting.

                                 JULIA
                        You’re disgusting.

                                 EDMUND
                        Yes. So where is he?
                             (calling)
                        Geppetto! Come out, come out 
                        wherever you are. 

                                 JULIA
                        I would die before I told you 
                        anything.

                                 EDMUND
                        Hiding like a coward. To be 
                        expected.

                                 JULIA
                             (sudden courage)
                        He’s the bravest man I know.

                                 EDMUND
                        Really, I just don’t get what you 
                        see in him.

                                 JULIA
                        You want to know what it is?

                                 EDMUND
                        Tell me.

                                 JULIA
                        He’s everything you’re not.

           Edmund laughs hysterically.
                                 EDMUND
                        You’re right in the sense that 
                        he’ll soon be poor and dead while 
                        I’ll still be rich and alive. 
                        Hotspur.

           Hotspur grunts and begins turning the house upside down. As 
           he does Edmund moves closer to Julia:

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        You know, I really think after I 
                        kill Geppetto we should give things 
                        another shot. We were good 
                        together. 

                                 JULIA
                        The thought makes me want to vomit.

                                 EDMUND
                        You say that now but when you’re a 
                        starving widow selling rotten 
                        apples on the streets with your 
                        sick father you’ll see things 
                        differently.

                                 JULIA
                        I could be dying of hunger and 
                        freezing to death while rats ate my 
                        flesh and disease burned my eyes 
                        and I still wouldn’t come to you.

                                 EDMUND
                        We’ll just have to agree to 
                        disagree then.

           Hotspur comes back into the room.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        He’s gone. Packed a bag.

                                 JULIA
                        You’ll never find him.

                                 EDMUND
                        Again, I hate to be disagreeable 
                        but while Hotspur may be as dumb as 
                        a bat he’s an expert tracker.

           Edmund moves in on Julia, rubbing her cheek with his hand.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Now you needn’t worry, my dear, I 
                        would never harm a hair on your 
                        head.
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SEE GEPPETTO 
                        DEAD!
                             (to Hotspur)
                        Let’s go.

           He walks to the door. Hotspur follows. Before leaving Edmund 
           turns back.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be waiting for you in my 
                        mansion full of food and wine. You 
                        have an open invitation. Heck, I’ll 
                        even help with the funeral expenses 
                        because I’m just that good of a 
                        person!

           He leaves. Julia moves to the window and watches as Edmund 
           and Hotspur walk into the woods. She gets a determined look 
           on her face.

           INSERT: The wooden book to a page reading:

           THE THIRD MISFORTUNE

           On the opposite page is a woodcarving of Julia running 
           through the woods as fast as she can. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        The third misfortune was the worst 
                        of the three.

           We CLOSE IN on the wood panel as it FADES into reality:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Julia runs up to the witch’s hut out of breath and knocks on 
           the door impatiently. 

                                 WITCH (O.S.)
                             (from inside)
                        Okay, okay. Give me a break. I’m 
                        126 for Christ’s sake.

           After a moment the witch answers.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell me you want twins. 

                                 JULIA
                        Edmund Vile is after my husband. I 
                        have to do something before he 
                        kills him.
           She opens the door for her.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           An evil looking woods. Hotspur looks down at a foot print and 
           then around at the landscape. 

                                 HOTSPUR
                        This way.

           Edmund giggles and follows Hotspur.

                                 EDMUND
                        Oh this is too fun! Should I shoot 
                        him in the heart or the stomach? 
                        The heart has so much more 
                        symbolism but there’s just 
                        something so appealing about the 
                        stomach.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Geppetto stands in the middle of the thick woods holding up 
           the map trying to decide which way to go. Little light gets 
           through to the bottom and the ground is covered in thick mud. 
           The map is still blank and the twisted trees which seem to be 
           closing in on Geppetto. He takes a few steps forward and 
           looks at the map. Nothing. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        As he was about to give up he 
                        remembered the witch’s words about 
                        the heart revealing the location.

           He closes his eyes and concentrates hard. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        And since his heart was full of 
                        only one thing, he thought of his 
                        love for Julia which was truer than 
                        any compass.

           He opens his eyes and looks at the map. It shows a path 
           through the trees to a bridge. He keeps going.

           EXT. BRIDGE - LATER

           Geppetto comes up to a decrepit bridge over a deep ravine 
           where a SMALL BEARDED MAN guards it. It sways unsteadily in 
           the wind, the rotting boards creaking and the rope fraying.
                                 SMALL MAN
                        Stop. Why is it you want to cross?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        For love.

                                 SMALL MAN
                        Move closer.

           As he does the small man pulls out a sword and holds it up to 
           Geppetto’s throat.

                                 SMALL MAN (CONT’D)
                        Only those I allow pass across this 
                        bridge. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Will you allow me?

           The small man looks into Geppetto’s eyes.

                                 SMALL MAN
                        You are on the right path.

           He lowers the sword and lets him pass. 

           Geppetto crosses, looking over the edge at the deep ravine 
           far below where there’s a dry riverbed full of sharp rocks. 
           His foot breaks through one of the boards and he just manages 
           to catch himself on the rope. He moves quicker.

           INT. HUT - DAY

           Julia and the witch sit across from each other looking down 
           at a crystal ball which shows Edmund and Hotspur coming to 
           the bridge Geppetto just crossed.

                                 WITCH
                        They will catch him within the 
                        hour.

                                 JULIA
                        Can’t you do anything? A spell to 
                        slow them down? Or make them lost?

                                 WITCH
                        I will do what I can but there is 
                        something you possess that is much 
                        stronger than any trick or illusion 
                        I can create.

                                 JULIA
                        Me? I don’t have anything.
                                 WITCH
                        You have true love and there is 
                        nothing stronger in this world.

                                 JULIA
                        But how is that going to save 
                        Geppetto?

                                 WITCH
                        The potion of eternal love. True 
                        love is forever. It cannot be 
                        killed. It always finds a way to 
                        continue on and on even as the 
                        world grows darker and darker.  
                        Bring me three items. Something you 
                        gave to your love, something your 
                        love gave to you, and something you 
                        made together. Bring them quick and 
                        if your love is really true no harm 
                        will come to either of you who 
                        drinks the potion.

                                 JULIA
                        Thank you, witch.

           Julia runs out of the hut. 

                                 WITCH
                             (calling after)
                        Be sure that none of the items are 
                        false! 

           The witch looks back down at her crystal ball.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        Now for some fun.

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           Edmund and Hotspur approach the small man.

                                 EDMUND
                        Look at this little man! And his 
                        little beard!
                             (to the small man)
                        Hello little man!

           The little man holds up his large sword.

                                 SMALL MAN
                        Only those I allow pass across this 
                        bridge.
                                 EDMUND
                        How rude. And that hardly seems 
                        true. 

                                 SMALL MAN
                        Why is that?

           Edmund pulls out his gun and shoots the man dead.

                                 EDMUND
                        Because I have this. 

           They cross the bridge.

           EXT. BRIDGE - LATER

           They get to the other side only to discover they’re on the 
           same side of the bridge as when they began.

                                 EDMUND
                             (furious)
                        What is going on?! A bridge is 
                        meant to be crossed, is it not?

                                 HOTSPUR
                        It is.

                                 EDMUND
                        Then this bridge HAS A SERIOUS 
                        DEFECT OF CONSTRUCTION.
                             (calmly)
                        You know what I’m going to do?

                                 HOTSPUR
                        What boss?

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m going to find the man who built 
                        this bridge and I’m going to have a 
                        little conversation with him AS HE 
                        BOILS IN A POT OF OIL!

                                 HOTSPUR
                        You already killed him.

                                 EDMUND
                        Damn.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        I think these woods are cursed.

           Edmund looks around a little worried, hearing strange sounds.
                                 EDMUND
                        It was such a lovely Tuesday until 
                        you said that.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Geppetto comes to a clearing and up to a huge, vertical cliff 
           disappearing into the clouds high above. Huge boulders roll 
           down the face of the cliff, which is covered in cactus, and 
           crash into the ground causing it to shake. 

           He looks up at it in disbelief. He then closes his eyes, 
           concentrates for a moment and then looks down at the map 
           which changes to show the cliff. He’s on the right path. He 
           begins to climb the jagged, sharp rocks sticking out from it.

           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - DAY

           Julia runs into the house and begins searching.

           --She uses soap and water to slip the wooden ring that 
           Geppetto gave her off her finger.

           --She removes the plaque on the door. 

           --She opens the wooden box and takes the paper heart.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - LATER

           Julia runs as fast as she can with the three items.

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE - DAY

           Geppetto is about halfway up the cliff, hanging from a rock, 
           when a boulder comes right for him with great speed. It 
           shakes the face of the cliff. He looks around and sees a 
           cactus plant a few feet away. He starts to sway side to side 
           to build momentum and leaps, grabbing onto to the cactus as 
           the boulder flies past him, just missing him. He screams as 
           the thorns sink into his hands.

           EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

           Edmund and Hotspur once again run across the bridge only to 
           find themselves on the same side as they started.
                                 EDMUND
                        This is getting to be highly 
                        annoying. We are burning this 
                        bridge down. Hotspur.

           Hotspur makes a torch from a stick and a piece of his shirt.

           INT. HUT - DAY

           Julia hands the three items to the witch who looks them over.

                                 JULIA
                        A ring Geppetto made for me, a 
                        heart I made for him, and the 
                        plaque from our house which we made 
                        together into a home.

                                 WITCH
                        Perfect. And these are not false 
                        items but the true items of your 
                        love?

                                 JULIA
                        Yes.

           The witch places the items in the caldron. 

                                 WITCH
                        Three items of love. One from the 
                        loved to beloved, one from the 
                        beloved to the loved, and one from 
                        the two make three. If the love is 
                        true then no harm shall come upon 
                        the head of either who drinks from 
                        the potion of eternal love.

           Brightly colored smoke rises.

           EXT. BRIDGE

           Edmund and Hotspur walk through the dark woods as the bridge 
           burns to the ground behind them.

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE

           Geppetto pulls himself over the top of the cliff and catches 
           his breath. He wraps his bleeding hands in a piece of ripped 
           off clothing. He looks back over the woods far below and sees 
           Edmund and Hotspur following him. His eyes narrow and he 
           keeps going more determined than ever.
           INT. HUT - DAY

           The witch gives Julia a small bottle of potion.

                                 WITCH
                        Drink half.

           Julia drinks it.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        Give the rest to Geppetto. 

                                 JULIA
                        How will I find him?

           She pulls out a compass and the vile of Eunice’s tears of 
           true love which she sprinkles over the face of the compass, 
           whispering:

                                 WITCH
                        North, south, east, west, show the 
                        way to her love, the one her heart 
                        beats for in her chest.
                             (to Julia)
                        Now go. Time is not on your side.

           EXT. GLACIER - DAY

           Geppetto comes up to the edge of a huge glacier of white ice 
           that extends to the horizon. Wind blasts across it causing 
           ice tornados to form. It’s freezing, barren and unfriendly to 
           all life. An ice desert. 

           Geppetto breaks off some ice and puts in his parched mouth. 
           He takes out the map. It shows the enormous glacier. He pulls 
           up his collar to protect his face and begins to walk.

           EXT. CLIFF SIDE

           Hotspur climbs, struggling with each inch, as Edmund hangs 
           from him with his arms around his neck. Suddenly, the rock 
           Hotspur is holding onto breaks away and he slips. Edmund 
           falls a few feet before he’s able to grab onto another rock. 
           He looks down at the ground far below.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m too rich and handsome to die.

           Hotspur pulls him up.
           EXT. WOODS

           Julia runs fast looking down at the compass. She trips on 
           something, falling to the ground hard. The potion goes 
           flying. She’s stunned for a second but then gets up quickly 
           and finds the bottle. It’s unbroken. Relief. 

           A man screams in pain behind her. It’s Jerry.

                                 JERRY
                        Owwwwwww! Owwwww!

           Gary rushes to Jerry who writhes in pain on the ground.

                                 GARY
                        What is it, Jerry?

                                 JERRY
                        I’m dying, Gary! Owwwww! It hurts.

                                 GARY
                             (begins to cry)
                        What is it that got you, Jerry? A 
                        bear? A lion?

                                 JERRY
                        Both I think. Owww!

                                 GARY
                        Are you saying they worked 
                        together?

                                 JERRY
                        I am, Gary. It was a very well 
                        thought out attack.

                                 GARY
                        This is horrifying news. I knew the 
                        day would come, but so soon?

                                 JERRY
                        It’s come, Gary. Save yourself.

           Julia approaches from the dark. 

                                 JULIA
                        It wasn’t a bear or a lion. 

           Gary and Jerry are shocked. Gary snaps and a tie rolls down 
           his front. Jerry waves his hands and a bouquet of flowers 
           appear in his hand.

                                 GARY AND JERRY
                        Julia.
                                 GARY
                        As beautiful as ever.

                                 JERRY
                        Indeed. 

                                 GARY
                             (to Jerry)
                        You’re not dying then?

           Jerry thinks a moment.

                                 JERRY
                        No, I suppose I’m not.

                                 GARY
                        Oh, thank god.

           They embrace, relieved.

                                 JULIA
                        I’m afraid I need your help.

           A beat.

                                 JULIA
                        Don’t you have to say that thing 
                        about Gary and Terry?

                                 GARY
                        Not any longer for the two died in 
                        an unfortunate accident on a 
                        whaling excursion. 

                                 JULIA
                        Oh dear.

                                 JERRY
                        Yes, it’s been said before but I’ll 
                        say it again. Never trust the 
                        asparagus on a whaling ship.
           They hold their hats to their chests.

                                 GARY
                        Such talent. 

                                 JERRY
                        Such imagination.

           A moment. They put their hats back on quickly.

                                 GARY
                        Now how can we help you?

           EXT. GLACIER - LATER

           Geppetto, freezing and being smacked by the wind, passes the 
           frozen bones of a large animal. He looks as if he’s about to 
           collapse and die himself but he forces himself to continue 
           on. As he does he sees a spot of green in the distance. The 
           only other color than white that he’s seen in miles.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Geppetto steps off the glacier and comes to the fertile banks 
           of a fast flowing river carved deep into the earth. He runs 
           to it and immediately puts his frostbitten and cut hands into 
           the water feeling both pain and relief.

           EXT. GLACIER

           Edmund and Hotspur, both freezing and exhausted, inspect 
           Geppetto’s footprints on the ice. They go every which way. 
           Hotspur picks a direction.

                                 HOTSPUR
                        This way.

           They trudge on.

                                 EDMUND
                        Will this glacier never end?

           I/E. HOT AIR BALLOON - EVENING

           Julia watches the ground below as Garry and Jerry guide the 
           balloon over the woods. She reads the compass.

                                 JULIA
                             (pointing)
                        That way. And fast!
           Jerry nods and burns the flame hotter.

           EXT. RIVER

           An exhausted Geppetto struggles to cross the river. The tide 
           moves fast and takes him away. He goes under the surface, 
           headed for a waterfall. Several moments pass and he doesn’t 
           resurface. 

           It seems he’s gone when his arm suddenly shoots up. He’s so 
           close to going over the falls when he grabs onto a branch and 
           stops himself. He manages to pull himself to the other side 
           inch by inch as the water pounds him. Finally, he gets to the 
           other side and falls onto shore, catching his breath and 
           spitting out water.

           He looks up and sees a thick forest of oddly twisted trees on 
           the edge of a cliff covered in fog. The way the tree’s 
           branches are shaped they seem to take on an almost human 
           form. He looks down at the map which is now just an image of 
           the magic tree. The tree is twisted and distinct. He’s made 
           it. He takes out his axe and runs to the forest. Now to find 
           the right tree. 

           EXT. MOVING FOREST

           Geppetto enters the forest, holding up the map and comparing 
           its image to the actual trees to find the right one. As he 
           does there’s a loud, haunted, sustained creaking sound. 
           Geppetto looks around nervously. Then the trees completely 
           disappear leaving nothing but a wide open field. Geppetto is 
           stunned. After a few seconds they reappear in completely new 
           positions.

           I/E. HOT AIR BALLOON

           Gary, Jerry and Julia hang on tightly as they go up the side 
           of the cliff. They just manage to clear it, the bottom of the 
           basket skimming the edge. Gary and Jerry exchange a look of 
           relief. Julia sees the enormous glacier in the distance.

                                 JULIA
                        My god...

           EXT. MOVING FOREST

           Geppetto keeps looking for the tree, moving from one to the 
           other, when he hears the click of a gun. He stops and closes 
           his eyes. He’s made it so far and now this.
           REVEAL: Edmund stands behind him pointing a gun at him. 
           Hotspur stands next to him threateningly. 

           Geppetto holds the axe close to his chest. As he turns around 
           he slides it behind his back so they don’t see it. 

                                 EDMUND
                        The great Geppetto who always 
                        excelled at everything! Well look 
                        at us now. I’m rich and powerful 
                        while you’re poor and about to die.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No matter how much money you have 
                        I’ll always have something you’re 
                        incapable of possessing. Something 
                        you can’t buy and that will haunt 
                        you until the day you die.

                                 EDMUND
                        An orphan’s upbringing?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        True love.

           Edmund begins to laugh.

                                 EDMUND
                        You want to know something? I made 
                        love last night with Rebecca. And 
                        with Michelle the night before. And 
                        Becky and Devon before that. And 
                        Susan, Tara and Amanda over 
                        breakfast. And it all felt pretty 
                        true to me!

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You have no idea.

                                 EDMUND
                        So what are you after out here? An 
                        herb to make tea from? A special 
                        plant to eat? I know how witches 
                        think, Geppetto. I knew her first 
                        after all. If anything, you should 
                        be thanking me. Who wants kids 
                        these days? Especially on a 
                        carpenter’s salary.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (his anger growing, 
                              stepping forward)
                        So it was you.
           Edmund cocks the gun, stopping Geppetto.

                                 EDMUND
                        I’m not one to lose. You should 
                        have learned that with your 
                        parents.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (confused)
                        My parents?

                                 EDMUND
                        I had to get rid of you somehow. 
                        And believe me, it gives me great 
                        pleasure to finally be getting 
                        credit for that one. 
                             (to Hotspur)
                        I was so ahead of my years.

           Hotspur agrees with a grunt. Geppetto clutches the axe with 
           white knuckles, his blood boiling.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’m going to kill you Edmund Vile. 
                        I promise you and there’s not a 
                        promise I haven’t kept.

                                 EDMUND
                        It’s pronounced Veee-layyyy! And 
                        that seems so doubtful, given the 
                        circumstances. BURN IT ALL.

           Hotspur uses his torch to begin lighting the grass on fire.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        No!!!

           The flames begin to rise. As the trees catch fire they seem 
           to make weeping sounds.

           I/E. HOT AIR BALLOON

           Julia sees smoke starting to rise from the forest.

                                 JULIA
                             (pointing)
                        Over there! They’re over there!

                                 GARY
                        We’re on it.

           Gary and Jerry change directions.
           EXT. MOVING FOREST

           Geppetto still holds the axe behind his back. The flames get 
           out of control, the wind spreading them quickly to the trees. 

                                 EDMUND
                        I have to tell you, Geppetto, I’m 
                        glad we find ourselves living at 
                        the same time and in the same 
                        place. It’s always been an enormous 
                        comfort to me to ruin your dreams 
                        over the years.  

           The loud creaking sound begins again. 

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        What in the world?

           And the trees disappear. As Edmund and Hotspur are distracted 
           by the disappearing trees, Geppetto throws the axe at 
           Hotspur. It lands in his chest. Hotspur takes a few steps 
           back, still holding the torch, and then falls over dead. 

           Edmund looks supremely annoyed.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Hotspur!!!
                             (to Geppetto)
                        That is very ANNOYING OF YOU!

           He holds the gun right at Geppetto and fires. Just as he does 
           the trees reappear again in a new configuration, one flaming 
           one appearing right in front of Geppetto and stopping the 
           bullet. Geppetto lets out a sigh of relief.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        You stupid, moving TREE! I am going 
                        to make it my personal mission to 
                        see you become TOILET PAPER!

           Geppetto runs behind another tree as Edmund comes after him 
           with the gun. He goes from tree to tree, trying to stay ahead 
           of Edmund and avoiding the flames, which spread quicker 
           because of the moving trees. As Edmund moves after him a 
           flaming branch falls from above and almost takes him out.

           Meanwhile, in the hot air balloon Gary and Jerry attempt to 
           make a dangerous landing near the cliff’s edge covered in 
           trees and flames. The balloon sways back and forth as the 
           wind blows hard.

                                 JULIA
                        We have to land!
                                 JERRY
                        It’s too windy. We’ll hit a tree.

                                 GARY
                        Or catch on fire.

                                 JERRY
                        And if this thing catches fire, 
                        it’s kaboom!

           The trees disappear below.

                                 JULIA
                        Look! 

           They look down seeing a wide open field.

                                 JERRY
                        Go now!

           They move the balloon down as quickly as possible and make a 
           rough landing. As soon as they do the trees appear again, 
           covering the sky above them with a canopy of branches. Gary 
           and Jerry give each other a look of relief. That was close.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s buy a car, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        A bicycle made for two.

           Julia gets out of the basket and runs toward Geppetto, 
           avoiding the flames which continue to rise. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Julia...

                                 JULIA
                             (back over her shoulder)
                        It’s okay, I’m protected.

           She keeps running, moving from tree to tree, looking at the 
           compass.

           Back to Edmund and Geppetto. 

           Geppetto takes cover behind a tree, hiding, as Edmund looks 
           for him. 

                                 EDMUND
                        Come out, come out wherever you 
                        are.

           He jumps behind one tree but he isn’t there.
                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Really, I have dinner reservations 
                        tonight, Geppetto. Can we get on 
                        with this murder?

           Geppetto comes to the edge of the cliff obscured by trees and 
           fog and just manages to stop himself before going over. He 
           looks down. Far below the ocean beats against jagged rocks.

           Edmund turns in circles aiming his gun, searching for 
           Geppetto.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        Look on the bright side of things, 
                        Geppetto. It won’t be as bad as 
                        being hit by a train.

           Julia stands behind a tree looking for Geppetto. She spots 
           him as he runs from one tree to another. She takes out the 
           potion. She’s about to run toward him when--

           Edmund also catches a glimpse of Geppetto and fires. The 
           bullet hits him in the arm. Geppetto lets out a yell of pain.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                        That’s more like it.

           Geppetto grabs his arm and sees blood on his hand. He rips 
           off a piece of clothing and ties it around his arm.

           Julia stops, shocked by seeing Geppetto get shot. She has to 
           get to him. She has to save him.

           Geppetto quickly moves behind another tree as Edmund keeps 
           approaching him. As he does Edmund moves to the other side of 
           the tree Julia’s behind. They’re mere feet away without 
           knowing it. Suddenly, the creaking sound begins again.

                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (singing creepily)
                        Nowhere to hide when the trees 
                        subside. Now to pay you back for 
                        stealing my bride.

           And the trees completely disappear. Julia and Geppetto are 
           both left without cover in the open field.

           Edmund sees movement out of the corner of his eye, turns and 
           fires thinking it’s Geppetto. 

           The bullet hits Julia’s heart. She looks shocked as she feels 
           the pain. 
                                 EDMUND (CONT’D)
                             (confused)
                        Julia? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HUT

           The witch watches the whole thing on her crystal ball.

                                 WITCH
                        No...

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. MOVING FOREST

           Julia holds her hands to the wound and then looks at the 
           blood on her fingers.

                                 JULIA
                        Why does it hurt?

                                 EDMUND
                        What are you...

           She sees Geppetto across the way. They lock eyes.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (unbelieving)
                        Julia? But you can’t be here.

                                 JULIA
                        I came to save you.

           She falls to the ground.

                                 EDMUND
                        What a stupid thing to do...

           Geppetto turns his eyes on Edmund who looks on totally 
           shocked. Geppetto charges him with all his strength and all 
           the anger in his soul and knocks him over the edge of the 
           cliff. Edmund falls screaming to his death, hitting the 
           jagged rocks below.

           Gary and Jerry watch the whole thing somberly.

           Geppetto runs to Julia who lays on the ground. The trees 
           reappear and they are now under a tree. It’s the same tree 
           shown on the map. The magic tree. A very twisted, distinct 
           tree.
                                 GEPPETTO
                             (pleading)
                        Julia? Please don’t die.

                                 JULIA
                        I thought our love was true.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        It is true. It is. How could you 
                        doubt?

                                 JULIA
                        But the potion didn’t work.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        What do you mean?

                                 JULIA
                        The potion of eternal love. I gave 
                        her the ring, the heart, and the 
                        plaque of our home and she made a 
                        potion from it. But it didn’t work. 
                             (beat)
                        Our love isn’t true.

                                 GEPPETTO
                             (realizing)
                        The paper heart?

                                 JULIA
                        The one I made you.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        But that isn’t the same heart, 
                        Julia.

                                 JULIA
                        What do you mean, Geppetto?

           Geppetto really starts to break down, realizing what’s 
           happened. Julia has a harder time with each breath.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I lied to you.

                                 JULIA
                        Why, Geppetto?

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I tore the heart in two on 
                        accident. I made a new heart and I 
                        told you it was the same one you 
                        gave me. But it was a lie. I’m so 
                        sorry, Julia. God, I’m so sorry.
           Julia smiles.

                                 JULIA
                        That’s good news.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Why?

                                 JULIA
                        Because it means our love is true 
                        after all. I love you, Geppetto. 
                        You are a prince and I am princess.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And it was true.

           She dies in his arms. Geppetto is shocked to his core.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Julia? Julia? Wake up. Please wake 
                        up. You are everything to me.

           She doesn’t move. Geppetto looses it.

           INSERT: The wooden book to a page reading:

           THE RESULT OF MISFORTUNE

           On the opposite page is a woodcarving of Geppetto weeping 
           under the magic tree with Julia in his arms. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        The third misfortune was the worst 
                        of the three.

           We CLOSE IN on the wood panel as it FADES into reality:

           EXT. MOVING FOREST

           Geppetto lets out a terrible moan full of agony. It echoes 
           through the woods as he holds Julia. Gary and Jerry weep as 
           they watch the scene.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Even in the greatest misfortune 
                        there are great miracles.

           As Geppetto holds her in his arms, a small acorn falls off 
           the magic tree and lands in the cuff of his pants.

           The flames start to engulf the forest but Geppetto doesn’t 
           move. Gary and Jerry run up to him and drag him through smoke 
           to the balloon as he holds on to Julia’s body.
           I/E. HOT AIR BALLOON - NIGHT

           Gary and Jerry sadly fly Geppetto home through the night sky 
           as he holds Julia in his arms. He looks as if his soul has 
           died.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Geppetto carries Julia to their home. Gary and Jerry watch 
           from the balloon basket with their hats over their hearts.

           As Geppetto walks the acorn falls out of the cuff of his 
           pants and lands on the dirt.

           INT. HILLSIDE HOUSE

           TIME LAPSE: Geppetto weeps over Julia’s body as three days 
           and nights pass.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        For three days and three nights he 
                        did nothing but weep over the body 
                        of his true love. 

           INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

           Geppetto finishes a beautifully made wood casket. 

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        On the fourth day Geppetto buried 
                        his wife.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - EVENING

           Geppetto stands over his wife’s grave.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You said it would take many worlds 
                        to hold your love for me and now I 
                        feel it will take millions to hold 
                        the grief I feel. I’m so sorry for 
                        lying to you. I will never forgive 
                        myself.

           He breaks down.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        The rest of my life will be nothing 
                        but waiting to meet you in the 
                        next. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        I will get there as soon as I can.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - MORNING

           Geppetto walks away from the house with a single bag.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Feeling he had nothing to live for 
                        he spent the next several years 
                        wandering the Earth, throwing 
                        himself into the most dangerous 
                        situations. His only hope being 
                        that he too might meet his end.

           MONTAGE:

           1. Korea, 1952. A beat-up Geppetto fights with a dwindling 
           team of soldiers. He leads a charge, running right at the 
           larger opposing army. He gets to the end unscathed and 
           realizes somewhat unbelievingly that not only is he alive, 
           but that they’ve won the battle.

           2. Mount Everest, 1953. Geppetto steps carefully along the 
           ledge of an icy cliff high up in the sky. He comes to two 
           passed out climbers stranded on the mountain, Edmund Hillary 
           and Tenzing Norgay. He revives them with oxygen, picks them 
           up, and starts carrying them toward the summit. 

           3. Off the coast of Massachusetts, 1956. Geppetto swims in 
           extremely rough currents pulling scared survivors from 
           portholes of the sinking SS Andrea Doria. He has a rope tied 
           around his waist connected to the Calypso which Cousteau and 
           Toma steer carefully nearby. He struggles not to get sucked 
           into the ship as water begins crashing through the windows.

           4. Nova Scotia, Canada, 1958. Geppetto crawls through a deep, 
           dark and dangerous mine shaft about to collapse. Suddenly the 
           ground begins to shake and he moves faster as rocks start to 
           fall. He breaks through a blockade using all his strength and 
           rescues several trapped miners running out of air. 

           5. Algeria, 1959. An even more beat-up Geppetto fights with a 
           ragtag team of poorly armed nationalists. Again he leads a 
           charge, running at a much larger and better equipped opposing 
           army. It looks to be a suicide mission but he breaks through 
           the enemy line and looks back over the battlefield which is 
           covered in the bodies of enemy soldiers. They’ve won. A look 
           flashes across his face: You’ve got to be kidding me.
                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        But no matter what danger he faced 
                        he survived and it would be someone 
                        else’s death to bring him back to 
                        life.

           INT. EUNICE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Geppetto enters the house slowly. The house is covered with 
           scribbled pages and the writing continues onto the floor and 
           walls. Eunice, dead, sits at her desk with an unfinished page 
           in front of her.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        Because of Geppetto, Eunice had 
                        found her love again despite the 
                        pain, and spent her last days 
                        writing thousands and thousands of 
                        love poems to Peter in a sort of 
                        fever dream. The poems continued 
                        onto the floor and walls of her 
                        house so that the home itself was a 
                        poem. There is a curse to defeat 
                        death and it’s called true love.

           Geppetto looks around in wonder at the poems.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was time to go home.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - DAY

           Geppetto, aged past his years, approaches the house which has 
           fallen into disrepair. He stops on seeing a giant tree in 
           front. It looks identical to the magic tree on the map. 
           Geppetto can’t believe it.

           Geppetto approaches the tree cautiously, as if it might not 
           be real and could disappear any moment. He touches it. 

           He steps back and takes out his axe. He swings at the tree, 
           splitting it open. 

           INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

           The workshop is covered in dust from years of neglect. 
           Geppetto works on a block of wood carefully, which is 
           starting to look like a rough puppet.
           INT. WORKSHOP - LATER

           Geppetto uses several different tools, carefully carvings the 
           puppet’s features, shaving away thin pieces at a time and 
           blowing away the dust.

           INT. WORKSHOP - LATER

           The puppet looks nearly complete.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        As he worked on the puppet he gave 
                        it a heart.

           Geppetto finishes making a new paper heart. He rolls it up 
           and puts it into a small hole where the puppet’s heart would 
           be.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        So you will know love in your life.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And a conscience.

           Geppetto catches a live cricket in his fingers. 

                                 GEPPETTO
                        You will be his conscience. If he 
                        is ever caught between right and 
                        wrong make noise so he will know 
                        which choice to make.

           He puts it into a small compartment in the puppet’s back.

                                 GRANDFATHER (V. O.)
                        And finally, he fashioned a nose 
                        that could grow so the child could 
                        not hide a lie.

           He carves a nose that can slide in and out like a telescope.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        If you ever lie let your nose grow 
                        long so you will learn from my 
                        mistake. Let it grow even if it’s a 
                        good lie so I will not lose you 
                        too.
           INT. WORKSHOP - LATER

           Geppetto finishes painting the puppet which looks incredibly 
           real. It’s his best work. He holds it up and looks at it 
           hopefully. Nothing happens. He closes his eyes.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Please, if there is anyone there, 
                        make this child real. I cannot bear 
                        to have had all of the misfortune 
                        been for nothing.

           He opens his eyes and waits a moment full of all the hope he 
           has left in the world. Nothing happens and he’s overtaken 
           with disappointment.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                             (to the puppet)
                        You were to be our child. And we 
                        would have loved you more than 
                        anything. But I know now there is 
                        no magic in this world. It was 
                        foolish to think a child might come 
                        from wood. And so I have been made 
                        a fool.

           He sets Pinocchio on a shelf and walks out.

           We slowly CLOSE IN on Pinocchio on the shelf. There’s a 
           bright flash and Julia appears dressed in all blue. She looks 
           more beautiful than ever. She approaches the puppet.

                                 JULIA 
                        My child, Pinocchio, I give you the 
                        gift of life which was stolen from 
                        me. Watch after your father who 
                        will need you more than ever. My 
                        love for him will live through you. 

           She touches the puppet and he comes alive.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Learn to be brave, honest and 
                        generous and you will become a real 
                        boy. My son, who is the result of 
                        love.

           Julia and the puppet look at each other for a long moment, 
           her face full of goodness. Then she disappears into blue 
           light as Pinocchio blinks his eyes. He looks down at his 
           hands and then touches his face.
           INT. WORKSHOP - LATER

           Pinocchio now stands in the middle of the workshop. Geppetto 
           enters the workshop and stops in his tracks on seeing 
           Pinocchio. He stares at him for a moment, unbelieving.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        My son?

           Pinocchio looks at Geppetto, his face innocent and full of 
           wonder. Geppetto breaks down.

                                 GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
                        My son, Pinocchio.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        Father.

           Geppetto embraces Pinocchio.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        I’ve wanted you for so long and now 
                        I needed you to be real more than 
                        anything.

                                 PINOCCHIO
                        I will be brave, honest and 
                        generous for you. And I will become 
                        a real boy.

           Geppetto looks Pinocchio in the face.

                                 GEPPETTO
                        Come. I have a story to tell you.

           He takes him by the hand paternally and leads him into the 
           house.

           EXT. HILLSIDE HOUSE - EVENING

           As we PULL BACK from the house, leaving it in the distance, 
           we see the fox and cat watching it, waiting.

           The image turns into a wood carving, the last page of the 
           book, which--

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

           --the grandfather closes. Pete listens, enthralled by the 
           story. The bus is now moving.
                                 GRANDFATHER
                        The end.

                                 PETE
                        Did a puppet really become a boy, 
                        grandpa?

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        Well, there are those who say it 
                        never happened because they can’t 
                        accept magic. They say it was just 
                        a case of madness caused by grief. 
                        Or that the whole story is pure 
                        invention. But know what I say?

                                 PETE
                        What?

                                 GRANDFATHER
                        If there was no magic in this world 
                        the misfortune would just be too 
                        much for us to bear.

           He smiles at the boy, happy to have told the story.

                                 GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
                        Now excuse me, Pete, but nature 
                        calls.

           As he stands up to go to the restroom a small cricket runs 
           across his shoulder and jumps under his collar. Pete sees it 
           and his eyes go wide. 

           The grandfather winks at Pete whimsically and walks away down 
           the aisle.

           Pete looks down at his video game and considers playing it, 
           but instead picks the book up and opens it to the first page, 
           amazed by the carvings.

           EXT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

           The bus passes under a sign reading, “PLEASURE ISLAND NEXT 
           EXIT.”

           WE RISE UP to see Pleasure Island in the distance. It’s 
           restored to its former glory, full of amazing rides and 
           games, and once again a grand place for children.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
