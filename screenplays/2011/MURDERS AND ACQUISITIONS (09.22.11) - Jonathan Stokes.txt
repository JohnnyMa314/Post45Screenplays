           EXT. THE SEA - EVENING

           The burning sun dips into the blue horizon, shooting its last 
           fiery rays into the coming night.

           INT. YACHT - CARGO HOLD - SAME

           HAKEEM BEASLEY, his face a spider web of scars, creeps 
           stealthily from a sealed hatch in the cargo hold.  Gingerly 
           stretching his legs and back, he has been hiding below deck 
           for days.

           EXT. YACHT - MID SHIP DECK

           Hakeem snakes up a ladder and steps silently onto the deck.  
           He inhales the night breeze, enjoying the salty air of the 
           sea.

           FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.  Hakeem performs a REVERSE PULL-UP onto a 
           higher deck.

           FRANK BARTHOLOMEW rounds the corner.  He hurriedly loads a 
           lifeboat with food and supplies.  Then CRANKS THE SAFETY 
           WINCH lowering the lifeboat to the sea.

           Diving from the upper deck, HAKEEM POUNCES ON FRANK LIKE A 
           PUMA, slipping him into a BLOOD CHOKE.  The two struggle, 
           stumbling around the deck in an absurd drunken dance.

           Frank slips Hakeem's grip and delivers an ELBOW DRIVE to 
           Hakeem's temple.  Hakeem moans in what sounds like pleasure.

           Hakeem squares his shoulders and returns a lightning 
           combination of JABS AND HOOKS, leaving Frank dazed and 
           panting on the deck.

           Frank taps his hands together in a “time out” gesture.

                                 FRANK
                        Point of order.

           Hakeem pauses.

                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        You're going to kill me, Hakeem, I 
                        get it.  I just want to know who 
                        sent you.

                                 HAKEEM
                        What's the difference?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Hakeem LUNGES for Frank, who spins and SLIPS HIS GRIP.  
           Hakeem is left holding nothing but Frank's blazer jacket.  
           Hakeem TOSSES it overboard.

                                 FRANK
                        Do you have any idea what that cost 
                        me?

                                 HAKEEM
                        You won't be needing it.

           Hakeem advances on Frank, swinging wild ROUNDHOUSES.  The two 
           men GRAPPLE, their fighting sloppy, desperate.  Frank gives 
           up ground, retreating to stern.

                                 FRANK
                        What I did doesn't make me a bad 
                        person.  Stealing from the mob, 
                        that's like two wrongs make a 
                        right.  Like multiplying negative 
                        numbers to get a positive.

                                 HAKEEM
                        You're right, Frank.  They should 
                        give you a medal for stealing mafia 
                        money.  You're Mother-freakin-
                        Theresa.

           As the yacht yaws on the ocean swells the men fight off 
           balance.  Hakeem's reckless HAYMAKERS land wide.

           Frank again makes the "time out" gesture.

                                 FRANK
                        Let's just catch our breath here a 
                        second.  Look at that gorgeous 
                        sea...That algae is phosphorescent.  
                        I didn't even know such a thing 
                        existed.  They don't have that in 
                        the Hudson River, huh Hakeem?

           Hakeem gazes out at the Caribbean water, the gently falling 
           dusk.

                                 HAKEEM
                        I'm sorry I'm doing this, Frank.  
                        But you made your bed and you have 
                        to sleep in it.

           The stern is lined with deep sea trolling rods seated in 
           gimballed mounts.  Hakeem wraps 80 pound fishing line around 
           his fists and stretches it before him like a garotte.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 FRANK
                        No gun?  They say you can shoot a 
                        man through two passing subway 
                        trains.

                                 HAKEEM
                             (shaking his head)
                        I gotta make sure the coroner finds 
                        salt water in your lungs.  You'll 
                        still be breathing when I drop you 
                        in the water.

           Hakeem corners Frank with the fishing line.  Frank DUCKS AND 
           WEAVES through the row of fishing rods, doubling back on 
           himself.  Hakeem chases him, fishing line UNSPOOLING BEHIND 
           HIM.

           The two are soon trapped in a web of fishing line.  Frank 
           makes the "time out" gesture one more time.

                                 HAKEEM (CONT’D)
                        No, no more time outs.

                                 FRANK
                        You know, I'm kind of proud to have 
                        lasted this long.  Everyone knows 
                        you're one of the best.

           Frank and Hakeem tug at their fishing line restraints.  It is 
           now a RACE for who will free themselves from the fishing 
           lines first.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        We left port four days ago.  You 
                        been in the cargo hold this whole 
                        time?  Jesus, Hakeem, your back 
                        must be shot to shit.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Only reason you ain't floating in 
                        the water yet.

           Frank slips free of the fishing line and dashes through the 
           lower deck hatch.  Hakeem pursues, fists clenched.

           INT. LOWER DECK - CONTINUOUS

           Frank backs down the hallway, BLOCKING HAKEEM'S PUNCHES by 
           swinging open every cabin door.  Hakeem SMASHES every door 
           shut,  relishing the pain in his fists.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 FRANK
                        Make it look like I went overboard?  
                        Is that the plan?

                                 HAKEEM
                        I got a half-empty bottle of Jim 
                        Beam.  I'm going to plant it on the 
                        deck after I drop you in.  Your 
                        skipper will find it tomorrow and 
                        put two and two together.

                                 FRANK
                        Do me in Caribbean waters where the 
                        police aren't as thorough?

           Frank reaches the engine room and ducks through the hatch.

           INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The twin diesel engines emit a DEAFENING ROAR.  There is no 
           exit.  Hakeem grabs Frank by the neck and slowly pushes his 
           face toward the burning hot motors.

           In last moment desperation, Frank stretches his hand and 
           reaches the fire extinguisher.  The tiny engine room is 
           BLASTED with potassium aerosol.

           Completely greyed out, two invisible men grabble in the smoke 
           cloud.

           One of them SCREAMS in pain.

           EXT. YACHT - MID SHIP DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Hakeem and Frank sit side by side on the deck, watching the 
           magical iridescent patterns of the algae.  Frank has a good 
           sized burn on his cheek and a whopping black eye.

           Hakeem SMOKES A JOINT and shares it with Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Martinique is two miles starboard.  
                        I was going to row the lifeboat to 
                        shore.  Disappear.

                                 HAKEEM
                        You speak any French?

                                 FRANK
                             (shrugging)
                        Life is a jungle, Hakeem.  Either 
                        adapt or go extinct.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HAKEEM
                        You bargaining, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        Leave the whiskey bottle on the 
                        deck.  Either way I disappeared at 
                        sea.  I'm not setting foot in 
                        America again, Hakeem, you know 
                        that.

                                 HAKEEM
                        What do I get?

                                 FRANK
                        One less soul on your conscience. 
                        That's the deal of a lifetime.

                                 HAKEEM
                        I don't see the angle.

                                 FRANK
                        C'mon, Hakeem, how long have you 
                        known me?  My whole life is in New 
                        York.  I live for the deal, without 
                        it I'm nothing.  The day I got on 
                        this boat is the day the mob killed 
                        me.  Let this one go.

           Hakeem sighs.

                                 HAKEEM
                        I want to change.  I want to be 
                        done with this business.  But 
                        sometimes it just feels like I'm 
                        born for it.

                                 FRANK
                             (gently)
                        It's your call, Hakeem.

           Hakeem studies the crystal blue waters and the dying fire of 
           the setting sun.  His scarred face looks exhausted from a 
           lifetime of fighting.  He breathes deep and lets it go. 

                                 HAKEEM
                        Go on, then.

           Frank clasps Hakeem's hand and shakes it.

                                 FRANK
                        I won't forget this, Hakeem.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 HAKEEM
                        I'd prefer that you did.

           Frank steps over the gunwale and onto the lifeboat.

           Pausing to happily wave goodbye, Frank's FOOT SLIPS. FRANK 
           SLAMS HIS HEAD ON THE EDGE OF THE BOAT and CRASHES INTO THE 
           WATER.  Knocked out cold, he sinks into the sea.  Bubbles 
           rise to the surface.  FRANK IS GONE.

           Hakeem stares in PARALYZED SHOCK.  It all happens too quickly 
           for him to react.

           Voices call from the bridge deck.

                                 SKIPPER (O.S.)
                        Man overboard!

           Hakeem, still stunned, places a half-empty bottle of whiskey 
           on the deck.

                                 HAKEEM
                             (bewildered)
                        It's like I was born for this.

           Hakeem slides down the ladder to hide in the cargo hold.

           A few final bubbles rise to the surface of the sea.

                        CHAPTER ONE - THE MARK

           INT. MANHATTAN PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

           JOE RIGHTMAN crosses the lot in long strides, flanked by his 
           right hand man, ARI, and his factotum, YALIE.

           Joe's voice is loud, booming.  500 years ago he would have 
           been a warlord.  But in this day and age, he is a corporate 
           raider.

                                 JOE
                        This is the worst haircut ever.  I 
                        look like a Cholo.  
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:
                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Normally I enjoy barbershop 
                        rapport, but this barber starts 
                        telling me about how the doctors 
                        want to put a stent in his leg or 
                        they're going to amputate.  Thing 
                        is, the doctors can't put the stent 
                        in because the barber's already on 
                        blood thinners from the stent in 
                        his heart.  This is what the guy's 
                        thinking about while he's cutting 
                        my hair.  Suffice it to say, I got 
                        a terrible haircut.

                                 YALIE
                        Joe, why we going in through the 
                        service entrance?

                                 JOE
                        Parking lot, Yalie.  I want to see 
                        what kind of cars they drive.  See 
                        how they're spending our money.

                                 ARI
                        The top brass parks closest to the 
                        elevator.

           Ari points to three reserved parking spaces with three very 
           nice cars.

                                 JOE
                        A Lexus, a Maserati, and a Lincoln.  
                        And they want more capital from us?  
                        Ari, we got right of first refusal 
                        on them?

                                 ARI
                        Shit yeah.

                                 JOE
                        Then fuck 'em.  We'll hold out 
                        funding until the city shuts off 
                        their power.  Make them beg for it.

           Joe turns to Yalie and clenches a fist.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        We're taking over this company, 
                        Yalie.  I'm going to grab them by 
                        the balls and crush them like 
                        grapes until the juice runs down my 
                        arm.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe, Ari, and Yalie are packed in with the morning rush hour 
           crowd.

                                 JOE
                        Took a no-wiper this morning.

                                 ARI
                        No kidding.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah.  It's like two minutes back 
                        in my day.  Sometimes you wipe and 
                        there's no end in sight.   And 
                        sometimes, you win the shit 
                        lottery.

                                 ARI
                        Nice.

           Several BUSINESS PEOPLE in the elevator shake their heads in 
           disgust.

                                 YALIE
                        How do you determine if it's a no-
                        wiper?  Don't you have to wipe 
                        first to determine you don't need 
                        to wipe?  Isn't the no-wiper a 
                        theoretical impossibility?

                                 JOE

           INT. DELTA WEB OFFICE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe, Ari, and Yalie enter the office and breeze past VALERIE, 
           the worried young receptionist.

                                 VALERIE
                        Excuse me?  Sirs?  Can I help you?

           The three men don't break stride.  They strut through the 
           cubicle floor like barbarian warriors entering a battlefield.

                        No way.  Their pants will be down 
                        and their asses hanging out.

                        out of your financials.  Good work.

           Joe gives Yalie a WHACK on the shoulder.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You ready to take lead on your 
                        first deal?

           Yalie blanches, freezing in his steps.

                                 YALIE
                        You want me to take lead?

                                 JOE
                        Look, Yalie. You been with me three 
                        years now and it's time to nut up 
                        or shut up.

                                 YALIE
                        But I haven't learned enough yet.

                                 JOE
                        This is the only way you're going 
                        to learn.

                                 YALIE
                        I'm not ready.

                                 ARI
                        And that's why you'll never be 
                        ready.

           Joe turns to face Yalie.  He is suddenly gentle, like a big 
           brother.

                                 JOE
                        Yalie, when's the last time you 
                        were bare naked with a woman?

                                 YALIE
                        What's that got to do with

                        sack if you're going to be a big 
                        hitter.  Nobody ever hit a grand

                        to screw up the deal.

           Ari shakes his head, disgusted.  Joe nods, accepting.

                                 JOE
                        Alright.  I'll run point today.

                        worrying about what everyone thinks 
                        of you and beat a path to what you 
                        want.

           Joe grabs Yalie's shoulder and gives him an affectionate 
           shake.

           The trio bears down on two ominous boardroom doors.  Ari is 
           flexing his muscles, pumping himself up.

                                 JOE
                        You still hitting the gym, Ari?

                        mother fuckers.

           They reach the heavy oak doors of the boardroom.  Valerie the 
           receptionist makes one last effort to stop them.

                                 VALERIE
                        Excuse me, there's a board meeting

           INT. BRONX SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           EDDIE GLICK, balding with a comb-over, leans back in a pock-
           marked office chair patched with duct tape.  Across from him 
           sits a ghetto drug dealer - "MOSES" - and his ROUGHNECK CREW.

           Eddie unwraps a piece of Nicorette and pops it in his mouth.

                                 EDDIE
                        You're familiar with Charles 
                        Darwin?

                                 MOSES
                             (sure)
                        Father of evolution.

                                 EDDIE
                        Darwin's grandfather had kids out 
                        of wedlock and murdered his wife 
                        with an overdose of opium.  His 
                        uncle died of an overdose and his 
                        other uncle commit suicide.  His 
                        father was an abusive monster.  His 
                        mother also died of a suspicious 
                        opium overdose.  Darwin grew up 
                        torturing puppies and small birds - 
                        wrote about it in his diaries.  He 
                        showed every sign of becoming a 
                        murderous, addictive monster like 
                        his family and then he took a 
                        voyage to the Galapagos and he had 
                        an idea...

           Eddie leans forward in his chair and looks Moses right in the 
           eyes.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Those who cannot change, go

                        flourish.  It saved his life.

           Moses chews on a toothpick and stares Eddie down with narrow 
           eyes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 EDDIE
                        I used to be police.  Narcotics.  
                        The week before they canned me I 
                        requisitioned a clutch of 
                        surveillance equipment and rigged 
                        every office in Major Crimes.  
                        Three years going and they've never 
                        figured it out.

           Eddie flips around his computer monitor for Moses to see.

           The monitor displays LIVE VIDEO FEED of a police conference 
           room where plainclothes POLICE OFFICERS sort through files 
           and tape photos to a white board.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        This is a narcotics special task 
                        force at Major Crimes, downtown.  
                        Their sole assignment is to bring 
                        down your operation.  Every day and 
                        night there's a team of officers 
                        monitoring you and everyone you 
                        know, waiting for someone to make a 
                        mistake.  One mope talking on a 
                        cell phone, one scared hopper 
                        turning informant.  You see that 
                        whiteboard at the head of the 
                        table?  That's what they already 
                        know of the Dykman Street 
                        hierarchy.  And guess whose name is 
                        at the top?

           Moses nods.  The police are onto him.

                                 MOSES
                        How do I make this go away?

                                 EDDIE
                        No new business.  You shut 
                        everything down until I can figure 
                        out what they have on you.

                                 MOSES
                        Impossible.  I can't turn off the 
                        tap, I got mouths to feed.  
                        Besides, I got a lot of 
                        constituents with a habit; I don't 
                        want them voting in the next 
                        district.

                        You wait them out, Moses.  If this 
                        task force can't pull dirt on you 
                        in three to six months, they'll get 
                        reassigned.  The city's over-budget 
                        and making cutbacks.  I'll let you 
                        know what they know; whose cell 
                        phones they're up on, which blocks 
                        they're monitoring.  Art of War.

                                 EDDIE
                        I got no problem with how a man 
                        makes his living.  But everybody 
                        sitting here could be looking at a 
                        lot of prison time.  You need to 
                        decide what your freedom is worth.

           Moses slowly nods.  He scribbles down his cell phone number 
           and slaps it on Eddie's desk.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I'll send you my rates.

           Moses and his crew file out.  Eddie relaxes back in his chair 
           and SMACKS the intercom for his receptionist.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Open a file, Annabelle - we got a 
                        new fish on the hook!

           INT. DELTA WEB BOARDROOM - DAY

           Right where we left them: Joe, Ari, and Yalie BURST in on the 
           corporate board meeting.  

           CEO BARRY GLICK and a dozen BOARD MEMBERS look up at Joe in 
           shock.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOE
                             (booming)
                        Which one of you schmucks is Barry 
                        Glick?

                                 BARRY
                             (uncertain how to respond)
                        I am?

                                 JOE
                        You're fired.

                                 BARRY
                        I'm the CEO, who the hell are you?

                                 JOE
                        Don't act like you don't know me.  
                        I'm Joe Rightman.

                                 BARRY
                        Well why don't you get the hell out 
                        of our board meeting, Joe Rightman?

                                 JOE
                        Only one of us is leaving here, 
                        Glick.

           Joe pronounces “Glick” like he's saying “dick.”  As an 
           insult.

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        What the hell is going on, here?

                                 JOE
                        You gentlemen are the board of 
                        directors?

           Various graying board members nod.  Joe tosses xeroxed 
           financials onto the table.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Sun Tzu: know thine enemy.  Glick's 
                        double-booking the accounting.  
                        These are your actual financials.

           Concerned board members pick up Joe's paperwork and slip on 
           reading glasses.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                             (to Glick)
                        You're skimming from the top.  
                        You're engaged in criminal fraud.

                        Delta Web's going to be chucked off 
                        the Nasdaq.  And I'm the only hope 
                        you have of saving it.  I own 
                        twelve percent of your stock.  I'm 
                        making a tender offer.

           Barry stands up and points to the door.

                                 BARRY
                        I'm making you an offer to leave 
                        before I call security.

           Joe turns to Valerie, the worried receptionist.

                                 JOE
                             (quietly)
                        Get security now.

                                 VALERIE
                        I don't even know who you are, sir.

                                 JOE
                        Try and keep up.  I'm Joe Rightman.  
                        And if security isn't here in 30 
                        seconds, you're fired.

           Valerie jumps to call security.

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        Is this true, Barry?  Is this why 
                        our cash flow's getting eaten up?

                                 BARRY
                        I don't have to answer to you, or 
                        to every maniac who walks in off 
                        the street -

           Joe tries to break in -

                                 JOE
                        Barry -

                                 BARRY
                        This is a difficult job and there 
                        are perquisites.  We have a burn 
                        rate!  Everything takes time -

                                 JOE
                        Barry  -

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 BARRY
                        I'm telling you we raise this 
                        private placement and we'll make it 
                        through to a positive IRR -

           While Barry back-pedals, Joe calmly lifts a water pitcher off 
           the table and HUCKS IT THROUGH THE CONFERENCE ROOM WINDOW.  
           It EXPLODES onto the cubicle floor.  Employees stare in 
           through the SHATTERED GLASS.

           Yalie and Ari glance at each other, admiring Joe's style.

                                 JOE
                             (quietly to Barry)
                        Shut the fuck up.

           Everyone on the entire office floor shuts the fuck up.  Joe 
           has the undivided attention of 80 employees.

           Joe stares Barry down like an old west gunslinger.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        You are ass-deep in some serious 
                        Enron shit.  You're treating the 
                        tax code like your own personal 
                        douche nozzle and using shareholder 
                        money for lubricant.  Stashing cash 
                        in offshore accounts like a runaway 
                        Nazi.  That's what I know, and I've 
                        only been in this building for 
                        seven minutes.

           Concerned board members pour over Joe's financials, shaking 
           their heads in shock.  But Joe's just gathering steam.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You're looking at enough fines to 
                        build two new tits on the Statue of 
                        Liberty.  And minimum one year jail 
                        time.

           Joe slowly crosses the long boardroom table to come face to 
           face with Barry.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah it's white boy jail time - but 
                        it's one year with no income, one 
                        year to foreclose on your fancy 
                        house and one year to lose all your 
                        fancy friends.  Now you may hate me 
                        right now, Glick, but I'm your best 
                        mother fucking friend.

                        Because I'm the one thing 
                        separating you from that jail time.

           SECURITY arrives and Joe holds them at bay with one hand.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        A lot of Delta Web employees were 
                        going to be dot-com millionaires; 
                        now the stock's being barfed off 
                        the Nasdaq like Tequila on oyster 
                        night.  In exchange for your prison 
                        time, I will accept a personal 
                        letter to every employee of this 
                        company apologizing for your role 
                        in what has taken place.

           Joe motions to the guards.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        You can send a proxy to gather your 
                        belongings and personal affects.  
                        If you are ever seen in this 
                        building again, you will be 
                        arrested.

                                 BARRY
                        Don't listen to this clown.  He 
                        doesn't even work here.

                                 JOE
                        Really?  I believe I just took over 
                        your company.

           Joe looks to the board of directors.  The board members look 
           at one another and nod their assent.

           Joe turns to Barry with a look that could freeze the balls 
           off an Eskimo.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        The door is behind you.  If you 
                        turn the knob, it opens.

           The guards nod respectfully to Joe as they lead Barry out.  
           The boardroom stands in stunned silence.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Glick is no longer CEO of Delta 
                        Web.  The cancer has been removed, 
                        the healing process has begun.

           There is a smattering of APPLAUSE from around the office.

           The room fills with ominous silence...

           INT. OFFICE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe thunders down the hall looking through financial 
           statements while Yalie and Ari trot behind him.

                                 JOE
                        Look at this SG&A budget.  Who's

                        Maureen Somers.

           MAUREEN gets up from her cubicle and timidly extends her 
           handshake.

                                 MAUREEN
                        Hi, I'm Maureen.

                        Maureen, clear your desk; you're 
                        fired.

           Joe moves down the cubicle aisles, literally tossing papers 
           over his shoulder as he goes.

                        Get a box for your shit, French, 
                        you're fired.

           Matt French, his mouth hanging open, watches Joe breeze by.

           A young Ivy Leaguer, PEARSON, bravely raises his hand.

                        Get the fuck out of here, you're 
                        fired.

           Joe turns and addresses the whole stunned office floor in his 
           booming voice.  He roars like a lion.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)

                    CHAPTER TWO - THE INFORMANT

           INT. BRONX SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Eddie speaks urgently on the phone, his hand cupped over the 
           receiver for privacy.

                                 EDDIE
                             (desperately)
                        Vinny, I can get you the money!  
                        100 g's, as promised...  No, I 
                        can't get it that fast, but I have 
                        a new client on the hook and I'm 
                        reeling him in!  Screw you and your 
                        ticking clock!  How long have I 
                        known you?  Hello... Vinny, Hello?

           The line is dead.

           Eddie takes a squirt of whiskey from his office flask and 
           chases it with a stick of Nicorette.

           Eddie looks up to see ANNABELLE, his daughter and 
           receptionist, standing in the doorway watching him.  She is 
           gorgeous.  20% daddy's girl and 80% serious trouble.

           Annabelle wears a plaid skirt and twirls her hair with a 
           pencil.

                        Daddy, look what the cat puked up.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Behind her, Barry Glick, ex-CEO of Delta Web stumbles into 
           the room.  His suit is rumpled as if it's been slept in.  His 
           eyes are red-rimmed and his chin is stubbly.

                                 EDDIE
                        As I live and breathe.  I never 
                        thought you'd deign yourself to 
                        show up here.

                                 BARRY
                        Eddie, I'm desperate.  I need your 
                        help.

                                 EDDIE
                        Give us some privacy, Annabelle.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        You don't let me hear anything!

                                 EDDIE
                        It's for your own good, sweetheart.

           Annabelle dumps some files on Eddie's desk and leaves, 
           shutting the door.

           Eddie pops a second Nicorette in his mouth and examines his 
           frazzled brother.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        The little brother helping the big 
                        brother.  What have you gotten 
                        yourself into?

           Eddie pulls the flask from his desk drawer and hands it to 
           Barry who takes it eagerly, running his hands through his 
           thinning hair.

                                 BARRY
                        This corporate raider - Joe 
                        Rightman - he launched a hostile 
                        takeover bid.

                                 EDDIE
                        So?

                                 BARRY
                        So he's got dirt on me - some 
                        accounting discrepancies.

                                 EDDIE
                        Jesus, Barry, I thought you were 
                        changing!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 BARRY
                        Everybody does this - it's Wall 
                        Street.  Point is he's leveraging 
                        my problems to get at my company.  
                        I built Delta Web, Eddie, and he's 
                        taking it from me!

                                 EDDIE
                        You didn't build Delta Web, Barry. 
                        You had financiers buy it and flip 
                        it into one of your Nasdaq shells.

                                 BARRY
                        I need to realize a profit, here!

                                 EDDIE
                        Well, what the hell can I do?

                                 BARRY
                        Rightman's got the board votes, 
                        he's got the shares.  There's only 
                        one possible way out.  Before the 
                        shareholder vote...

           Barry puts down the flask and leans close to Eddie.

                                 BARRY (CONT'D)
                        ...I need to kill Joe Rightman.

           Eddie holds Barry's gaze for a beat, then laughs.  Then 
           realizes Barry is not joking.

                                 EDDIE
                        Crap on a stick, Barry.  Are you 
                        out of your mind?  Take an Ativan, 
                        go home and get some sleep.

                                 BARRY
                        I need this, Eddie!  It's the only 
                        way to save my company!

                                 EDDIE
                        It's insane.  And you'd go to 
                        prison.

                                 BARRY
                        I'm going to prison, anyway!

                                 EDDIE
                        You'd be the prime suspect - you'd 
                        be the first person the police 
                        would question.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BARRY
                        He's a corporate raider - half the 
                        suits in Manhattan want a piece of 
                        him.  They'll pin a medal on me.

           Eddie picks up the flask and takes a swig.

                                 EDDIE
                        Why come to me?

                                 BARRY
                        How else am I supposed to put out a 
                        hit?  Do I just post the bounty on 
                        Craigslist “gigs?”  Who do I 
                        contact?

                                 EDDIE
                        No.  No way.  This is too much.

                                 BARRY
                        You deal with gangsters and drug 
                        dealers all day long.  Anyone with 
                        a RICO investigation.  Now your own 
                        brother comes to you and you won't 
                        even have a conversation?

                                 EDDIE
                        Ativan, Barry.

                                 BARRY
                        All these gangsters you work with 
                        employ muscle.  They all have dirty 
                        work and you own the entire 
                        Rolodex.  Who better than you to 
                        put the word out?

                                 EDDIE
                        I'm not a gangster, Barry!  I'm a 
                        guy who got fucked by the police 
                        and is having a little fun at their 
                        expense!

                                 BARRY
                        Is that all this is?  Because it 
                        looks to me like a pretty massive 
                        criminal fucking conspiracy!

                                 EDDIE
                        You just admitted to fraud not two 
                        seconds ago - you're not allowed to 
                        judge what I do ever again!  I was 
                        kicked off the force over politics, 
                        what's your excuse?  Greed?

                        Eddie, my life is over.  Jail time, 
                        Eddie.  I never asked you for much; 
                        matter of fact, I don't recall 
                        asking you for a damned thing.  But 
                        I'm telling you now: you put the 
                        word out to your friends: $500,000 
                        for Joe Rightman.  You put a 48 
                        hour clock on it.

                                 EDDIE
                        Get out of my office.

                                 BARRY
                        I don't think you're understanding 
                        me, Eddie.  You put out that hit or 
                        I go to the police on your whole 
                        operation.

                                 EDDIE
                        Fuck you, and the dick you rode in 
                        on!

                                 BARRY
                        I'm dying, here!  I'm hung out to 
                        dry!  I'm begging you.  You're the 
                        only person who can help me.  The 
                        crime's not on your head, it's on 
                        mine.  Just put out the word!

                                 EDDIE
                        You'd rat me out.

                                 BARRY
                        You don't have to make me, Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                             (quietly)
                        Get out.

           Barry puts a briefcase on Eddie's desk.

                                 BARRY
                        This is $600,000.  That's a 20% 
                        finder's fee to you.  It's just a 
                        few phone calls, Eddie.  It's not 
                        on your head.

           Barry leaves through the back door.

           Eddie opens the briefcase and takes a long, hard look at the 
           money.

           Eddie notices Annabelle peering at him from the doorway, 
           sucking on a lollypop.  He SLAMS the briefcase shut.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)

                        What hit?

                                 ANNABELLE
                        The hit for uncle Barry.  I want to

                                 EDDIE
                        I don't know what you're talking

                        on top of the intercom button, I 
                        heard the whole thing.

           Eddie looks down at his desk, and sure enough, the intercom 
           is broadcasting.

                                 EDDIE
                        A chip off the old block.

           Eddie packs the briefcase away in the office safe.

                        Don't even joke about it.

                        lonely, alcoholic, gambling-
                        addicted, dead-beat dad to come up

                        the hell out of the Bronx.  There's 
                        a whole world out there and I want 
                        a chance at it.  I do this hit and 
                        I control my future without 
                        wondering if my tuition is going to 
                        end up on a craps table in A.C.

                                 EDDIE

                        Yeah, but it makes you real hard

           Annabelle storms out.  Eddie follows.

           INT. RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

           A Magnum is duck-taped under the reception desk, facing the 
           front door.  Annabelle reaches under the desk, grabs the 
           massive gun, and wedges it into her purse.

                        You used to love being on the 
                        force.  You cared about doing the 
                        right thing.

                                 EDDIE
                        I didn't make the world this way.  
                        As long as people want drugs, 
                        there's going to be drug dealers.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Yeah?  Well as long as people want 
                        other people killed there's going 
                        to be hitters!

                        you walk out that door.

           Annabelle turns and walks out the door.  Eddie sighs and tips 
           his flask to his lips.

           But it is empty.

           INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DAY

           A gorgeous apartment, completely barren.  Not a stitch of 
           furniture.  KOGI sleeps on the floor.

           Sunlight creeps in through the blinds, waking him.  Kogi 
           rolls over and begins performing bare-knuckle pushups on the 
           hardwood.

           Kogi's hair is long, dyed, and Japanese punk.  His body is 
           ripped like a gladiator and his eyes are like cold, brushed 
           steel.

           In the center of the living room is a martial arts dummy.  
           Jammed into its eyes, temples, and carotid arteries are every 
           kind of household object... A credit card, a house key, the 
           bent arm of a pair of reading glasses.  Kogi is a master of 
           Hoda Korosu - he can kill with any object.

           There is only one extravagance in Kogi's apartment: Bonsai 
           trees.  Dozens of them.

           Kogi crosses to the fridge and cracks open a container of 
           Lactaid.  He slowly opens the blinds, letting in the light.

           Then quietly, lovingly, he tends to his Bonsai trees.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED LOT - SOUTH BRONX - DAY

           Eddie Glick chews his Nicorette and loads a nine millimeter.  

           Hakeem, the scarred hit man, TARGET SHOOTS bottles beneath 
           the elevated tracks of the A train.  In ghetto style, the two 
           men have potatoes wedged onto their handguns as silencers.

                                 EDDIE
                        Eight days in a cargo hold, that 
                        must have been torture.

           Hakeem almost grins.  It was nothing.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Remember the Cardiff deal last 
                        Christmas?  I slid seventeen 
                        stories through the laundry chute 
                        to get out of that building.

                                 EDDIE
                        Must have hurt like hell.

                                 HAKEEM
                        I have a medical condition.  A 
                        paraphilia, called Algolagnia.  I 
                        get sexual pleasure from pain.

           Eddie turns and squints at Hakeem's scarred face.

                                 EDDIE
                        You are a piece of work.

                                 HAKEEM
                        It helps me get my job done.

                                 EDDIE
                        Why are you telling me all this?

                                 HAKEEM
                        Masochistic Personality Disorder.  
                        I make questionable life choices.

           Hakeem aims his nine and BLASTS A ROW OF BOTTLES with 
           disturbing accuracy.

                                 EDDIE
                        I have another questionable life 
                        choice for you.

           Eddie pulls a manila file folder from his jacket and rests it 
           on a cinder block near Hakeem.

                                 EDDIE (CONT'D)
                        A businessman.  I have his office 
                        address, his local bar, his 
                        friends, his photo, his resume, his 
                        bank, his library records - 
                        anything you need.

                                 HAKEEM
                        You've done all the homework.  Why 
                        not just do him yourself?

           Eddie takes aim at a bottle and gets it on the third shot.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You're the hitter.  I've never 
                        killed anyone, Hakeem.  That's one 
                        line I haven't crossed.  Maybe I 
                        feel like the stain's less on me if 
                        someone else does it.  Is that too 
                        honest?

                                 HAKEEM
                        I wonder if Stalin actually killed 
                        anyone, or if he just had others do 
                        it for him.

                                 EDDIE
                        I wonder why after I close the 
                        freezer door, the fridge is so hard 
                        to open.  But that's not fucking 
                        important right now.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Sorry, Eddie.

           Eddie sighs.

                                 EDDIE
                        I need you on this one.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Something happened on that yacht.  
                        Made me wonder if it is possible 
                        for a man to change.  But I'm 
                        trying, Eddie.  I'm out.  No more 
                        jobs for me.

                                 EDDIE
                        The fuck will you do?

           Hakeem lines up a trick shot, SHATTERING A BOTTLE OFF A 
           RICOCHET.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Plumbing.

           Eddie's face cycles through several different emotions before 
           he finally answers.

                                 EDDIE
                        Plumbing?

                        You ever read “The Millionaire Next 
                        Door?”  Plumbers who own their own 
                        business are more likely to become 
                        millionaires than almost any other 
                        profession.

                                 EDDIE
                        You'll need startup capital.  Who's 
                        going to give you a fucking 
                        business loan?

                        How much capital do I need to be a

                                 EDDIE
                        You serious?  How about a truck, 
                        advertising, tools, parts, one 
                        year's working capital.  Benefits 
                        package for employees.  Sole 
                        proprietorship.  What do you know 
                        from these things?

           Hakeem picks up Eddie's file and flips through it.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Why are you doing this?

                        Annabelle wants the hit.

           Hakeem whistles through his teeth.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Your own daughter wants to be a

                        Jesus, Eddie.  When are you going 
                        to start Gambler's Anonymous?

                                 EDDIE
                        In my book, GA spells, “gay.”

                                 HAKEEM
                        No, it spells “ga.”

                        What the fuck is “ga?”

                        So you need me to hit this suit 
                        before she does.  To keep her soul 
                        clean?

                                 EDDIE
                        She doesn't know that once you've 
                        crossed lines like we have, it's 
                        hard to go back.

           Hakeem nods.

                                 HAKEEM
                        The road to hell is all downhill.  
                        Trip once and you just keep on 
                        falling.

           Hakeem removes the potato silencer from his nine.  He aims at 
           a pyramid of bottles.  Three on the bottom row, two in the 
           middle and one on top.  Hakeem SHOOTS out the bottom row, the 
           middle row, and finally the top.  EVERY BOTTLE SHATTERS IN 
           MIDAIR BEFORE IT HITS THE GROUND.

           Six shots in two seconds.  Gunfire ECHOES around the concrete 
           walls of the tenements.

                        I suppose one more businessman 
                        couldn't hurt, right?

           Eddie turns to Hakeem and smiles.

                                 EDDIE
                        How hard could it be?

                     CHAPTER THREE - HAKEEM THE HITTER
           INT. DELTA WEB MAIN LOBBY - DAY

           Hakeem crosses the main foyer in easy strides.  He is now 
           clean cut in a business suit, but wearing a billowing black 
           trench coat with the collar turned up.  He looks like an 
           accountant for the Wu Tang Clan.

           Hakeem walks right past the lobby security guards.  Nobody 
           moves to stop him.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The elevator is clogged with BUSINESS PEOPLE.

           Hakeem enters and instinctively raises one hand to block the 
           overhead security camera.

           Brazenly clamping a joint in his lips Hakeem EXHALES A CLOUD 
           OF POT SMOKE.  The business people cough and cover their 
           noses with their shirts.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Are you serious?

                                 HAKEEM
                        'Bout to get that way.

                        What do you think you're doing?

                                 HAKEEM
                        Whatever the fuck I want.  You 
                        should try it sometime.

           Hakeem blows smoke out through his mouth while inhaling it 
           back in through his nostrils.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        This is a no smoking elevator.  
                        Matter of fact, all elevators are 
                        no smoking elevators.

           Hakeem snubs out the joint on the tip of his tongue.  The 
           businessman's brain does a back flip.

                                 BUSINESSMAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you here for, anyway?

                                 HAKEEM
                        Job interview.

           Hakeem spreads a slow grin, revealing two gold teeth.

           The elevator CHIMES, opening on the 47th floor.  Hakeem exits 
           trailing a plume of ganja smoke.

           Joe and Yalie hustle through the office, Yalie trotting to

                        ask me and I'll teach you.

                        Joe, if you're going to keep buying 
                        these internet companies, sooner or 
                        later, you're going to have to 
                        learn how to use the internet.

           INT. DELTA WEB OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - SIMULTANEOUS

           Hakeem sits in the reception area filling out a job 
           application.  Two nine-millimeter Glocks bulge beneath his 
           suit jacket.

           Under "What is Your Greatest Strength" on the application, 
           Hakeem writes "Finishing the job."

           Hakeem watches Joe move across the office, sizing him up.
           INT. JOE'S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Joe enters his office and immediately turns on CNBC, CNN, and 
           CSPAN on three different television sets.

           Joe SHOUTS out the doorway to his assistant.

                                 JOE

                        you're going to have to kill a 
                        bunch of people.

                        When you're in the trenches, the 
                        commander doesn't have time to coax 
                        his soldiers into fighting; he 
                        shouts a command and it gets 
                        followed, or everybody gets killed.  
                        That's how business should run.

                        Love of the deal over everything

                        come back to bite you?

           Across the office, Hakeem spots Joe putting on his overcoat.  

           Hakeem tosses his job application in the recycling bin.  He 
           swipes a Post It note off the reception desk and heads for 
           the elevator bay.
           INT. DELTA WEB ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Hakeem steps into an elevator as a few EMPLOYEES exit.  He 
           deftly swings an arm to the ceiling and slaps the Post It 
           over the iris of the elevator security cam.

           Hakeem pulls out a Glock, RACKS THE SLIDE, and SCREWS ON THE 
           SILENCER.  He stands concealed in the elevator, holding the 
           DOOR OPEN button and waiting...

           Hakeem waits in the elevator, focusing his breathing.  A loud

           Hakeem BURSTS from the Delta Web building, frantically 
           scanning the crowd of midtown pedestrians.

           One hand on the Glock in his pocket, Hakeem jogs to the curb 
           and DESPERATELY WAVES HIS FREE HAND to hail a cab.  None of 
           the cabbies even slow down.

           Hakeem is just another black man trying to hail a cab in 
           midtown.

           Joe hustles out of the Delta Web building and pushes his way 
           through the throng of pedestrians, including a HOMELESS MAN 
           begging for change.

                        Yeah?  Neither have I.  Pussy.

           Joe steps to the curb.  He swoops past Hakeem, purses his 
           lips, and WHISTLES LIKE A STEAM ENGINE.  A yellow cab 
           instantly SCREECHES TO A STOP.

           Joe opens the cab door and holds it chivalrously for Hakeem.

           Hakeem scans the cab, the driver, Joe's proximity.  Sweat

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, right.

           Hakeem blanches.

                                 JOE [ON PHONE]
                        Get me two hundred thousand and a 
                        credit line of fifty.
                             (pause)
                        That's not good enough.  I want it 
                        today.
                             (pause)
                        Well then split the cash with 
                        Doyle.
                             (pause)
                        Ten percent finder's fee??  Doyle 
                        can stick ten percent of my balls 
                        in his mouth!
                             (pause)
                        Look, I love Jimmy Doyle.  But if 
                        he thinks his dick is so big it can 
                        reach his own asshole, then tell 
                        him to go fuck himself.

           Joe hangs up.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Well, thanks for trying.

                        What are you talking about?  I just 
                        got you $300,000.

           Hakeem's jaw gapes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        That was Bob Duffy at Albert 
                        Capital.  His idea of negotiating 
                        is asking how far to spread his ass 
                        cheeks.

           Joe slips the cabbie some cash.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                             (to cabbie)

           Joe hands Hakeem a business card.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Here's my info, call me so we can 
                        square this away.

           Hakeem is astonished and humbled.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Thank you...

                        Don't thank me, I own half your 
                        business.

           Joe hustles out of the cab, already dialing his next phone 
           call.

           The cab continues north through traffic.  Hakeem stares 
           straight ahead, nearly catatonic with shock.  $300,000 in 
           thirty seconds.

                                 HAKEEM
                             (to the cabbie)
                        This is me.

           The cabbie pulls to a stop.

                        How much do I owe you?

                                 CABBIE
                        Nothing - he paid for you.

           EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

           Hakeem steps out of the cab and meets Eddie at their 
           rendezvous.

                        I'm out.

           Hakeem turns and walks away, heading north toward the Bronx.

                                 EDDIE
                        Hakeem, you're my rock!  What

                        I need you!

           Hakeem just walks away.  He stretches his arms and shouts for 
           all New York to hear.

           INT. CHANGO STREET TAVERN - NIGHT

           Joe, Ari, and Yalie squeeze through the rowdy Wall Street 
           bar.  Joe and Ari know everyone.

           Joe claps a BROKER on the shoulder.  The broker looks up from 
           his whiskey.

                                 JOE
                        Hey man, how's it going?  Jimmy

                        No, I got laid off.

           The broker returns to his whiskey.

           Joe moves down the bar.  He punches a BANKER on the arm.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Hey fuckstick!  I called you the

                        I think I was on another line.

                        Yeah, a line of coke in the 
                        bathroom.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY PARKING GARAGE - SIMULTANEOUS

           An AAA tow truck pulls up next to a big black SUV.  The AAA 
           driver jumps out.

                                 DRIVER
                        This the one?

           Eddie Glick steps out of the shadows, dressed in a nice suit.

                        Yep.  Long day at the office and I 
                        just locked my keys in there.

           The AAA DRIVER pulls out his slim jim, shimmies it through

                        It's all in the wrist.

                                 DRIVER
                        We got it over the phone, you're 
                        all set.

                                 EDDIE
                        Thanks, buddy.  Have a great night.

           The AAA Driver takes off.

           Eddie climbs in the backseat of the SUV, sinking down behind 
           the driver's seat.

           He pulls out a Heckler & Koch, aims it at the driver's seat, 
           and rehearses his shot.

                        Let's say one percent of the nubile

                        10 in both looks and personality. 
                        We're still talking about 10 
                        million women.  That's like Ireland 
                        plus Denmark.  That's like six 
                        Manhattan's filled with women you 
                        could happily spend the rest of

                        That would be an awesome city.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah but just because they score 
                        10s for personality and looks 
                        doesn't make them a soul mate.

                                 YALIE
                        Then how do you define soul mate?  
                        Let's say it's asymptotal.  Let's 
                        take your Gaussian curve and say 
                        one women on the planet must out-
                        score all others on your personal

                        that needle in a stack of 3.5

                        Yalie, the thing is that humans are 
                        prosaic.  What do you have in 
                        common with some bank teller in

                        Your soul mate could be sitting 
                        right here in this bar.

           Eddie takes a gulp from his flask.  He aims his gun at the 
           back of the driver's seat, practicing his speech.

                        Good evening, Mr. Rightman.  This 
                        is a message from Barry Glick...
                        It's not personal, it's business...
                        Okay, well I know it was business 
                        to you and then my brother made it 
                        personal, and really, what could be 
                        more personal than killing you, but 
                        he's my brother - what am I 
                        supposed to do?

           Eddie catches his reflection in the rearview mirror.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I'm doing this for Barry and for 
                        Annabelle.  This has to be the 
                        right thing, because it's for 
                        family.

           Eddie looks at his reflection, unconvinced.  He unscrews his 
           flask and takes another long pull.

           At the bar, Yalie waves his arm in vain to get the 
           BARTENDER's attention.  Annabelle is on him like a pouncing 
           cat.

                        So I hear this is the watering hole

                        You could say that.

           Yalie points to Joe who is SLAMMING SHOTS with some Chinese 
           bankers.

           Annabelle leans low across the bar, her top drooping, drawing 
           the bartender's attention immediately.

                        One Guinness for the lady, and a 
                        Shirley Temple for the kid.

           Yalie turns to face Annabelle.

                                 YALIE
                        Well, at least you got the 
                        bartender to serve me.

           Annabelle looks him square in the eyes, as if she can see his 
           very soul.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        I get what I want.

           Yalie blushes.  Annabelle is way out of his league.  Yalie 
           realizes he has tied a bar straw into a double square knot.

           EXT. BRONX ZOO - TIGER CAGE - NIGHT

           The crescent moon disappears behind ominous clouds.

           Kogi, with his punk J-pop hair, drops down off a high chain 
           link fence and lands in a crouch.  Behind him, deep inside 
           the tiger cave, comes A LOW GROWL.

           Kogi calmly pulls a bandana from his pocket and rolls it up 
           like Rambo preparing for battle.  Instead of wrapping the 
           bandana around his forehead, HE WRAPS IT AROUND HIS EYES.

           In the darkness, softly padding TIGER CLAWS SCRATCH against 
           cement.

           Now, Kogi does something astonishing.  He puts his right hand 
           behind his back, tucks it through his belt, and tightens the 
           belt.  He is now blindfolded in a tiger cage with ONE HAND 
           TIED BEHIND HIS BACK.

           A Bengal tiger emits a rumbling GROWL.  It is a sound no 
           human should have to hear in the dark.

           Kogi draws a priceless Katana sword.  Moonlight smiles on its 
           silver skin.

           Kogi's muscles quiver with anticipation.  His ears pick up 
           the sound of the powerful tiger stepping into the open.

           Kogi bows, smiles, and squares off with the beast.  Every 
           muscle in his body now completely relaxed...

                        These finance BSD's spend so much 
                        money on their houses - how many 
                        hours a week is anyone actually at 
                        home?  Shit, I could live out of a

                        True enough.

           Joe jerks a thumb toward the backseat.

           Eddie searches for his gun.  It's up on the backseat, just 
           out of reach.

           INT. JOE'S SUV - MOVING - LATER

           Joe's SUV heads for the Holland Tunnel.

                                 JOE
                        How do you think Yalie's doing with 
                        that man-eater, Annabelle?  She 
                        practically dragged him out of the 
                        bar in her teeth like a mother 
                        tiger.

           In the backseat, Eddie's eyes go wide.

                                 ARI
                        Look, you know I love Yalie, but 
                        he'll douche out.

                             (incredulous)
                        What?  It's a done deal!  That girl  
                        is a straight-up predator.  She's 
                        probably eating his brains right 
                        now like a succubus.  He's going to 
                        show up in the office covered in 
                        claw marks and paw prints.

           Eddie listens, clenching his teeth.

                                 ARI
                        If he got her home - and that's a 
                        big if - he probably served her 
                        milk and cookies, tucked her in, 
                        and went to bed.

                        For Yalie's sake I hope you're 
                        wrong.  I've got big plans for 
                        Yalie.  But that boy needs to find 
                        his nuts.

           head inside to settle the bill.

           INT. JOE'S SUV - SAME

           Eddie sits up, checks to make sure the coast is clear and 
           jumps out of the SUV.

           EXT. HOBOKEN TRUCK STOP - SAME

           Eddie waddles behind the gas station.

           Finding some bushes, Eddie unzips and urinates with enormous 
           relief.  He stretches his neck and back - clearly sore from 
           crouching behind the driver's seat.

           After a post-pee shudder, Eddie crosses back to the gas 
           station.

           Joe's SUV PULLS AWAY, back toward the highway.

                                 EDDIE
                        Shit!

           Eddie frantically checks his pockets.  No gun.  His Heckler & 
           Koch is on Joe's back seat.

           parking lot.

           Stranded in Jersey.

                      CHAPTER FIVE - KOGI THE KILLER
           INT. KOGI'S APARTMENT - DAWN

           Kogi delicately trims a few tiny branches from a Bonsai tree.  
           Then, with resolve, he takes a deep breath and lets it out 
           slowly.

           Kogi now stands before his bathroom mirror, his cold eyes 
           staring at his long, spikey hair.  He puts the trimming 
           shears to his scalp.  The sink is soon filled with pink, 
           blonde, and blue hair.

           Kogi now brushes off an Armani suit, straightens a tie in the 
           mirror, and picks up a briefcase.  For a final touch, he puts 
           on horned rim spectacles.

           In short black hair, he is now completely indistinguishable 
           from every other businessman on Wall Street.  Except for one 
           detail...

           Bowing his head, Kogi dons a necklace adorned with a single, 
           bloody, tiger claw.

           size, a glass of milk on the night stand.

                        say a few things...  All I do is 
                        work.  In the winter, I don't even 
                        see daylight 'cause I'm in the 
                        office by seven and work a fourteen 
                        hour day.  And if I don't take lead 
                        on a deal soon I'm going to get 
                        replaced.  I don't have normal

           EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

           Eddie, with dark bags under his eyes, sits on a park bench 
           chewing a wad of Nicorettes.  He is startled to notice KOGI 
           SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Just another businessman in the 
           park.

           They speak without facing one another, gazing out on the grey 
           harbor.

                                 KOGI
                        Why did you contact me over a 
                        businessman?

                                 EDDIE
                        You're the best there is.

                                 KOGI
                        Is he really such a challenge?

                             (sighs)
                        Guy's practically a hitter, 
                        himself.

           Kogi nods.  He picks up the file folder from the park bench.

                                 KOGI
                        Then I accept.

           The two sit for a beat, watching the gently gliding yachts on 
           the Hudson and one lonely white kite rippling in the grey 
           sky.

                        When I got started, you know what I 
                        chose as my cover story?  
                        Industrial supply parts 
                        distributor.

                        I wanted to pick something so 
                        mundane, no one would question me 
                        too deeply about it at a cocktail 
                        party.  Shit, not even the FBI 
                        would want to read my file.

                        see, I still can't pull pussy.  
                        'Cause you meet a girl in this 
                        city, the first thing she asks is

                        I entered this business for 
                        revenge.  Every day in grade school 
                        I hit my forearms and shinbones 
                        with a whiskey bottle to develop 
                        bone calluses, and stayed up all 
                        night training my eyes to see in 
                        the dark.  For years I traveled the 
                        world, studying every martial art.  
                        Finally, I sought the man who 
                        brought so much pain to my family.

                        by his loving family?

                        No, he was quite alive.
                             (filled with respect)
                        He was the greatest adversary I 
                        have ever faced.  He left me with 
                        scars I shall carry forever, even 
                        into the next life.  The day I 
                        killed him was the greatest day of 
                        my life, and also the saddest.

                        I seek opponents who can match me 
                        in discipline and skill, but have 
                        never found one.  I fear I will 
                        search forever.  What do you do 
                        when you have achieved your life's 
                        goal?

                        Maybe you should try a new line of

                        how she can't get financial aid and 
                        how she just wants to get the hell 
                        out of The Bronx.

                                 JOE
                        And you sat there and listened?

                                 YALIE
                             (shrugging)
                        Well, yeah.

                                 JOE
                        Jesus, Yalie.  You don't get laid 
                        by being nice to a girl!

           Joe pulls a twenty out of his money clip and begrudgingly 
           hands it to Ari.  Ari puts an arm around Yalie's shoulder.

                                 ARI
                        You want my advice?  Date crazy 
                        girls.

                                 YALIE
                        Really?

           Ari and Joe nod, definitely.

                        Crazy girls are dynamite in the

                        bad about breaking up with them, 
                        cause they're crazy.

           INT. JOE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The three enter Joe's office.  Hakeem is standing before 
           Joe's desk, looking somber.

                        What's this?

           INT. JOE'S OFFICE - ONE MINUTE LATER

           Joe sits at his desk, his whole life spread out before him - 
           the contents of Hakeem's folder.  Ari stands behind Joe's 
           desk, arms crossed.  Yalie clutches his brow in shock.

                                 JOE
                        A hit?

                                 HAKEEM
                        You need to move to a safe 
                        location.  They know where you 
                        live, where you drink, and that you 
                        exercise at the Harvard club even 
                        though you didn't go to Harvard.

                        Jesus, even the Harvard guys 
                        haven't figured that out.

           Joe flips through the file in amazement.

                        through.

           Joe gets up from his desk and paces the floor, thinking.

                        No, no, no, going to the police

           best to being yelled at.

           thumbs up.

           Joe and Ari look at each other and laugh.  For them, the 
           answer is obvious.

                                 JOE
                        Life is a game, and the object of 
                        the game, is to not be a pussy.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. BRONX ROOFTOP - AFTERNOON

           Hakeem adjusts the sites on a monstrous 50 CALIBER MARINE 
           SCOUT SNIPER RIFLE.  He nestles the muzzle break on the 
           parapet of the rooftop.
           RIFLE SCOPE - POV

           On the street below, Barry Glick steps out of his immaculate 
           Lincoln Town Car and lovingly brushes a few specs of dust off 
           the hood.

           Barry crosses the street toward Eddie's office.

           EXT. BRONX ROOFTOP - SAME

           Hakeem lines up Barry in the rifle sites.  Hakeem's finger 
           tests the trigger, but he cannot take the shot.

                                 HAKEEM
                        No more killing.

           Hakeem's finger relaxes.

                                 HAKEEM (CONT’D)
                        I'm changing.  I'm quitting this 
                        life.  This is not me.

           At that moment, the scout rifle is violently KICKED FROM HIS 
           FACE.  The rifle PLUMMETS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.  
           Hakeem clutches his smashed nose, moaning in pleasure.

           Hakeem looks up to see Kogi backlit in the glaring sunlight.

                                 KOGI
                        Glick said you would be coming for 
                        him.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Tell Eddie I couldn't take the 
                        shot.  I wanted to but I couldn't.

                                 KOGI
                        In a battle for life and death, 
                        there is no second place.

           Hakeem looks up wearily, wiping the blood from his nose.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Can there be a tie for first?

                                 KOGI
                        No.

           Hakeem launches himself at Kogi, TACKLING HIM LIKE A 
           LINEBACKER.  Nearly twice Kogi's size, Hakeem might actually 
           stand a chance.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The two killers ROLL AND GRAPPLE on the rooftop gravel.  
           Hakeem CRUSHING KOGI'S NECK in a vice grip; Kogi seeking 
           pressure points between Hakeem's ribs.

           Finally, Kogi's fingers find a three inch screw in the 
           rooftop gravel.  Kogi swings his arm to SLAM THE SCREW INTO 
           HAKEEM'S TEMPLE.  Hakeem ducks; the screw PIERCING HIS UPPER 
           EARLOBE.

           The two killers roll away and assume fighting stances.

           Hakeem picks up a piece of broken glass from the rooftop and 
           examines the screw in his ear, admiring the reflection.  The 
           screw makes for a pretty bad-ass piercing.

                                 HAKEEM
                             (smiling)
                        Not bad.

           Hakeem LEAPS AT Kogi.  Kogi retreats through rooftop clothes 
           lines.  PUNCHES FLY AT Kogi through billowing bed sheets.  
           Kogi grabs clothespins and JABS AT HAKEEM'S KNEECAPS AND 
           SHOULDER BLADES.

           Kogi backs through a rooftop garden, Hakeem's SMASHING FISTS 
           BURSTING TOMATO PLANTS that splatter the two with blood red 
           juice.  Impervious to pain, Hakeem is an unstoppable monster.

           Kogi dives and backrolls, uprooting roof-mounted satellite 
           dishes.  Kogi FRISBEE HURLS THEM AT HAKEEM who demolishes 
           them with CRASHING ELBOWS AND FISTS.

           Kogi retreats through a web of rooftop POWER LINES THAT 
           SIZZLE AND HUM.  Each man fighting with gymnastic precision - 
           fearful of crossing the cables.

           Hakeem is all street brawler and Kogi is all finesse.  While 
           Hakeem pants and fumes, Kogi is the patient bull fighter 
           wearing him down.

           Finally, Kogi lures Hakeem into a wire enclosure, boxed in by 
           massive ROARING AIR VENTILATORS.

                                 KOGI
                        You fight with heart.  But your 
                        kung fu is second rate.

                                 HAKEEM
                        You don't even know who I am or 
                        what you're fighting me for.  
                        You're just here for the paycheck.

                        No.  I am just here to win.

           Hakeem squares his fists and springs for Kogi.  But this time 
           Kogi does not hold back.  Kogi releases his full speed and 
           power.

           Kogi BLOCKS AN EYE GOUGE and a COBRA CLAW TO THE JUGULAR.  
           With dizzying speed, Kogi soon blocks every strike as if 
           reading Hakeem's very thoughts.

           Finally, as if tired of playing, Kogi ducks a roundhouse and 
           PILE-DRIVES AN ELBOW INTO HAKEEM'S JAW.

           The fight is over.  Hakeem sprawls on the rooftop, sleeping 
           like a baby.

           Joe, Ari, and Yalie enter the palatial suite.  Glittering 
           Louis XIV chandeliers illuminate Persian carpets.  Yalie 
           gawks; Joe and Ari have seen it all before.

                        We have to set up some kind of

           Moving up, we see a bit of her calf, her smooth, white 
           thigh...

           A sliver of her stomach...

           And then Annabelle herself, thoroughly engrossed in "SURVEY 
           OF GLOBAL ECONOMICS."

           Annabelle takes off her reading glasses, stretches 
           luxuriously, and turns to gaze out Yalie's bedroom window - a 
           dazzling view of lower Manhattan.

                        This is what I want.

           Wrapping herself in bedsheets, Annabelle crosses the room and 
           returns the college textbook to Yalie's overstuffed 
           bookshelf.

           She crouches down to her purse and draws the .44 Magnum.

           Hakeem returns to consciousness.  Blinking his eyes, he finds 
           himself tied to Eddie's office chair.

           Barry pulls up a side table and sets down a BOX CUTTER, 
           OFFICE SCISSORS, and a HAMMER.

                                 BARRY
                             (apologetically)
                        This is all the torture equipment I 
                        could find in Eddie's office.  But 
                        it'll have to do.

           Kogi stands in a corner, arms crossed, meditative.  Eddie 
           paces back and forth nervously.

           Barry picks up the office scissors and the hammer.  He weighs 
           them in his hands and settles on the hammer.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        him up.

           Barry nods and CRACKS HAKEEM ACROSS THE FACE with the handle 
           of the hammer.

           Hakeem lets out a low moan, tasting blood.

                                 EDDIE
                        You're just going to beat it out of

                        This man was going to kill me with 
                        a sniper rifle, Eddie.

                        But he didn't.

           Eddie picks up his coat and turns to leave.

                        Where are you going?  To place a 
                        bet with your bookie?

                                 EDDIE
                        I'm going after my daughter.  
                        Twenty years of surveillance 
                        experience, I should be able to

                                 BARRY
                        She's not going to listen to you.

                                 EDDIE
                        Yes, she is.  As long as I'm in 
                        this life she can call me a 
                        hypocrite.  But if I leave it, and 
                        ask her to leave with me, then 
                        maybe I have a chance.

           Hakeem nods, a strange smile flickers across his face.

           Eddie turns to leave.

                                 BARRY

           But Eddie is already gone.

           Barry returns his focus to Hakeem.

           Barry CRACKS Hakeem once more with the hammer.  This time, 
           harder.  Hakeem moans with pleasure.

                                 HAKEEM
                        I'll never tell.  You're going to

                        It doesn't have to be like this -

                        Harder!

           Barry delivers a few more punches, increasingly frustrated.

           Barry collapses back in his chair, exhausted.  Confused and 
           frustrated, he turns to Kogi.

           Kogi pushes Barry aside and moves to stand in front of 
           Hakeem.  Kogi eyes him narrowly.

           Hakeem quivers with anticipation.

                        They have a presidential suite.  It 
                        has a panic room.

           Kogi and Hakeem share a long look.

                                 KOGI (CONT’D)
                        It's been a pleasure.

                                 HAKEEM
                        The pleasure's all mine.

           Barry thoughtfully fingers a single slip of paper from 
           Eddie's desk: MOSES'S CELL PHONE NUMBER.  He slips it in his 
           pocket.

                                 BARRY
                        You know any shortcuts downtown in 
                        rush hour?

           Barry and Kogi exit.  Hakeem collapses back in his 
           restraints, exhausted.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           Joe has CNBC going on the TV and NPR on the stereo.  The 
           BELLHOP enters.

                                 BELLHOP
                        Your Bonsai trees, Mr. Rightman.

                                 JOE
                        Oh yes, out here on the balcony.  
                        They like the fresh air.

           The bellhop turns, revealing a stern face and a TIGER CLAW 
           NECKLACE.

           Kogi's deadly eyes scan the room - every object is a lethal 
           weapon.  The electric chord of a lamp...the crystal flower 
           vase...The Plaza's logo-embossed fountain pens...

           Kogi follows Joe onto the balcony with the bonsai trees...

           EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Joe tips Kogi absently, eyeing the epaulets and brass buttons 
           of Kogi's red bellhop uniform.

                                 JOE
                        Nice getup.  Who owns the Plaza, 
                        anyway?  Trump?  Hilton?  How's the 
                        management?  Good benefits?  What's 
                        the stock at?

           Joe flicks out a Japanese trimming knife and sets to work on 
           his Bonsai trees.

           Kogi eyes the steel blade and hesitates.  He watches the 
           careful way Joe trims the leaves.

                                 KOGI
                        Tell, Mr. Rightman.  Are you fond 
                        of bonsai trees?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 JOE
                        Had to flee some stupid shit today, 
                        and this is only thing I thought to 
                        take with me.

                                 KOGI
                        But, of all the possessions in your 
                        house -

                                 JOE
                        I don't own a house.

                                 KOGI
                        What do you spend your money on?

                                 JOE
                        Let me tell you something kid, the 
                        only thing worth spending money on 
                        is making more money.

           Kogi nods.

                                 KOGI
                        You live only for battle.

                                 JOE
                        Sure.

                                 KOGI
                        What makes a plant so important?

           Joe stops and considers.  For once Joe's voice is quiet and 
           thoughtful.

                                 JOE
                        I learn from them.  You can curse 
                        and scream at a plant and it just 
                        breathes in your carbon dioxide.  
                        You can spit on a plant and it just 
                        drinks your water.  You can drop 
                        trow and take a shit on a plant and 
                        it just fertilizes and grows.  I 
                        spend my life trying to be like 
                        these trees.  Take all the crap 
                        life throws at you, grow from it, 
                        and get stronger.

           Kogi nods solemnly.

                                 KOGI
                        Sometimes the roots of the tree die 
                        first.  It takes months to show in 
                        the leaves.

                        So you keep watering and feeding 
                        and pruning it for months, not 
                        knowing the plant is long dead.  
                        Sometimes I think about how maybe 
                        I'm like that plant.  Already dead.  
                        It just hasn't shown yet.

           Joe looks up at Kogi, considering.

                                 KOGI (CONT'D)
                        Tell me, Mr. Rightman, what would 
                        you do if there were no more 
                        battles to win?

                                 JOE
                        You asking if I could retire?

                                 KOGI
                        Yes.

           Joe shakes his head.

                                 JOE
                        No, I couldn't.  Life is the 
                        battle.  If I had to retire, I'd 
                        probably throw myself out this 
                        window.

                                 KOGI
                        If you cannot fight, then die with 
                        honor?

                                 JOE
                        Better to burn out than to fade 
                        away, right?

           Kogi considers this deeply before responding.

                                 KOGI
                        The great Samurai, Miyamoto 
                        Musashi, wrote that the master wins 
                        by having the objects around him 
                        fight for him.

                                 JOE
                        Yeah, I read that in business 
                        school.

                                 KOGI
                        I have vanquished every enemy I 
                        ever faced, searching for my equal.  
                        Today, Joe Rightman, you have 
                        vanquished me.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Quizzical, Joe puts down his sheers and turns to look at 
           Kogi, really seeing him for the first time.

                                 KOGI (CONT’D)
                        I know now what I must do.

           Kogi bows.  He climbs up on the parapet of the balcony and 
           turns to Joe and smiles.  This is the first time Kogi has 
           ever looked happy.

                                 KOGI (CONT’D)
                        Today, Joe Rightman, you have freed 
                        me from this world.

           Kogi gracefully falls back and PLUMMETS FROM THE BUILDING - a 
           graceful swan dive.

                                 JOE
                        Jesus - no!  Oh my God -

           Joe turns, he can't look.  Sixteen stories below, he hears an 
           awful SPLATTER and a CAR ALARM GOING OFF.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        What the hell did I say?

           Ari and Yalie bolt into the room and onto the balcony.

                                 ARI
                        The fuck just happened?

           Ari and Yalie hustle Joe inside from the balcony.

                        in this?

           Ari and Yalie maneuver Joe into the panic room.

           INT. PANIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A barren room with a few dusty cans of creamed corn and a 
           security monitor.

                                 JOE
                        Well, what am I supposed to do?  
                        Sit here and count my testicles?

                        Yalie accumulates shares while I 
                        handle police.  Just sit tight.

           Ari and Yalie leave and close the panic room door, sealing 
           Joe in.

                                 JOE
                        Hey, I got no cell reception in 
                        here!

           Joe looks around for something to do in the empty room.  
           There is only a chair and a laptop.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                             (pissed off)

                        thumb up my ass.

           Joe sits down and regards the laptop coldly.

                        bellhops.  They are present and 
                        accounted for.  Whoever fell out of 
                        your window was not an employee of 
                        this hotel.

                                 PIERRE
                        As you wish.

           Pierre and the bellhops surround Ari and Yalie.  White gloves 
           behind their backs, they wait.  POLICE SIRENS wail in the 
           distance.

           out of his Navigator.  Six roughnecks step out of vehicles on 
           either side.

                                 MOSES
                        What's your play?

                                 BARRY
                        Hang back while the police sort 
                        this out.  But watch the exits.  
                        Joe Rightman doesn't leave this 
                        building.

           Moses chews on his toothpick.

                                 MOSES
                        Five hundred g's?

           Barry nods.

                                 BARRY
                        But I get to take the shot that 
                        kills him.

           Moses nods to his crew.  They spread out to surround the 
           Plaza Hotel.

           Hakeem wakes up, tied to the chair.  He struggles against his

           INT. PANIC ROOM - SAME

           Joe paces the tiny panic room, bored out of his gourd.  He 
           checks the security monitor - the police are still taking 
           statements.

           Joe looks at the laptop and scowls...

           Eddie's office is now EMPTY.  On Hakeem's bloody chair lies a

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

           Barry and Moses march down the carpeted hallway, leading 
           Moses's team of street thugs.  They round a corner, duck 
           yellow POLICE TAPE, and slip into the Presidential Suite.

           The door is wide open.  The rest of the hotel sleeps.

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Barry's henchman shut the door and guard it.  Barry beelines 
           for the panic room and BANGS on the door.

                                 BARRY
                        Joe Rightman, you in there?
           INT. PANIC ROOM - SAME

           Joe watches Barry and his gangsters on the black and white 
           security monitor.

           Joe looks to his cellphone - he has no bars.  He grits his 
           teeth in fury.

                                 BARRY [ON MONITOR]
                        Joe!  Open up!

                                 JOE
                             (shouting through the 
                              door)
                        Bite my nuts, Barry - it's a panic 
                        room.

           INTERCUT - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

           Barry holds up a pair of keys for Joe's security camera.

                                 BARRY
                        Picked them up from hotel security 
                        in the lobby.  Seems all the 
                        security guards are busy checking 
                        out the body on my Lincoln.

           Barry unlocks the panic room door...

           INT. PANIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Barry, flanked by menacing thugs, steps inside.

           Barry holds out his hand and receives a nine millimeter Luger 
           from Moses.

                                 BARRY
                        Everybody out of the room - no 
                        witnesses.

                                 MOSES
                        Are you sure?

                                 BARRY
                        Get the fuck out.

           The thugs retreat from the panic room.  Barry shuts and locks 
           the door.

                                 JOE
                        You take one step closer and I will 
                        shove my lawyer so far up your 
                        ass...

           CONTINUED:

           Barry TURNS THE LUGER ON JOE.

           Joe sits in his chair, with no barrier between him and the 
           gun.

                                 BARRY
                        Now I want you to shut the fuck up.  
                        You are the cancer that must be 
                        removed.  You are the incompetent 
                        one screwing up my company.

                                 JOE
                        You really up for this, Glick?

           Barry steadies his aim.

                                 BARRY
                        Sit still.

                                 JOE
                        I am a corporate Darwinist.  I take 
                        companies that are failing, and 
                        either I change them or destroy 
                        them.  There's nothing personal 
                        here.

                                 BARRY
                        You are a parasite.

           Joe leans forward in his chair, ignoring Barry's gun and 
           staring boldly into Barry's eyes.  Joe speaks slowly and 
           carefully.

                                 JOE
                        Business is a jungle and I am an 
                        agent of nature.  I am a lion, and 
                        you are an antelope.  The antelopes 
                        may hate the lions, but the lions 
                        make the antelopes stronger.

                                 BARRY
                        You quoted Sun Tzu to me yesterday.  
                        Whoever has the most information 
                        wins.  Well I read the fine print 
                        and you're the only one who can 
                        finalize this takeover.  With you 
                        out of the way, I get to keep my 
                        company.

                                 JOE
                        I never knew you were this 
                        dedicated.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 BARRY
                        What can I say, Joe?  This company 
                        is my life.  I wouldn't know what 
                        to do if I had to start over.

                                 JOE
                        You could have just changed your 
                        practices, Barry.

                                 BARRY
                        It's a little late for that, now.  
                        So it looks like I'm the lion, and 
                        you're the antelope.  

           Barry draws a bead on Joe's forehead.  There is no escape.

           Barry COCKS the weapon.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Any last words, Joe?

                                 JOE
                        Of course.

           Joe turns to his laptop.  HAROLD GARDNER's face is on the 
           monitor.

           Joe has learned how to Skype.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        You got all that, Harry?

                                 HAROLD [ON COMPUTER]
                        Sure did, Joe.

                                 BARRY
                        Who the hell is that?

                                 JOE
                        Harold Gardner, New York Times.  
                        He's wanted to interview me for a 
                        while but I'm always being held up.

                                 HAROLD [ON COMPUTER]
                        The police are on their way, Joe.

           On the monitor, other reporters are visible, crowding around 
           Harold in his office.  Newspapermen burning the midnight oil.

                                 JOE
                        Amazing technology.  Who owns 
                        Skype, is it public?  What's the 
                        stock at?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           Joe returns his attention to Barry.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        So, where were we?  You were 
                        telling me that whoever has the 
                        most information wins.

           Joe leans back in his chair.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Still want to pull that trigger, 
                        Barry?

                                 BARRY
                        Looks like you get to live, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Who the fuck cares?  The real story 
                        here is, I just won your company.

           Barry looks at Joe with cold fury in his eyes.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        Easy, Barry.  I've got witnesses.

                                 BARRY
                        And I've got nothing to lose.

           Barry closes in on Joe with murder in his eyes...

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL - ELEVATOR BAY - SIMULTANEOUS

           Hakeem exits the elevator.  He is a bleeding mess, but moving 
           steadily.  He takes a moment to leave the elevator door 
           propped open with a cigarette ashcan.

           Easy exit.

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Hakeem marches down the hallway toward the Presidential 
           Suite.

           Ari and Yalie move to stop him.

                                 ARI
                        Oh, no you don't.

           Hakeem pulls his Glock and JACKS ONE IN THE CHAMBER.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You two jokers covered the front 
                        elevators, but not the service 
                        elevators.

                                 YALIE

                        I was born for this.

           Behind them, A CRACK OF GUNFIRE EXPLODES from the 
           Presidential Suite.

           Hakeem PUSHES past them to the hotel door and SAVAGELY KICKS 
           IT DOWN.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Hakeem steps into this hornet's nest of thugs.  His gun FIRES 
           CONTINUOUSLY.  He reclips without breaking rhythm.

           Miraculously, HAKEEM IS NOT KILLING ANYONE.  Only shooting 
           the guns from the gangsters' hands.  As fast as they can 
           draw, their guns end up on the floor.

           The echoes of gunfire die away, leaving a half dozen stunned 
           gangsters, jaws hanging open in superstitious awe.

                                 MOSES
                        You must be Hakeem.

                                 HAKEEM
                        Indeed.

                                 MOSES
                        They say you've killed more 
                        brothers than sickle cell.

                                 HAKEEM
                        That may be true.  And any other 
                        day you'd all be dead, too.  But 
                        today is a new day.

           Hakeem safeties his Glock and raises his fists to fight.

           The gangsters look to Moses uncertainly.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You heard the man.  He ain't gonna 
                        shoot you cowards.  Now take care 
                        of him!

           The thugs rush Hakeem who fights like a mad dog, SMASHING 
           NOSES AND TEETH with the heel of his palm.

           Ari joins in the fighting, holding his own like a college 
           boxer.

           Expensive furniture is CRUSHED under flying bodies; a flat 
           screen TV CRUMPLES on a gangster's dew rag.

           Finally, it is just down to Moses and Hakeem.  Hakeem is 
           taking Moses's punches and moaning with pleasure.

                                 ARI
                        Hakeem, c'mon, HURRY UP!

                        Oh, right.  Sorry.

           Hakeem hits Moses with a RIGHT CROSS AND DROPS HIM.

           Hakeem, Ari, and Yalie race for the panic room.

                                 YALIE
                        Joe!  Joe are you in there!  Joe!

           There is a silent beat.  Then the click of the door 
           UNLOCKING.

           Hakeem draws his Glock and trains it on the panic room door.

           And the panic room door swings open revealing...

           INT. PANIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...Joe, a Luger in his hand.  Barry, pistol-whipped and 
           groggy, lies sprawled in the armchair behind him.

           A single curl of smoke rises from a bullet hole in a can of 
           creamed corn.

                                 JOE
                        Sell all our Delta Web stock.

                                 YALIE
                        Joe?

           CONTINUED:

                                 JOE
                        The price is going to plummet when 
                        news breaks their CEO is going to 
                        jail.  Then we'll pick up the 
                        company for pennies on the dollar.

           Ari nods and gets on his cell.

           Joe dabs a speck of creamed corn from his power tie and steps 
           out of the panic room.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe spots the bruised and battered Hakeem.

                                 JOE
                        Hakeem, what the hell happened to 
                        you?

                                 YALIE
                        He went to bat for you.

           Joe nods to Hakeem.

                                 JOE
                        Police are coming up here.  You 
                        best get as far away as you can 
                        right now.  I'll be in touch.  
                        Yale, take his gun.

           Hakeem wipes the prints from the Glock and hands it to Yalie 
           who nearly fumbles the heavy weapon.

           Shrugging, Yalie tucks the gun into the waistband of his suit 
           pants where it bulges awkwardly.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        You did good, Hakeem.

                                 HAKEEM
                        You can count on me, Joe.

           The two hitters shake hands.  Hakeem gives Joe one last nod 
           and disappears out the door.

           Pierre, the fastidious hotel manager, arrives with his 
           coterie of Bellhops.

                                 PIERRE
                        What is happening now?

                        Ari, stay and handle things with 
                        Pierre.  Make sure the police know 
                        who to arrest.  Yalie and I are 
                        going to make a tactful exit.

           Joe scans the room.

                                 JOE (CONT'D)
                        What name did we rent this room 
                        under?

                                 ARI
                        The Prince of Zamunda.

                                 JOE
                        Nice.

           Joe ushers Yalie toward the door.

                        Service elevator?

                                 JOE
                        Correct.  Yalie, what do you know 
                        about Skype stock?

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe and Yalie jog down the hallway.  They have ditched their 
           blazers and are donning red Bellhop jackets and hats.

                                 JOE
                        I feel ridiculous.

                                 YALIE
                        It's just til we get out of the 
                        building.

           Joe and Yalie freeze, hearing the sound of a SWAT TEAM 
           approaching from an adjacent hallway.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 JOE
                        Detour.

           Joe pulls Yalie down a side hall.

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL - SIDE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Joe and Yalie dead end at a balcony window.

           The SWAT TEAM rushes past down the main hallway.

                                 YALIE
                        We could just wait here.

                                 JOE
                        No.  The SWAT team will set up a 
                        perimeter.

                                 YALIE
                        How do you know this stuff?

                                 JOE
                             (duh)
                        Law & Order.

           At that moment, a BULLET WHIZZES PAST THEM, SHATTERING THE 
           BALCONY WINDOW.

           Moses stands at the end of the hallway, gun smoking.  His 
           right eye is a swollen mess; his aim is unsteady.  But he is 
           determined.

                                 YALIE
                        Joe, c'mon!

           Yalie and Joe climb through the smashed window and pile onto 
           the balcony...

           EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           It is nothing more than a widow's walk.  Four feet across.  
           Sixteen stories in the air.

           Moses lurches toward the window, closing in on the two 
           sitting ducks.

           Yalie grabs Joe's arm and points frantically over the edge of 
           the balcony.

                                 YALIE
                        We jump to that fire escape.

                                 YALIE
                        We can do it!  It's parkour!

                                 JOE
                        How do you know this stuff?

           MOSES FIRES HIS GUN.  Bricks EXPLODE from the balcony wall.

           Yalie and Joe climb up on the parapet AND LEAP...

           ...They sail through the air for what seems like eternity, 
           then CATCH THE METAL RAILING OF THE ADJACENT FIRE ESCAPE.

           EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS

           Joe's feet slip, losing their grip.  He dangles helplessly 
           from the metal railing, the gaping city sprawling beneath 
           him.

                                 YALIE
                        Hang on Joe!

                                 JOE
                        No shit!

                                 YALIE
                        I've got you!

           Yalie desperately grabs Joe's arms and pulls with all his 
           might.  Moses's BULLETS EXPLODE IN SPARKS against the metal 
           framework of the escape ladder.

           Yalie pulls Joe to safety.  Yalie tries to SMASH OPEN THE 
           FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW but it is too thick to break.

                                 YALIE (CONT’D)
                        C'mon, Joe!

                                 JOE
                             (in shock)
                        I can't move.

                                 YALIE
                        You're always telling me to nut up 
                        or shut up!  Now nut up!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Yalie races down the fire escape ladder.  Joe hustles after 
           him.

           High above them, Moses makes the DEATH DEFYING LEAP to the 
           fire escape.

           Yalie and Joe race down the fire escape ladders, upsetting 
           roosting pigeons, BULLETS RICOCHETING ON THE IRON SPEED RAIL.  
           At each landing, Yalie SMASHES HIS FISTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS 
           but they are all locked tight.

                                 YALIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit...shit...

           Yalie searches for options.

                                 YALIE (CONT’D)
                        There.  The storm drain.  We use it 
                        to climb to that open window.

                                 JOE
                        There's no way it will hold us!

                                 YALIE
                        It's our only shot.

           BULLETS DEMOLISH BRICKS, sending clouds of red dust raining 
           down on the two financiers.

           Yalie and Joe climb the fire escape railing and grab hold of 
           the aluminum storm drain.  They SCREAM as the drain buckles 
           and snaps, FOLDING AWAY FROM THE BUILDING.

           Bracket by bracket the storm drain PEELS AWAY FROM THE BRICK, 
           sending the Wall Street pair lurching toward the earth ten 
           feet at a time.

           MOSES LEAPS DOWN FIRE ESCAPE LADDERS, racing to keep pace 
           with the duo while SHOWERING THEM WITH BULLETS. 

           Finally the storm drain CRASHES ONTO AN ADJACENT FIRE ESCAPE, 
           hurtling Joe and Yalie hard onto the metal grating.

                                 YALIE (CONT’D)
                        Joe!  An open window!

           Panting with fear, Yalie climbs up on the railing, balances 
           precariously, and rolls in through the open hotel window.  
           Joe follows, BULLETS DISINTEGRATING THE BRICKS AROUND HIM.
           INT. RANDOM PLAZA HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Yalie and Joe roll onto a queen size bed.  An OLDER MAN and a 
           YOUNGER WOMAN SCREAM.  Caught in adultery, they clutch the 
           sheets to their naked bodies.

                                 YALIE
                        Sorry!

           The woman continues to SCREAM.

                                 JOE
                        Oh get over yourself, lady.  I've 
                        seen better.

           EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - SAME

           GUNSHOTS echo across Fifth Avenue.  LIGHTS TURN ON all over 
           the hotel.

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL HALLWAY - SAME

           Yalie and Joe flee the hotel room and sprint down the hall.

                                 YALIE
                        Stairs!  This way.

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Yalie and Joe burst into the stairwell.  Below them, a SWAT 
           TEAM CREW is rushing up the steps.

           Behind them, Moses is loping down the hallway, SLAMMING A 
           FRESH CLIP IN HIS GUN.

           Joe and Yalie look at each other.

                                 JOE/YALIE
                        Up.

           They spring up the stairs, Yalie taking them three at a time.

           Below them, we hear a SHIT STORM OF BULLETS as Moses collides 
           with the entire SWAT TEAM crew.

           Yalie and Joe pause to listen.

                                 YALIE
                        Christ almighty.

                        Not our problem.  Keep moving.
           INT. PLAZA HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Joe and Yalie burst from the stairway.  Yalie reads the label 
           on the stairway door - "16."

                                 YALIE

                        We're back on the 16th floor.

           Joe loosens his tie, struggling to catch his breath.

           A SWAT PATROLMAN, sweeping the room with his gun sights, 
           crosses the kitchen and exits.

           Joe and Yalie pop out of an alcove and cross through the 
           banquet kitchen.

           And there, at last, is the service elevator.

           INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR BAY - SAME

           Joe ceremoniously hits the elevator button.  Joe and Yalie 
           ditch their red Bell Hop hats and jackets.  They are both 
           wide eyed and gasping for breath.

                                 YALIE
                        How we doing?

                        Pretty good, all things considered.

           The elevator doors part to reveal Annabelle's big-ass Magnum 
           aiming POINT BLANK AT JOE'S HEAD.

                                 YALIE
                        You set me up?  You played me!

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Why do you think I called you the 
                        fiddle?

           Yalie blanches.  He looks down at his feet, defeated.

                                 ANNABELLE (CONT'D)
                        Step aside.

           Yalie swallows hard, then sets his teeth with determination.  
           He pulls Hakeem's Glock from his blazer pocket and levels it 
           at Annabelle's right eye.

                                 YALIE
                        No.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Your boss is a monster.

                                 YALIE
                        He's a good monster.  He saves 
                        people's jobs.  He makes companies 
                        run right.

           From around the corner, Eddie arrives, gun drawn.

                                 EDDIE
                        Annabelle, put the gun down.

                                 JOE
                        Thank God.

                                 EDDIE
                        He's mine.

           Joe is now flanked on both sides.  Yalie positions his body 
           to shield Joe from Eddie while keeping his gun trained on 
           Annabelle.  Mexican standoff.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Everybody in New York wants to kill 
                        me today!

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Daddy, how did you find me?

                        This is my hit.

           Eddie grips his gun with both hands, steadying his shot.

                                 EDDIE
                        No sweetheart.  I can't let you do 
                        this.  You've changed me, 
                        Annabelle.  I'm closing shop.  As 
                        of today, Glick Enterprises is in 
                        the industrial supply parts

                        this, Annabelle?

                             (gesturing with her gun)
                        That's my dad.  And Barry Glick is 
                        my uncle.

                        This is the man who gambled away

                        Jesus, the whole family is bat

                        Not helpful, Joe.

                        It's a point of fact, Yalie.

           Annabelle tightens her trigger finger.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        I'm doing it, Daddy.

                        He deserves it.  He's just some fat

                        Everybody shut the fuck up!

           For once, everybody listens to Yalie.

                        Barry Glick is arrested!  He's 
                        going to prison!  Joe knocked him 
                        out cold and the SWAT team's on 
                        this building like ants at a

                        What does that do to your hit?  
                        Where's the money go?

                                 EDDIE
                        It's in escrow with me.

                                 JOE
                        Escrow?

                                 EDDIE
                        $500,000.  If the hit comes 
                        through, I pay it out.  If it 
                        doesn't, the money reverts to 
                        Barry.  Standard operating 
                        procedure.

                        That money is evidence of a 
                        criminal conspiracy - you want to 
                        help your brother in court, you're 
                        not paying that money to anybody, 
                        understood?

           Eddie and Annabelle, fingers on triggers, listen, 
           considering.

                        That $500,000 is a family gift from 
                        Barry to his niece Annabelle to pay 
                        for her college tuition and move 
                        her out of the Bronx.  Eddie, when 
                        Barry goes to court you're going to 
                        be under investigation.  You need 
                        to get in the industrial supply 
                        parts business pretty damn quick.  
                        That means Gambler's Anonymous,

                                 EDDIE
                        Yes.

                                 YALIE
                        You want your first client?  I know 
                        a good plumber just starting out.  
                        He's going to need a direct 
                        distributor.  It gives you a paper 
                        trail.  We clear?

                                 EDDIE
                        Understood.

           Annabelle watches the newly assertive Yalie, her lip 
           trembling just a little.

                                 YALIE
                        Then everybody's straight.  Eddie, 
                        put your gun down.

           Eddie does.

           bruised.  Joe and Yalie smooth out the wrinkles in their 
           Brooks Brothers suits and tighten their ties.

                                 YALIE
                        So is this the craziest deal you 
                        guys have ever done?

           Joe and Ari shake their heads immediately.

                                 JOE/ARI
                             (unison)
                        No.  The Matterhorn deal.

           Joe and Ari are dead silent for a moment, each one shuddering 
           as they remember the Matterhorn deal.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. PLAZA HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           In dapper suits, the trio crosses the crowded floor of the 
           lobby.  POLICE, SWAT TEAM, MEDICS, JOURNALISTS, and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS, all jostle their way past.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Joe claps a hand on Yalie's shoulder.

                                 JOE
                        You did good, kid.

                                 YALIE
                        Thanks, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        No, listen to me.

                                 YALIE
                        Yeah.

                                 JOE
                        There are four kinds of people in 
                        this world, Jackson.  Pussies, 
                        wimps, sissies...and hitters.  
                        You're a hitter now, Jackson.  
                        You're a hitter.

           Yalie straightens his rumpled hair and adjusts a cuff link.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - FIRST LIGHT

           The brilliant light of dawn fills the world with a rising 
           hope.  Sunlight fills the avenues, the restaurants, and the 
           conference rooms where hitters make their deals.

           Joe, Ari, and Yalie strut down the sidewalk.  Three hitters 
           in business suits on their way to their next score.

           Joe WHISTLES LOUDLY and a cabbie SLAMS ON HIS BRAKES.

           The trio piles into the cab.  And across Manhattan lights 
           turn green.  The cab merges east into traffic, heading into 
           the rising sun.

                                 THE END
