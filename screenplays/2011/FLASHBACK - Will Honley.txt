          Verve
           FADE IN:

           Darkness. Then a hint of light. Faint at first.  Growing 
           brighter and brighter, almost blinding as we go into --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A BLAZING FLUORESCENT BULB shines from the ceiling, its 
           piercing light bouncing around the pristine white walls.

           The cramped room is silent, save for the incessant mechanical 
           whir of a CEILING FAN.

           No ornamentation.  No decorations.

           A bed.  A night table.  Medical equipment.

           Lying in the bed is A MAN.  Late 30s. Thin but muscular. 
           White hospital gown.  Hair closely shaved.  Beard overgrown.

           This is CALE ISAACS.

           Gradually, his eyes flutter open, blinking against the 
           blinding light.

           Cale lets out a soft sigh.  Looks around the windowless room.  
           Confused.  Disoriented.

                                 CALE
                        Hello?

           Silence.

           Slowly, Cale sits up.  Groans in pain. 

           He goes rigid.  Something’s not right.

           Shakily, he runs a hand over his head, shocked by his closely-
           cropped hair.

           Coming around the top of his head, Cale’s hand goes still.  
           His eyes widen.  Startled.

           Gently, he rubs his fingertips up and down the back of his 
           head, tracing the STITCHES over the FRESH GASH that runs down 
           to the nape of his neck.

           His breathing quickens, suddenly worried.

           Cale takes a moment.  Tries to collect himself.

           He sees two doors -- one closed, one open.
           The open door leads into a small bathroom.  The lights off.

           Cale calls out to the closed door --

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?!

           No response.  The only sound the dull, persistent humming of 
           the ceiling fan.

           Cale pivots.  Dangles his legs over the side of the bed.  
           Pushes himself up.

           Grunting, he carefully lowers himself to the floor.

           Cale’s legs wobble.  He grips the bed.  Steadies himself.

           Shakily, he starts towards the door, but stops as --

           An IV tube jerks his arm back.  It’s connected to a bag 
           hanging from a metal stand beside the bed.

           Cale grips the stand, using it for balance as he shuffles 
           over to the closed door.

           His fingers fumble with the door knob.  Locked.

           He pounds on the door.  Waits for a response.  Nothing.

           Glancing up, he sees a SMALL CAMERA mounted in the corner 
           above the door.  Its red power light glowing dimly.

           Cale waves his arms, shouting into the camera --

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Can anyone hear me?

           He continues waving his arms, growing more frantic until --

           His body sags, legs giving out underneath him.

           The room begins to spin.

           Cale gropes for the IV stand.  Catches himself from falling.

           He drags himself back over to the bed.  Climbs into it with a 
           groan.  Eyelids drooping.

           Cale takes one last look at the locked door before his eyes 
           flutter closed.  Black.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale wakes up to find a tray of food on the night table.  
           Congealed.  Unidentifiable.

           He sets the tray on his lap.  Digs up a chunk with his 
           plastic fork.  Takes a bite and immediately spits it out.

           Gagging, Cale grips the IV stand and staggers into the

           BATHROOM

           Where he turns the water on and rinses out his mouth.

           Like the main room, the bathroom is devoid of character.

           A sink.  A mirror.  A toilet.  A shower.  Nothing more.

           Cale turns the water off.  He tilts his head around.  Looks 
           at the gash along the back of his head.  Red.  Jagged.

           Timidly, he reaches back to touch it.  When suddenly he hears 
           the lock on the main door click.  Cale shuffles back into the

           MAIN ROOM

           As the door opens and A MAN enters.

           He’s in his 50s. Partially balding.  Distinguished.   
           Dressed conservatively with a STETHOSCOPE draped around his 
           shoulders.  This is ALAN MATHESON.

           The two men stare at each other several moments before --

                                 CALE
                        You a doctor?

                                 MATHESON
                        I sure hope so, otherwise I spent a 
                        long time in school for nothing.  
                        You shouldn’t be walking around.

                                 CALE
                        I’m fine.  What is this place?

                                 MATHESON
                        You’re gonna want to sit.

                                 CALE
                        I said I’m --

           Suddenly, his legs start to give out again.
           Gripping the IV stand, Cale pulls himself over to the bed.  
           He sits on the edge as Matheson approaches.

                                 MATHESON
                        Let me take a look.

           Cale leans away from him.  Uneasy.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        I have to check your stitches.

           Cale lowers his head, letting Matheson examine the stitches.

                                 CALE
                        What am I doing here?

                                 MATHESON
                        Lie back, I need to check the 
                        others.

                                 CALE
                        The other --

           Matheson leans Cale back.  Cale watches him closely --

           As Matheson lifts up Cale’s gown, revealing another STITCHED 
           LACERATION along his stomach.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t even feel that.

                                 MATHESON
                        You’re on pretty good pain meds.

           Matheson places the bell of the stethoscope on Cale’s chest.  
           Listens to the rhythmic thud of his heartbeat.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Sit up for me.  Slowly.

           Cale sits up stiffly.  Matheson slides the bell of the 
           stethoscope around his back, listening to his lungs.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Take a deep breath.
                             (beat)
                        Again.

           Matheson lays the stethoscope back around his shoulders.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Any numbness, blurred vision?
                                 CALE
                        No.  Why am I here?

                                 MATHESON
                        How are your motor skills?  You’re 
                        able to eat okay?

                                 CALE
                        I would be if the food didn’t taste 
                        like shit. Why am I --

                                 MATHESON
                        Any ringing in your ears?  Trouble 
                        with your hearing?

                                 CALE
                        You having trouble with yours?

                                 MATHESON
                        What about your memory?

           Cale backs down.  Visibly shaken.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You sustained quite a bit of head 
                        trauma.  It’s understandable that 
                        there’d be some residual effects.

                                 CALE
                        Look, I only want to know --

                                 MATHESON
                        This is a medical facility outside 
                        of Houston.  You’ve been here, 
                        unconscious, for over two weeks.

                                 CALE
                        What happened to me?

                                 MATHESON
                        You don’t remember?

           Cale shakes his head.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        What’s the last thing you do 
                        remember?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t -- I don’t know.

           Matheson pulls out a small notepad and pen.
                                 MATHESON
                        Well, let’s start with the easy 
                        ones.  Can you tell me your name?

           Cale shakes his head.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Really?

           Cale nods.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Birthday?  Where you were born?

                                 CALE
                        No.

                                 MATHESON
                        Family?  Friends?  Job?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t know.

                                 MATHESON
                        Any chance you can you tell me the 
                        days of the week?

                                 CALE
                        Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday --

                                 MATHESON
                        Okay.  What about states?

                                 CALE
                             (like a shot)
                        Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, 
                        California, Colorado --

                                 MATHESON
                        Excellent.

                                 CALE
                        Knowing who I am, how I got here, 
                        that would be excellent.  Naming a 
                        couple states doesn’t mean shit to 
                        me right now.

                                 MATHESON
                        Fair enough.

           Matheson puts the pen and paper away.
                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid there’s only so much     
                        I can tell you.  In cases such as 
                        this, it’s best to let the mind 
                        piece itself back together.  Too 
                        much information too quickly --

                                 CALE
                        Who am I?  Can you tell me that?

                                 MATHESON
                        Your name is Callum Matthew Isaacs.  
                        You were born in Moberly, Missouri, 
                        February 5th, 1979.  Your parents 
                        were Michael and Kathleen.  Does 
                        any of this sound familiar?

                                 CALE
                        No.  Why am I here?

                                 MATHESON
                        You really don’t remember anything, 
                        do you?

           Cale eyes him, waits for an answer.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You were in an accident.

                                 CALE
                        What kind of accident?

                                 MATHESON
                        That’s a complicated question to 
                        answer, and would only lead to 
                        further questions.  I think we’ve 
                        done enough for today.  You should 
                        rest some more.  I’ll be back to 
                        check on you later.

           He starts for the door.  Cale follows, dragging the IV stand.

                                 CALE
                        What happened to me?  What sorta
                        accident was I in?

           Matheson doesn’t respond.  Opens the door to leave.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Tell me how I --

           His legs start to buckle.  Matheson quickly reaches out, 
           catching Cale before he collapses to the floor.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The fan blades whir loudly in the darkness.  A sliver of 
           light sneaks underneath the main door.

           Cale’s eyes open.  He sits up with a groan.  Spots the SMALL 
           RED LIGHT shining from the camera over the door.

           He slides out of bed.  Grips the IV stand.  Heads into the

           BATHROOM

           And flicks the light on.

           He moves over to the toilet.  Leans his elbow against the 
           wall, sighing in relief as he pees.

           Cale flushes.  Turns the light off.  He starts back into the

           MAIN ROOM

           And shuffles slowly towards the bed.

           Then he stops.  His hand shakes, rattling the IV stand --

           THEN SUDDENLY A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT FLASHES FROM SOMEWHERE.  
           CALE’S BREATH CATCHES IN HIS THROAT AS --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The dull sound of the toilet flushing.  Cale stands over it, 
           leaning against the wall for support.

           EXACTLY AS HE WAS MOMENTS AGO.

           Cale looks around.  Disoriented.  Confused --

           As the toilet shuts off.  Silence.

                                 CALE
                        What the --

           He’s cut off as there’s another FLASH OF LIGHT and --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale awakens to two ORDERLIES pulling him up off the floor.  
           Blood flows from a fresh wound on his forehead.

           The Orderlies lay Cale on the bed as his eyes flutter closed.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale jerks awake to find Matheson replacing his IV bag.

                                 MATHESON
                        Easy.  You were dreaming.

           Cale runs a hand over his bandaged forehead.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You took a bit of a tumble last 
                        night.  Gotta be more careful,   
                        you coulda torn your stitches.

           Cale sits up.  Leans back against the wall.

                                 CALE
                        Something happened.

                                 MATHESON
                        The meds you’re on can affect your 
                        equilibrium.  You’re lucky we had 
                        someone monitoring your room or 
                        else you mighta spent all night --

                                 CALE
                        I passed out?

                                 MATHESON
                        On your way back from the bathroom, 
                        yeah.  You weren’t unconscious for 
                        more than a few seconds.  Nothing 
                        to worry about.  Grab yourself a 
                        shower, then we’ll get started.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Steam rises from the shower as Cale eyes himself in the 
           mirror.  He runs a hand through his shaggy beard.  Frowns.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale, freshly showered, emerges from the bathroom.  Matheson 
           is seated on a chair at the foot of the bed.

                                 CALE
                        Any chance I could get a razor?  
                        This itches like hell.
                                 MATHESON
                        I’ll have the orderlies bring you 
                        one when we’re done.  Take a seat.

           Cale slides down onto the bed.

                                 CALE
                        You never told me your name.

                                 MATHESON
                        Matheson.  Dr. Alan Matheson.

           He extends his hand.  Cale takes it.

                                 CALE
                        What kinda doctor are you?

                                 MATHESON
                        A good one.  Let’s get started.

           He reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a stack of flashcards.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You remember your name?

                                 CALE
                        Callum Matthew Isaacs.

           Matheson shows him the first flashcard.  5 + 3.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        You’re kidding me, right?

                                 MATHESON
                        There’s only a handful of areas in 
                        the brain associated with memory.  
                        First step is to figure out which 
                        one’s been affected.

                                 CALE
                        Tell me about the accident.

                                 MATHESON
                        This first.

                                 CALE
                        I’m not doing anything until I know 
                        how I got here.

           Matheson sits there, unmoving, holding up the flash card.  
           The two men lock eyes.  Neither backing down until --
                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ, eight, okay?

           Matheson holds up another flash card.  22 - 6.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Sixteen.

           Matheson flips to the next card.  5 x 9.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Forty-five.  What’s the point in 
                        determining whether or not I can do 
                        second grade math?

                                 MATHESON
                        This will go a lot faster if you 
                        don’t ask questions.

                                 CALE
                        It’s not gonna go at all unless you 
                        answer them.

           Matheson sighs.  Sets the cards aside.

                                 MATHESON
                        In answering these equations, 
                        you’re using a number of areas in 
                        your brain.  The computation is 
                        done in the frontal lobe.  You’re 
                        processing the information you see 
                        on the cards, which, to a certain 
                        extent, involves the parietal lobe.  
                        And you’re saying the answers 
                        aloud, which means you’re accessing 
                        the temporal lobe -- all areas of 
                        the brain also associated in some 
                        ways with memory, and they all seem 
                        to be functioning perfectly.  Also 
                        you remembered your name so your 
                        hippocampus seems unaffected as 
                        well.  Now can we continue?

           Cale nods.  Matheson turns over the next flash card.  It’s a 
           simple drawing of a father pushing his son on a park swing.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        What do you see here?

                                 CALE
                        It’s a dad with his kid, they’re 
                        playing, having fun.
                                 MATHESON
                        Last one.

           He flips to the final card.  It shows a young boy looking 
           down at a school assignment marked with a giant F in red ink.

                                 CALE
                        The kid’s disappointed, sad.

                                 MATHESON
                        No, he’s not.

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, it’s probably just a practice 
                        test or something.

                                 MATHESON
                        None of the people in these two 
                        pictures are displaying any kind of 
                        emotion.  See, faces totally blank.  
                        You took the situations and filled 
                        in emotion based on your own 
                        memory, so the problem’s not in 
                        your thalamus or the amygdala.

                                 CALE
                        So where is the problem?

                                 MATHESON
                        I have no idea.

           Matheson slides the cards back into his pocket.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Your condition is abnormal.

                                 CALE
                        How’s that?

                                 MATHESON
                        Amnesia is rare.  Incredibly rare.  
                        Oftentimes physically or 
                        emotionally traumatizing events can 
                        cause memory gaps.  But full-blown 
                        amnesia, remembering nothing about 
                        one’s past, it’s almost unheard of.

           Matheson scoots his chair closer.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Now I don’t want to presume 
                        anything, but hypothetically if you 
                        were exaggerating your condition --
                                 CALE
                        Exaggerating?

                                 MATHESON
                        Maybe there’s something you’d 
                        rather not talk about.  If that’s 
                        the case, I understand.  I’m sure 
                        you’ve been through a lot, more 
                        than I can imagine, but if there’s 
                        something that maybe you’re afraid 
                        to say, it’s okay, you can tell me.

                                 CALE
                        Doc, I don’t have the first damn 
                        clue what I’ve been through.  You 
                        say it’s a lot, I’ll take your word 
                        for it.  And if there’s anything 
                        else you’d like to share, I would 
                        absolutely love to hear it, ‘cause 
                        I’ve got zero idea who I am, how I 
                        got here, or what may or may not be 
                        waiting for me outside these walls.  
                        As far as I’m aware my life started 
                        yesterday.  You know everything I 
                        know because you told me everything 
                        I know, so the only person in this 
                        room with any secrets is you.

           Matheson smiles at this.  He reaches into his pocket and 
           pulls out a SMALL PATCH.  Hands it to Cale.

           It’s singed.  Stitching torn from something.  The patch shows 
           a sleek, high-tech rocket blasting up through the clouds.  
           And in simple block letters is a single word -- HELIOS.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is this?

                                 MATHESON
                        It’s a patch from your flightsuit.

                                 CALE
                        Flightsuit? My flightsuit?

                                 MATHESON
                        You sure you’re up for this?

           Cale nods.
                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        For the last twelve years NASA’s 
                        had a group of researchers focused 
                        on designing and building the first 
                        craft capable of accelerating to 
                        and sustaining travel at the speed 
                        of light. They called it The Helios
                        Project. Roughly eight months ago 
                        they completed their prototype.

                                 CALE
                        Prototype?  You mean a ship?

                                 MATHESON
                        They built a craft capable of 
                        traveling at one hundred and eighty-
                        six thousand miles per second, a 
                        craft that within a decade would 
                        have allowed for nearly 
                        instantaneous transportation 
                        anywhere in the world, anywhere in 
                        the universe, thereby changing the 
                        course of human history.  If you 
                        want to call it a ship, you 
                        wouldn’t be wrong, but that word 
                        doesn’t quite cover it.

                                 CALE
                        That’s impossible.  Nothing can go 
                        the speed of light.  Can’t be done.

                                 MATHESON
                        Apparently you thought differently 
                        when you signed up to be the pilot.

           Cale takes a deep breath.  Tries to process this.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You crashed in a corn field outside 
                        of Arnett, Oklahoma.

           Cale goes rigid.  From somewhere comes the SOUND OF AN ALARM.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        We only know two things for sure.  
                        One is that at precisely two-oh-
                        eight and sixteen seconds you 
                        performed a manual override of the 
                        computer’s main program.

           The sound of the alarm grows louder.  Drowning out Matheson.
                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        The second thing we know is that 
                        exactly one minute and twelve 
                        seconds later --

           Cale begins to shake as the ALARM becomes deafening.  And 
           under the piercing din -- THE SOUND SCREAMING --

           Matheson grabs Cale by the shoulders.  Shakes him.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Cale.  Cale!

           The chaotic noise continues inside of Cale’s mind until --

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        CALE!

           Suddenly Cale snaps into focus.  Silence.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.

                                 MATHESON
                        I think that’s enough for today.

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.

           Matheson goes to grab the patch.  But Cale clutches it tight.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           Matheson nods.  He exits, leaving Cale sitting on the bed, 
           staring at the burned patch.  Mind racing.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           The faucet runs as Cale stands at the sink, lathering up his 
           face.  A fresh razorblade rests nearby.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Steam rises as Cale, freshly shaven, showers.  He leans back, 
           rinsing the shampoo from his hair.  When suddenly --

           THERE’S A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT AND --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Water streams from the faucet.  Cale, disoriented, leans 
           against the sink to hold himself up.

           He takes a deep breath.  Stares at himself in the mirror --

           HIS SCRAGGLY BEARD IS HALFWAY SHAVED OFF.

           Shakily, Cale sets the razor down.  Studies himself in the 
           mirror.  Confused.  Suddenly there’s ANOTHER FLASH and --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Cale’s eyes flutter open.  He’s lying on the floor of the 
           shower, water cascading down onto his face.

           He groans.  Sees blood flowing from a torn stitch in his 
           abdomen.  Red water swirls down the drain as --

                                 CALE (V.O.)
                        Something’s happening to me.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale lies in bed as Matheson re-stitches his stomach wound.

                                 MATHESON
                        You’ve been blacking out?

                                 CALE
                        A couple times now.

                                 MATHESON
                        What’s it like, just before, do you 
                        feel light-headed?  Dizzy?

                                 CALE
                        No.

                                 MATHESON
                        Headache when you wake up?

                                 CALE
                        No.

                                 MATHESON
                        So that’s it, you blackout?  
                        Nothing more to it?
           Cale hesitates.  Watches Matheson work.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Cale?

                                 CALE
                        No.  Nothing more.
                             (beat)
                        When can I talk to my family?

                                 MATHESON
                        Your family?

                                 CALE
                        They know I’m here, right?       
                        I’m allowed to talk to them?

           Matheson looks away.  Hesitates before --

                                 MATHESON
                        I’ll see what I can do.

                                 CALE
                        What?  What is it?

                                 MATHESON
                        Nothing that --

                                 CALE
                        Why can’t I talk to them?

                                 MATHESON
                        Because there’s no one to talk to.

           He pauses.  Lets this sink in.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Your parents are both gone, no 
                        brothers, no sisters, you have no 
                        wife, children, aunts, uncles, 
                        cousins.  Nobody.  Your lack of 
                        personal ties is why you were 
                        chosen in the first place.

                                 CALE
                        Are you sure?

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry.

           He lays a comforting hand on Cale’s shoulder.  Then carefully 
           sets the last stitch in Cale’s stomach.
                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Anything else I can do for you?

           Cale shakes his head.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Hit the call button if you need me.  
                        I’ll be around.

           Matheson starts to leave before --

                                 CALE
                        I remember things.

                                 MATHESON
                        What’s that?

                                 CALE
                        When I black out I remember things.

                                 MATHESON
                        From the ship?

                                 CALE
                        No.  Mundane stuff, stuff I just 
                        finished doing.  But it’s strong, 
                        the memory.  It seems real.  Like 
                        I’m reliving it.

                                 MATHESON
                        What you’re referring to is a 
                        condition known as hyper memory 
                        recall.  It’s in part what 
                        sufferers of PTSD experience.

                                 CALE
                        Post-traumatic stress disorder?

                                 MATHESON
                        That’s right.  The brain’s complex.  
                        It can call up memories, make them 
                        seem as real as this right here.

                                 CALE
                        What happened to me on that ship?

                                 MATHESON
                        Only you can answer that.

                                 CALE
                        You said yesterday that you guys 
                        knew two things for sure.  What’s 
                        the second one?
                                 MATHESON
                        The answer to what you did aboard 
                        that ship is of supreme interest to 
                        a lot of people, not just you.

                                 CALE
                        I bet.  What’s the second thing?

                                 MATHESON
                        How badly do you want to know what 
                        happened to you?

           Cale doesn’t answer.  Waits for him to continue.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        There may be a way to help 
                        accelerate the recovery of your 
                        memory.  In cases of post-traumatic 
                        amnesia such as yours there’s been 
                        a lot of success recovering 
                        memories by way of electronic 
                        neural stimulation.

                                 CALE
                        Electronic neural stimulation?  
                        Sounds like shock therapy.

                                 MATHESON
                        Yeah.

                                 CALE
                        Exactly how is this different from 
                        shock therapy?

                                 MATHESON
                        Same thing, electronic neural 
                        stimulation just sounds better.

                                 CALE
                        Absolutely not.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, I’m your doctor, I’m here for 
                        you, to make you better, that’s 
                        all.  But I’m not totally in 
                        charge.  There are people in this 
                        building who want to know what 
                        happened on that ship and they’ll 
                        do anything they can to find out.

                                 CALE
                        It crashed, that’s what happened.
                                 MATHESON
                        Yes, but before the ship crashed it 
                        accelerated to the speed of light.

           Cale stares up at him.  Shocked.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        That’s the second thing.  You did 
                        something to the system aboard the 
                        ship, tweaked some parameter, 
                        changed some algorithm, we don’t 
                        know.  But a minute after you did, 
                        the ship accelerated to the speed 
                        of light and stayed there for one 
                        one-hundredth of a second.

           Matheson pauses.  Lets the weight of this hang in the air.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        They need to know what you did, 
                        they can’t wait, and as far as 
                        they’re concerned this treatment is 
                        their best chance.  I’ll be there 
                        with you, I’ll make sure that --

                                 CALE
                        Get out.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, I only want to help you.

                                 CALE
                        I don’t give a shit about the ship.  
                        There’s nothing I need to know 
                        badly enough to justify zapping my 
                        brains out jacking up my head even 
                        worse.  Tell them I said no.

                                 MATHESON
                        I will.  Let me know if you need 
                        anything else.

           He gives Cale’s leg a friendly pat then walks out.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           The burned patch sits above the sink below the mirror.  Cale 
           stares at it intensely.  Then his eyes drift to the mirror --

           And back to the shower behind him.  

           Cale lifts up his gown.  Examines his stitches.
           He shakes his head.  Mystified.

                                 CALE
                        Whatever.

           He goes to grab the patch off the sink --

           When something catches his attention.  He stops.  Stares at --

           The ring finger of his left hand.  There’s a faint tan line.  
           Barely visible --

           But it’s clearly the outline of a wedding band.

           Cale stands frozen.  Processing this as --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale emerges from the bathroom, leaning against the IV stand 
           for support as he strides to the bed.

           He grabs the call button.  Pushes it repeatedly.  Anger 
           growing on his face.

           After several moments, the door opens and Matheson enters.

                                 MATHESON
                        Pushing it once would’ve sufficed.

                                 CALE
                        Why’d you lie to me?

                                 MATHESON
                        I’ve never told you anything but 
                        the truth.

                                 CALE
                             (holding up ring finger)
                        You said I had no family.  I was 
                        married.

                                 MATHESON
                        You were, yes.  Not anymore.

                                 CALE
                        What happened?

                                 MATHESON
                        I don’t know, I’ve only seen 
                        snippets of your personal file.  
                        But as far as I know you haven’t 
                        been married for almost a year. 
                                 CALE
                        Why haven’t you read my file?

                                 MATHESON
                        It wasn’t given to me.  They seem 
                        to prefer you and I maintain a 
                        certain level of detachment.

           Cale looks to the camera over the door.

                                 CALE
                        Can’t they hear you?

                                 MATHESON
                        There’s no audio.  Cale, you and I 
                        are in this together.

                                 CALE
                        How do you figure that?

                                 MATHESON
                        I’ve worked as a NASA doctor for 
                        twenty-five years.  My loyalty to 
                        this program is unquestioned.  They 
                        brought me in here to get you well 
                        enough so they could do the neural 
                        stimulation treatment.  That’s all 
                        they care about.  Not me though.

                                 CALE
                        Like you give a shit about me.

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m a doctor, you’re my patient,   
                        it’s that simple.  If you do this 
                        willingly, I can be there and I’ll 
                        help you however I can.  But if you 
                        force their hand, three orderlies 
                        will crash through that door and 
                        haul you out of here kicking and 
                        screaming.  I don’t want that, and 
                        I’m certain you don’t either.

                                 CALE
                        What can you tell me about my past?

                                 MATHESON
                        Not much that I haven’t already.   
                        I know you were in the Air Force, 
                        that you joined NASA ten years ago.

                                 CALE
                        No, my life.  Who I was.
                                 MATHESON
                        I don’t know.

                                 CALE
                        I had a wife.

                                 MATHESON
                        I know nothing about your wife 
                        other than she’s not your wife 
                        anymore.  But this treatment, it 
                        does work.  Yeah, it’s the best 
                        chance they have to learn what 
                        happened aboard the ship, but it’s 
                        also the best chance you have to 
                        get your life back.  Don’t do it 
                        for them, do it for you.  

           Cale looks down.  Studies the tan line on his ring finger.

                                 CALE
                        When can we start?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Matheson sets up a wheelchair beside Cale’s bed.

                                 CALE
                        I can walk.

                                 MATHESON
                        It’s on the other side of the 
                        facility.  You’ll thank me.

           Cale slides out of bed and down onto the wheelchair.

           Matheson wheels him to the door.  Opens it.  The two of them 
           step into a

           NARROW HALLWAY

           With dim lighting and dull gray walls.

           Matheson guides Cale down the shadowy corridor.  The steady 
           clacking of his shoes reverberates through the empty halls. 

           They move along in silence.  Cale nervously grips the 
           armrests of the wheelchair.

           Matheson wheels him around one corner.  Then another.

                                 CALE
                        We’re underground, aren’t we?
                                 MATHESON
                        That’s right.  Three levels.

                                 CALE
                        What kinda place is this?

                                 MATHESON
                        Whatever it is upstairs that’s not 
                        what it is down here.  This is 
                        where the government keeps things 
                        they’d prefer remain secret.

                                 CALE
                        Why do I fall into that category?

                                 MATHESON
                        The testing of a light-speed 
                        spacecraft was controversial.      
                        A craft traveling that fast carries 
                        a lot of energy with it.  Some 
                        considered it to be too dangerous.

                                 CALE
                        So no one knew?

                                 MATHESON
                        Only a select group.  As far as the 
                        rest of the world is concerned, you 
                        tragically crashed on your way to 
                        the moon.

           They turn another corner, stopping at a large steel door.

           Matheson slides a key card along a panel beside the door.    
           A green light flashes.  The door buzzes.

           Pushing the door open, Matheson wheels Cale into the

           MACHINE ROOM

           Where a TECHNICIAN, 40s, is running last-minute checks on a  
           MASSIVE DEVICE.

           A complex web of electrical cables snakes down from the 
           ceiling, coil around A SIMPLE WOODEN CHAIR, then weave their 
           way to a CONTROL PANEL.

           Cale nervously eyes the setup as the Technician greets him.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        You must be Mr. Isaacs.

           Cale nods.  Doesn’t take his eyes off the chair.
                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        It looks much more intimidating 
                        than it really is.

                                 CALE
                        Sure as hell hope so.

           Matheson helps Cale out of the wheelchair and eases him down 
           into the wooden seat.  Cale shifts uncomfortably.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Sorry about that, I’m afraid I’m 
                        not much of a woodworker.  And I 
                        couldn’t use any padding.

                                 CALE
                        It’s fine.

           The Technician smiles politely then moves over to the control 
           panel, checking the dials and gauges.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        If you wouldn’t mind.

           He holds two leads out to Matheson, who takes them and 
           secures them to either side of Cale’s head.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        I assume the good doctor explained 
                        what we’ll be doing today.

                                 CALE
                        He told me enough.

           Matheson places a reassuring hand on Cale’s shoulder.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        And can you strap him in?

           Matheson straps Cale’s arms and legs to the chair.

                                 MATHESON
                        Those aren’t too tight, are they?

           Cale shakes his head as the Technician grabs a mouth guard 
           from the control panel.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Do you have any questions?

                                 CALE
                        How bad’s it gonna be?
                                 TECHNICIAN
                        The shock will be relatively mild.  
                        It may be painful, I’m sorry to 
                        say, but it’s not strictly speaking 
                        dangerous.  Anything else?

                                 CALE
                        Why couldn’t you use padding?

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Flammability.  Didn’t want the 
                        chair catching fire.

                                 CALE
                        Sorry I asked.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        You’ll be fine.

           He slides a mouth guard between Cale’s teeth.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        So you don’t bite off your tongue.

           He offers another polite smile.  Steps to the control panel.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Everyone ready?

           Cale nods, turns to Matheson who gives him a reassuring look.

           The dull electric buzz grows louder.  And louder.

           Tense moments pass.  Cale slowly breathes in and out.  
           Steeling himself up.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, in three, two, one...

           He hits a switch on the panel.  The overhead lights flicker.

           Cale tenses.  Bracing for the shock --

           THEN A MASSIVE SURGE OF ENERGY SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY.

           Cale’s back arches, convulsing.  The pulsating electric hum 
           fills the room.  Crescendos as --

           IMAGES FLASH IN CALE’S MIND -- A WOMAN -- AN EMPTY ROOM --

           THEN THERE’S A SUDDEN BURST OF BLINDING LIGHT AND --
           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Silence.  Cale jolts awake.  Sits up to find himself --

           In a plush bedroom.  Nicely decorated.  King-size bed.

           Cale takes in a deep breath.  Confused.  He effortlessly 
           pushes the sheets off his body.  No pain.

           He lifts up his white undershirt.  No stomach wound.

           Cale slides out of bed.  He steps over to the mirror on the 
           bureau and is shocked to see --

           His hair is longer.  Cale ruffles it into place.  
           Instinctively parting it.  Looking all-American.

           Cale eyes himself in the mirror.  Tries to process all this.

           INT. HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Cale edges down the hall, enjoying the feel of the carpet on 
           his bare feet.  He smiles as he steps into

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Which like the bedroom is impressive.  State-of-the art 
           electronics.  Expensive furniture.  Well-decorated.

           Cale stands in the doorway, taking it all in.

                                 CALE
                        Hello?

           No response.  He crosses the room.  Heads for the front door.

           EXT. HOUSE - DAY

           Cale emerges from inside the house to find himself --

           In the middle of a quiet suburban street.  The quiet clicking 
           of lawn sprinklers.  The sound of a mower in the distance.

           Cale stands on the porch.  Taking it all in.

           Across the street, a PUDGY NEIGHBOR waves as he heads into 
           his house.  Cale timidly waves back.  Overwhelmed.
           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cale strides back inside.  He takes a deep breath.  Spots a 
           desk nearby cluttered with framed photos of --

           Cale and a woman.  Dark-haired.  Subtly beautiful.

           He picks up one of the pictures.  Stares at the woman.  But 
           nothing registers.  He puts it down as he notices --

           A daily desk calendar.  THE DATE IS MARCH 2nd, 2017.

           Cale continues around the room to a shelf filled with DVDS.  
           He sifts through them until he finds one labeled --

           WEDDING VIDEO.

           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The television comes on as the wedding video begins.         
           A cheesy graphic pops up -- CALE AND JESSE FOREVER.

           Hand-held footage shows Cale putting on his tuxedo.

                                 CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                        You sure you’re ready for this?

                                 CALE
                        What are you doing?

                                 CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                        You wanted me to document.  I’m 
                        documenting.  So how do you feel?

                                 CALE
                        I feel pumped.  Let’s do this.

           Suddenly the video cuts to footage of JESSE, the woman from 
           the pictures, as ANOTHER WOMAN does her hair.

                                 JESSE
                        He said he’s pumped?

                                 CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 JESSE
                        What a dork.

           She smiles lovingly.  Looks directly into the camera.
                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Most romantic day of our lives and 
                        that’s the best you got?

                                 CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                        How do you feel, Jess?

                                 JESSE
                        I feel, um -- I’m pumped too.

           The tape cuts back to footage of Cale getting dressed.

                                 CAMERAMAN (V.O.)
                        When did you know?  That she was 
                        the one, when did you know?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t -- It’s cheesy.

                                 CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
                        It’s your wedding video, it’s 
                        supposed to be cheesy.

                                 CALE
                        The first time I saw her laugh.  
                        She does this thing, I don’t know, 
                        her laugh, it’s totally unself-
                        conscious.  She loses herself.  
                        Totally lets go.  When’s the last 
                        time you completely lost yourself?

           The tape cuts to footage of him and Jesse dancing at the 
           reception.  Cale whispers something in her ear and Jesse 
           bursts out laughing.  It’s adorable.  Infectious.

           In the living room, Cale stares at the footage, enraptured, 
           until suddenly from across the room --

                                 JESSE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Cale hops up from the floor.  Looks to the doorway to find 
           Jesse standing there in the flesh, arms crossed.

                                 CALE
                        I was, uh...

                                 JESSE
                        Feeling nostalgic?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.  I guess so.
           Fingers fumbling, he switches off the TV.  Eyes Jesse.   
           She’s slightly older and more dour than in the video.      
           Her upbeat energy seems to have evaporated.

                                 JESSE
                        At least you’re awake.  What time 
                        did you get in last night?

                                 CALE
                        Last night?

                                 JESSE
                        Last I checked it was past two and 
                        you still weren’t home.

                                 CALE
                        I don’t -- I don’t remember.

                                 JESSE
                        Right.

           She turns and walks out of the room.  Cale follows her into

           THE KITCHEN

           Where Jesse grabs a leftover container from the fridge.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let me interrupt what you’re 
                        doing.  Forgot my lunch this 
                        morning, just came to grab it.

           Cale stares at her.  Mind racing.  At a loss for what to say.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Why are you looking at me that way?

                                 CALE
                        What way’s that?

                                 JESSE
                        Like you’ve never seen me before.

                                 CALE
                        I didn’t mean to -- Sorry.

           Jesse takes a water bottle from the cabinet.  Fills it.

                                 JESSE
                        When are you gonna be home tonight?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t know.
                                 JESSE
                        Right.

           She starts towards the door before --

                                 CALE
                        Jes -- Jesse?

                                 JESSE
                        Yes?  Cale?  What’s wrong with you?

                                 CALE
                        I’m not -- It’s been a weird day.

                                 JESSE
                        I’ve gotta get back.  Got a dozen 
                        patients to see this afternoon.

                                 CALE
                        Maybe you could -- Can you --

                                 JESSE
                        Jesus, Cale, what is it?

                                 CALE
                        Maybe you could eat here.  Skip 
                        work.  We could spend some time 
                        together.  Talk about stuff.

                                 JESSE
                        What kinda stuff?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t -- I don’t know, whatever.

                                 JESSE
                        Whatever?  No, I don’t think I’ll 
                        stay here to discuss whatever.

                                 CALE
                        Did I do something or --

                                 JESSE
                        And you want me to skip work?  Me?

                                 CALE
                        Jesse, what did --

                                 JESSE
                        That takes some balls, Cale.  Who 
                        the hell do you think you are?
           She stares him down, then disappears out the door.  Cale 
           stands frozen.  Confused.  He starts after her.

                                 CALE
                        Jesse, wait --

           BUT THEN SUDDENLY THERE’S A BRILLIANT FLASH AND --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - DAY

           Cale awakens on the floor.  Matheson kneels over him.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale!  Wake up!

           Cale blinks.  Disoriented.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Cale, you with us?

           Cale nods groggily.  Starts to say something.  But then his 
           eyes flutter closed as he passes out.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale lies motionless on the bed, staring up at Matheson as he 
           shines a pen light into his eyes.

                                 MATHESON
                        You gave us a bit of a scare.

           Cale starts to sit up.  Matheson eases him back down.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Easy, easy.  You passed out as soon 
                        as we began the treatment, you were 
                        nonresponsive.  How do you feel?

                                 CALE
                        Got a pretty wicked headache, but 
                        other than that I’m fine.

                                 MATHESON
                        You’re not fine.  Cale, you were 
                        unconscious for more than ten 
                        minutes.  Your pulse was low, you 
                        were barely breathing.  I thought 
                        we’d lost you.

                                 CALE
                        Ten minutes?
                                 MATHESON
                        Did the electric pulse stir 
                        anything loose?  Did you remember 
                        anything?

                                 CALE
                        My wife.

                                 MATHESON
                        Really?

                                 CALE
                        Jesse.  That’s her name, right?

                                 MATHESON
                        It is.  What did you remember?

                                 CALE
                        She was mad at me.

                                 MATHESON
                        For what reason?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t know.  It wasn’t like she 
                        was mad about something, she was 
                        mad at me.  Frustrated.  Like it’d 
                        been going on for a while.

                                 MATHESON
                        See, your memories are still there, 
                        they’re just buried.

                                 CALE
                        She left me, didn’t she?

                                 MATHESON
                        Is that what you think?

                                 CALE
                        I did something wrong and she left 
                        me.  Is that what happened?

                                 MATHESON
                        I don’t know.  But if that’s what 
                        you think, what you feel, then 
                        you’re likely right.  Our instincts 
                        are correct most of the time.

                                 CALE
                        I want to talk to her.
                                 MATHESON
                        I’ll see what I can do, but given 
                        that she’s no longer your spouse 
                        there may be difficulty getting our 
                        friends upstairs to sign off.

                                 CALE
                        I’m talking about a phone call.

                                 MATHESON
                        I’ll see what I can do.  Do you 
                        need anything else?

           Cale shakes his head.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        This memory, was it like the others 
                        you’ve experienced during 
                        blackouts?  Was it hyper realistic?  
                        Did it feel like you were there?

                                 CALE
                        Nope.  Nothing special at all.

                                 MATHESON
                        Okay.  I’ll check in on you later.

           He starts towards the door before --

                                 CALE
                        Hey, Doc, what is today?

                                 MATHESON
                        Hmm?

                                 CALE
                        The date?  What is today?

                                 MATHESON
                        It’s November fifth.

                                 CALE
                        Twenty-seventeen?

                                 MATHESON
                        Yeah.  Why are you so interested in 
                        the date all of a sudden?

                                 CALE
                        No reason.  Just curious.

           Matheson nods, then leaves the room, locking the door.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits on the bed, mind turning.  After a moment, he 
           climbs down to the floor and rips the sheets off the bed.

           He balls up the sheets.  Tosses them in the corner.

           Cale then climbs back into the bed.  Lies down.

           He stares at the ceiling.  Watches the fan blades whir.  
           Closes his eyes.  But nothing happens.

                                 CALE
                        Come on, you can do it.

           He slams his eyes closed.  Face clinched in concentration.

           AND THERE’S SUDDENLY A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT AS --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits on the bed.  He looks around.  Smiles --

           As he sees the sheets are still on the bed.  Corners tucked 
           in neatly.  Pristine.

           THEN THERE’S ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale’s eyes snap open.  He’s lying on the stripped bed.  The 
           sheets still piled in the corner.  He sits up with a smile.

                                 CALE
                        Son of a bitch.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Water pours from the spout as the bathtub fills with water.  
           Cale sits on the toilet, watching the waterline climb.

           With the tub full, Cale turns off the water.

           He then lies down on the floor.  Takes a calming breath.  His 
           face strains in concentration as --

           THERE’S A QUICK FLASH OF LIGHT AND --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Cale’s body shudders as he finds himself back on the toilet, 
           exactly as he was moments earlier.  Water spills from the 
           spout as the tub fills with water.

           Cale stands.  Checks the waterline.  The tub is half full.

                                 CALE
                        Probably about three --

           He’s cut off as there’s another FLASH and --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Cale wakes up on the floor.  He looks to the full tub.

                                 CALE
                        About three minutes.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits on the edge of the bed as Matheson flashes a pen 
           light in his eyes.

                                 MATHESON
                        Pupil response is good.  You having 
                        any motor function difficulty?

                                 CALE
                        No.

                                 MATHESON
                        Any more blackouts in the last 
                        couple days?

                                 CALE
                        None at all.  Any chance I could 
                        get a pen and paper?

                                 MATHESON
                        What for?

                                 CALE
                        I was thinking it might help my 
                        memory to do some, what’s it 
                        called, free writing.

                                 MATHESON
                        Free association writing?
                                 CALE
                        Stream of consciousness, yeah.   
                        You think that might help?

                                 MATHESON
                        It’s certainly worth a try.  And 
                        I’d be happy to help you with that, 
                        if you tell me what’s going on.

           Cale stiffens.  Worried.

                                 CALE
                        What do you mean?

                                 MATHESON
                        You’ve been displaying some 
                        abnormal behavior, such as 
                        stripping the sheets off your bed.  
                        Any particular reason you did that?

                                 CALE
                        Any particular reason you were 
                        watching me do that?

                                 MATHESON
                        It’s in my job description.  
                        Unusual behavior is often 
                        incredibly telling.  People don’t 
                        alter the status quo for no reason, 
                        so what’s going on, Cale?

           He locks eyes with Cale.  Waits for an answer.

                                 CALE
                        There was a spider.

                                 MATHESON
                        A spider?

                                 CALE
                        In the bed.  I freaked out a little 
                        and ripped the sheets off.  Sorry I 
                        upset the status quo, but spiders 
                        freak me out.  Don’t judge me.

                                 MATHESON
                        Wouldn’t dream of it.  I don’t like 
                        snails myself.

                                 CALE
                        Snails?
                                 MATHESON
                        With those curly shells, the way 
                        they climb up walls, they’re just 
                        weird.  Don’t tell anyone.

                                 CALE
                        Your secret’s safe with me.

                                 MATHESON
                        I’ll have an orderly bring you a 
                        pen and paper later today.

                                 CALE
                        Thanks.

           Matheson puts his pen light away.

                                 MATHESON
                        Anything else I can do for you?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, could I get a clock too?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The digital clock on the bedside table clicks to 7:16 PM.

           Cale opens the notebook on his lap.  Jots down the time.

           He then lies down on the bed.  Closes his eyes.  Focuses.  
           And suddenly we’re --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale takes in a deep gulp of air as he finds himself sitting 
           cross-legged on the bed.  He looks to the clock.  7:14 PM.

           He grabs the notebook.  Hastily draws a STAR on the first 
           page before there’s another FLASH OF LIGHT AND --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale wakes.  He sits up.  Eyes the clock.  7:17 PM.

                                 CALE
                        Time keeps going.

           He opens the notebook.  Finds the star on the first page.
           Cale draws an arrow from the first time listed, 7:16, and 
           jots down 7:14.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Two minutes.  I wonder if I can 
                        push it further.

           He writes down the current time as the clock clicks to 7:18.

           Then Cale lies down.  Closes his eyes tight.  Face clinched.  
           Focusing.  As a FLASH OF LIGHT begins to build and --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           A shudder ripples through Cale’s body.  He’s seated on the 
           bed.  Staring at the clock -- 7:13.

           He chuckles to himself.  Opens the notebook --

           The first page is blank.  No times.  No star in the corner.

           Cale takes the pen.  Draws a figure-eight in the upper corner 
           where he initially drew in the star.  He sets the notebook 
           down.  Takes a deep breath as --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale’s eyes flutter open as he sits up. The clock reads 7:20.

           He opens the notebook.  The front page now has a figure-eight 
           drawn in the corner instead of a star.

                                 CALE
                        It changed.

           Cale writes out the time of his last jump -- 7:13.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Five minutes.

           He jots down the current time.  Lies back down as --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The clock reads 12:42 AM.  Cale leans back against the wall, 
           flipping through the notebook.  The first few pages are 
           filled with times.  Cale jots down the time lapse from each 
           jump.  Does some quick math.

           He writes down the average -- 3.42 MINUTES.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits up in bed as Matheson takes his blood pressure.

                                 CALE
                        Any luck with me being able to talk 
                        with my wife?

                                 MATHESON
                        Not yet.  I’m still trying though.

                                 CALE
                        What if we were still married?

                                 MATHESON
                        You’re not.  Blood pressure’s good.

           He undoes the blood pressure cuff.

                                 CALE
                        I’m serious, what if the two of us 
                        were still married?

                                 MATHESON
                        I don’t indulge in what ifs, 
                        they’re a waste of time and energy.

                                 CALE
                        Say I somehow fixed whatever made 
                        her leave me, then we’d still be 
                        together and I could talk to her.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, it’s best if you --

                                 CALE
                        I need to know who I was.  And from 
                        where I’m sitting, the easiest way 
                        to do that would be to talk to the 
                        person who was closest to me.

           Matheson makes a note on Cale’s chart.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        How am I doing?

                                 MATHESON
                        Quite well it seems.

                                 CALE
                        Well enough to do that electric 
                        chair thing again?
           INT. MACHINE ROOM - DAY

           The machinery hums.  Cale is strapped into the chair.  
           Matheson looks on as the Technician places extra electrodes 
           around Cale’s head.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        We’re gonna monitor your brain 
                        activity this time, see what’s 
                        going on up there.  You ready?

           Cale gives a thumbs up.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Same level as before.  Should be 
                        relatively mild.  Sound good?

           Cale nods.  The Technician hits a series of buttons.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Three...two...one...

           He flips the switch.

           A surge of current rushes through Cale.  He arches his back 
           against the chair.  Cries out in pain as --

           A LIGHT SPARKS FROM SOMEWHERE -- GROWING BRIGHTER -- CUTTING 
           THROUGH THE DARKNESS AS --

           Cale squints.  He shields his eyes against the light only to 
           find that he’s STANDING BEHIND A PODIUM in --

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           A DOZEN EXECUTIVES are seated in the audience.  They stare at 
           Cale expectantly.  Growing impatient.  Cale stands frozen, 
           unsure what to do.  He looks behind him --

           To see a COMPLEX SCHEMATIC being projected on a large screen 
           on the stage.  Cale stammers as --

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        So what’s the answer?

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        How are the tachyons stored in the 
                        hyperdrive prior to release?

                                 CALE
                        The -- Yeah, I’m sorry, I --
           Suddenly Cale is saved as a SLENDER WOMAN steps out of the 
           darkness and slides in behind the podium.  She’s classically 
           beautiful, her smile warm.  This is LEIGH WALDMAN, early 50s.

                                 LEIGH
                        You’ll have to excuse Mr. Isaacs, 
                        we’ve been working him a little too 
                        hard, I’m afraid.

                                 EXECUTIVE #2
                        Can he explain the hyperdrive
                        functionality or not?

                                 LEIGH
                        Of course he can, he designed it.  
                        That’s all for now though.  We’ll 
                        send around a memo with the rest.  
                        Let’s let Cale get back to work.

           The lights come on.  The Executives file out, grumbling.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Assholes. Got a question for 
                        everything.  You all right?

                                 CALE
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 LEIGH
                        Take a walk with me.

           INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Cale walks beside Leigh down a wide office hallway.

                                 LEIGH
                        Sorry, I shoulda stepped in sooner.  
                        From now on, they get an hour of 
                        questions, that’s it. And if any of 
                        them come around bugging you, let 
                        me know and I’ll run interference.

           The two of them stride through a pair of double doors into

           AN EXPANSIVE LOBBY

           With enormous front windows that overlook a bustling street.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        What’s the ETA on the engine specs?
                                 CALE
                        I dunno, ask me again later.

                                 LEIGH
                        You sure you’re okay?  Maybe we 
                        have been working you too hard.  
                        It’s all gonna be worth it though.  
                        The hard work, the sweat, all of 
                        it.  You and me, we’re gonna change 
                        the world, you can’t do that 
                        without making a few sacrifices.

           A cell phone begins to ring.  Cale doesn’t notice.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        That your phone?

           Cale pats his pockets.  Finds a ringing cell phone.  The 
           screen reads: JESSE’S CELL.

                                 CALE
                        It’s Jesse.  My wife.  That’s my 
                        wife’s name, Jesse.

                                 LEIGH
                        I’m aware.  Tell her I said hi.

           She heads off as Cale answers the phone.

                                 CALE
                        Hello?

                                 JESSE (V.O.)
                        Hey, sweetie.

                        questions that --

           He suddenly loses his train of thought as he sees MATHESON 
           cross the lobby and disappear into an elevator.

                                 JESSE (V.O.)
                        Cale?  Hello?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, I’m here.

                                 JESSE (V.O.)
                        Look, I just called to apologize 
                        for going off on you yesterday.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        All you wanted was to spend time 
                        together and I -- Whatever, I’m 
                        sorry.  What’d you wanna ask?

           As Jesse talks, Cale strides across the lobby, reaching the 
           elevator bank as a pair of doors opens.  He steps into the

           ELEVATOR

           And runs his hand down the panel of buttons.  The lowest 
           level is B-1. Cale stares at the panel curiously as --

                                 JESSE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Cale, what did you wanna ask me?

                                 CALE
                        Just a couple quick things.

                                 JESSE (V.O.)
                        Then why don’t you come out of that 
                        elevator and ask me?

           Cale cranes his head around.  Peeks back into the lobby.

                                 CALE
                        You can see me?  Where are you?

                                 JESSE (V.O.)
                        I don’t know, but right now you’re 
                        pretty cold.

           Cale steps back into the

           LOBBY

           And searches the area, listening to Jesse as she directs him.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Warm, warmer. No colder. Way cold, 
                        you’re gonna die of frostbite.  
                        Okay, you’re thawing out.

           Cale turns, finally seeing Jesse out the front window.  Their 
           eyes meet.  Cale goes for the door and accidentally bumps 
           into an EXECUTIVE.  Papers spill across the floor.

           Outside, Jesse bursts out laughing.  Cale bends down to help 
           gather the papers.  But stops suddenly as he sees Jesse 
           through the window.  Laughing.  Cale watches her.  Entranced. 

           The executive hustles off with his papers as Cale pulls open 
           the door.  He goes to his wife.  She’s mere feet away when --

           Suddenly a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT cuts through his mind and --
           INT. MACHINE ROOM - DAY

           Cale jerks awake, still strapped to the chair.  Matheson 
           kneels in front of him, tapping the side of his head.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale?  Cale, you okay?

           Cale nods.  Mutters through the mouthpiece.

           Matheson begins to unstrap Cale’s arms and legs.  Cale 
           shouts, his protests muffled.

           Matheson removes Cale’s mouthguard.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        We’re done for today.

                                 CALE
                        No, please.  I wanna go again.

                                 MATHESON
                        I can’t allow that, Cale.  It isn’t 
                        safe for you to --

                                 CALE
                        One more time.

                                 MATHESON
                        Were any memories triggered?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.  Yeah, it’s helping.

                                 MATHESON
                        What do you remember?

           Cale hesitates.  Unsure what to say.

                                 CALE
                        My wife.  I saw her.

                                 MATHESON
                        That’s it?

                                 CALE
                        Is that it?  It’s my wife, I need 
                        to go again.  Please.

           Matheson and the Technician share a look.
                                 MATHESON
                        No, it’s too dangerous.

                                 CALE
                        Come on, Doc.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, your body clearly isn’t 
                        responding favorably to the 
                        treatment.  Loss of consciousness 
                        for this long isn’t typically --

                                 CALE
                        Do you want me to get my memory 
                        back or not?!

                                 MATHESON
                        Okay, one more.  But we’re gonna
                        take it down a notch.

                                 CALE
                        No, that’s not --

                                 MATHESON
                        It’s my call.  You wanna do this 
                        again, that’s the way it’s gonna
                        be.  There’s no sense in getting 
                        your memory back if we have to fry 
                        your brain to do it.  Understood?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.

           Matheson slides the mouthguard back between Cale’s teeth.

           The Technician resets the console.  Turns the power down.

           The electric hum diminishes but continues to pulsate.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        You sure you’re ready for this?

           Cale nods.  Braces for the shock.

                                 TECHNICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, three, two, one...

           He flips the switch.  The hum of energy crescendos as a surge 
           of electricity jolts through Cale.

           His body arcs rigidly.  A flash of light and then --
           INT. RESTROOM - DAY

           Water streams from the faucet.  Cale shudders as he finds 
           himself standing over a bathroom sink.  He eyes his 
           reflection in the smudged mirror.

           A sign taped to the corner of the mirror reads: EMPLOYEES 
           MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK.

           Suddenly there’s a pounding at the door.  A MAN’S VOICE comes 
           through.  Agitated.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, buddy, you alive in there?

           Cale ignores him.  He fumbles through his pockets.  Finds 
           keys, a wallet, a cell phone, and a pen.

           Finally Cale looks at his watch -- 9:42 AM -- MARCH 5TH.

                                 CALE
                        Two days later.

           The pounding at the door continues.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Come on, man, zip it up.

           Cale opens the door to find a MIDDLE-AGED MAN waiting 
           impatiently.  The Man pushes his way into the bathroom, 
           closing the door behind him, as Cale steps out into

           A DINER

           Retro. Old-fashioned booths with mini-jukeboxes.  

           Cale stops near a glass case at the back of the restaurant.  
           Candy and trinkets inside.  He scans the diner.  Disoriented.

           Until he spots Jesse sitting at a booth across the diner.  
           She makes goofy faces at a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL at a nearby 
           booth.  The girl is laughing.  Having a blast.

           Cale watches Jesse interact with the girl.  A loving smile 
           spreads across his face.

           But their fun comes to an end as the Young Girl’s FATHER 
           spins her around and motions for her to eat her food. 

           The girl waves at Jesse.  Jesse waves back as across the room 
           Cale looks to the CASHIER, 20s, behind the glass case.
                                 CALE
                        Do you have any flowers?

                                 CASHIER
                        Just what you see.

           Cale grabs a candy bar.  Pays.  Then he walks over and sits 
           across from Jesse, who’s resumed working on a crossword 
           puzzle.  He offers her the candy bar.

                                 CALE
                        Got you a present.

                                 JESSE
                        After that meal, are you kidding?
                             (re: the crossword)
                        Verne’s sub.  Eight letters.

                                 CALE
                        Nautilus.  How do you do it?

                                 JESSE
                        Do what?

                                 CALE
                        You’ve just got this energy, this 
                        glow.  How do you do it?

                                 JESSE
                        I have special powers.  Eight 
                        letters, binary question words.

                                 CALE
                        I’m serious.

                                 JESSE
                        I do what makes me happy.

                                 CALE
                        That’s it?

                                 JESSE
                        Most people overthink things, they 
                        somehow talk themselves out of 
                        doing what they want.  If I think 
                        something will make me smile, then 
                        I do it.  Simple as that.

                                 CALE
                        And are we happy?

           Jesse looks up from the crossword.
                                 JESSE
                        Why are you asking if...

                                 CALE
                        Because I am.  Are we?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah.  Usually.  It’s just hard 
                        sometimes knowing that you love 
                        something else as much as you love 
                        me.  But I get it, it’s your job, 
                        your dream, whatever.  Can we -- 
                        Binary question words?

                                 CALE
                        Either or.

           Jesse fills this in as --

                                 JESSE
                        That reminds me, do you want me to 
                        give you a call after or wait for 
                        you to get home?

                                 CALE
                        After?  After what?

                                 JESSE
                        The appointment that you were just 
                        saying you couldn’t make.

                                 CALE
                        Right.  Yeah.  This appointment,  
                        is it with a doctor or...

                                 JESSE
                        No, it’s with Herman, the guy who 
                        drives the floorsweeper at the 
                        hospital.  He swears he can work 
                        the ultrasound machine just as well 
                        and he gave me a really good deal. 

                                 CALE
                        Ultrasound?

                                 JESSE
                        Gotta make sure the baby doesn’t 
                        have an extra head.  Or no head for 
                        that matter.  Unexpected gathering.  
                        Thirteen letters.

           Jesse looks up from the puzzle.  Sees Cale stunned.
                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 CALE
                        Noth -- Nothing.

                                 JESSE
                        Unexpected gathering?

                                 CALE
                        Surprise.  Surprise party.

           Jesse starts to write this into the puzzle but stops as --

                                 JESSE
                        Pen’s dead.

           Cale digs into his pockets.  Offers up his pen.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay.  I gotta go.

                                 CALE
                        I wanna come.  To the appointment.

                                 JESSE
                        You told me five minutes ago --

                                 CALE
                        I wanna be there.

                                 JESSE
                        You say that now then in two hours 
                        Herman’s gonna be rubbing goo on my 
                        belly and you’re gonna be whining 
                        that you have to run off to work.

           Cale pulls out his keys.  Thrusts them at her.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 CALE
                        I’m yours, all day.  Even if for 
                        some reason I ask for them back, 
                        don’t give them to me.  I want to 
                        be with you.  That’s all I want.

           Jesse grins.  Takes the keys, pockets them.  Starts to stand.  
           But Cale drops a quarter into the mini-jukebox.

                                 JESSE
                        What are you -- Are you serious?
                                 CALE
                        Give me a letter and a number.  
                        Come on, anything.  A number and --

                                 JESSE
                        I don’t know.  C 14.

           Cale punches it in.  A GOOFY OLDIES SONG begins.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Cale just smiles.  Stands.  Offers her his hand.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        You’re joking.  Now?  To this?  
                        We’ll look ridiculous.

                                 CALE
                        And you looked totally normal 
                        making silly faces with your little 
                        friend.  Come on, let’s go.

           He pulls her out of the booth.  They start to dance.  But 
           Jesse can’t contain herself.  She bursts out laughing.     
           The two of them lock eyes.  Jesse leans up to kiss him --

           THEN ALL AT ONCE THERE’S A FLASH OF LIGHT AND --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - DAY

           Cale sucks in a deep gulp of air as his eyes shoot open.  
           He’s still in the chair. Matheson and the Technician look on.

                                 MATHESON
                        Did it work?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Matheson sits near the foot of the bed, watching as Cale 
           hungrily gulps down a tray of food.

                                 MATHESON
                        Still nothing about the ship?

                                 CALE
                        No.  Just her.

                                 MATHESON
                        I see.
                                 CALE
                        Don’t sound too thrilled, it’s only 
                        my life and all.

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry.  I’m happy your memory’s 
                        returning.

                                 CALE
                        When can I talk to her?

                                 MATHESON
                        I put in a request, but it takes a 
                        while for word to make its way to 
                        the top.  They may not grant it 
                        anyway, with you not being married.

           Cale sets his fork down.

                                 CALE
                        You’re sure about that, that we’re 
                        not married?

                                 MATHESON
                        As sure as I was yesterday.

                                 CALE
                        That can’t be right.

                                 MATHESON
                        Why’s that?

                                 CALE
                        I mean under these circumstances, 
                        it’s not right for them to keep us 
                        from talking, married or not.

                                 MATHESON
                        I agree.  I’ll do everything I can.

                                 CALE
                        Does she know I’m here?

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m not sure.  They tell me what I 
                        need to know in order to do my job, 
                        nothing more.

           Cale finishes his food.  Sets the tray aside.

                                 CALE
                        When can I go back again?  To the 
                        chair, I mean?
                                 MATHESON
                        I’ll have to check your brain scans 
                        from the last round of treatment.  
                        I noticed a few anomolies that --

                                 CALE
                        How long?

                                 MATHESON
                        At least a day or two.

           Cale looks away.  Disappointed.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Cale, I’m not going to pretend I 
                        know what you’re going through.

                                 CALE
                        Sounds like you’re about to.

                                 MATHESON
                        Our memory, it’s everything.  Tells 
                        us what we’ve done, where we’ve 
                        been, what we care about, who we 
                        love.  I understand you’re 
                        desperate to get that back, but it 
                        may take some time.

                                 CALE
                        I just wanna know who I was.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits on the bed.  The clock reads 4:24 PM.

           He grits his teeth.  Squeezes his eyes closed.  Focuses all 
           his energy --

           UNTIL THERE’S A QUICK FLASH OF LIGHT AND --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale shudders.  Looks to the clock.  4:19 PM.

                                 CALE
                        There’s gotta be another way to go 
                        farther back.

           He sighs in frustration.  As there’s another FLASH and --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale awakens.  He’s about to close his eyes and try again 
           when he notices a TREMOR IN HIS HAND.  FINGERS SHAKING --

           Then suddenly a light in the bathroom flickers.

           Cale cranes his head around.  The light flickers again.  And 
           again.  Electricity crackling.

                                 CALE
                        Shit.

           He reaches for the call button but stops as --

           SUDDENLY THE FLICKERING BATHROOM LIGHT ILLUMINATES A FIGURE.

           Cale shudders.  The call button falls to the floor and the 
           red actuator slams against the cold tile.

           But Cale’s eyes are locked on the bathroom.  As the lights 
           flicker again, he gets a better look at the figure.

           IT’S JESSE.

           Cale stares.  Enraptured.  Confused --

           Until the main door opens and an Orderly enters.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Did you need something?

           Cale turns.  Startled.

                                 CALE
                        No.  Sorry.  It fell.

           The Orderly leaves without another word.

           Cale turns back to the bathroom.  The light is on.  No longer 
           flickering.  And Jesse is gone.

           Cale climbs out of bed.  Gripping the IV stand he staggers to

           THE BATHROOM

           And pokes around curiously.

           He pulls back the shower curtain.  No one there.

           Cale lets out a sigh.  Shrugs.  Starts for the door --
           But stops as he hears A VOICE coming through the wall.  Soft.  
           Indistinct.

           Cale presses his ear to the wall.  Listens closely.  But the 
           voice is still too muffled to make anything out.

           Moving quickly, Cale grabs a cup from the sink.  Places the 
           mouth of the cup to the wall.  His ear to the other end.    
           And the voice comes through clearly.  It’s Matheson --

                                 MATHESON (O.S.)
                        ...treatment is making it worse.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        It’s also bringing his memory back.  
                        He remembers his wife, snippets of 
                        their life together.  I’d say 
                        that’s pretty conclusive proof that 
                        the treatment’s effective.

                                 MATHESON (O.S.)
                        I’m not sure it’s safe to --

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        We’re running out of time.  I need 
                        his memory back now.

                                 MATHESON (O.S.)
                        Say his memory comes back and he 
                        remembers everything, what happened 
                        with his wife, all of it.  What 
                        will you do then?

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        The more important question is, 
                        what is he gonna do?

           Approaching footsteps.  Cale scrambles away from the wall.

           He fumbles the cup down onto the sink.  Flushes the toilet.

           The water swirls down, toilet running loudly as Matheson 
           appears in the doorway.  Cale pretends to button his pants.

                                 CALE
                        Can’t a guy get a little privacy?

                                 MATHESON
                        Sorry.  You weren’t in bed, I was 
                        worried you’d blacked out again.

           Cale grips the IV stand.  He follows Matheson back into the
           MAIN ROOM

           And takes a seat on the bed.  Cale notices a folder in 
           Matheson’s hand.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        We need to talk.  These are the 
                        scans of your brain from the last 
                        round of treatment.

           Matheson opens the folder.  He pulls out a number of CAT-scan 
           style brain images.  Lays them along the foot of the bed.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You say your memory’s coming back?
                             (pointing to the scans)
                        See these areas here?  The 
                        hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, 
                        perirhinal cortex, temporal cortex, 
                        these are where our memories are 
                        stored.  Look at these scans.  In 
                        every single one, those areas are 
                        totally black.  No neural activity.

           He grabs the last scan.  The whole thing is nearly black.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        This one here, half a second after 
                        the shock begins, virtually zero 
                        brain activity.  Coma patients have 
                        more going on than this.  We did 
                        two shocks.  After the first one, 
                        you were technically brain dead for 
                        a period of almost five minutes, 
                        after the second shock, for a 
                        period of close to four.

                                 CALE
                        That’s not normal I’m guessing.

                                 MATHESON
                        These scans leave me with two 
                        questions.  The first is how can 
                        you be remembering things when the 
                        memory centers in your brain 
                        haven’t been activated?  And the 
                        second, is how are you still alive?  
                        This low level of activity isn’t 
                        enough to regulate your heart, your 
                        lungs, but I was there. I heard you 
                        breathe and I felt your heartbeat.

           Cale stares at the scan.  At a loss for words.
                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You know what the most puzzling 
                        thing is?  This right here.

           He points to a small area on the last scan, the only portion 
           of the brain lit up.  And it’s blazing, bright red.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You know what that area of the 
                        brain does?

           Cale shakes his head.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Neither do I.  No one knows.
                        This is a dead space, dormant in 
                        everyone, long believed to be some 
                        type vestigial area associated with 
                        lower brain function. 

           Cale stares at the small illuminated area in the scan.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Cale, your brain is working in a 
                        way for which I have no medical 
                        explanation. Your synaptic pathways 
                        no longer follow traditional 
                        routes, it’s like your entire brain 
                        has rewired itself.  You say you 
                        remember your wife, you know her 
                        name, I’m just wondering --

                                 CALE
                        What haven’t you told me about her?  
                        About my wife?

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, you know everything --

                                 CALE
                        Don’t lie to me.  I heard --

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m not lying --

                                 CALE
                        You either tell me what you know or 
                        I’m gonna take this IV stand and 
                        beat you with it till you can’t 
                        walk.  We understand each other?  
                        So what haven’t you told me?
           Matheson puts a calming hand on his shoulder.  He notices 
           that one of Cale’s fingers is TWITCHING RANDOMLY.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, I would never lie to you.  
                        Ever.  You know everything I do 
                        about your wife.  But I can’t do my 
                        job unless I have all the facts.  
                        So I need to know what happens to 
                        you during these treatments.

           Cale takes a moment before --

                                 CALE
                        You remember what I said about the 
                        blackouts?  How I remember things 
                        and it’s like I’m there?  Well, 
                        it’s like I’m there because I am 
                        there.  I’m actually going back.

           Matheson nods.  Solemn.

                                 MATHESON
                        This is what I was afraid of.

                                 CALE
                        What?  You gotta believe me, I’m 
                        not remembering things --

                                 MATHESON
                        I know it may seem like --

                                 CALE
                        I’m really there.

                                 MATHESON
                        It only feels like that because 
                        your brain is shutting down.

                                 CALE
                        What are you -- You said it was 
                        rewired or -- What do you mean --

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry to tell you this, I 
                        really am, but you’re dying, Cale.  
                        That’s what these scans show, and 
                        these delusions your describing 
                        only confirm that --

                                 CALE
                        They’re not delusions.
                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, the pathways in your brain 
                        are damaged.  Look at your hand, 
                        the muscle spasm.  Signals are 
                        getting crossed, before long your 
                        brain won’t be able to regulate 
                        your organs properly.  Then your 
                        brain will start to shut down.

                                 CALE
                        How long do I have?

                                 MATHESON
                        I estimated two weeks.  Maybe 
                        three.  But that could speed up if 
                        we continue the treatment.

                                 CALE
                        The shocks make it worse.

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m advocating that we cease the 
                        electric stimulation sessions until 
                        we better understand --

                                 CALE
                        I’m actually going back.  I need 
                        you to believe me.  Please!

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry, Cale.  I’m gonna do 
                        everything I can to help you.

           He pats Cale on the shoulder.  Then stands to go.

                                 CALE
                        Doc, you gotta believe me.  Doc!

           Matheson exits without turning back.  The door slams.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale lies in bed asleep.  Peaceful.

           Then all at once he’s ripped out of bed by two Orderlies.  
           They pull him to the door while Cale flails against them.

                                 CALE
                        What the hell’s going on?
           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The Orderlies drag Cale kicking and screaming down the hall.

                                 CALE
                        Hey, where are you taking me?!   
                        Let me go!

           He tries to kick loose, but the Orderlies are too strong.

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale is pulled into the room.  He fights against the 
           Orderlies as they strap him into the chair.

                                 CALE
                        Get your hands off me!

           The Technician and Matheson stand beside the control panel.  
           They watch as Cale struggles against the restraints.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

           The Technician begins to place electrodes on Cale’s head.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        You said it was dangerous to --

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry, Cale.

                                 CALE
                        What are you doing?!

           Cale continues to struggle.  It’s no use.  Then suddenly the 
           door to the room opens.  Cale cranes his head around to see 
           LEIGH.  He sighs in relief.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        You.  Help me, get me outta here.

                                 LEIGH
                        You remember me?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, of course.  Untie me.

                                 LEIGH
                        See, Alan, I told you.  This is 
                        helping his memory come back.
                                 CALE
                        Get me outta here.  Please.

           Leigh looks at Cale sympathetically.  Then she grabs the 
           mouthguard off the table and shoves it between Cale’s teeth.

           Cale struggles.  His shouts muffled but venemous.

                                 LEIGH
                        We ready to start?

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Good to go.

           He hits a button on the console.  The machine powers up as 
           Leigh bends down.  Looks Cale in the eyes.

                                 LEIGH
                        I wish there was another way but 
                        unfortunately time is running out.

           Cale looks to one of the Orderlies.  Sees a pen sticking out 
           of his pocket.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to make this as painless 
                        as possible but I need you to try 
                        and focus and think back to -- 
                        Cale, are you listening to me?

           Cale closes his eyes.  Focuses his concentration.  There’s a 
           FLASH of light and suddenly --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           The two Orderlies drag Cale into the room.  They slam him 
           down into the chair as he thrashes against him.  The 
           Orderlies manage to strap one of his arms in --

           And in a flash Cale grabs the pen from the Orderly’s pocket.  
           Kicks the two of them away.

           Cale hastily slides the pen between the loops on the wrist 
           strap.  Pulls it loose.

           He then bolts out of the chair.  Races for the door.  Grabs 
           the handle.

           But before he can open it, one of the Orderlies grabs Cale 
           from behind and drags him back to the chair.

           Cale screams as there’s a FLASH and --
           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale’s eyes flutter open to find Leigh standing in front of 
           him.  He’s still strapped to the chair.

                                 LEIGH
                        Another blackout?

           Cale grunts a response through the mouthguard. Leigh gently 
           removes it as --

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to administer a series 
                        of shocks now.

                                 CALE
                        Good.  Send me back.  I’ll fix it 
                        so I never end up here.

           Leigh looks to Matheson.

                                 LEIGH
                        You weren’t kidding about the 
                        delusion, were you?

                                 CALE
                             (to Matheson)
                        When I get outta here, I’m gonna
                        find you out in the real world and 
                        I’m gonna --

                                 LEIGH
                        That’s enough, Cale.

           She slides the mouthguard back into place.  Cale continues 
           talking, his speech muffled.

           The Technician flips a switch on the control panel.  The room 
           fills with the hum of electricity.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        Ready?

                                 LEIGH
                             (to Cale)
                        Try to concentrate on what you did 
                        aboard the ship.  Think back.
                             (to technician)
                        Hit it.

           The Technician punches the button.  Electricity pulses as it 
           shoots through Cale’s body.  And suddenly we’re --
           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cale starts.  His eyes flutter as he finds himself lying in 
           bed with Jesse, his arm draped over her.

                                 JESSE
                        Something wrong?

                                 CALE
                        No.  I was -- I’m fine.

           Jesse leans back.  Kisses his cheek.

                                 JESSE
                        You look confused.  Do we need to 
                        discuss what we’ve done?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t --

                                 JESSE
                        In my health talk at the college 
                        this morning I emphasized the need 
                        to make sure these types of 
                        activities were consensual.

                                 CALE
                        There’s something I need to --

           Jesse climbs on top of him.

                                 JESSE
                        At any point were you uncomfortable 
                        with what we were doing?  Because 
                        I’d hate to think that I took 
                        advantage of you.

           She leans down, kissing him passionately.

                                 CALE
                        Jesse, there’s something I need to 
                        talk to you about.

                                 JESSE
                        Are you killing the mood?  Is that 
                        what you’re doing?

                                 CALE
                        No -- Well, yeah, probably.  I need 
                        you to do something for me.  No 
                        matter what, you can’t let me go.
                                 JESSE
                        Pretty sure we’re past the hit-it-
                        and-quit-it stage.

                                 CALE
                        Jesse, I’m serious.  I don’t know 
                        how much time I have.

                                 JESSE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CALE
                        The ship, Helios. Whatever 
                        happens, whatever I say, you can’t 
                        let me get on it.  I don’t care if 
                        you have to strap me down to this 
                        bed, you can’t let me go up there.

                                 JESSE
                        What are you --

                                 CALE
                        Just promise me.

                                 JESSE
                        Okay.  Okay, I promise.  Even if 
                        you don’t wanna go, can I still 
                        strap you to the bed?

                                 CALE
                        Swear to me, no matter what.

                                 JESSE
                        Girl scout’s honor.

           Jesse salutes.  Cale smiles.  Relieved.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        What’s gotten into you?

                                 CALE
                        Nothing.  I’m -- Nothing.

           He pulls Jesse in close.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        This is where I want to be.  Right 
                        here.  This is where I belong.

           Cale smiles.  Rubs her slightly paunched belly.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think about names?
                                 JESSE
                        Did you finish your list of 
                        obviously inferior choices?

                                 CALE
                        What’s your choice?

                                 JESSE
                        Still Andrew.  Not gonna change.

                                 CALE
                        Andrew?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah.

                                 CALE
                        I like that.

                                 JESSE
                        Since when?  The other day you 
                        rattled off five people you’ve 
                        hated who had that name, which I 
                        still think is a piss poor 
                        barometer for naming your son.

                                 CALE
                        No, I like it.  Andrew.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.

           He pulls her in tighter.  Kisses her softly.  Lovingly.

           The phone on the nightstand begins to ring.  Cale ignores it.

                                 JESSE
                        Are you gonna get that?

           Cale shakes his head.  Continues kissing her --

           UNTIL SUDDENLY THERE’S FLASH OF LIGHT IN HIS MIND AND WE --

           INT. HELIOS SHIP - DAY

           A WARNING ALARM SCREECHES.  RED LIGHTS FLASH ACROSS CALE’S 
           PANICKED FACE.  HE’S STRAPPED INTO THE PILOT SEAT.
           The lights on the control panel flicker as an ELECTRONIC 
           VOICE announces --

                                 ELECTRONIC VOICE
                        Warning.  Breach to main hull.

                                 CALE
                        Hello?!

                                 ELECTRONIC VOICE
                        Warning.  Breach to main hull.

                                 CALE
                        Somebody help!

           Cale pounds on the control panel.  Frantic.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Help!

           Suddenly the alarm goes silent.  The lights click on.

                                 ELECTRONIC VOICE
                        Simulation seventeen complete.

           Cale slowly collects himself.  His breathing steadies.  
           Finally he stands and makes his way to the back of the ship.  
           Timidly he pushes it open and steps out into

           A MASSIVE HANGAR

           Where two men, one LANKY and the other BALDING, stand at a 
           control panel beside the sleek SIMULATOR.

                                 LANKY
                        Told you it wouldn’t work.

                                 BALDING
                        He didn’t complete the cycle.
                             (to Cale)
                        You didn’t complete the cycle.

           Cale comes down the steel steps.

                                 LANKY
                        What happened?  It was the power 
                        cell, wasn’t it?

                                 BALDING
                        The power cell isn’t the issue.
                                 LANKY
                        The output capacity is.  Unless 
                        Freddy has some sorta superhuman 
                        strength, the stick’s gonna tear 
                        his arm off at the socket.

                                 BALDING
                             (to Cale)
                        All right, let’s try it again.

           Cale pats down his pockets.  Comes up empty.

                                 BALDING (CONT’D)
                        Cale, you wanna --

                                 CALE
                        You know where my phone is?

                                 BALDING
                        Back at security with the rest of 
                        our phones.  Let’s just get this 
                        done so we can all go --

                                 CALE
                        I need to talk to my wife.

                                 LANKY
                        It’s two in the morning.

           Cale checks his watch.  MARCH 8th -- 1:48 AM.

                                 LANKY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, buddy, we need you to 
                        focus.  I’m sorry we pulled you out 
                        of bed, but we need your mind here 
                        along with the rest of you.

                                 BALDING
                        We could use the thrusters.

                                 LANKY
                        What are you gonna power them with?

                                 CALE
                        The phone.  That was you guys.

                                 LANKY
                        What do you think here?  How do we 
                        offset the torque on the stick so 
                        Freddy can maintain control?

           Cale starts towards the exit before --
                                 LANKY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, man, the demonstration’s 
                        in six hours.  Nobody’s going home 
                        till we figure this thing out.

                                 CALE
                        I really don’t care.  I’m not going 
                        on the ship.  You understand me?  
                        Tell that bitch that I’m not going.

                                 LANKY
                        Jesus, buddy, are you --

                                 CALE
                        I’m not going!

                                 BALDING
                        Yeah, I don’t think Freddy’d care 
                        much for you sitting in his lap.

                                 CALE
                        Who’s Freddy?

                                 BALDING
                        Did you hit your head in there?

                                 CALE
                        Wait, I’m not the pilot?

                                 BALDING
                        Not unless you changed your mind.  
                        Or better yet changed Jess’s mind.  
                        You got a kid coming, man.  Why the 
                        hell would you wanna go up there?

                                 CALE
                        I need to talk to her.

                                 LANKY
                        Come on, we gotta figure this out.

           Cale starts towards the exit, striding fast before --

           ANOTHER FLASH FLICKERS IN HIS MIND AND --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale jerks awake.  Trickles of blood flow from his nostrils.  
           The din of electrical current rages.  And above that, the 
           sound of shouting.  Chaotic --
                                 MATHESON
                        That’s enough!  We’re done!

                                 LEIGH
                        Hit it again!

                                 MATHESON
                        You’re gonna kill him!

                                 LEIGH
                        We need to know!  Hit it again!

           The electrical hum crescendos and as Matheson screams --

           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Silence.  Cale stands beside the nightstand as Jesse sleeps 
           soundly in the bed.  Suddenly a voice comes from somewhere --

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Sir?  Are you there, sir?

           Cale shudders.  Realizes he’s holding the phone to his ear.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Sir, are you --

                                 CALE
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I’m here.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        What’s your emergency, sir?

                                 CALE
                        Emergency?

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        You said there was something wrong 
                        with your wife.

           Cale looks to Jesse asleep on the bed.  He tries to shake her 
           awake.  She doesn’t move.

                                 CALE
                        Jesse?

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Sir, what’s the nature of your --

           Cale doesn’t hear the rest as the phone slips from his hand 
           and clatters to the floor.  He shakes Jesse harder.  Panics.
                                 JESSE
                        Jesse!

           Jesse still doesn’t move.  No response.

           A FLASH BEGINS TO BUILD IN CALE’S MIND.

           He hastily takes a look at his watch -- 3:43 AM.  THEN THE 
           BLINDING WHITE LIGHT OVERTAKES HIM AND WE --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale’s eyes flutter.  He fades in and out of consciousness.

                                 MATHESON
                        Loosen his arm.  Loosen it!

                                 LEIGH
                        His brain activity --

                                 MATHESON
                        Get him to his room!  Get him --

           Cale’s eyes close.  The room goes black.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The fan squeals in the silence.  Cale sleeps in bed,  
           machines hooked into him.  A steady beeping.

           Matheson stands at the foot of the bed.  He studies a series 
           of BRAIN SCANS in his hand.   His face is grim.  Concerned.

           The door opens behind him and Leigh enters silently.

                                 LEIGH
                        Has he come to yet?

           Matheson shakes his head.

                                 MATHESON
                        You see these?

           He passes Leigh the scans.  She flips through them.

                                 LEIGH
                        What am I looking at?

                                 MATHESON
                        The random synaptic firings are 
                        getting worse.
                                 LEIGH
                        We knew that was a possibility.

           Leigh hands the brain scans back.  Looks at Cale solemnly.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        He wanted to go on the ship.  He 
                        asked me, he begged me.  Nobody had 
                        any idea this would be a side 
                        effect.  There was no indication --

                                 MATHESON
                        We’re killing him!

                                 LEIGH
                        He died the moment he got on board 
                        that ship.

           She steps towards the bed.  Squeezes Cale’s limp arm.

                                 MATHESON
                        What’s happening in his brain right 
                        now is unprecedented.  I’ve been 
                        poring over neurologic studies for 
                        days, there’s never been anything 
                        like it before.

                                 LEIGH
                        Are you saying you believe his 
                        stories, that he’s actually --

                                 MATHESON
                        No, I’m just saying we should slow 
                        down, take some time, really try 
                        and figure out what’s going on.

                                 LEIGH
                        We’re resuming the treatments as 
                        soon as he wakes up.

                                 MATHESON
                        He’s my patient.  It’s my call.

                                 LEIGH
                        I don’t wanna damage your ego or 
                        anything, but this is bigger than 
                        you now.  He’s not a patient.  The 
                        key to humanity’s future is locked 
                        away somewhere in his mind.  And 
                        one way or another I’m gonna find a 
                        way to pull it out.

           She shoots him one final look, then walks away.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The Orderly enters and checks on the machinery connected to 
           Cale.  He pulls out the old IV bag.  Goes to replace it --

           When suddenly Cale’s hand moves.  His eyes flutter open.

           The Orderly stumbles away from the bed.  Surprised.

                                 CALE (V.O.)
                        How long have I been out?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits up slightly.  Matheson stands over him.

                                 MATHESON
                        Two days.  Do you remember my name?

                                 CALE
                        Why wouldn’t I --

                                 MATHESON
                        I’ve got half a dozen scans that 
                        show neural misfires in your brain.  
                        Now do you remember my name or not?

                                 CALE
                        Matheson.

                                 MATHESON
                        Do you remember anything new?

                                 CALE
                        New?  You mean like from my past or 
                        like you and that bitch strapping 
                        me down and frying my skull?     
                        No, I don’t remember anything new.  
                        Now get the hell outta here.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, I need to --

                                 CALE
                        Get.  Out.

                                 MATHESON
                        There’s something you need to know.
                                 CALE
                        There’s a lot of things I need to 
                        know.  Like my wife, her dying, you 
                        knew this whole time, didn’t you?

                                 MATHESON
                        I felt that the notion of someone 
                        waiting for you might be a strong 
                        motivator to aid in your recovery.

                                 CALE
                        Fuck you!

           Matheson backs away.  Apologetic.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        March eighth, between midnight and 
                        three, that’s when she died, right?

                                 MATHESON
                        I believe so, yes.

                                 CALE
                        What happened to her?

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, I need to tell you --

                                 CALE
                        What happened?

                                 MATHESON
                        It was a carbon monoxide leak.  
                        Nothing spectacular.  She died in 
                        her sleep.  Peacefully.

                                 CALE
                        That’s it?  That’s -- That’s it?

                                 MATHESON
                        That’s it.  Listen, Cale, your most 
                        recent brain scans --

                                 CALE
                        I don’t give a shit.

                                 MATHESON
                        You need to understand --

                                 CALE
                        Am I still dying?

           Matheson nods.
                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Is there any way to stop it?

                                 MATHESON
                        I don’t know.  Our best bet for the 
                        short term is to get Dr. Waldman to 
                        discontinue the treatment.  She’s 
                        not confident that your memory will 
                        return on its own.  She’s gambling 
                        that the electronic stimulation 
                        will trigger it before your --

                                 CALE
                        Before my brain conks out.

                                 MATHESON
                        Yeah.  I’m trying to get her to 
                        stop but she’s not --

                                 CALE
                        Why don’t you go do that then and 
                        leave me the hell alone?

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry, Cale.  I really am.

           But Cale doesn’t hear this last part.  His focus is drawn to 
           the bathroom where JESSE is standing in the doorway.  

           Matheson follows his gaze.  But he doesn’t see anything.

           Cale keeps his eyes on Jesse.  She smiles coyly.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear me?  I said --

                                 CALE
                        Leave me alone.

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CALE
                        I don’t care.

           Matheson stands with a sigh and walks out.  Cale looks back 
           to the bathroom doorway.  Jesse is gone.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale climbs out of bed.  Lowers himself to the floor.  Legs 
           shaking, he shuffles to the bathroom, gripping the IV stand.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Steam fills the room as Cale showers.  He leans against the 
           wall, unable to hold himself up.  His hands shake.

           He closes his eyes.  Rinses the shampoo from his hair --

           When suddenly a pair of arms wrap around him.

           Startled, Cale brushes the water and suds from his eyes.    
           He spins around to find Jesse standing there.

           He stares at her for a moment before --

                                 CALE
                        How did you get here?

                                 JESSE
                        Magic.

                                 CALE
                        You’re not real.

                                 JESSE
                        I am to you.

           She leans in to kiss him.  Cale closes his eyes.  Waits for a 
           kiss that never comes.

           And when he opens his eyes again, Jesse has disappeared.

           Then all at once Cale’s legs give out.  He fumbles for the 
           wall, trying to hold himself up.  But it’s no use.

           He struggles to lower himself safely down, fingertips sliding 
           on the tiled walls.

           Finally Cale drops down to the floor of the shower.  Water 
           cascades down around him.

           He tries to pull himself back up but his legs won’t work.

           Cale sighs in frustration.  Leans his head against the wall.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Darkness.  Cale tosses and turns, unable to sleep.  He rolls 
           over on his side --

           To find Jesse lying in bed beside him.
                                 JESSE
                        Hey you.

                                 CALE
                        Hey.

           He stares at her a moment, lost in her eyes before --

                                 JESSE
                        You left me.

                                 CALE
                        You died.

                                 JESSE
                        You’d made your choice long before 
                        that.

                                 CALE
                        No.

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah, you did. But it’s okay, I get 
                        it, the fascination of the unknown, 
                        the search for something new.  You 
                        went after what you wanted.

                                 CALE
                        I had what I wanted.

                                 JESSE
                        Then why weren’t you beside me in 
                        bed?  Why aren’t you dead too?

           The question hangs in the air before --

                                 CALE
                        So I can save you.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale lies on the bed, gripping Matheson’s hand.

                                 MATHESON
                        Okay, good.  Other hand.

           Cale grabs Matheson’s fingers with his other hand.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Now squeeze.

           Cale’s fingers tighten feebly.
                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Keep going.  Harder.

           Cale tries squeezing harder, but he has no strength.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        That’s good.  You can stop.

           Cale’s hand falls away.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        You’re having trouble standing?

           Cale nods.

                                 CALE
                        Any chance I could get some 
                        stronger painkillers?

                                 MATHESON
                        Headaches?  How bad, on a scale 
                        from one to ten?

                                 CALE
                        I don’t think ten covers it.  Feels 
                        like I’m falling apart.

                                 MATHESON
                        Your motor control’s gonna continue 
                        to get worse.  Headaches, blurred 
                        vision.  I’m doing my best to try 
                        and find some way to reverse --

                                 CALE
                        That’s not good enough.  I told you 
                        that if you lied to me I was gonna
                        beat you half to death, you 
                        remember that?

                                 MATHESON
                        Seeing as how you can barely walk, 
                        I figured it was an empty threat.

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, well, now you owe me.  I need 
                        a favor from you.

                                 MATHESON
                        What might that be?

                                 CALE
                        Does your little machine keep track 
                        of the zaps it gives me?
                                 MATHESON
                        Yeah.

                                 CALE
                        The intensity level?

                                 MATHESON
                        Yeah.

                                 CALE
                        I want readouts of all of them.

                                 MATHESON
                        For what reason could you possibly 
                        need that information?

                                 CALE
                        You owe me.  And seeing as how I’m 
                        not gonna be around much longer, 
                        your window to repay that debt’s 
                        getting smaller by the day.  Now 
                        will you help me or not?

           Matheson looks down at him.  His face impossible to read.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Cale steadies himself against the sink.  Looks at himself in 
           the mirror.  The muscles in his eyes twitch.  He looks to his 
           hands.  His fingers jerk.  Muscles spasming.

           He clinches his hand into a fist.  His whole hand shakes as --

           The door opens in the other room.  Cale starts for the 
           doorway expectantly --

                                 CALE
                        Did you get the readouts from --

           But he goes rigid as he enters the

           MAIN ROOM

           To find Leigh beside his bed.  He eyes her, venomous.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        What do you want?

                                 LEIGH
                        Just to talk.  Please, hear me out.
           Cale’s legs begin to shake beneath his weight.  Leigh steps 
           up to help him but Cale waves her off.  Sits on the bed.

                                 CALE
                        I’m fine.  Talk.

                                 LEIGH
                        I know how I must look from where 
                        you’re sitting, but believe me, I’m 
                        not the bad guy here.

                                 CALE
                        You locked me in a room, tortured 
                        me, lied to me about my dead wife, 
                        and you came alarmingly close to 
                        killing me.  If you’re not the bad 
                        guy, then who the hell are you?

                                 LEIGH
                        Everything I did was for the 
                        project. If you were in my position 
                        you’d have done the same thing.

                                 CALE
                        Bullshit.

                                 LEIGH
                        You only say that because you don’t 
                        know who you are.  I know you, 
                        Cale, better than anyone.  That’s 
                        what you’ve been looking for, isn’t 
                        it?  Who you are?  Let me show you.

           She pulls a small ELECTRONIC TABLET out of her pocket.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Touch the screen.

           Cale hesitates.  Unsure.  Then finally taps the screen --

           A video begins to play.  Handheld footage of an office party.  
           There’s wild cheering.  Booze being passed around.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        That was last year, the night we 
                        finally got the hyperdrive to 
                        filter and store tachyons.  The 
                        night we realized what we’d been 
                        building towards was gonna work.

           In the midst of the chaotic party is Cale.  Shouting louder 
           than the others.  Gulping down champagne.
                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t stop smiling all night.

           Cale watches himself on the tablet.  Emotional.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Cale, the Helios Project didn’t 
                        exist before you.  You breathed 
                        life into it and you lived it every 
                        day for ten years.  Your entire 
                        world revolved around it.

                                 CALE
                        What about my wife?

                                 LEIGH
                        You loved her.  I know you did, but 
                        this was your life.

           The video continues to play.  Cale watches the younger 
           version of himself.  Laughing.  Cheering.  Never happier.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Sacrifices had to be made.  But it 
                        all worked out for the best.  You 
                        got on the ship and you did what 
                        nobody else could have done.  I 
                        knew all along it had to be you.

           The video stops.  Leigh gently lifts it off his lap.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I could have handled things 
                        better, but I was only trying to 
                        finish what we started.  You gave 
                        everything to this program, it was 
                        gonna be your legacy.  And you will 
                        be a legend, you’re gonna change 
                        the world, all you have to do is 
                        remember what you did on the ship.

           Cale processes all this, mind turning as --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale is seated on the floor.  Charts litter the space around 
           him.  He examines a time line of the flight -- the moment the 
           ship went light-speed, the moment that it crashed.  Jesse 
           paces in front of Cale as he jots down notes.

                                 JESSE
                        You shouldn’t be doing this.
           Cale pores over a list of the energy delivered by each shock 
           that sent him back in time.  He begins making calculations.

                                 JESSE (CONT’D)
                        Cale, stop.

                                 CALE
                        Leave me alone.

                                 JESSE
                        You’re actually gonna help them?

                                 CALE
                        I am them!

           Jesse kneels down in front of him.  Eyes him compassionately.

                                 JESSE
                        Your head’s turned around, you’re 
                        not thinking straight.

                                 CALE
                        Says the hallucination.

                                 JESSE
                        You were gonna save me.

                                 CALE
                        I still am, I can do both.  After I 
                        jump back to the ship and figure 
                        out what I did, then I’ll go back 
                        again and save you.  Everybody 
                        wins, and I can finally get the 
                        hell out of this godforsaken place.

           Cale continues working.  Jesse kneels over him.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        What?!

                                 JESSE
                        Don’t do this.

                                 CALE
                        Will you please go away?

                                 JESSE
                        Cale --

                                 CALE
                        Leave me alone!

           He focuses on his work.  Looks up again.  And Jesse is gone.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale is seated on the bed, papers spread out around him.  He 
           passes a series of calculations to Leigh.

                                 CALE
                        The machine has to be dialed in to 
                        the right settings.

                                 LEIGH
                        I don’t understand.

                                 CALE
                        Different shock levels trigger 
                        different memories.  There’s a 
                        narrow window where I can check the 
                        ship’s keystroke log before it 
                        crashes -- Whatever, it doesn’t 
                        matter, just set the machine to 
                        these levels and we’re good.

           Leigh folds the slip of paper.  Slides it into her pocket.

                                 LEIGH
                        Don’t worry about the settings.  
                        Just refamiliarize yourself with 
                        everything, try to get your brain 
                        going in the right direction, and 
                        we’ll take care of the rest.

                                 CALE
                        You don’t understand --

                                 LEIGH
                        The machine doesn’t work like that, 
                        different settings don’t set off 
                        different memories.

                                 CALE
                        Maybe ordinarily but this --

                                 LEIGH
                        Cale, your mind is going.

                                 CALE
                        No, it’s not.  I’m perfectly fine.

                                 LEIGH
                        Then why have you been talking to 
                        yourself the last two days?  Let us 
                        handle the machine.  Don’t worry, 
                        we’ll take care of everything.
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits on the edge of his bed, repeatedly hitting the call 
           button.  After a few moments, Matheson bursts in.

                                 MATHESON
                        What is it?  Everything okay?

                                 CALE
                        What took you so long?

                                 MATHESON
                        I was -- What do you need, Cale?

                                 CALE
                        You gotta talk to Waldman for me.  
                        I know you don’t believe the time 
                        jump thing, but unless the 
                        machine’s dialed in right, I could 
                        end up anywhere.

                                 MATHESON
                        I don’t think --

                                 CALE
                        Just do this for me, please.  
                        You’re my doctor, you asked me to 
                        trust you, all I’m asking is --

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m not your doctor anymore.

           Cale goes silent.  Surprised.

                                 CALE
                        Since when?

                                 MATHESON
                        About five minutes ago. Dr. Waldman
                        is adamant that your treatment be 
                        continued, and I can’t in good 
                        conscience be any part of that.

                                 CALE
                        I can go back, I can find out what 
                        she wants, I can save my wife.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, if they strap you into that 
                        chair again, you’re going to die.

           Cale looks away.  Sees Jesse standing beside the bed.
                                 CALE
                        You don’t know that for sure.

                                 MATHESON
                        No but I have thirty-four years of 
                        medical knowledge and a few hundred 
                        years of science backing me up.

                                 JESSE
                        Maybe you shouldn’t go.

                                 CALE
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale --

                                 CALE
                        Two more jumps, that’s it.      
                        I’ve got it all plotted out, look.

           He hands Matheson two sheets of paper depicting the power 
           levels for the two shocks.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        One to get me to the ship before it 
                        crashes, the other to get to Jesse.

                                 JESSE
                        You’re forgetting the paradox.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, your mind is broken, you’re 
                        delusional.

                                 CALE
                             (to Jesse and Matheson)
                        No, I’m not.

                                 JESSE
                        If you save me, then none of this 
                        ever happens.

                                 MATHESON
                        I can’t help you.

           He hands the papers back to Cale.  Cale looks to Jesse.

                                 JESSE
                        The only reason you were on that 
                        ship was because I died.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESSE (CONT'D)
                        If I’m not dead, then you never go, 
                        you never end up here.  The ship 
                        doesn’t work without you on it.

                                 MATHESON
                        Cale, you have to refuse the 
                        treatment.  Do you understand?

           But Cale isn’t listening to him.  He’s focused on Jesse.

                                 CALE
                             (to Jesse)
                        Say that again.

                                 MATHESON
                        You have to refuse the treatment.

                                 JESSE
                        The ship doesn’t work without you, 
                        and me dying is what put you on it.

           Cale goes still.  Something’s just clicked in his mind.

                                 MATHESON
                        Good-bye, Cale.

                                 CALE
                        No, wait, I need you to help me.  
                        You need to send me back.  Take me 
                        to the chair right now.

                                 MATHESON
                        I can’t do that.

                                 CALE
                        This is real, okay?  Forget your 
                        thirty-four years of medical 
                        experience and listen to me.  You 
                        said it yourself, something’s 
                        happening in my brain that you 
                        can’t explain.  This is real!

                                 MATHESON
                        I’m not gonna kill you.

                                 CALE
                        She’s gonna kill me anyway.  At 
                        least let me try to fix all this.

           But Matheson simply turns and walks out.  The door slams as --

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Doc!
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale sits on the bed.  Mind turning.  He glances towards the 
           bathroom.  And something clicks into place.  Shakily, Cale 
           lowers himself down to the floor and staggers into the

           BATHROOM

           And stares at the metal SHOWER CURTAIN RINGS.

           Struggling to stand on his tiptoes, Cale wrenches one of the 
           rings off of the shower rod.

           He then shuffles over to the wall, where above the sink is an 
           ELECTRICAL SOCKET.

           Cale turns the metal ring over in his fingers.  Kisses it.

                                 CALE
                        Take me back.

           Hand shaking, he inches the ring towards the socket.  Cale 
           takes a deep breath.  Then jams the ends into the slits.

           A SURGE OF ENERGY ROCKETS THROUGH HIM.  A BURST OF LIGHT AS -- 

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           Cale’s eyes burst open.  He cries out in agonizing pain.   
           His whole body shaking, he slowly sits up to see --

           WRECKAGE FROM THE CRASHED SHIP.  SPREAD ALL OVER THE FIELD.

           Cale braces himself against a piece of the hull.  Pulls 
           himself to his feet.  Blood pours from a wound in his stomach 
           and another wound in the back of his head.

           He stumbles forward through the flaming debris.  Overwhelmed.

                                 CALE
                        Hello?!

           Suddenly, his legs give out.  Cale stumbles to the ground, 
           his head landing inches from a jagged piece of metal.

           Groaning, he looks through the smoky haze to see --

           The main control panel.  Charred.  Pieces broken away.  But 
           still clipped to it is a singed PHOTOGRAPH OF JESSE.

           Cale sees the picture.  Smiles through the pain before --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Cale awakens on the floor of the bathroom.  The flesh of his 
           right hand is burnt.  He groans in pain.

                                 CALE
                        Shit.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Cale turns on the water full blast, as hot as it will go.  He 
           opens the bathroom door, letting the steam escape.

           He watches as the water vapor floats out the door.  He peeks 
           out into the

           MAIN ROOM

           To see the lens of the camera over the door fogging up.

           Cale waits a moment, then slips across the room.

           He grabs the pen off the bedside table.  Unscrews it.  Pulls 
           out the spring and breaks it in half.

           Cale steps over to the door, using the broken spring as a 
           lock pick.  He twists it back and forth.

                                 CALE
                        Come on, come on.

           The lock clicks.  Cale twists the knob.  Steps out into

           THE HALLWAY

           And edges down the corridor, his legs shaky beneath him.

           Cale turns a corner.  Leans against the wall for support.

           SUDDENLY HE HEARS APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.

           Cale ducks around another corner.  Stands perfectly still --

           As the footfalls grow louder.  Closer.

           Cale breathes quietly.  Steadies himself against the wall --

           But his legs continue to shake under his weight.

           Cale stiffens.  Goes totally still --
           As an Orderly walks past in the adjoining hallway, less than 
           fifteen feet away.

           The Orderly continues on.  Footfalls receding.

           Cale lets out a relieved sigh.  Then continues down the hall.

           He turns one corner.  Then another.  His strides grow 
           shorter, more desperate.

           Finally Cale reaches the door to the machine room.  He slides 
           the broken pieces of spring into the lock. 

           He turns it back and forth.  Hands shaking.

           Tense moments pass.  Footsteps approach.

           Cale bears down.  Works frantically --

           Finally the lock clicks.  Cale tries the knob and the door 
           opens.  He catches a glimpse of the machine --

           When suddenly pairs of arms wrap around his body as two 
           Orderlies force him away from the door.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Cale closes his eyes.  Tries to focus his mind into a jump --

           But one of the Orderlies jams a syringe into the side of 
           Cale’s neck.

           Instantly Cale’s body goes limp.  Blackness.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Cale awakes groggily.  He goes to rub his eyes, only to find 
           that his arm is handcuffed to the bed frame.

           Leigh stands over him.

                                 LEIGH
                        You shouldn’t have done that.

                                 CALE
                        You.

                                 LEIGH
                        I’m disappointed in you.  I thought 
                        you’d finally come around.
                                 CALE
                        I know what you did.

           Leigh stares at him.  Cold.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        And even if I remember, I’ll never 
                        tell you what I did on the ship.

                                 LEIGH
                        Yes, you will.  I know you, Cale.  
                        You worked too hard on this project 
                        to let the secret of its success 
                        die with you.  You may not remember 
                        who you are, but that doesn’t 
                        change who you are.  You’ll do 
                        everything you can to remember, and 
                        then you’ll tell me how you did it.

           She leans down.  Kisses his forehead.  Cale jerks away.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, for all this.  I really 
                        am.  And I’m gonna make sure your 
                        sacrifice is never forgotten.  Get 
                        some rest.  You’re gonna need it.

           She rubs a hand along his cheek.  Then turns and walks out.  
           Cale watches her go.  Glaring.  Mind turning.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale lies in bed.  The red camera light shines brightly in 
           the darkness.  Cale stares at it in disgust --

           Until suddenly the camera light goes out.

           Cale sits up.  Confused.

           The sound of hurried footsteps in the hall.  The clatter of 
           keys.  The door lock clicks --

           And Matheson steps into the room.

                                 MATHESON
                        We have to move fast.

           He hastily unlocks Cale’s handcuffs.  Helps him out of bed.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Come on.
           He slides the IV stand over to Cale.  Cale grips it tight.  
           Grabs the papers off the table and follows Matheson into the

           HALLWAY

           And the two of them rush down the darkened corridor. 

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have much time.

           He grips Cale by the arm.  Helps him along.

                                 CALE
                        Thanks.

                                 MATHESON
                        Gotta keep moving.

           The two of them turn down another corridor.  Almost to the 
           door to the machine room --

           When all at once the door to the stairwell flies open behind 
           them and UNIFORMED GUARDS pour out with Leigh among them.

           Matheson pulls Cale along.  Frantic.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Come on!  Come on!

                                 LEIGH
                        Get him!

           The Guards sprint towards them.  Boots pounding.

                                 MATHESON
                        Hurry!

           Cale pushes him away.  Stands perfectly still.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           The Guards close in.  Only a few feet away. 

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Cale!

           Cale closes his eyes.  Takes a deep breath --

           And just as the Guards grab him there’s a FLASH and --
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Cale lies in bed.  He hears the rattle of keys through the 
           door.  Then the door opens and Matheson enters.

                                 MATHESON
                        We have to move fast.

           He hastily unlocks Cale’s wrist.

                                 CALE
                        The shower rod.

                                 MATHESON
                        What?

                                 CALE
                        Get the shower rod.

           Matheson slides the IV stand over to Cale then disappears 
           into the bathroom.

           Cale lowers himself to the floor.  He grips the IV stand for 
           balance, legs shaking.  Grabs the papers off the table as --

           Matheson emerges from the bathroom, shower rod in hand.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.

           The two of them step into the

           CORRIDOR

           And move quickly down the hall.

                                 MATHESON
                             (re: shower rod)
                        Why am I carrying this?

           Cale doesn’t answer.  They turn down another corridor and 
           Cale reaches back for the shower rod.

           Matheson hands it to him, and Cale slides it between the door 
           handles on the stairwell door.

           And no sooner is it in place then HEAVY FOOTFALLS sound in 
           the stairwell and Leigh’s face appears in the window.

           She tries to open the doors, but the rod holds them in place.

           Leigh glares at Cale through the window.  Venomous.  
           She turns to the Guards behind her.

                                 LEIGH
                        The other stairwell.  Go!  Go!

           Cale watches through the window as the Guards head back up 
           the stairs.  Matheson grabs him by the arm.

                                 MATHESON
                        We gotta hurry.

           The two of them continue down the hall.  They turn a corner, 
           then another, finally arriving at the machine room.

           Matheson slides his key card.  The lock clicks.  They enter

           THE MACHINE ROOM

           And Matheson bolts the door behind them.  Cale climbs into 
           the chair as Matheson powers up the machine.  

           Together they attach the leads to Cale’s head.  The low hum 
           of energy gradually fills the room.

                                 CALE
                        Thank you.

                                 MATHESON
                        This is insane, you know that?

           Suddenly there’s a HEAVY POUNDING on the door.  Cale hands 
           Matheson the two sheets with the power level settings.

                                 MATHESON (CONT’D)
                        Which one?

           Cale considers each.  Unsure.  Finally he points to one and 
           Matheson punches the settings into the control panel.

                                 CALE
                        Keep it going as long as you can, 
                        make sure I have enough time.

                                 MATHESON
                        Ready?

                                 CALE
                        Hit me.

           The electricity crescendos.  Matheson hits the button --

           AND A BRILLIANT BURST OF LIGHT FLASHES IN CALE’S MIND AS --
           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           The steady ca-chunk of the windshield wipers as rain beats 
           down.  Cale shudders.  Grips the wheel.  Stopped at a light.

           He glances at the dashboard clock.  12:42 AM.  Checks his 
           watch.  March 8th.

                                 CALE
                        Holy shit, it worked.

           A horn blast sounds from behind him.  The light is green.  
           But Cale doesn’t move.

           Hands fumbling, Cale reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out his 
           cell phone as the car behind him continues to honk.  He pulls 
           up the contact list.  Shuffles through.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Home, home.

           The car behind Cale honks one last time, then pulls around, 
           the DRIVER flipping him off.

           But Cale doesn’t see.  His head is buried in the phone.  
           There’s no listing for HOME.

           He scrolls down.  Finds JESSE.  Hits send.  And it goes 
           straight to voicemail --

                                 JESSE (V.O.)
                        Hey, you’ve reached Jesse --

           Cale hangs up.  Pounds a fist into the dash, frustrated,  
           rattling the GPS.

           He pulls up the GPS menu.  Finds a listing for HOME.       
           The directions pop up.

           Cale slams on the gas.  He whips the car around in the middle 
           of the intersection, speeding off as --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           The electrical hum is almost deafening.  Cale sits 
           unconscious in the chair, his body convulsing.

           Matheson watches in horror as the banging on the door grows 
           louder and louder.

           He presses himself against the door.  Holding it shut as --
           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Cale rockets down the street, blowing past stop signs.  The 
           voice from the GPS guides him.

                                 GPS
                        Turn right in point one miles.

           Cale cranks the wheel.  Spins the car around the turn.

           He glances at the GPS.  Less than a mile from home.

           The engine hums as Cale floors the gas pedal and --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Electricity humming.  Matheson puts all his weight on the 
           door.  But it begins to give way, the frame splintering.

           He groans in pain as --

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cale’s car squeals to a stop outside of the house.  He bolts 
           from the car.  Races up the drive.  Fumbles the keys.

           He pounds on the front door, trying each key.

                                 CALE
                        Jesse!

           Finally he finds the right key.  The door opens as --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           The latch finally gives.  Matheson tries to force the door 
           closed but he’s losing ground.  The door opens inch by inch 
           as the guards push it open as -- 

           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cale races in to find Jesse asleep in the bed.  He taps her 
           on the cheek, trying to wake her up.  No luck.

                                 CALE
                        Come on, come on.

           He grabs Jesse by the shoulders.  Shakes her.  Still nothing.
                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Jesse!

           Finally he picks her up off the bed.  Hoists her onto his 
           shoulders as --

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           The Guards force the door open.  Matheson backs away, 
           guarding the chair defensively.  Leigh steps between the 
           guards.  Eyes him coldly.

                                 LEIGH
                        Get out of the way.

                                 MATHESON
                        Not a chance.

           Leigh motions to the Guards.  They draw their guns as --

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cale lowers Jesse down onto the front lawn.  Begins CPR.

                                 CALE
                        Come on, baby.  Come on.

           He breathes air into her lungs.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           The Guards aim their guns on Matheson as Leigh stares him 
           down.  Matheson’s body trembles.  He tries to stay strong.

                                 LEIGH
                        Is he really worth all this?

                                 MATHESON
                        He’s my patient.

           Tense moments pass before --

                                 LEIGH
                        Grab him.

           The guards rush forward.  They pull Matheson away from the 
           chair where Cale sits unconscious as --
           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cale continues CPR.  He grows more frantic with each second.

                                 CALE
                        Come on, Jesse.

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Leigh steps to the control panel.  Matheson struggles against 
           the Guards as they hold him back.

                                 MATHESON
                        No!

           Leigh reaches for the power lever.  Fingers closing in as --

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cale breathes into Jesse’s mouth.  Pumps her chest.

           INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

           Leigh grips the lever.  Shuts the machine down as --

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Cale pounds on Jesse’s chest.

           A glimmer of light FLICKERS in his mind.

                                 CALE
                        No.  Please.  No!

           He keeps working as the light grows brighter.  And brighter --

           And just as the light overtakes Cale --

           JESSE JOLTS AWAKE, TAKING IN A DEEP GULP OF AIR AND --

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The slow, steady beeping of machinery.  Cale’s eyes flutter 
           open.  He’s seated in a chair by the bed --

           Where Jesse sleeps.  Sheets pulled up around her.
           Cale takes her hand.  Caresses it gently.  And her eyes open.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey you.

           Cale leans in.  Kisses her.

                                 CALE
                        Are you okay?

                                 JESSE
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.

                                 CALE
                        I was -- I was so worried.  I found 
                        you in the house and --

                                 JESSE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 CALE
                        The carbon monoxide leak.

                                 JESSE
                        Were you having a little dream?

                                 CALE
                        No, there was a leak.

                                 JESSE
                        Cale, that was months ago.  Why are 
                        you bringing that up --

           She’s cut off as a NURSE enters the room with a NEWBORN BABY.

                                 NURSE
                        Look who’s the first one awake in 
                        the nursery!

           Cale stares wide-eyed as the Nurse gently sets the baby in 
           Jesse’s arms.  The baby coos.

                                 JESSE
                        Hey, Andrew.  Say hi to daddy.

                                 CALE
                        Hey, little guy.

           Cale takes his son’s tiny hand.  Smiles.  He pulls his wife 
           and son in close.  Overwhelmed.
           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Cale stands at the window to the nursery, watching his son.  
           In the window’s reflection, he sees Leigh move in behind him.

                                 LEIGH
                        There you are!  How is he?

           Cale turns.  Simply stares at her.

                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Which one is he?  That one there?  
                        Oh, he’s so beautiful.  Can I see 
                        Jess or is she still sleeping?
                             (off Cale’s look)
                        What?  Something wrong?

                                 CALE
                        My memory’s been a little fuzzy but 
                        it’s starting to come back.  The 
                        ship, it’s never worked, never 
                        reached light-speed, has it?

                                 LEIGH
                        Because we haven’t had the right 
                        guy in the chair.  It’s gotta be 
                        you, Cale, I’m telling you.  You’re 
                        the only one who can make it work.

                                 CALE
                        That why you tried to kill my wife?

           Leigh steps back.  Visibly shaken.  Caught.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought.

                                 LEIGH
                        Cale, I would never --

                                 CALE
                        Don’t.  Just don’t.  I don’t know 
                        if I’ll ever remember how I made it 
                        work, but I can promise you this.
                        I’m gonna keep an eye on you, on 
                        the project, and if I think you’re 
                        getting close, I’m gonna derail it.  
                        I’m gonna devote the rest of my 
                        life to making sure that you never 
                        get what you’ve devoted yours to.  
                        Thought you should know now in case 
                        you’re wondering about it later.
           Leigh stands there.  At a loss for words.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna want to leave now.

           Leah turns, stunned.  And walks away.

           INT. CALE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cale grabs every notebook and scrap of paper on his desk and 
           shoves it into a cardboard box.  There’s drawings, 
           schematics, equations.  He clears off the whole desk.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Cale steps onto the elevator, cardboard box under his arm.  
           The doors close and elevator descends for a moment before the 
           doors open again and MATHESON steps on.

           Cale glances at him, stunned, as the two ride in silence.  
           Finally Matheson notices Cale looking at him and --

                                 MATHESON
                        Something wrong?

                                 CALE
                        Huh?  No, no.

                                 MATHESON
                        Do we know each other?

                                 CALE
                        I guess we don’t.

           The doors open.  Matheson gets out.  Cale watches him go as --

           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cale enters with the filled cardboard box to find Jesse 
           sitting on the couch, baby cradled in her arms.

           Cale kisses her sweetly.  Caresses the baby’s head.

                                 JESSE
                        You wanna sit with us?  I’m about 
                        to put him down for his nap.

                                 CALE
                        In a minute.  There’s one quick 
                        thing I gotta do.
           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Cale pulls a metal trash barrel to the middle of the 
           backyard.  He looks back towards the house --

           And through the window sees Jesse inside with the baby.      
           A smile slowly crosses his face.  He’s happy.  At peace.

           Cale then grabs the cardboard box and dumps all the papers 
           into the trash barrel.

           He strikes a match.  Hesitates.  Watches the flame dance --

           When suddenly the flame brushes against his finger.

           He winces in pain.  A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT AND THEN --

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Moments earlier.  Cale looks through the window of the house 
           to see his wife and child.  He’s smiling.  Happy -- 

           But his smile quickly fades as realization sets in.  This 
           isn’t over.  And as Cale stands there watching his family --

           THERE’S ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND --

           FADE OUT

           THE END
