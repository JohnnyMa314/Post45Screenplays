           “You know, I just love Grace Kelly. Not because she was a 
           princess, not because she was an actress, but because she was 
           just about the nicest lady I ever met. Grace brought into my 
           life as she brought into yours, a soft, warm light every time 
           I saw her, and every time I saw her was a holiday of its 
           own.”

           “I fell in love with Prince Rainier. What followed was more 
           difficult than I had thought.”
                               Her Serene Highness Gracia Patricia of Monaco
                                                            aka Grace Kelly

           EXT. ROCK OF MONACO - DAY

           A ‘58 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud navigates the winding mountain 
           roads of the Mediterranean Principality of Monaco. A man with 
           bulldog features peers out of the glass at the harbor 
           segueing into the sprawling sea. ALFRED HITCHCOCK, 62, the 
           legendary film director. He glumly surveys the wondrous 
           beauty of Europe’s playground for the rich and famous. The 
           yachts and the boats down below are like toys in the sparse, 
           freezing, yet idyllic winter setting. 

           It is December, 1961. 

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE OF MONACO. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           C.U. on a B&W PHOTOGRAPH of a blonde WOMAN and a MAN with 
           their backs to us, looking out at that same Monegasque vista. 
           A famous LIFE MAGAZINE PHOTO of GRACE KELLY and PRINCE 
           RAINIER III OF MONACO, taken shortly before their fairytale 
           wedding many years ago. A picture of dignified romance.

           Hitchcock sits under the CREST of THE GRIMALDIS, the ROYAL 
           HOUSE OF MONACO, staring at the photo. He is alone in a 
           gigantic waiting room, clutching his cane and hat in one 
           hand, and a screenplay in the other. He is surrounded by 
           CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS, and the portraits of the GRIMALDI 
           FAMILY looking down with the stern disapproval of history. 

           Hitchcock checks his watch impatiently, just as the door 
           CREAKS open and in walks MADGE TIVEY-FAUCON. Early 30s. The 
           stern, overly confident lady-in-waiting, who has worked hard 
           to lose her Australian heritage in a refined European palace.

                                 MADGE
                        Well come on, Mr Hitchcock, We 
                        don’t have all day.
           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. CORRIDORS - DAY

           Hitchcock walks in step with Madge through the magnificent 
           hallways of the 190-Room Palace. Their heels clip on the 
           marble, as PALACE STAFF rush by on their errands --

                                 MADGE
                        -- you are to refer to her as Your 
                        Highness or if you speak French you 
                        can call her Votre Altesse -- 

           -- now sweeping through a HALLWAY being refurbished -- 
           scaffolds erected and WORKMEN making a racket -- passing a 
           giant christmas tree -- 

                                 MADGE (CONT’D)
                        -- just Altesse is also acceptable, 
                        but Highness is not. Nor is 
                        Princess --

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Whatever you say, madam.

                                 MADGE
                             (stops)
                        I do not run a bordello, Mr 
                        Hitchcock. If you must, it’s Ma’am.
                             (then)
                        You’re not going to give me 
                        trouble, are you, Mr Hitchcock?

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Trouble?

           -- something SMASHES at the other end of the corridor -- 
           servants quickly chastise the culprit and clear up the mess. 
           Madge, wary of Hitchcock, walks on, as he follows towards a 
           set of GRAND DOUBLE DOORS -- the ROYAL QUARTERS -- 

                                 MADGE
                        Remember to nod your head when you 
                        first make her presence, but don’t 
                        bow. She’s not the Queen of England-

           She opens the doors for him. Hitchcock surveys the royal 
           quarters beckoning-

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        And you Madam, are not the Queen of 
                        Sheba. Good day.

           He walks into the royal quarters, leaving Madge speechless.
           INT. PRINCESS’ QUARTERS - DAY

           A PEN in slender female hands ... a long LETTER in BIG LOOPED 
           HANDWRITING to “MA KELLY”. BLUE EYES scan the text -- the 
           WOMAN’s lips pursing in thought -- then the pen moving to a 
           pad where she begins to practice a SIGNATURE: Grace de 
           Monaco, Grace de Monaco. Repeatedly. But can’t get it right. 
           A further pause ... before the pen returns to the letter and 
           the woman simply WRITES: “See you later alligator, Gracie.” 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hitchcock navigates the royal quarters ... to the STUDY ... 
           where he sees the solitary woman sitting at a bureau by the 
           window, her back to him, dressed practically in slacks and 
           blouse. The winter sun casts through the bars of the castle’s 
           windows like a gilded cage.

           He accidentally steps on a child’s squeaky toy, which breaks 
           the silence. The woman stops ... turns to face him- 

           GRACE KELLY. 32. Princess Grace of Monaco. The sharp cheek 
           bones, the depth behind her porcelain gaze, off-set by 
           striking blonde hair tucked back. Except now a mother of two, 
           her modern dress at odds with the world she inhabits, a 
           million miles from the fairy-tale of the newsreels. 

                                 GRACE
                        Hitch?

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Altesse.

           In an instant, her whole demeanor LIGHTS UP with joy, and she 
           breaks into BIG SMILE that lights up the whole room.

                                 GRACE
                        Are you ever a sight for sore eyes.  

           OVER -- we HEAR the SCREAMS of CHILDREN -- 

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. GREAT GARDENS / GREAT HALL - DAY

           Meet the shy PRINCE ALBERT, 3, in a woolly hat, picking his 
           nose as he hides behind Grace’s legs. He gets a disapproving 
           tap on the hand from Grace, as his diminutive older sister, 
           PRINCESS CAROLINE, 5, hands PRESENTS to their mother, which 
           she in turn is giving to every child that passes into the 
           hall. The parents each give a short nod or a curtsy to Grace. 
           The hall is decorated for the biggest kids’ CHRISTMAS PARTY 
           you’ve ever seen.

           (whenever a foreign language is spoken subtitles are assumed)
                                 GRACE (FRENCH)
                             (to parents)
                        Good day ... welcome ... Merry 
                        Christmas ... What a handsome young 
                        man ... 

           Hitchcock stands behind Grace, watching this magnificent act 
           of philanthropy, wincing at the DIN of children. Grace is 
           helped by Madge and a tall rangy brunette called PHYLLIS 
           BLUM, 23, Grace’s very practical and loyal personal secretary 
           (and the only American on her personal staff). 

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Where’s the Prince?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Oh, he never comes. Far too busy.

                                 HITCHCOCK
                             (off the children)
                        ALL the kids in Monaco?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Every Christmas.

           Hitchcock feels someone tugging at his coat tails. It’s 
           Princess Caroline.

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Yes?

                                 PRINCESS CAROLINE
                        You’re in my way.

           Hitchcock stares at the impudent little Princess with a 
           raised eyebrow. 

                                 GRACE
                        Caroline, apologize!

           Princess Caroline mumbles sorry, as Grace offers an 
           apologetic look to Hitchcock.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Grace takes the small podium ... a MICROPHONE ... standing 
           before more than five-hundred children and their parents ... 
           she clears her throat ... her hand imperceptibly shaking ... 
           She’s awkward. Nervous. An American careful not to break 
           decorum before the eyes of her European subjects-

                                 GRACE (FRENCH) (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to thank you all-
                             (feedback, which clears)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (FRENCH) (CONT’D)
                        -for once more gracing us at this 
                        precious time of year. You are 
                        Monaco’s future. The Prince, my 
                        husband, couldn’t be here today due 
                        to matters of state, but we wish 
                        you all a very Merry Christmas. 

           There’s APPLAUSE as she nods, smiles self-consciously, keen 
           to get off the stage. 

           EXT. GREAT GARDENS - DAY

           Hitchcock lays the SCRIPT down on the table. Grace sits 
           opposite him sipping her tea, eyeing the script, away from 
           the maddening crowd. She turns it around, trying not to seem 
           curious, eyeing the title.

                                 GRACE
                        Marnie ... hmm ... who’s the 
                        leading man ...?

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Oh I don’t know. Cubby Broccoli 
                        just made a spy movie with some 
                        Scottish fellow he’s raving about. 
                             (then)
                        It’s probably not going to be my 
                        best work, but it could be yours. 

           Hitchcock regards the footmen nearby, and Madge, never too 
           far away ... he leans forward, throwing Grace a lifeline-

                                 HITCHCOCK (CONT’D)
                        We start production in the spring. 
                        Universal will pay you one million 
                        dollars.

                                 GRACE
                        It’s not about the money, Hitch. 

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        It can be about whatever you want 
                        it to be. Certainly beats living 
                        with Mrs D’Anvers looking over your 
                        shoulder. Where was she when I was 
                        casting that role?

           Grace regards Madge going inside, then lingers on Hitchcock, 
           who seems genuinely concerned for her. A paternal figure.

                                 HITCHCOCK (CONT’D)
                        It’s going to be the role of a 
                        lifetime, Gracie.
                                 GRACE
                        Do I look that unhappy, Hitch?

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        You look tired, Gracie. 

           He says it with warmth and sincerity. A sympathetic smile, 
           before putting on his hat, picking up his cane-

                                 HITCHCOCK (CONT’D)
                        Now I have to get back to LA. I 
                        left Evan alone with Cary Grant and 
                        God only knows what they’ve done to 
                        my Birds script-

                                 GRACE
                        How is Cary?

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        His wife still sticks pins in your 
                        effigy every night.

           Grace chuckles. Hitchcock pleased to have made her laugh. He 
           takes his leave-

                                 GRACE
                        Hitch.
                             (he stops)
                        THIS is the role of a lifetime.

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        Yes, but you’re not playing it very 
                        well, your highness.

           He remembers to nod in curtsy, then leaves, taking that 
           flavor of Hollywood glamor with him. Grace, his blunt words 
           settling, as she realizes her personal secretary Phyllis 
           standing alongside her. Grace hands her the LETTER-

                                 GRACE
                        Mail this, will you please Phyllis? 
                        It’s going to my mother.  

           Phyllis nods and departs, as Grace picks up the script and 
           feels its weight in her hands ... only to notice MADGE has 
           been watching her from the window, and now moving away from 
           it.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        The place to be seen for New Year’s

           Grace smiles at the cameras and crowds, and waves. Her smile 
           lighting up the screen every time.

           INT/EXT. THE CHRISTINA - NIGHT

           The yacht is packed with hundreds of people. The elegant, the 
           beautiful, the powerful. Seeing in the NEW YEAR as a BAND 
           PLAYS by the swimming pool, beneath a banner that reads HAPPY 
           1962!. Drinks flow. Roulette and blackjack tables are manned 
           by croupiers. The lights of Monte Carlo in the background.

           We’re with Grace, moving through the guests. To her eyes, 
           these European aristocrats are somewhat grotesque, eccentric. 
           She simply smiles and nods as she glides among them, leading 
           De Gaulle’s wife, YVONNE VENDROUX, 61, through the party- 

                                 YVONNE
                        Are any of your Hollywood friends 
                        here?

                                 GRACE
                        This is Mr Onassis’ party. He likes 
                        to be the biggest drunk in the 
                        room.
                             (they share as smile)
                        Have you met Father Tucker? 

           FATHER FRANCIS TUCKER, 72, Prince Rainier’s seasoned Irish-
           American chaplain and counsel. 
           A kindly old soul with a glint in his eye, who played an 
           integral role in bringing together a lonely Prince and a 
           restless actress. For now, he’s propping up the bar, wearing 
           scarf and hat at a jaunty angle, motioning for a refill, 
           surprised as Grace takes his arm-

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Tuck married us you know.

           Father Tucker doffs his cap towards Yvonne.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Oh, how do you do, ma’am?

                                 GRACE
                        You know its against protocol to 
                        wear your hat indoors.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Pray don’t tell Madge. I won’t hear 
                        the end of it.

                                 GRACE
                        Have you seen Rainier?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Always talking business. Can’t seem 
                        to let it rest for one moment.

           Tucker nods towards a seating area where Onassis holds court-

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS. It’s ARISTOTLE ONASSIS, 56, 
           mischievous Greek tycoon, larger than life businessman and 
           bon viveur, pouring and serving while holding court- 

                                 ONASSIS
                        And that’s when I said, Maria my 
                        love, be proud of your scandals! 
                        What else will they write about 
                        when you’re gone?

           His girlfriend, MARIA CALLAS, the vivacious opera-singer, 38, 
           sighs with mild embarrassment-

                                 MARIA
                        That’s not how it happened at all- 

           Onassis belly-laughs. It’s infectious. We like him. He 
           notices Rainier’s older sister PRINCESS ANTOINETTE, 41, 
           perching herself on a chair- 
                                 ONASSIS
                        Madame, you are now sitting on the 
                        largest penis in the world.
                             (off her puzzlement)
                        The chair covers. They’re made from 
                        whale’s scrotum.

           Antoinette bounces up like she’s been electrocuted. 

           PRINCE RAINIER III. 38, Prince of Monaco. An ambitious young 
           monarch who married a Hollywood star against tradition. 
           Breaks from his conversation-

                                 RAINIER
                        It’s alright, Antoinette. Mr 
                        Onassis was simply joking.

                                 ONASSIS
                        I wasn’t.

                                 RAINIER
                        Is that how you speak to the 
                        monarch’s sister, Ari? Would you 
                        like me to confiscate your boat?

                                 ONASSIS
                        Would you like me to buy the rest 
                        of your tiny country?

           Onassis grins and hiccups. A common joke between him and the 
           Prince. Antoinette looks to her husband, the dutiful and ever-
           somber JEAN-CHARLES, 48, and decides to gingerly sit anyway. 

           Grace and Yvonne arrive into the thick of all this -- 

           Grace sits by Rainier as Yvonne takes her seat by PRESIDENT 
           CHARLES DE GAULLE. 72. This isn’t De Gaulle popularized in 
           uniform and mustache, this is De Gaulle during France’s Fifth 
           Republic. A dark-suited towering stern-faced ogre of a man 
           who has become France’s answer to Churchill. As he continues 
           his conversation with Rainier-

                                 DE GAULLE
                        I’m telling you, the British will 
                        always side with the Americans. 
                        Their Atlanticism will be the end 
                        of our culture. A third pillar. 
                        Between the Soviets and the United 
                        States. That’s what Europe must 
                        become.

                                 GRACE
                        What will I tell my children, Mr 
                        President? 
           Grace, searching her handbag for her cigarettes-

                                 DE GAULLE
                        About what?

                                 GRACE
                        They are Monegasque, yet also 
                        American. Should I perhaps drop 
                        them in the middle of the Atlantic?

           De Gaulle lingers on Grace’s soft manner. Somehow 
           disapproving of her position as a European Princess. 

                                 DE GAULLE (FRENCH)
                        That would be a pity. They are such   
                        delectable little creatures.

                                 GRACE (FRENCH)
                        They are most precious to me.

                                 DE GAULLE
                             (clasps his hands)
                        Tres bien! Your French has 
                        improved.

           De Gaulle turns to EMILE PELLETIER, a thin grey man, Monaco’s 
           French Minister of State, standing behind his chair-

                                 DE GAULLE (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t she adorable, Emile?

                                 PELLETIER
                        Adorable.

                                 RAINIER
                             (takes Grace’s hand)
                        Grace is the best ambassador I have 
                        ever had.

           Grace absorbs De Gaulle’s condescension, but her smile 
           doesn’t waiver, as De Gaulle lights her cigarette for her.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        Okay, let me ask your ambassador 
                        this question, Rainier- 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                             (arriving - interrupting)
                        Let us talk of lighter subjects, Mr 
                        President.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        This is just friendly conversation.
           Tucker takes Rainier’s side, his chief counsel, with a ‘don’t 
           let this happen’ glance to the Prince ... 

                                 RAINIER
                        Francis is right, Charles-

                                 DE GAULLE
                        I insist.

           Rainier knows De Gaulle won’t let it drop ... sits back, with 
           a thin smile ... as De Gaulle looks to Grace-

                                 DE GAULLE (CONT’D)
                        Right now, we are faced with a 
                        terrible war in Algeria. Yet as I 
                        try to deal with it, the O.A.S. a 
                        far right nationalist movement in 
                        my own country disagrees with my 
                        Algerian policy and has been trying 
                        to assassinate me. How should I 
                        deal with the OAS, or for that 
                        matter the Algerian colony?

                                 GRACE
                        One would ask why in heavens you 
                        would be fighting a war in Africa 
                        anyway. I suspect you should 
                        arrange a vote for the Algerian 
                        people and just concentrate on 
                        problems in your own country. 
                        Colonialism seems so last century.

                                 DE GAULLE
                             (niggled)
                        Maybe you’re right, Rainier. Maybe 
                        a Princess shouldn’t be occupying 
                        herself with such complex matters.

           He motions to a waiter to refresh his drink. Rainier, 
           relieved that this ended without an international incident.

                                 RAINIER
                        I’ll have a Bourbon, please.

                                 YVONNE
                        Tell me more about Los Angeles, 
                        Grace. I have been meaning to go, 
                        but of course, Charles doesn’t like 
                        the United States so much.

           But Grace isn’t listening, still calm, still cordial, still 
           demure, as she regards De Gaulle-
                                 GRACE
                        We were brought up to participate, 
                        Mr President. My father didn’t care 
                        what interests we had but we had to 
                        be interested in something. He 
                        would be terribly upset to see 
                        someone without enthusiasm.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        Of course. It is the American way.

                                 GRACE
                        Maybe if it had been the European 
                        way, we wouldn’t have had Fascism, 
                        Communism or the need for your ... 
                        third pillar. 

           De Gaulle. Stony faced. Onassis guffaws, breaking the 
           tension, but just making De Gaulle’s intellectual humiliation 
           worse. Rainier grows red with embarrassment. Grace sips her 
           drink, a picture of innocence. Father Tucker can’t help but 
           smile at the French President’s embarrassment.

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Rainier is pacing, furious. Grace sits removing her make-up. 

                                 RAINIER
                        This is not America, Grace, People 
                        don’t just - SPEAK - their minds!

                                 GRACE
                        Why not?

                                 RAINIER
                        Because that man is a vindictive 
                        psychopath, and he never forgets!

                                 GRACE
                        What did you expect me to say?

                                 RAINIER
                        I don’t know. You used to be an 
                        actor. Act.

           Madge walks in carrying a dress-

                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                        GET OUT, MADGE!

           Madge walks straight back out again. 

           Silence.
                                 GRACE
                        I’m sorry if I embarrassed you, 
                        Ray. But that man is a bully. 

                                 RAINIER
                        He’s the most powerful voice in 
                        Europe.

                                 GRACE
                        Isn’t this what you wanted us to 
                        teach Caroline and Albert? To never 
                        be afraid to speak your mind?

           Rainier pinches his tired eyes. Sighs. He knows she’s right-

                                 RAINIER
                        There’s a time and place for 
                        everything. I need De Gaulle on-
                        side if I’m to have any hope of 
                        modernizing this country.
                             (off her silence)
                        How was the children’s party?

                                 GRACE
                        It was wonderful. We missed you.

           A soft moment between them.

                                 RAINIER
                        Madge says Hitchcock came to see 
                        you.

                                 GRACE
                        Well that is a surprise.

                                 RAINIER
                        She’s just doing her job.

                                 GRACE
                        Her job is to be my lady-in-waiting 
                        not your eyes and ears.

                                 RAINIER
                        She was my personal secretary for a 
                        very long time. She is very loyal.
                             (then)
                        Is everything all right?

           Grace holds his gaze in the mirror. Beat. She nods and smiles-

                                 GRACE
                        He was just passing through. It was 
                        nice to see him.
           Rainier eyes her through the mirror, then relaxes, believing 
           the lie. He kisses her on the head.

                                 RAINIER
                        Good night, my love.

                                 GRACE
                        Good night.

           Rainier leaves. She watches the door close behind him. Her 
           wistful smile fades as she lingers on the silence, then 
           observes the make-up - her persona - on the cotton pads ...

           INT. PRINCE RAINIER’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Rainier, deep in thought, takes off his ceremonial uniform 
           and gets ready for bed. Brushing his teeth. Washing his face. 
           As he dries off, he lingers on the grim portrait of his 
           FATHER, Prince Pierre, forever looking down on him from among 
           his ancestors. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Caroline and Albert are fast asleep in their beds. Madge 
           dozes in a chair, clutching a book on EUROPEAN ROYAL HISTORY. 
           Grace leans quietly over her sleeping kids, tucking them in, 
           with a kiss for each child. As she gets up, she notices 
           bruises on Albert’s arm. She frowns. Bite marks.  

           Madge stirs and wakes, seeing her mistress in the room ...

                                 GRACE
                        Do you know how he got these?

           Madge gets up and peers ... now frowning in concern ...

                                 MADGE
                        My goodness. I’ll have words with 
                        the nanny. Albert was with the 
                        other kids this evening. 

                                 GRACE
                        You think one of them bit him?

                                 MADGE
                        Their playroom is usually 
                        indescribable disorder.

                                 GRACE
                             (concerned, but-)
                        It’s their way, I suppose.
           Madge is ruffled by Grace’s kindly, liberal approach.

                                 MADGE
                        What shall I do with your dresses 
                        for tomorrow? 

                                 GRACE
                        I’ll deal with it in the morning. 
                        It’s been an exhausting night.

                                 MADGE
                        I’ve always been very frank with 
                        you, ma’am. And I know we’ve ... 
                        never quite seen eye-to-eye. But if 
                        there’s ever any service I can be, 
                        it’s that you don’t try to change 
                        him. Rainier. You must make sure he 
                        doesn’t modernize too much.

                                 GRACE
                        How so?

                                 MADGE
                        By becoming too attached to what 
                        you perceive to be a modern 
                        sensibility.

                                 GRACE
                        Is that what you did when you left 
                        Australia, Madge? Lose your modern 
                        sensibility?

                                 MADGE
                        The House of Grimaldi is the oldest 
                        monarchy in Europe. It can be a 
                        petty, squabbling house, but it has 
                        survived by its own peculiar ways. 
                        You make Rainier happier than I’ve 
                        ever seen him. But your subjects 
                        will never forgive you if they felt 
                        you were alienating their prince 
                        with hot dogs and bourbon. 

                                 GRACE
                        Is that a warning?

                                 MADGE
                        It’s simple advice, ma’am. Find 
                        your place among your subjects. Or 
                        their love affair with you will end 
                        quicker than you’d expect.  

           Madge ... off Grace’s look ... picks up her book ... 
           INT. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           Grace walks the hallway alone to her chamber. Madge’s words 
           ringing in her ears. She stops at the door ... regards Prince 
           Rainier’s room. The door shut. Rainier’s distant SNORING 
           coming from behind it. She stands listening, taking in the 
           ghostly silence of the palace ...

           INT. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Grace pulls open a bureau drawer to reveal the script for 
           MARNIE. Beat. She takes it, crawls into bed, puts on reading 
           glasses ... and starts to read by the light of the bed lamp.

           EXT/INT. MONACO. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY

           The bureaucrats and civil servants come and go --

           INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

           A grand meeting of the Monaco Council. 

           Rainier sits surrounded by his cabinet, listening to EMILE 
           PELLETIER, Monaco’s de facto Prime Minister and De Gaulle’s 
           representative in Monaco, in a heated debate-

                                 PELLETIER
                        The top ten trucking contractors in 
                        Marseille have all relocated their 
                        registered addresses to Monaco-
                        Ville, yet don’t even have a 
                        working office here. 
                             (off his maps and papers)
                        One hundred and three new companies 
                        registered offices in Monaco in the 
                        last two years. Ninety per cent of 
                        them relocated from France. All of 
                        them came for your zero-tax policy. 

           JEAN-CHARLES REY, leader of the opposition, and Rainier’s 
           brother-in-law whom we met on Onassis’ yacht, leans forward. 

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        What do you want us to do about it?

                                 PELLETIER
                        Stop spending so much time actively 
                        courting French companies in Paris.
           Princess Caroline runs in, picks up her DOLL from the floor 
           of the cabinet room, her poodle OLIVER yapping after her. She 
           disturbs Pelletier, but Rainier doesn’t even notice.

                                 PELLETIER (CONT’D)
                        President De Gaulle is worried you 
                        are stealing French taxes and 
                        French jobs. 

                                 RAINIER
                        I know he pays your salary, but 
                        you’re supposed to be our Minister 
                        of State. Did you explain 
                        everything to him?

                                 PELLETIER
                        He’s very preoccupied with the war 
                        in Algeria right now. I can tell 
                        you he’s very concerned that French 
                        companies in Monaco will somehow 
                        finance attempts by the OAS on his 
                        life.

                                 RAINIER
                        That’s completely irrational. 

           Rainier surveys Pelletier, who is unmoved. Pelletier eyes him 
           wearily get up and walk to the MODEL of FUTURE MONACO by the 
           open balcony, before he regards little Caroline playing with 
           the dog. Her disregard for decorum grates with Pelletier. 
           Rainier surveys the great CASINO in the square opposite-

                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                        Monaco has only ever been about the 
                        casinos. That’s what I inherited. A 
                        playground for French aristocracy. 
                        Your wealthy come, spend, and go. 

                                 PELLETIER
                        And that’s a problem? 

                                 RAINIER
                        Let me tell you something, Emile, 
                        what Monaco was is not what Monaco 
                        will be. Ten thousand people live 
                        here. In fifteen years it will be 
                        twenty-thousand. Most of them 
                        aren’t rich, aren’t from nobility, 
                        they’re ordinary working class 
                        people who need schools, hospitals, 
                        a social safety net. I’m 
                        responsible for that, and the 
                        casinos alone can’t pay for it. We 
                        make nothing, we export nothing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAINIER (CONT'D)
                        There are no arable lands, no 
                        agriculture, we still haven’t 
                        recovered from the second world 
                        war. 

                                 PELLETIER
                        What are you proposing?

                                 RAINIER
                        I’m proposing that if your 
                        aristocrats are going to drain 
                        Monaco, then it is not unreasonable 
                        for us to attract French businesses 
                        to pay for its upkeep.

                                 PELLETIER
                        Well, it certainly puts us at an 
                        impasse, your highness. Because the 
                        President wants you to not only 
                        impose income tax on Monaco, but to 
                        pay the proceeds to France.

           There’s a stir. One of the ministers, MONSIEUR DELAVENNE, 
           Minister of the Interior, grows indignant-

                                 DELAVENNE
                        You want us to pay tax to France?

                                 PELLETIER
                        You are a French protectorate which 
                        has only ever existed because of 
                        the good will of France. 

                                 RAINIER
                        What is this? Some kind of 
                        protection racket? We’re a 
                        sovereign nation. No matter how 
                        hard Charles finds that to stomach.

                                 PELLETIER
                        I am to return to Paris tomorrow 
                        with your answer. 

           Pelletier, done, gets up. Rainier watches him pack, then 
           softens, trying to appeal to Pelletier’s human nature- 

                                 RAINIER
                        Emile, does President De Gaulle 
                        really want the children of Monaco 
                        to grow up to be croupiers? 

                                 PELLETIER
                        Some would say that would be an 
                        improvement.

                             (off Caroline)
                        Some of Monaco’s offspring are 
                        running around like the 
                        grandchildren of a Philadelphia 
                        bricklayer.

           The ministers shuffle uncomfortably. Pelletier gathers his 
           stuff -- as Rainier, his expression frozen on his face ... 
           anger visibly rising -- and -- 

           SLAP! Rainier’s open palm STRIKES Pelletier across the cheek, 
           KNOCKING him to the ground! Pelletier clutches his face, 
           SHOCKED, tears of pain forming in his eyes, his papers fly up-

           Caroline stops playing with her toys. 

           SHOCKED SILENCE as Pelletier looks up from the floor at 
           Rainier bearing down on him ...

                                 RAINIER
                        Get on the first bus back to Paris, 
                        Emile. And tell your President that 
                        Monaco no longer needs a ‘French’ 
                        Minister of State. We can choose 
                        our own Prime Minister.

                                 PELLETIER
                        You ... you can’t fire me ...

           Rainier, standing over Pelletier with his fists clenched, 
           before his official guards dutifully pick the dazed Frenchman 
           up off the floor, gather his papers and carry him out. 

           Rainier gathers Caroline up into his arms, makes a FACE at 
           her to make her LAUGH when he sees she’s afraid.

           The rest of the room processes what just happened. Delavenne 
           somberly removes his glasses and pockets them.

                                 DELAVENNE
                        De Gaulle will not take this well.

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. FRENCH PRESIDENT’S PALACE - DAY

           A man’s polished shoes urgently clip on the MARBLE. Through 
           hallways - an ante-room, passing aides and assistants towards 
           the President’s Office --  It’s Pelletier. And he is UPSET. 
           INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY

           President De Gaulle hovers over a map of ALGERIA and THE 
           MEDITERRANEAN, in conversation with his military officers and 
           MINISTER FOR DEFENSE -- when Pelletier barges in -- 

                                 DE GAULLE
                        What are you doing back here?

                                 PELLETIER
                        He hit me.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        Who did ... ?

                        Prince Rainier. He has made his 
                        intentions very clear.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        He struck a representative of 
                        France? 

                                 PELLETIER
                        And banned me from ever returning 
                        to Monaco.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        Did you say something to annoy him?

                                 PELLETIER
                        I merely expressed that he may want 
                        to examine where his loyalties lie.
                             (then - closer)
                        He is beating the drum for national 
                        identity, Mr President. He’s grown 
                        dangerously anti-French.

           De Gaulle grows silent. This is like a red rag to a bull. 

           INT. PRINCESS GRACE HOSPITAL. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A sign on the door: RED CROSS COMMITTEE MEETING, PRIVATE.

           A table-tag in front of Grace at the conference table -- HSH 
           Princess Grace, President -- she is flanked by her young 
           secretary Phyllis, who is dutifully taking notes. They are 
           surrounded by the LADIES OF THE RED CROSS, wives of 
           Monegasque aristocrats who sit on this philanthropic 
           committee. Helping themselves to the tea and cake buffet --

           It’s a RABBLE of CHATTER. In MONEGASQUE, the local dialect, 
           which Grace doesn’t understand --
                                 GRACE
                        Ladies! If we can please just 
                        concentrate on the issue. The local 
                        orphanage is severely underfunded, 
                        whichever way we look at it. 

           COUNTESS BACIOCHI, 50s, large, outspoken, sets down her tea-

                                 BACIOCHI
                        Ma’am, we cannot justify the 
                        orphanage being financed from our 
                        budget. The hospital already 
                        accounts for most of our spending.

                                 GRACE
                        I can pay from palace funds.

                                 BACIOCHI
                        If the palace pays for the 
                        orphanages, the retirement homes 
                        will expect you to do the same, and 
                        then the schools. It sets a bad 
                        precedent. 

                                 GRACE
                        How about the palace gives you an 
                        endowment, the Red Cross pays for 
                        the orphanages, no one need know-

                                 BACIOCHI
                        It’s very irregular.

                                 GRACE
                        We can fit all of our orphans into 
                        one hospital wing, so there’s no 
                        reason why we can’t guarantee them 
                        some dignity. We’re only converting 
                        an open dormitory so each child can 
                        have his or her own separate living 
                        area. Surely you can’t have a 
                        problem with that, whatever class 
                        these children may come from.  

           Grace regards the aristocratic women, staring back blank.

                                 BACIOCHI
                        Maybe we can vote for it at our 
                        plenary session tomorrow.
                             (changing the subject)
                        The next matter on the docket is 
                        the Annual Red Cross Ball.

                                 GRACE
                        That isn’t due until October.
                                 BACIOCHI
                        No, ma’am. But we’ll need to start 
                        planning now. The annual ball is 
                        the most important party in our 
                        social calender. 

           Beat. Grace, frustrated- closing her notebook.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sorry, Countess, I mistakenly 
                        thought we were here for charity.

           INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR - DAY

           Grace. Out the door, Phyllis struggling to keep up with her -- 
           into the elevator -- punches the button -- glimpses the 
           aristocratic wives of Monaco, chattering away in their little 
           bubble. She will never be one of them-

                                 GRACE
                        The Red Cross will be the death of 
                        me, Phyllis.

           As the doors close --

           EXT. ROCK OF MONACO. MOUNTAIN ROADS - DAY

           The GROWL of an ENGINE. Grace. Her lips pursed, that 
           frustrated frown still etched on her face. Her scarf blowing 
           in the wind, as the odometer pushes 50, 60, 70. The Riviera 
           whizzes past. She is driving ALONE- 

           She turns the steering wheel one way, then the other, 
           navigating some hair-raising turns -- cars shoot by in the 
           opposite direction -- before a BUS appears from a BLIND 
           CURVE, head-on, but she swerves expertly around it, ignoring 
           the HORNS -- when -- 

           An old peasant woman carrying a bag of potatoes crosses her 
           path. Grace SLAMS on the brakes, the car SQUEALS to a halt 
           inches from the woman. Grace exhales. The woman doesn’t even 
           see who is behind the wheel, she just walks across the road 
           and down the dirt path, disappearing from view. 

           Grace. Silence. Slots the car back into gear. It CHOKES, 
           rolls a few feet, and dies. Grace sits back. 

           EXT. COUNTRY-SIDE - DAY

           Grace walks bare-foot through the field, her heels in her 
           hand, towards the RECTORY -- 
           EXT. RECTORY - DAY

           The DOORBELL. Father Tucker opens the door, surprised to see 
           Grace standing lost and dishevelled on the other side. 

                                 GRACE
                        Can you drive me home please?

           INT. RECTORY. LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

           We see Tucker’s sparse existence. A humble old man who lives 
           alone. Grace eyes PHOTOS of his EXTENDED FAMILY, the EMPTY 
           LIQUOR BOTTLES, the PIPE, the piles of CORRESPONDENCE marked 
           ‘DELAWARE USA’, as Tucker gets his coat and subtly hides the 
           letters. He observes Grace sitting in silence.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Are you alright?

                                 GRACE
                        Did I make a mistake?  

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        What kind of mistake?

                                 GRACE
                        I can’t speak my mind for it might 
                        offend someone, Tuck. Everything I 
                        do or say is wrong. Do you know how 
                        I spent most of my afternoon? 
                        Trying to get a group of noble 
                        ladies who have never done a day’s 
                        work to pay for partitions in a 
                        children’s orphanage. Wall 
                        partitions. Instead they’d rather 
                        waste their time planning a Ball 
                        because orphans clearly aren’t high 
                        on their agenda.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You’re in Monaco, Grace. A country 
                        with eight-hundred years of 
                        history. They have their ways.

                                 GRACE
                        Well it isn’t my way. To think I 
                        came here thinking I might actually 
                        be able to make a difference.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Were your children a mistake? Was 
                        your family a mistake?
           Grace. Clearly not, but that doesn’t solve her problem.

           INT. TUCKER’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Tucker drives Grace in silence, rolling through the sleepy 
           streets of Monaco-Ville. Grace regards the beauty through her 
           own reflection in the window.

                                 GRACE
                        What d’you think would happen if I 
                        went back to making movies?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        What’s the movie about?

                                 GRACE
                        A frigid, compulsive thief. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You always know how to make things 
                        easy for yourself.
                             (off her look -- they 
                              share a smile)
                        Have you talked to Rainier?

                                 GRACE
                        I’m afraid he’ll say no.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        When has he ever said no to 
                        anything you’ve asked for?
                             (beat)
                        If there’s anything I’ve learned, 
                        it’s people have a habit of 
                        surprising me. Not least of all 
                        Ray. There’ll be those who won’t 
                        like the thought of a Princess 
                        acting, but I guess they made up 
                        their minds about you a while ago. 

                                 GRACE
                        Like Madge?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Madge is a nobody. 

           Grace surveys Tucker, this genteel old man who knows so much.

                                 GRACE
                        What’s the secret Tuck?
                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        My dear, being a princess requires 
                        more than just being a model 
                        housewife and mother. 

           Grace, finding solace in his wise gaze. An ally. They are 
           disturbed by a commotion in the PALACE GROUNDS, where a dozen 
           official vehicles block their path.

                                 GRACE
                        What’s going on ... ?

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. GREAT OFFICE - DAY

           A CRISIS ROOM has been formed. An emergency meeting of the 
           Monaco Council. The TV is on. Everyone silently watching. 
           Jean-Charles Rey sees Grace and Tucker enter, and waves them 
           in, motioning silence, even as phones ring in the background. 

           Rainier lights a cigarette, as President De Gaulle reads a 
           statement on TV:

                                 DE GAULLE (FRENCH)
                        We have set a time limit of six 
                        months for Monaco to impose income 
                        tax on its people, levies on its 
                        businesses, and to cease its active 
                        courtship of French companies. If 
                        our concerns are not met within 
                        this time-frame, we shall not only 
                        commence an economic blockade of 
                        the principality, but will not 
                        hesitate to reclaim it for France.

           News cuts to a French PRESS CONFERENCE where a man makes a 
           show of making phone calls. The legend reads: Valery Giscard 
           d’Estaing, French Minister of Finance -- he lets the phone 
           ring off the hook -- then puts the phone down and redials --

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                             (to Grace - whispers)
                        He’s calling the registered office 
                        of every French company relocated 
                        to Monaco.

                                 D’ESTAING (FRENCH)
                        See? No one answers. French 
                        companies with empty offices in 
                        Monte Carlo. And these-
                             (holds up papers)
                        -these are the financial accounts 
                        and correspondence of Monaco’s 
                        government with these businesses.

                        Stealing money from the French 
                        treasury. We will stop this even if 
                        it means by force.

                                 RAINIER
                        Turn it off. 

           Rainier paces as someone switches off the TV. 

                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                        This is a disaster. How did he get 
                        hold of confidential government 
                        papers? 

                                 DELAVENNE
                        We must have a leak.

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        More likely Pelletier took them 
                        with him.

           The door opens and in walks RUPERT ALLAN Jr., 58. Legendary 
           Hollywood publicist. 

                                 RAINIER
                        Rupert, how are you? Come, sit. You 
                        know everybody, Rupert Allan, our 
                        chief publicist from Rogers & Cowan 
                        in Los Angeles. He’s going to work 
                        on my official statement. 

           Rupert takes his seat with a nod of recognition to all, 
           including Grace, who is simply observing in silence.

                                 DELAVENNE
                        We should call a press conference, 
                        go on a public offensive. We need 
                        to explain our side of the story.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Publicity is not the answer. It’ll 
                        only antagonize him.

                                 RAINIER
                        I think you’ve strayed too far from 
                        the parish, Francis.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You’re never too old to be spared 
                        the rod, my boy. 

           Rainier regards Tucker -- the only man able to take a tone 
           with him-
                                 RAINIER
                        Okay, fine, what do you think I 
                        should do?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Call De Gaulle and apologize. Tell 
                        him it’s all been a terrible 
                        mistake. Propose a compromise. 

                                 RAINIER
                        Poppycock.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You don’t have an army. You don’t 
                        have a navy. You’re in no position 
                        to hardball the French President. 
                        Especially as he’s about to lose 
                        Algeria and he needs to show his 
                        people that he’s strong. He’s made 
                        a bold threat, he’ll carry it out. 

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        He’s right. Our food, our water, 
                        our power, everything runs through 
                        France. We’ll be squashed in an 
                        instant.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You need to take control of the 
                        situation by seeming contrite. That 
                        will buy you time, appease his ego. 
                        A space to think. Plan. For the 
                        next move. 

                                 RAINIER
                        Cardinal Richelieu had nothing on 
                        you, Francis.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        It was your temper that got you 
                        into this mess. I’ve always warned 
                        you about that. Monaco hasn’t 
                        lasted this long by locking horns 
                        with France. 

           Rainier, off Tucker, begrudgingly looks to his ministers ... 
           and nods. Grace has watched this all unfold in silence. 
           Rainier notices her watching. He seems to draw himself 
           together, trying to seem more decisive. 

                                 RAINIER
                        Very well. Let’s start by trying to 
                        be humble.
           INT. GRAND DINING HALL - EVENING

           Grace and Rainier eat supper with their kids. Family meal. 
           Oliver the poodle sits gnawing on a bone in the corner of the 
           room. Otherwise, they eat in silence.

                                 RAINIER
                        This pumpkin soup’s great. Maureen 
                        made it?

                                 GRACE
                        My new recipe.

           More silence.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        What if he doesn’t accept your 
                        apology? Are we going to war?

                                 RAINIER
                        If we do, it’ll be the shortest war 
                        in the history of mankind.

                                 GRACE
                        Are we stealing his taxes?

                                 RAINIER
                        France has been bleeding us dry for 
                        centuries. 
                             (then - more circumspect)
                        Somebody asked my father once, if 
                        you could be any monarch, which 
                        monarch would you be? He said 
                        either the Tsar of Russia, or the 
                        Prince of Monaco. The Tsar because 
                        he knows the name of none of his 
                        subjects ... and the Prince of 
                        Monaco because he knows all of 
                        them.
                             (leans in - with passion)
                        Monaco used to stand for something. 
                        An ideal. If my choice is pay money 
                        to De Gaulle to fund his colonial 
                        wars, or take what’s rightfully 
                        ours and use it to give our people 
                        a better life, then it’s not a 
                        choice I’d contemplate.

           Beat. He starts to eat again. The weight of expectation on 
           his shoulders isn’t lost on Grace. A sense that they share a 
           common idealism.
                                 GRACE
                        Why don’t you ask Onassis to help 
                        you? He’d do anything for you.

                                 RAINIER
                             (chews thoughtfully)
                        That’s a good idea. I will. 
                             (then)
                        How did it go with the Red Cross? 
                        Will they redevelop the orphanage?

                                 GRACE
                        The treasury’s going to pay.

                                 RAINIER
                        I bet Countess Baciochi was pleased-

                                 GRACE
                        She said it was irregular. Whatever 
                        that may mean. 

                                 RAINIER
                        It means you’re forcing her do 
                        something for a reason other than 
                        to her own benefit.

                                 GRACE
                        You should see the conditions, Ray. 
                        Those kids can’t live like that.

           He eyes her with a sense of pride, yet-

                                 RAINIER
                        Make sure you don’t upset her too 
                        much, okay? I need her husband’s 
                        political support.

           Grace. His seeming support now a little less meaningful.

           Beat.

                                 GRACE
                        Hitchcock offered me a role.

                                 RAINIER
                        Oh?

                                 GRACE
                        I think it might be inappropriate 
                        to accept now.

                                 RAINIER
                        Were you considering accepting?
                                 GRACE
                        I’ve thought about it.

                                 RAINIER
                        It means that much to you?

                                 GRACE
                        I miss it.

           Rainier mulls the sentiment, then back to cutting his chicken-

                                 RAINIER
                        You should do it.
                             (off her surprise)
                        Did you think I was going to say 
                        no?

                                 GRACE
                        Well I just presumed ... 

                                 RAINIER
                        If you really can’t do without it, 
                        then ... I won’t stand in your way. 

                                 GRACE
                        But would it be appropriate? I 
                        don’t want people thinking I’m 
                        running away, or abandoning you.

                                 RAINIER
                        The only thing I ask is you manage 
                        the publicity. Get Rupert to word a 
                        release before he returns to Los 
                        Angeles. You’ll find that your 
                        subjects will tolerate just about 
                        anything, as long as they know you 
                        have their best interests at heart. 

           Grace nods, relieved it turned out so much easier than she’d 
           dreaded. Even if his last words don’t ring true for her.  

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

           Grace steps out onto her bedroom balcony, and watches her 
           husband taking Caroline and Albert for a stroll in his 
           PRIVATE ZOO in the garden. Past lions, leopards and monkeys 
           in their cages. If nothing else, Rainier is wonderful around 
           his kids. They look up at her and wave. She waves back, 
           feeling almost content for the first time in a long time. 
           INT. OFFICE OF PRINCESS GRACE - DAY

           THREE MEN in suits sit beneath a giant oil painting of Fifth 
           Avenue. They are the stuffy and dundering EMILE CORNET, 
           Palace Press Officer, equally stuffy GEORGE LUKOMSKI, Palace 
           Photographer and the colorful Monsieur Delavenne, Minister of 
           the Interior, whom we have already met. Phyllis and Madge are 
           also present along with Rupert Allan. The three visitors get 
           to their feet as Grace enters-

                                 GRACE
                        Gentlemen, I have wonderful news. 
                        I’m going to make a film. For Mr 
                        Alfred Hitchcock.  
                             (off the silence - smiles)
                        Try not to look too astonished. 

           The three men swap concerned glances.

                                 DELAVENNE
                        No Princess of Monaco has ever 
                        taken to the stage or screen 
                        before, Altesse.

                                 GRACE
                        There’s always a first time for 
                        everything Monsieur Delavenne.

                                 CORNET
                        What about your duties, ma’am? And 
                        the crisis, I’m not sure how we can 
                        present this in a way that won’t 
                        cause outrage. 

                                 GRACE
                        This is 1962, Monsieur Cornet. I 
                        can be a mother, a wife, and hold 
                        down two jobs without the people 
                        getting too upset, can’t I?

                                 CORNET
                        And the Prince, ma’am?

                                 GRACE
                        What about the Prince? 
                             (off his silence)
                        Mr Allan and I are going to write 
                        the statement. You will hold on to 
                        it until our conversations with 
                        France are resolved. Mr Hitchcock 
                        has agreed to be patient, and we 
                        shall be most discreet.
                                 CORNET
                        What about the studio? They will 
                        want to publicize it.

                                 GRACE
                        They’ve agreed to follow your lead. 
                        They will only publish when the 
                        palace publishes. Which won’t be 
                        until the crisis is over.

           Cornet nods. Though with a strong air of disapproval.

                                                                CUT TO:

           GRACE’S PRESS RELEASE, being TYPED by PHYLLIS, as Grace and 
           Rupert Allan oversee it. We can’t hear what is being said, 
           just seeing some of the words being typed. It is sealed and 
           handed to MADGE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Cornet. Reading the release. He looks to MADGE who has 
           delivered it, before returning it to the envelope, and 
           depositing it into his filing cabinet. He LOCKS the cabinet. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Grace bathes Caroline and Albert. The kids SPLASH away in the 
           huge bath, as she turns to pick up their towels.  

                                 GRACE
                        Okay, kids, time to get out-

           Grace glances in the mirror to see CAROLINE leaning over and 
           BITING her little brother on the arm. Albert immediately 
           bursts into TEARS. Grace spins on her heels-

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Caroline! 

           Grace picks up Albert, wraps him in a towel, soothes him. She 
           looks to Caroline once more, the culprit for her brother’s 
           bite marks, now looking contrite.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Why would you do such a thing?

           Caroline SHRUGS. Grace sets Albert down, then sits over her. 
           She takes Caroline’s arm. Puts her on mouth to it, and bites 
           gently, then harder, then a little harder- Caroline SQUEALS 
           and pulls her arm back. She retreats from her mom. Afraid. 
                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        That’s how you made your little 
                        brother feel. It’s not nice, is it?

           Caroline ... beat ... shakes her head ... Grace softens, 
           holds the towel up, before Caroline ... wary of her mother, 
           allows herself to be wrapped. Grace turns to see Madge in the 
           doorway, having seen what happened.

                                 MADGE
                        You asked for Wednesday’s itinerary 
                        for the hospital tour ...   

                                 GRACE
                             (noting the surprise)
                        I found the biter. 
                             (off the look)
                        Spare me the indignation, Madge.

           Madge gently stops her from passing-

                                 MADGE
                        The acting, your highness. It will 
                        not end well. 

           Grace absorbs this, and walks on.

           A huddle of photographers and reporters -- US and European 
           PRESS -- following Grace on an official visit to the 
           ORPHANAGE in the newly unveiled hospital wing. We can clearly 
           see the brand new partitioned off living areas. Grace has won 
           her battle, and is among the kids, exchanging words with the 
           orphanage staff. A YOUNG GIRL presents her with a PICTURE OF

           A murmur of WARM LAUGHTER. There’s a lot of goodwill in the 
           air towards philanthropy as Grace plays with the KIDS --

                        Well, I think we have to work hard 
                        to make sure that standards for 
                        those who aren’t privileged are no 
                        different to those who are;  
                        wherever in the world they may be. 
                        And we’re starting at home, with 
                        something as simple as ensuring 
                        sanitation, privacy and dignity for 
                        those in our orphanages and

                        lucky enough to be born into wealth 
                        or marry a prince.

           More laughter. Grace glances over to Madge, who is standing 
           at the back of the room, whispering with Countess Baciochi... 
           Grace dwells on the seeming conspirators ...

                        funny business. They swear blind.

           Silence as Grace absorbs what this could mean.

                        I’ll need a little more time,

                        I can talk to the studio. If it 
                        helps, we can push it back into

                        That cannot be. I ... I put it here 
                        and locked it. I have the only key.

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. GRACE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Grace clutches the NEW YORK MIRROR, the headline: PRINCESS 
           GRACE TO RETURN FROM FAIRY-TALE, reading out loud:

                                 GRACE
                        “The fact that wife Grace Kelly is 
                        returning to her movie career - no 
                        matter what the reason - is 
                        indicative that something in some 
                        way has gone wrong with her 
                        marriage.” Why do they write such 
                        lies, Rupert?

           We’re in Grace’s own crisis room. The PHONE is on CONFERENCE, 
           Rupert is on the speakerphone from his OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES 
           (we may cut to him, but most of the action focuses on Grace). 
           Every major publication stacked high, Phyllis and Madge 
           sifting through them, a very embarrassed Cornet in attendance 
           with his PR juniors-

                        Try to avoid reading what Hedda 
                        Hopper’s writing. I think she’s 
                        been penning your obituary for a 
                        while. The bigger question is how 
                        did the release get out from Mr 
                        Cornet’s office? 

           All eyes to the bumbling Cornet- 
                                 CORNET
                        I suspect an intern must have 
                        become confused and put it on the 
                        distribution pile. But I still 
                        don’t see how. I have the only key 
                        to the cabinet, and only one person 
                        knew where I put the release.

           He looks to Madge, who is affronted.

                                 MADGE
                        How dare you, Mr Cornet? 

                                 CORNET
                        I’m only suggesting a mistake may 
                        have happened.

                                 MADGE
                        There are certain things about 
                        which I do not make mistakes. Not 
                        least of all unlocking your locked 
                        filing cabinet in error.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Or it wasn’t a mistake. 

                                 MADGE
                        I’m sorry?

           Phyllis and Madge stare at each other. Grace, unsure what to 
           make of all of this-

                                 GRACE

                        Rupert, stay on the line please.

           The staff get up and leave, as Grace catches a moment alone 
           with Rupert who remains on the speakerphone.

                        during your summer vacation to the 
                        States, that you were planning to

                        fund. But I need you to keep a low

                        Is there any truth to what they’re 
                        saying about you and Rainier? Off 
                        the record?

                                 RUPERT
                        If I were less loyal, Gracie, I’d 
                        say ‘how dare you’?

                                 GRACE
                        How dare I? How dare they?

                        How dare they do this to me?

           Silence.

                                 GRACE
                        Sure.

           They hang up on each other. Grace, feeling very much alone 
           and unwanted in this huge palace.

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE OF MONACO. HALLWAYS - EVENING

           A procession of civil servants and politicos head to the 
           SUMMIT ROOM where an official phone conference has been set 
           up. Grace lingers in the halls, eyeing everyone with a sense 
           of distrust, before seeing Father Tucker-

                                 GRACE
                        Tuck.

           She motions for him into an ante-room-

           INT. ANTE-ROOM - EVENING

           Tucker sits listening gravely to Grace, in hushed tones ...

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t think it was an accident, 
                        Tuck. I think somebody wanted to 
                        leak this. Madge, or Cornet, I 
                        don’t know, but somebody. What I 
                        can’t work out is why? Do they 
                        detest me that much?
                                 TUCKER
                        This isn’t about you. I daresay 
                        somebody just used you to light a 
                        fire under Rainier’s problem. It 
                        all depends how De Gaulle reacts.

                                 GRACE
                        Why should De Gaulle care? 

                                 TUCKER
                        Perception, my dear. It’s very 
                        important to a man as proud as De 
                        Gaulle what the superpowers think 
                        of him. You going back to Hollywood 
                        at a time of crisis will only be 
                        seen as a brazen insult. You can 
                        only hope he doesn’t read either 
                        the New York Mirror or Look 
                        magazine.

                                 GRACE
                        Ugh, why does everything have to be 
                        so complicated?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Is there anybody on your staff you 
                        absolutely trust?

                                 GRACE
                        Phyllis. She’s an honest girl from 
                        upstate New York. I handpicked her. 

           Grace watches Tucker, the wheels of his mind turning-

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        In fifteen minutes, Ray is going to 
                        pledge his allegiance to France in 
                        order to bring De Gaulle to the 
                        negotiating table. But if he starts 
                        to suspect we have a traitor in the 
                        palace, he’ll start by punching De 
                        Gaulle in the nose. Figuratively 
                        speaking.

                                 GRACE
                        That’s why I haven’t told him yet.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        There may be no good time to tell 
                        him at all. We need this crisis to 
                        go away. If Ray asks, call it 
                        incompetence and blame the palace 
                        Press Office. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FATHER TUCKER (CONT'D)
                        Get Phyllis, get the superintendent 
                        of palace security, he’s very 
                        discreet, conduct your own 
                        investigation into the leak. In 
                        fact, I don’t even believe this is 
                        an isolated incident. I’m not 
                        convinced De Gaulle got hold of our 
                        government papers from Pelletier. 
                        We have spies in the palace. But 
                        remember, for the good of the 
                        country, Ray mustn’t be troubled.

           Grace nods, forever a student in Tucker’s company.

                                 RAINIER (O.S.)
                        Ray mustn’t be troubled by what?

           Tucker and Grace turn to see Rainier in the doorway, 
           adjusting his tunic. Beat. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Altesse was just wondering whether 
                        we should fire Mr Cornet. The press 
                        office really made a mess of this 
                        Hitchcock announcement.

                                 RAINIER
                        Was it his fault? 

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know.
                             (then)
                        Are you mad?

                                 RAINIER
                             (struggling with the 
                              buttons, clearly not 
                              happy-)
                        These things happen. It can’t be 
                        helped. Francis, we can’t keep the 
                        French waiting.

                                 GRACE
                        Oh Ray, you’ve- 

           She tuts and unbuttons the top of the tunic. He’s absent-
           mindedly missed a hole, she adjusts it.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        You do get caught up in your own 
                        silly little head sometimes.

           She feels his gaze. An awkward normality as she fixes it. 
                                 RAINIER
                        When you find out who it was, you 
                        must be firm, Grace. Incompetence 
                        must always be punished severely. 

           She nods and forces a smile. Rainier lingers off the buttons, 
           done perfectly, forces a smile back. He wants to say 
           something, but can’t figure out how to articulate it. He 
           gives her a mechanical peck on the cheek and leaves. Father 
           Tucker follows, with a nod to Grace.

           EXT. ROC AGEL ESTATE - DAY

           The gates of the Grimaldis’ royal holiday home. A vast 
           estate. PHOTOGRAPHERS linger at the gates, waiting for a 
           sight of the royal family, countered by an increased security 
           presence. The place feels like a fortress.

           It is now July 1962. 

           INT. KITCHEN / BAR AREA - DAY

           Madge is fussing over the preparation of the SALADS by the 
           CHEF and his staff. We follow her making sure every piece of 
           presentation is to the Prince’s tastes. Throughout, she 
           notices Phyllis loitering in the background, watching her. 
           Madge grows frustrated, turns to Phyllis-

                                 MADGE
                        Is there something you’d like to 
                        say to me?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Nope.

           Madge, can’t muster a response, walks on.

           EXT. OUTDOOR DINING AREA - DAY

           COCKTAILS being prepared in 80-degree heat. Grace, deep in 
           her own thoughts, chops fruit with her sister-in-law, 
           ANTOINETTE. Grace’s hair has been cut short in a signature 
           Grace Kelly summer look. She notices Madge appear with 
           Phyllis in tow.

                                 CAROLINE (MONEGASQUE)
                        Mamon! Look at me!

           Caroline is among KIDS, extended friends and family, 
           practicing a swan dive into the pool, executed imperfectly. 
           Grace doesn’t understand what Caroline is saying, but-
                                 GRACE
                        Good job!

           Caroline looks very pleased with herself -- when -- SPLASH! 
           She’s ENGULFED by someone DIVE-BOMBING into the pool-

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        Christian!

           Antoinette’s 13-year-old son, CHRISTIAN, the culprit, 
           crawling back up to the HIGH DIVING board --

                                 ANTOINETTE (CONT’D)
                        I told you to stop that, you’ll 
                        hurt yourself. 

           MARIA CALLAS, stunning in her bikini, shades and sun-hat, 
           sets empty cocktail glasses on the bar --  

                                 GRACE
                        Are they still holed up in the 
                        office?

                                 MARIA
                        Two hours now. Frightfully boring 
                        all this pride and posturing. This 
                        is supposed to be a summer break.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                             (refilling her glass)
                        Politics is never on vacation, Ms. 
                        Callas.

           Grace glances at the counter TV: VOX POPS of the common man 
           in the street -- all displaying a sense of indignation --

                                 ANTOINETTE (CONT’D)
                        Peasants. If it wasn’t for us, 
                        they’d be speaking French.

                                 GRACE
                        They are speaking French.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        Ecoute. They are speaking 
                        Monegasque. 

           Grace strains at the TV ... realizes that she can’t 
           understand a word of being said ...

                                 GRACE
                        What are they saying?

           Antoinette turns up the TV and translates on the fly-
                                 ANTOINETTE
                             (off Man 1)
                        How can a married Princess be seen 
                        to kiss another man? That’s what 
                        they do in the movies, isn’t it?
                             (off Man 2)
                        We’re in crisis and she’s leaving. 
                        For Hollywood!
                             (off Woman 1)
                        No, I’m not sure she can ever be 
                        one of us.

           Grace absorbs that feeling of alienation.

                                 MARIA
                        I noticed you’ve got stables. 

                                 GRACE
                        Do you ride?

                                 MARIA
                        Do I ride?

           INT. ROC AGEL. RAINIER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rainier, Onassis, Jean-Charles, Delavenne, Father Tucker and 
           a couple of other ministerial types are crowded around a 
           telephone. The mood is tense, these talks are still on-going-

                                 RAINIER (PHONE)
                        I can agree to the taxing of French 
                        companies, but the tax has to stay 
                        in Monaco. It’s only fair.

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        Non.

                                 RAINIER (PHONE)
                        Come on, Charles, I’ve already 
                        given you our allegiance. We’ll 
                        match your French rates. What your 
                        companies want to do after that is 
                        up to them. 

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        Non!

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. FRENCH PRESIDENT’S PALACE - DAY

           De Gaulle stands reading a copy of LOOK magazine. Photographs 
           of GRACE KELLY over the ages, the headline: THE PRINCESS 
           RETURNS TO TINSELTOWN. His ministers sit in silence.
                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        You will tax all of Monaco. You 
                        will pay the proceeds to France.

                                 RAINIER (PHONE)
                        That’s not negotiation, it’s 
                        extortion.

           De Gaulle drops the magazine down next to a newspaper. The 
           HEADLINE READS: “ALGERIA LIBERATED: FRANCE HANDS BACK NATION” 

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        You’ve made a mockery of me, 
                        Rainier. How do you think it’s 
                        going to look next time I’m sitting 
                        with Khrushchev or Kennedy? Oh 
                        Charles, we noticed you gave 
                        Rainier an ultimatum and he sent 
                        his American wife to Hollywood. 
                        What am I supposed to say to that? 
                        Why should I even dignify you with 
                        further talks?

           Rainier rests his head in his hands-

                        It’s all a misunderstanding, 
                        Charles. 

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        So why did you release the news? Is 
                        she going to Hollywood or not?

                                 RAINIER (PHONE)
                        No.

                             (the phone’s gone silent)
                        Charles?

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        Your family only has a country 
                        because I say so. You agree to my 
                        terms by tonight, or I’ll send 
                        Monaco back into the dark ages. I 
                        will rip your children’s 
                        inheritance from under them, and 
                        nobody will care. 
           The mention of his children makes Rainier angry-

                                 RAINIER (FRENCH - PHONE)
                        You know what? Next time you sit 
                        with Kennedy and Khrushchev, why 
                        don’t you start by explaining how 
                        you lost Algeria? For that matter, 
                        explain it to your own people first-

           He hangs up. Father Tucker, having been motioning calm, sighs 
           in defeat. 

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        What happens now?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        He waits until tomorrow, then 
                        executes a blockade. 

                                 ONASSIS
                        Can he really do that? 

                                 DELAVENNE
                        He can do what he likes. And we’re 
                        not in the U.N. so we have nobody 
                        to turn to.

                                 ONASSIS
                        Why aren’t you in the U.N.?

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        They won’t let us in. We’re too 
                        small.

                                 ONASSIS
                        Why don’t you call Kennedy?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        We’ve tried, they’re calling it a 
                        French matter.

           Onassis wracks his brains for a solution ...

                                 ONASSIS
                        So let’s make it a non-French 
                        matter. You have European 
                        neighbors, they can put pressure on 
                        De Gaulle. 

                                 RAINIER
                        I’m listening.
                                 ONASSIS
                        Fire Rogers & Cowan, bring Rupert 
                        Allan in to come and work 
                        exclusively for you. He’s a bright 
                        publicist. He can paint it like 
                        David and Goliath -- you’re trying 
                        to look after your people, the big 
                        oaf is trying to take it by force. 
                        Make Monaco’s security seem like a 
                        threat to Europe. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You will only-

                                 RAINIER
                        -antagonize De Gaulle. I 
                        understand. 

           Rainier sits back, struck by indecision.

                                 ONASSIS
                        And you have the Princess at your 
                        side. A damsel in distress.

                                 RAINIER
                        Some would say that’s more a 
                        disability than a benefit.

                                 ONASSIS
                        Then maybe it’s time you brought 
                        her into line, instead of letting 
                        her do what she wants.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        That’s not a solution.

                                 RAINIER
                        What is a solution, Francis? Do you 
                        have one? Because we just tried 
                        your way and failed.

           EXT. ROC AGEL, GROUNDS - DAY

           Grace and Maria on two magnificent horses, GALLOPING across 
           the grounds of the estate. Grace, pushing for speed, looking 
           back as Maria navigates the divots and mole-hills. We’re 
           feeling the exhilaration -- the need for release that is in 
           Grace’s blood --   

           -- as they SCREECH to a halt ... they’ve ventured near the 
           gates of the grounds. Photographers and journalists stalk the 
           other side of the gates. Grace’s constant prison. She turns 
           to Maria, out of breath, but eager to know-
                                 GRACE
                        How do you do it? 

                                 MARIA
                        How do I do what?

                                 GRACE
                        I’ve read everything they say about 
                        you. They call you a prima donna. 
                        They say you’re a Tigress. A 
                        homewrecker. That Onassis’ wife 
                        caught you - rutting - on his pool 
                        table.

                                 MARIA
                             (amused)
                        We weren’t rutting, my dear, we 
                        were fucking! I have nothing to 
                        hide. What they say is who I am.

           Maria, a fire that burns singular and bright, as her horse 
           circles Grace, like a predator, and she comes closer-

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You have a ... restlessness. 

                                 GRACE
                        Oh?

                                 MARIA
                        You want to be public, and private. 
                        You want to live out there, and 
                        also live in here. You want them to 
                        adore you, but leave you alone.

           Grace. Regards Maria closely, awkwardly. Trying to understand-

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I only live out there.

                                 GRACE
                        But are you happy?

           Maria closer now, lingering off Grace’s gaze, intrigued-

                                 MARIA
                        I am. But you ... you’re married to 
                        a Prince. You must live where and 
                        how they tell you. Even I know 
                        that. And your only way out, is 
                        that way-  
                             (- points to the gates)
           Maria and Grace. Fire and Ice. Before Maria breaks into a 
           grin, pulls away, and kicks at her horse -- she bolts, 
           leaving a trail of dust. Grace watches her go, then the gates 
           of the estate, before turning her horse and kicking at it too-

           EXT. VERANDA. DINING AREA - EVENING

           Lunch is served. An American-style BBQ. Hot dogs, burgers, 
           salads, coca-cola, but all created in a very European way. 
           The extended family and guests sit at the table eating. 

           Rainier eats, his foul mood hangs like a cloud, as Grace cuts 
           Albert’s food for him, on eggshells around her husband.

           Antoinette is the first to break-

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        It’s all just so unfair.

                                 PRINCESS GHISLAINE
                        Antoinette, we don’t talk state 
                        affairs over lunch.

           PRINCESS GHISLAINE, 62, Dowager Princess of Monaco, step-
           mother to Rainier and Antoinette. An elegant French lady who 
           is a lush, visiting from Paris. 

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        But mamon, what would papa have 
                        done? 

           Rainier stops. The mention of his father makes him tense.

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        My love, your step-mother is right. 
                        Let us forget our troubles for an 
                        hour or two.

           Ghislaine sees Rainier’s displeasure, deflects the question.

                                 PRINCESS GHISLAINE
                        Who put out white lilies?

                                 GRACE
                             (off the flowers)
                        I did.

                                 PRINCESS GHISLAINE
                        White lilies are only to be used 
                        for funerals, Grace.
                                 GRACE
                        I asked Madge. She said they’d be 
                        acceptable.

                                 MADGE
                        I only said white flowers, ma’am. I 
                        didn’t say white lilies.

                                 GRACE
                        Madge, you knew they only had 
                        lilies when I placed the order.

           Madge ... at fault ... maybe wilfully ... drops her gaze and 
           continues eating.

                                 RAINIER
                        I suppose your hair was Madge’s 
                        fault too.

                                 GRACE
                        My hair?

                                 RAINIER
                        Who told you to cut it that short?

           Grace grows red. Suddenly self-conscious. Father Tucker looks 
           on. Even Onassis watches, as he delights some of the kids 
           with his sleight of hand magic.

                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                        It looks dreadful. It yells of 
                        disrespect.

                                 GRACE
                        To whom?

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        I think Grace’s hair is very 
                        elegant. It’s the ‘artichoke’ look-

                                 PRINCESS GHISLAINE
                        She’s a modern woman-

                                 RAINIER
                        No she isn’t. She’s a Princess of 
                        Monaco.
                             (to Ghislaine)
                        Besides, you spend most of your 
                        time in Paris, so you’d have little 
                        knowledge of how we do things.

           Ghislaine grows silent. Grace tries to make light of it.
                                 GRACE
                        Ray, you can’t be the great 
                        modernizer one minute and try to 
                        turn back the clock the next.

                                 RAINIER
                        What do you want, Grace?

                                 GRACE
                        What do I want?

                                 RAINIER
                        If it wasn’t for this Hollywood 
                        nonsense, we’d be out of this hole. 

                                 GRACE
                        If it wasn’t for your inability to 
                        show anything but silence or anger, 
                        maybe we wouldn’t be in this hole.

                                 RAINIER
                        You’ll have to call Mr Hitchcock 
                        and turn him down publicly. We’ll 
                        make a show of how happy you are 
                        here. That you’re retiring from 
                        acting. Hollywood is in the past. 

                                 GRACE
                        Because De Gaulle says so?

                                 RAINIER
                        Because I say so.

                                 GRACE
                        That’s not your decision to make.

                                 RAINIER
                        I am the Prince, and your husband.

                                 GRACE
                        I won’t do it, Ray.

                                 RAINIER
                        You will and you must!

           Caroline and Albert shrink back, terrified at their father 
           raising his voice. Silence. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Rainier. This is uncalled for.

           Rainier. His frustrations getting the better of him-
                                 RAINIER
                        I didn’t make you marry me. I 
                        didn’t make you come here. What is 
                        it Hollywood will give you that I 
                        can’t?   

                                 GRACE
                        It’s just a movie, Ray.

                                 RAINIER
                        And you’re just an actress.

           Grace absorbs his insult, sees how afraid her kids have 
           become. Her lips curls. Annoyance and injustice rising 
           through her gut -- and without raising her voice -- 

                                 GRACE
                        Have you thought this might not be 
                        about a movie at all? That De 
                        Gaulle is looking for any excuse to 
                        take Monaco?
                             (off Rainier’s silence)
                        No, because you don’t listen to 
                        anybody, Ray. Especially not as 
                        they tip-toe around while you blow 
                        with indecision, too paralyzed with 
                        the fear that you might just be in 
                        over your head. 

           An uncomfortable stir. Rainier, struck by her words. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you shouldn’t ask WHO would 
                        want to be an enemy of Monaco, but 
                        look in the mirror and figure out 
                        WHY. With all our backward ways I’m 
                        sure you’ll find a reason.

           Rainier, furious. Swallowing it, getting up. Beat. He doesn’t 
           know what to do, so SMASHES his glass on the floor, startling 
           everyone, and walks off. 

           A marriage in crisis, and everybody was witness to it. 

           INT. MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

           A PROJECTOR in a DARKENED ROOM. A FLICKERING IMAGE: a black-
           and-white wedding in grand surroundings. We’re watching the 
           famous MGM-produced “WEDDING OF THE CENTURY” of 1956. Grace 
           Kelly saying her vows, becoming Her Serene Highness Princess 
           Gracia Patricia of Monaco. Rainier positively beaming. A 
           regal, stately affair. A happier time.
           Grace sits watching it alone, drinking. In the background, 
           outside, we can HEAR Maria SINGING OPERA. Grace is disturbed 
           by a noise. Father Tucker, finding his way in, whiskey in 
           hand, drops himself in a couch. Watches the screen with her-

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        He was very nervous you know. He 
                        wanted to impress you so much. I’d 
                        never seen his hands shake like 
                        that.

           Tucker soaks up her brooding silence-

                                 GRACE
                        You believe in fairy-tales, Tuck?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        I believe in happily-ever-after.

                                 GRACE
                        Even this far away from home?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        God helps. So does whiskey.

           He drinks. The moment settles. 

                                 GRACE
                        When I won my Oscar, do you know 
                        what my father said? I always 
                        thought Jack would be the one to 
                        put the family name in lights. Jack 
                        was my older brother, and an 
                        Olympic rower. Daddy was genuinely 
                        surprised I achieved anything in 
                        life. I think to him I was always 
                        going to be the disappointment.
                             (looks to Tucker)
                        Believe me, I never thought living 
                        with Rainier would be any easier 
                        than living with my father.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Rainier loves you, Grace.

                                 GRACE
                        Rainier loves an image of me. 
                             (then)
                        Once upon a time I also thought he 
                        was the most charming man I ever 
                        met. He was so ... different. 
                        Refined, in control, calm.
                             (and then again)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT'D)
                        Now it’s like we can’t even speak 
                        the same language.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You’ve never spoken the same 
                        language.

                                 GRACE
                        What happens if I was to get 
                        divorced?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Do you still love him?
                             (she doesn’t reply)
                        Your children will suffer most. 
                        They are heirs to a European 
                        throne. You’ll be lucky to ever see 
                        them again. I suppose the world 
                        will also hang its head in 
                        disappointment.

                                 GRACE
                        Should I say no to the movie then?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        I can’t speak for you, Grace.

           Grace gets up, refills her drink.

                                 GRACE
                        I sent my mom a letter six months 
                        ago asking for her advice. She 
                        wrote back yesterday.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        What did she say?

                                 GRACE
                        Don’t screw it up! He’s a prince!

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        If it makes you feel any better, I 
                        received a letter from the Vatican. 
                        The Pope would love to know why I 
                        didn’t try harder to dissuade you 
                        from returning to Hollywood.

           Grace. Growing quiet. Reality setting in. 

                                 GRACE
                        I’ve gotten us all into a right 
                        pickle, haven’t I?
           Tucker eyes the tired sense of defeat about her. A woman who 
           has made everything herself, now at a dead end. It moves him. 
           He mulls his next move very carefully, before coming in close-

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        When people dream of marrying 
                        royalty, they rarely comprehend 
                        what it means. The master of all 
                        you survey, yet slaves to your 
                        subjects. Power and duty. It is one 
                        of the most difficult skills a 
                        person can ever learn. Now add to 
                        that a culture a million miles away 
                        from your own, and it becomes an 
                        almost impossible undertaking. You 
                        feel very alone. Stranded.
                             (reflective)
                        I’ve given this place fifteen years 
                        of my life. It’s sucked the marrow 
                        right out of my bones. 

                                 GRACE
                        But you’re still here.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        I’m afraid what would happen if I 
                        left. This place has no heart. It 
                        needs me. Rainier needs me. He 
                        needs you.

                                 GRACE
                        It doesn’t feel that way. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Because he doesn’t understand you. 
                        Yet he’s still fascinated by you. 
                        To him, you are all the 
                        contradictions in one. Elegant yet 
                        clumsy. Emotional yet logical. 
                        Modern yet classical. And 
                        underneath it all, you give a damn.   
                        In you he sees everything he 
                        aspires to be. And that is why 
                        everybody else is so afraid of you. 
                        Because alongside Rainier, you 
                        might just become the greatest 
                        princess Monaco has ever seen.

           Grace, staring intently at Tucker, moved by his belief in her-

           Maria Callas has grown silent in the background. 
                                 GRACE
                        Why do you care so much what 
                        happens to me? 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Because I believe in love. And I 
                        don’t believe that you and Rainier 
                        have grown so far apart to have 
                        fallen out of it. 

           Awkward silence.

                                 GRACE
                        I do love him. When I see him with 
                        Caroline and Albert, I ... it’s 
                        just ... I don’t know how I’m ever 
                        going to live with him. Or how I’m 
                        going to spend the rest of my life 
                        in a place where I can’t be me.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You stopped being Grace Kelly six 
                        years ago. And you’re not yet 
                        Princess Grace. Right now you’re 
                        just a housewife with two bratty 
                        kids, mourning the loss of the 
                        romance of your wedding day.
                             (off her silence-)
                        Give Rainier, and Monaco, the ideal 
                        they crave, everything else will 
                        work itself out. I promise you. 
                        Rainier will follow you to the ends 
                        of the earth, and your people will 
                        do the same. Give yourself 
                        completely.

                                 GRACE
                        If only it were that easy.

           Grace, regarding her beautiful wedding plays on the screen-

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Some of us still believe in you, 
                        your highness. But at some point 
                        every fairy-tale must end, and real 
                        life must begin. Nobody says it has 
                        to be easy. 

                                 GRACE
                        There’s two people in a marriage, 
                        Tuck. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Yes, there are.
           Silence. Grace sighs.

                                 GRACE
                        Who’d have thought the hardest role 
                        I’d ever have to play would be me?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        I’m just a drunk old priest who has 
                        outstayed his welcome. But I do 
                        know people who can help you. What 
                        you choose to do, is up to you. 

           Tucker. Squeezes her hand. Leaves her watching the flickering 
           images of the wedding ... the ghosts of a fairytale, the 
           ideal ... as it SEGUES TO-

           EXT. MONACO FOOTBALL CLUB STADIUM - DAY

           BARBED WIRE being unraveled. The GROUNDSMAN and his staff 
           look on helplessly as FRENCH SOLDIERS roll the barbed-wire 
           across the middle of the soccer stadium.

           EXT. AUTOROUTE MONACO/FRANCE BORDER - DAY

           A MONEGASQUE FAMILY drive in their car, heading for the 
           border. A FRENCH SOLDIER up ahead, motions for them to stop. 
           They slow to a FRENCH ARMY BLOCKADE, more barbed wire, trucks 
           and traffic being inspected. Traffic SNAKES all the way ahead-

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER (FRENCH)
                        Papers.

                                 MONEGASQUE MAN (FRENCH)
                        We’re only going to Montpelier.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER (FRENCH)
                        Not without papers you’re not.

           EXT. MONTE CARLO. CHURCH OF THE SACRED HEART - DAY

           Rainier’s CHAUFFEURED CAR arrives at the church. Jean-Charles 
           opens the door as Rainier and his security team get out-

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        He has raised a wall-to-wall 
                        blockade. Barbed wire across the 
                        entire border, his warships 
                        stationed on the edge of our 
                        waters, and we’ve been cut off from 
                        Nice airport. 
                                 RAINIER
                        He can’t do that. Our borders run 
                        through the middle of town.

           Jean-Charles motions to the spectacle before them -- 

           BARBED WIRE FENCING runs straight through the church grounds, 
           splitting the cathedral between France and Monaco. FRENCH 
           SOLDIERS share cigarettes on the other side. The PRIESTS look 
           on from this side.

                                 PRIEST
                        It was like this when we woke up.

           Rainier eyes the beautiful landscape blighted by the ugly 
           wire. Approaches the line, addressing the French soldiers.

                                 RAINIER
                        I demand to speak to your 
                        commanding officer!

           The soldiers look to each other, then turn their backs-

                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                        I’m speaking to you, imbeciles!
                             (stepping over the wire)
                        Get me your- 

           The French soldiers abruptly draw their weapons. Rainier 
           stops, as his SECURITY TEAM draw their weapons in reply. An 
           absurd stand-off across the border. Jean-Charles pulls at 
           Rainier to step back.

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        Monaco Prince shot by French Army 
                        doesn’t make for a great headline.

           Rainier ... allows himself to be pulled away ... as the 
           FRENCH LIEUTENANT comes running ... diffusing the tension. 

                                 FRENCH LIEUTENANT
                        Put down your weapons!
                             (to Rainier)
                        Sir, you must keep to your side! 
                        This is by the order of the 
                        President himself. There is nothing 
                        we can do!

           Rainier. Helpless. Returns to his vehicle.

           INT. CHILDREN’S CHAMBERS - EARLY MORNING

           Grace tucks in Albert who has kicked off his covers. 
           She checks his arm. The bite marks are no longer there. She 
           smiles, pleased. Caroline stirs and opens her eyes, to see 
           her mother over her. They share a smile as Grace kisses her 
           daughter and tucks her in also. Caroline goes back to sleep, 
           comforted, angelic. Grace dwells on her, reaching a decision.

           EXT. RECTORY - DAY

           A MASS has finished, Father Tucker is seeing off some of his 
           congregation, when he notices Grace has arrived. Leaning 
           against her car. Sunglasses and headscarf so she isn’t 
           noticed, waiting for him. She takes her sunglasses off, and 
           the look on her face is clear -- I’m here, what now?

           INT. CHATEAU - DAY

           Grace and Tucker follow a BUTLER. They are led into the 
           classically decorated, ostentatious GREAT RECEPTION HALL. TWO 
           POMERANIANS and TWO RED SETTERS comes running down the 
           stairs, followed by --

           COUNT FERNANDO D’AILLIERES, 45, a flamboyant aristocrat.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        Oh my goodness, Princess Grace, in 
                        my humble home. Count Fernando 
                        D’Aillieres at your service.

           He nods efficiently. Kisses her hand.

                                 GRACE
                        How do you do?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        How are you, Fernando?

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        Frightful headache behind the eyes, 
                        but that’s what you would expect 
                        this time of year. Please, ma’am, 
                        come, you’re in time for tea. 

           He turns away. Grace looks to Tucker.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        He can trace his line over three-
                        hundred years, to the court of 
                        Prince Honore II. There’s nothing 
                        about Monaco he doesn’t know.
           INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Fernando navigates a perfect china tea-set, going through a 
           tea-making ritual. Grace takes in the surroundings, the home 
           of a connoisseur, a historian of Monaco’s culture.  

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        A marriage in crisis? You won’t be 
                        the first. There aren’t many royal 
                        marriages in Monaco that haven’t 
                        completely fallen apart. It’s what 
                        happens when you’re so insular. The 
                        Prince finds a wife from far away, 
                        the Princess sees Monaco for the 
                        peculiar place it really is, and 
                        runs for the hills.

                                 GRACE
                        That’s very reassuring, Count.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        I’m a protocol expert, ma’am, not a 
                        marriage counselor.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You’re also an historian. 

           Fernando eyes them both-

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        My duty is first and foremost to 
                        Monaco. I will perform whatever 
                        service I am called for.

                                 GRACE
                        The language, the customs, the 
                        protocol, I want to understand it 
                        all. Can you teach it?

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        I wouldn’t be much of an expert if 
                        I couldn’t. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Without the Prince’s knowledge.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        Discretion is the Monegasque way.

                                 GRACE
                        I made a commitment with the whole 
                        world watching, Count. It will not 
                        be called a failure. For the sake 
                        of my children, and my family.
           Fernando surveys Grace, seemingly examining her, or making up 
           his mind. She can be a very determined when she wants to be.

           INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

           Maps and strategic plans spread across the tables, showing 
           the extent of De Gaulle’s blockade, the RADIO NEWS is on, 
           thick smoke, nervous energy and sweat hangs in the air.

                                 DELAVENNE
                        We have perhaps two months before 
                        we run out of essential supplies.

           Rainier, his mind somewhere else, realizes everybody’s 
           looking to him to lead-

                                 RAINIER
                        De Gaulle?

                                 DELAVENNE
                        He’s running down the clock. 

                                 RAINIER
                        You think he would actually invade?

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        By October. Which means whatever we 
                        have up our sleeve, we’d better 
                        pull it out fast.

                                 RAINIER
                        Where the devil is Francis?

           INT. HALLWAYS - DAY

           Rainier strides out of his office, to see Tucker arriving-

                                 RAINIER
                        You know, there was a time you used 
                        to say ‘do you mind if I?’ or ‘may 
                        I be excused?’ Where have you been?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        The Vatican was seeking news on our 
                        crisis. I’ve had to reassure the 
                        Holy See you’re in control and 
                        it’ll be resolved.

           Rainier, something else is actually bugging him, he pulls 
           Tucker aside.
                                 RAINIER
                        Have you spoken to Grace? Is she 
                        all right?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Why don’t you call on her?

                                 RAINIER
                        I wouldn’t know what to say. I feel 
                        awful, Francis. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Maybe start by apologizing.

                                 RAINIER
                        I didn’t do anything wrong.

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Then why do you feel awful?

                                 RAINIER
                        I don’t know.
                             (sighs)
                        It seems everything I do or say 
                        these days is just wrong. I don’t 
                        know where I stand anymore. And I 
                        don’t ... I don’t want to lose her. 
                        You know I’ve never been good at 
                        these things. What should I do?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Sometimes when you think you’re not 
                        being heard, you should just be 
                        quiet and listen. She gave up her 
                        friends, her family, her life, to 
                        start one with you. She’s your 
                        wife, Ray, not your enemy. 
                             (lets it settle)
                        A little space often brings immense 
                        perspective. Leave her be. Tend to 
                        your business. Let her decide what 
                        she wants to do.

                                 RAINIER
                        Until when?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        You’ll know when. She’ll tell you. 

           Rainier takes in Tucker’s enigmatic counsel. 

           They are interrupted by the old press officer, EMILE CORNET, 
           shuffling out of his office with a single box of his 
           belongings. 
           Rupert Allan’s army of young slick HOLLYWOOD PR MEN arrive in 
           the opposite direction with their own belongings and take 
           over the offices with military precision. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Now is there anything I can say to 
                        dissuade you from this course of 
                        action with De Gaulle?

                                 RAINIER
                        None whatsoever.  

           INT. FERNANDO’S CHATEAU. GREAT LIBRARY - DAY

           Grace is overloaded with dusty hardcover reference books by 
           Count Fernando, now descending from a step-ladder.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (O.S. - OVER)
                        At any given time, there are four 
                        hundred people working within the 
                        palace walls. But they’re not 
                        working for you, they’re working 
                        for the palace.

           INT. STUDY - DAY

           The dogs watch as Fernando talks Grace through the books, 
           studiously following an ORGANIGRAM ...

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        There’s the Palace Protocol Office. 
                        Chamberlain, Aide-De-Campe, and of 
                        course your Lady In Waiting, Madge. 
                        They sit adjacent to the Palace 
                        Press Office, the Prince’s Estate 
                        Administration, the Charge De 
                        Mission, and below the Cabinet of 
                        The Prince. His inner circle, which 
                        you know better than most. 

           Grace, dizzy with the magnitude of the diagrams.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (CONT’D)
                        You must know exactly where to 
                        place each one of these individuals 
                        in the pecking order, because 
                        almost every single one makes it a 
                        profession to flatter, deceive, and 
                        hide incompetence. You are a 
                        foreigner in Europe’s oldest court. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COUNT FERNANDO (CONT’D)
                        And the target of all the hidden 
                        agendas that come with that 
                        privilege.

                                 GRACE
                        How will I know who to trust?

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                             (off Grace’s naivete)
                        What would you say are the true 
                        qualities of a Princess, your 
                        highness?

                                 GRACE
                        She must stand by her husband. Be a 
                        supportive mother. A family woman. 

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        Wrong. A Princess must be 
                        everything to everybody at all 
                        times. You must be Grace Kelly and 
                        Princess Grace both at once. 
                             (puts his fingers together 
                              to illustrate)
                        The glamor of Hollywood, the 
                        aspiration and idealism of an 
                        American, married to the discrete 
                        cunning and sophistication of a 
                        European. 
                             (then, conspiratorially)
                        In High Noon, you were a closed

                        of ice. Out here you must become 
                        serene. The ‘grace’ of Monaco. That 
                        means, trust no one, become sincere 
                        in your insincerity. How to say one

                        something completely different.

           Beat.

                                 GRACE
                        You’ve seen my movies?

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        All of them. I adore your movies.

                                 GRACE
                             (eyeing the mass of 
                              information before her)
                        This is certainly a lot to take in.
                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        Don’t get too comfortable, we’re 
                        moving onto history. 

           INT. MONACO’S CENTRAL LIBRARY - DAY

           Grace is on her own in a secluded reading room, surrounded by 
           PAINTINGS and BOOKS depicting Monaco’s colorful HISTORY:

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (V.O.)
                        For almost a thousand years, Monaco 
                        has stood as a symbol of liberty. 
                        That a few people on a small rock 
                        can live a peaceful existence, as 
                        they choose, free from tyranny. 

           INT. MONACO’S GREAT CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

           Grace, alone at night, seeing the history written into the 
           murals and stained-glass windows. Tucker stands talking to a 
           cleric, clearly a private event-

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (V.O.)
                        The House of Grimaldi has been 
                        responsible for protecting that 
                        ideal-

                                 GRACE (V.O.)
                        -since 1297. Francesco Grimaldi-

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (V.O.)
                        -known as “Il Malizia”-

                                 GRACE (V.O.)
                        -“The Cunning One” - and his men 
                        captured the fortress protecting 
                        the Rock of Monaco while disguised 
                        as Franciscan monks. 

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (V.O.)
                        Very good. 

           EXT. ROCK OF MONACO - DAY

           Grace HIKES to the highest point of the rock, looks down at 
           the principality clutching a MAP, as Count Fernando motions 
           to where CERTAIN HISTORIC BATTLES took place. Father Tucker 
           struggles up the hill after them, exhausted. Grace lingers 
           off her map, and then the landscape, concentrating to absorb 
           as much as she’s being told-
                                 COUNT FERNANDO (V.O.)
                        Louis XIV sought to take Monaco but 
                        failed. French Revolutionary forces 
                        actually succeeded, only until 1814 
                        when Napoleon was driven out. 
                        During the Second World War, the 
                        country fell into the hands of the 
                        Nazis, until they too were 
                        eventually defeated. Monaco has 
                        always stood proud, the second 
                        smallest country in the world, 
                        protected by that most powerful of 
                        weapons, guile and determination.

           INT. COUNT FERNANDO’S CHATEAU - DAY

           Caroline and Albert sit playing with the dogs, as their 
           mother sits with Count Fernando. He makes subtle movements 
           and gestures. A scratch of the nose. A brush of the ear. 
           Grace has to study them, then holds up cue cards with words 
           on them: ANGRY, SAD, LYING, NERVOUS, UPSET etc. She gets it 
           wrong often, but every once in a while gets it right.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO (V.O.)
                        That is the Monegasque way. 
                        Learning to read people’s smallest 
                        signals, conveying a message 
                        without words, reading the tells 
                        that give people away. Not only 
                        must you know what yours are, but 
                        you must make sure yours remain 
                        hidden at all times. 

           INT. STUDY - NIGHT

           Father Tucker watches Count Fernando put his books and 
           instruments away. They are alone. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        What do you think?

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        She needs work. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        The prince has planned a state 
                        reception for the neighbor states 
                        in two weeks. He’s going to make 
                        his case to them for economic and 
                        military support. She needs to be 
                        ready by then. 
                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        This isn’t just about a marriage, 
                        is it Father?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Unfortunately, it is. It’s the only 
                        thing they have going for them.

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE OF MONACO. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Rainier walks to his room, reading a dossier, when he passes 
           Grace’s room. The door is ajar. He stops and peeks in. She’s 
           passed out cold on the bed from exhaustion, fully-clothed. 
           Rainier contemplates his sleeping beauty. Watching her 
           longingly, then walks on to his own room.

           No sooner has the door to his bedroom closed, than MADGE 
           appears from the shadows.

           INT. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Madge enters and stands over her sleeping mistress. Snooping. 
           She picks up one of the many books on PALACE PROTOCOL that 
           Grace has fallen asleep surrounded by. She notices the MARNIE 
           screenplay, lying ignored under papers on the floor. Now 
           turning her attention to Grace’s NOTEBOOK, the distinct 
           looping hand-writing charting the TREE ORGANIGRAM of the 
           PALACE STAFF. Annotations, observations -- and a BIG FAT ‘?’ 
           next to MADGE’S NAME:  

           “TRAITOR?”

           Madge grows cold as she eyes her mistress fast asleep. A 
           CREAK outside. She tenses. 

           INT. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           Madge steps out. Nobody. She moves on, quickly. And now ... 
           it’s PHYLLIS’ turn to appear from the shadows ... ever 
           vigilant, having seen Madge’s peculiar behavior.

           INT. MADGE’S PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Madge picks up a phone and DIALS -- 

           INT. PHYLLIS’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Phyllis sits with the SUPERINTENDENT FOR PALACE SECURITY. 
           Wired to a LISTENING DEVICE, planted on Madge’s phone-   
                                 MADGE (O.S.)
                        I need to see you right now. I 
                        think they’re onto me. 

           Off Phyllis’ intrigue -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE SEQUENCE: The following is an extended sequence of 
           MUSIC over VISUALS, occasionally underscoring dialog.

           INT. PALACE. PRESS ROOM - DAY

           RUPERT ALLAN in full flow, juggling phones. His office is a 
           flurry of activity. Telex and phones ringing off the hook, as 
           he masterminds the organization of the STATE DINNER, as 
           Rainier works through the lists. There’s a HUGE MAP open of 
           their European neighbors. The FLAGS of the COUNTRIES. Italy, 
           Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, even 
           Luxembourg. They have PHOTOGRAPHS of delegates mapped out 
           against each country’s flag. 

           Father Tucker watches this all unfold, in the background, 
           ignored by Rainier. Tucker is handed a LETTER, bearing a 
           DELAWARE US POSTMARK. He opens it, reads it. He becomes 
           VISIBLY UPSET by its contents. But he puts on a brave face, 
           trying not to show it to the other men in the room.

           INT. FERNANDO’S CHATEAU (VARIOUS) - DAY/EVENING

           Grace RECITES Monegasque IDIOMS, blending French and Italian, 
           as Fernando patiently corrects her. She stops, FRUSTRATED. 

                                 GRACE
                        It’s so DIFFICULT.

                                 COUNT FERNANDO
                        Try again, Altesse.

           Grace. A look to Father Tucker, who is barely paying 
           attention to her predicament, engrossed in a newspaper.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           Grace PERFECTING her knowledge of history. 

           Grace MEMORIZING the organigrams.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Count Fernando SLAMS his notebook shut.
                                 COUNT FERNANDO (CONT’D)
                        Bon. Time to meet your people.

           EXT. MONTE CARLO HARBOR - DAY

           A bustling FARMER’S MARKET in the harbor square. People are 
           stockpiling, there’s panic buying, the police are involved in 
           arguments, stall-holders struggling to keep up-

           INT. BLACK SEDAN (STATIONARY) - DAY

           Grace sits with Tucker, watching the hustle from safety. He 
           senses her hesitation.

                                 GRACE
                        What happens if De Gaulle wins?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Rainier will lose the throne, 
                        Monaco will be absorbed into 
                        France, and an entire culture 
                        becomes history.
                             (then)
                        Fortitude, Grace. Give yourself 
                        completely. You can do it.

           Grace, deep breath, taking strength from his encouragement.

           EXT. MONTE CARLO HARBOR - DAY

           Grace walks away from the car, looking back to see Tucker 
           watching, as she strolls relatively unnoticed into the 
           chaotic market. She nervously digs her hands into her coat 
           pockets, mingling with the passers-by. She stops to inspect 
           the produce on a VEGETABLE STALL. The STALLHOLDER, a WOMAN 
           who is heavily over-worked, turns to see Grace and double-
           takes, dropping her potatoes. Grace, very self-conscious, 
           holding a cabbage-

                                 GRACE (MONEGASQUE)
                        How much are these-
                             (searches for the word)
                        -cabbages?

           The stallholder, frozen, can only mumble the price.

           Grace feels a ripple passing through the crowd around her. 
           The Princess?! She has to call on every ounce of strength to 
           keep herself rooted to the spot. 
           Her ordinary subjects, those whom she’s only ever seen in 
           staged press events and behind a curtain of palace security, 
           the people who had dismissed her as a flighty Hollywood star, 
           now up close and personal. All staring at her flatly, in 
           disbelief, a brief interruption to their day-to-day crisis.  

           The wave, passing through the whole market, bringing 
           everything to a halt. Grace, holding her cabbage, 
           intimidated, only the summer harbor breeze for company. 

           A POLICEMAN pushes through the crowd-

                                 POLICEMAN (FRENCH)
                        Altesse, what are you doing here? 
                        Where is your security detail?

           Grace surveys the nervous policeman, then the alien stares, 
           and she feels a surge of confidence, smiles- 

                                 GRACE (MONEGASQUE)
                             (struggling in her dictum, 
                              but managing enough)
                        You will only speak to me in 
                        English or Monegasque, officer. I 
                        will not speak the language of a 
                        country we are in conflict with.
                             (now in ENGLISH)
                        And why would I need security to 
                        walk among my own people?
                             (she turns to the 
                              stallholder)
                        You look like you’re struggling. 
                        Would you perhaps need some help?

           The Stallholder doesn’t know what to say. She just curtseys. 
           Holds up an apron. Grace takes it.

           INT. BLACK SEDAN (STATIONARY) - DAY

           Father Tucker watches the market returning to normal with a 
           sense of relief and satisfaction.

           EXT. MONTE CARLO. SQUARE - DAY

           Grace, in the full swing of helping the stallholder sell her 
           wares, getting her hands dirty, one of the people- 
           INT. RECTORY. LIVING QUARTERS - EVENING

           Father Tucker works through his correspondence. ‘WILMINGTON, 
           DELAWARE’. He sits back cradling his whiskey, reading one in 
           particular, deeply disturbed, and now begins RESPONDING.

           INT. RAINIER’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Rainier, 24/7 at the office -- he and Grace leading very 
           separate lives now -- 

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Grace, eating with Caroline and Albert, but Rainier’s place 
           is empty.

           INT. RAINIER’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - DAY

           Rainier eats lunch while working-

           EXT. FRENCH-MONACO BORDER - DAY

           Grace carries a tray of refreshments to a French Army border 
           patrol. The same soldiers who had pulled their guns on 
           Rainier. She swallows her fear and trepidation, as the 
           soldiers watch her nearing, the glamor and the beauty 
           incongruous with the surroundings, with some Monegasque 
           townsfolk walking behind her. She stops across the line-

                                 FRENCH LIEUTENANT
                        Can we help you, ma’am?

                                 GRACE
                        We thought you might be hungry. 

           INT. RAINIER’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Rainier sits poring through his SUMMIT ITINERARY, when he 
           notices something on the TV flickering in the corner. The 
           NEWS: showing Grace at the border, laughing and joking with 
           the French soldiers who are GIDDY in her company. She has the 
           French soldiers wrapped around her fingers, and the TV PRESS 
           has naturally pounced on it. 

           Rainier watches her skillfully disarm their enemies with her 
           common touch. He can’t help but be surprised and enchanted.
           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. FRENCH PRESIDENT’S PALACE - EVENING

           CHARLES DE GAULLE sits watching the FRENCH EVENING NEWS with 
           his wife Yvonne. Similar images of Grace taking her 
           philanthropy out to the streets during the crisis. De 
           Gaulle’s far from enchanted. He’s peeved.

                                 REPORTER (FRENCH)
                        Her Serene Highness Princess Grace 
                        took supplies to her embattled

                        Monegasques barricaded themselves 
                        into their homes, fearing that 
                        French paratroopers may fall from

                        Naturally! If I see a Frenchman, 
                        I’ll shoot him!

                        They’ve underestimated us. We will 
                        never surrender. We’d rather lose 
                        everything we have and go hungry. 
                        And when they invade, we’ll fight 
                        them every step of the way.

           De Gaulle suddenly starts laughing. He laughs so hard, he 
           almost chokes on his crepes. The LAUGH ECHOES, and the --

           MONTAGE ENDS.

           INT. OFFICE OF PRINCESS GRACE - NIGHT

           Grace listens to a recording of Madge’s conversation through 
           headphones. Phyllis and the Superintendent of Palace Security 
           watch her reaction keenly. We can’t hear what she’s hearing. 
           The tape ends, Grace takes off the headphones, much wiser.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        She’s meeting with a French private 
                        detective tomorrow night.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT'D)
                        While everybody else is occupied 
                        with the state dinner. Why would 
                        she need to do that?

                                 GRACE
                        It seems Madge has a lot to answer 
                        for. Okay, do what you need to.

           EXT. RECTORY - NIGHT

           Grace’s convertible pulls up in the gloom.

           INT. RECTORY - NIGHT

           Grace enters carrying a pile of Monaco books.

                                 GRACE
                        Tuck?

           Her voice echoes into the darkness. Beat. She navigates the 
           gloomy corridors ... cautiously ... to find ... 

           INT. RECTORY. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           ... Tucker slumped in a DRUNKEN STUPOR over his desk. Grace’s 
           heart flutters-

                                 GRACE
                        Tuck!

           She rushes to him, and stops. He’s not dead. He’s passed out 
           DRUNK. A half-written LETTER under his pen. Grace softens. 
           Puzzled, she takes the letter at the top of the pile, 
           postmarked Wilmington, Delaware.

           She sits reading. Surprised at what it contains ... when 
           Tucker SNORES so loud he wakes himself. He blearily gets his 
           bearings, to glimpse Grace sitting in the armchair- 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Grace!
                             (checks his watch)
                        Oh my, I-

           He stops, because she’s holding his letter. And she’s upset.

                                 FATHER TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        You really shouldn’t be reading my 
                        private mail-
                                 GRACE
                        Why didn’t you tell me about this?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        It’s nobody’s business-

                                 GRACE
                        It’s my business.
                             (off his silence)
                        You’re leaving.

           Tucker. Struggles up, surveys his empty glass, trying to 
           think straight through the fog. Sets the glass down, refills 
           it, drinks. He can’t bring herself to look at her. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        The letter’s from the wife of my 
                        older brother Joe. He’s sick. They 
                        need me. I’m going home, Grace. 
                        Back to America. 

                                 GRACE
                        How long have you been planning 
                        this?
                             (off the many letters)
                        Seems like you play the Monaco game 
                        better than anybody else. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                             (brief guilty silence)
                        When I came to Monaco, Ray had only 
                        recently taken the throne. His 
                        parents had abdicated after a 
                        difficult divorce. He was thrust 
                        into the spotlight at twenty-one 
                        without any guidance. He chose me 
                        against everybody’s wishes. America 
                        inspires him, don’t ask me why. But 
                        I always knew I wouldn’t be able to 
                        give him with what he truly lacks. 
                        He can only get that from a strong 
                        Princess who could love him 
                        unconditionally as a husband.

                                 GRACE
                        Get what?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Courage. Stability. A confirmation 
                        of his faith in family. 
                             (then)
                        I’ll be 73-years-old soon. This is 
                        not where I want it to end. Your 
                        family is here. Mine is far away.
           Grace lingers on this lonely old man far away from home. 
           Beat. She wipes a tear from her cheek and holds out his 
           letter. He takes it gratefully. 

           Awkward silence hangs between them.

                                 FATHER TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow night, at the state 
                        dinner, Rainier will ask the 
                        European leaders to back him 
                        against De Gaulle. They will all 
                        refuse. No one is prepared to stand 
                        against France. Monaco does not 
                        hold enough significance. That’s 
                        when someone will come to you with 
                        a solution to the problem. 

                                 GRACE
                        Why me ... ?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        This whole fiasco smells of 
                        brinkmanship, and you’re considered 
                        Rainier’s weakness. Someone’ll come 
                        to you to help persuade Rainier to 
                        make a deal with De Gaulle. That 
                        someone will be your traitor.

                                 GRACE
                        You won’t be there?

                                 FATHER TUCKER
                        Rainier hasn’t invited me. It seems  
                        he has outgrown me.

           Tucker. A sense of finality. He picks up a newspaper, the 
           stories reflect the era: Soviets sends missiles to Cuba, 
           China and India going to war etc. 

                                 FATHER TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        This world is a hateful one, Grace. 
                        It’s conflicted and ugly. If Monaco 
                        is to survive, it has to become a 
                        symbol of everything that is good.
                             (looks to her)
                        Give the world an ideal. An image 
                        it will want to aspire to and 
                        protect. That’s the only way out of 
                        this mess.

           He gently holds her by the shoulders -- almost a WHISPER --
                                 FATHER TUCKER (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be fine, my girl. Just 
                        follow your heart. 

           Off Grace -- 

           EXT. PARIS SUBURBS, PETIT-CLAMART - DAY

           President De Gaulle steps out of a government building with 
           his wife and into a Citroën DS. No sooner has his armed 
           entourage rolled away, than two BLACK RENAULTS pull up and 
           three men jump out with MACHINE GUNS. They spray the convoy 
           with bullets with yells of Vive la France!

           De Gaulle’s Citroën is riddled with bullet holes. The 
           assassins exchange fire with the French Presidential guard, 
           before making their getaway. Leaving the Citroën smoking.

           INT. MONACO. MONTE CARLO CASINO - EVENING

           A STATE DINNER in the palatial surroundings of Monaco’s most 
           illustrious casino. The venue has been gloriously turned out. 
           FLAGS of EUROPEAN NATIONS on tables, as the FOREIGN ENVOYS 
           greet each other at Rainier’s event. 

           EXT. FRENCH-MONACO BORDER - EVENING

           Meanwhile, a single SEDAN rolls across the border into 
           Monaco. The man behind the wheel, with a THICK-JAW wearing a 
           crumpled suit, hands the French border patrol his papers -- a 
           FRENCH PASSPORT. They wave him through.

           EXT. ROCK OF MONACO. LAY-BY - NIGHT

           Pitch black. THICK-JAW stands under a tree, by his parked 
           sedan. A set of HEADLIGHTS appear in the winding road and 
           pull up. Beat. MADGE gets out of the other car. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           PHYLLIS’ CAR, headlights OFF, pulling up not far away. She 
           has followed Madge up into the moonlight mountain roads. She 
           takes cover behind a rock and peers down at the exchange 
           taking place between Madge and the Thick-Jaw. They seem to be 
           exchanging something. Envelopes, but we can’t quite tell.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Thick-Jaw takes his envelope and returns to his car. 
           Madge watches him drive away, before returning to her own.
           INT. MADGE’S CAR (STATIONARY) - NIGHT

           Madge gets behind the wheel. Checks the contents of the 
           envelope. She’s VERY pleased by what she finds, though we 
           can’t see what it is. A SMILE CURLS across her thin lips. She 
           seals the envelope, looks up and almost jumps out of her skin-

           PHYLLIS has emerged right in front of her eyes. Madge grows 
           annoyed, determined to have this out right now, only to 
           realize the door is being opened for her -- the 
           Superintendent of Palace Security. She’s been busted. 

           Phyllis gets in beside here, off the envelope-

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I think we got some talking to do.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Rainier checks his watch, nervously adjusting the collar on 
           his tunic, when he senses a stir among his footmen ...

           GRACE is gliding down the steps to meet him. He pauses for a 
           moment. She is stunning, in a long flowing dress, her gloves, 
           her porcelain features. 

           A Princess. Effortless. Timeless.

           Rainier ... frozen to the spot ... as this enchanting, 
           beguiling creature descends before him ... she seems the 
           same, yet so different. Calm ... almost ... serene. 

           Grace ... descending to her waiting Prince ... keeping 
           herself composed ... the first time they’ve really seen each 
           other in a while ...

                                 GRACE
                        How have you been? 

                                 RAINIER
                        Busy. You?

                                 GRACE
                        Busy.
                             (then)
                        It’s what happens when you live in 
                        such a big palace. 

                                 RAINIER
                        You can get lost for days.

           An awkward beat. Rainier adjusts his tunic, irritated by it-
                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                        I can never get this blasted thing-

                                 GRACE
                        Let me-

           She fixes his button for him. Beat. Normality. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Shall we?

           INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

           Grace enters on Rainier’s arm, shaking hands with everybody, 
           warmly greeting the FOREIGN MINISTERS of local European 
           nations. Official phots being taken by Lukomski, a perfectly 
           orchestrated political event, courtesy of Rupert. 

           Rainier and Grace take their place at the table, and are 
           seated, followed by Jean-Charles and Antoinette, Onassis and 
           Maria, and some of their closest ministers and allies. The 
           moment Rainier and Grace sit, so does everybody else. 

           Grace, scans the faces, the foreigners, but also the various 
           ministers. Wondering where the traitor will come from the 
           ranks of these politicians.  

           Grace feels Rainier watching her closely, still absorbing her 
           transformation. Everything she is doing, from her handling of 
           the eating implements, to the sublime smiles and looks she 
           casts around, to the gentle chit-chat, is expert.

                                 GRACE
                        You didn’t invite Tuck.

                                 RAINIER
                        I don’t need Tuck.

           Grace doesn’t show an ounce of emotion. Rainier can’t work 
           out where his wife has gone. This woman seems so European. 

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Grace is engaged in deep conversation with the envoys. But 
           her eyes are on the closed double doors of the committee 
           room, behind which the talks are taking place. There’s an 
           underlying current of tension. She finds herself alongside an 
           unusually anxious Rupert. 

                                 GRACE
                        What’s wrong?
                                 RUPERT
                        There was an attempt on De Gaulle’s 
                        life this afternoon. 

                                 GRACE
                        My goodness, is he hurt?

                                 RUPERT
                        We should be so lucky. French right 
                        wing claimed responsibility. This 
                        thing just gets more complicated.

                                 GRACE
                        Surely he can’t blame that on us.

                                 RUPERT
                        No, but it means nobody will want 
                        to cross him now.

           The double doors burst open and the ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
           comes storming out and promptly leaves the building with the 
           Italian delegation scrambling after him.

           Grace glimpses Rainier and Onassis in the smoke-filled room, 
           together with Monaco’s cabinet. It is INTENSE. Rainier 
           catches her gaze, strained. Grace contemplates how lost he 
           looks, almost afraid, before deciding to approach him.

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM - NIGHT

           Grace seems to breeze through the smoke and stench of male 
           sweat, and pulls Rainier aside. In hushed tones...

                                 GRACE
                        Louis XIV failed to take Monaco, 
                        Napoleon failed to take Monaco, De 
                        Gaulle will fail to take Monaco. No 
                        matter what happens here tonight.

           Rainier, absorbing her words of support- 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        And stop drinking, you need to keep 
                        your wits about you.

           She takes the bourbon away from him, a conspiratorial look, 
           as he watches her go ... feeling strangely empowered.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Grace steps out. Jean-Charles follows and closes the doors. 
           He grabs a drink from a passing waiter. An air of defeat.
                                 GRACE
                        It’s a lost cause, isn’t it?

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        No one will help us. If only 
                        Rainier wasn’t so pig-headed.  

                                 GRACE
                        What choice does he have?

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        I can bring De Gaulle to the 
                        negotiating table. To reach a 
                        compromise. But Rainier won’t 
                        listen to me. Maybe you can talk 
                        some sense into him. 

           Grace. Frozen. Her face. Like china. Staring at her own 
           sister-in-law’s husband, so nonchalant in his delivery. She 
           has to call on every ounce of skill drummed into her by Count 
           Fernando to hold it together. Jean-Charles downs his drink,  
           absently pinches at his ear as he puts the glass down. 
           Reminiscent of the ‘lie’ tell Fernando had shown her. 

                                 JEAN-CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Will you speak with him? The French 
                        President is not that unreasonable. 
                        Not if you know how to frame the 
                        conversation. 

           Beat. Grace nods and smiles, softly-

                                 GRACE
                        Never fear, Jean-Charles. Let me 
                        see what I can do.

           Jean-Charles smiles gratefully, before heading back into the 
           room. Grace realizes that her sister-in-law, Antoinette, is 
           glancing at her nervously from a conversation she’s having 
           across the room. Gauging Grace’s reaction. At her side, as 
           always, is her 13-year-old son CHRISTIAN. Antoinette smiles, 
           under any other circumstances genuine, but now, sinister.

           Grace’s pasted on fake smile doesn’t break.

           INT. PALACE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Grace in her dress, running, lost, upset, BARGING into -- 
           INT. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Grace -- hyper-ventilating -- yanking off her tight-fitting 
           gown -- loosening -- before crumpling on the bed and gasping 
           for air. Unable to comprehend what may be true. She takes a 
           moment to process what she just witnessed. Beat. She senses a 
           presence. She realizes the door to her room has opened ... 

           Phyllis steps in with the Superintendent ... now followed by 
           a somber MADGE. She doesn’t look like she’s under arrest. In 
           fact, they all look like they’re on the same side. Madge 
           looks to the others, before placing her ENVELOPE on the bed. 
           Beat. Grace picks up the envelope, very confused.

           INT. PALACE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Rainier STRIDES through, checking the rooms --

                                 RAINIER
                        Grace? Grace!

           Her chamber is empty -- as he frowns -- heads to his own 
           private chambers -- the door -- OPEN --  

           INT. PRINCE RAINIER’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - NIGHT

           Rainier enters to find Grace here, with the contents of 
           Madge’s ENVELOPE spread on the bureau desk -- 

                                 RAINIER
                        Are you all right? They said you 
                        left early. 

           He sees the contents of the envelope -- GRAINY PHOTOGRAPHS -- 
           a PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR’S REPORT: which contains pictures and 
           commentary on JEAN-CHARLES and ANTOINETTE meeting with De 
           Gaulle’s envoy PELLETIER. Rainier stares in horror at the 
           evidence in his hands -- his own family in deep conversation 
           with the enemy, accepting a briefcase from Pelletier, handing 
           over documents -- different places, different meetings --  

                                 GRACE
                        Did you tell Antoinette to meet 
                        with De Gaulle’s people? 

                                 RAINIER
                        Of course not, where did you get 
                        these?

                                 GRACE
                        Madge. She acted on her own 
                        suspicions. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT'D)
                        Hired a private eye to follow 
                        Antoinette and Jean-Charles. Your 
                        sister made a deal with France to 
                        deliver Monaco to De Gaulle, in 
                        return for eventually taking the 
                        throne. It’s all here. They leaked 
                        your papers, my press release, 
                        they’ve been visiting France every 
                        other week for the past five 
                        months, doing everything they can 
                        to sabotage us. 
                             (off his look)
                        Tuck told me tonight someone in the 
                        court will offer to make peace 
                        between you and De Gaulle, and that 
                        that person will be our traitor. 
                        Jean-Charles.

                                 RAINIER
                        Why didn’t you tell me anything...?

                                 GRACE
                        What would you have done?

           Rainier regards the photos, in utter disbelief. 

                                 RAINIER
                        You want me to accuse my own 
                        sister?

                                 GRACE
                        She’s trying to topple you! If they 
                        can work with De Gaulle and somehow 
                        remove you, Antoinette’s son 
                        Christian is next in line. Which 
                        makes her regent!

           Rainier slumps, defeated. Absorbing the unexpected discovery.

           A long moment of silence.

                                 RAINIER
                        I should have listened to my 
                        parents. They warned me against 
                        marrying a ... a movie star. 

                                 GRACE
                        You mean an American.

                                 RAINIER
                        I thought you were above this. 
                                 GRACE
                        Well I married a charming prince 
                        who turned into a stubborn, spoilt 
                        little man. Leading a stubborn, 
                        spoilt little Monaco. Have you ever 
                        wondered I might only have ended up 
                        here because my father disapproved 
                        of everybody else I brought home?

                                 RAINIER
                        Why don’t you leave?

                                 GRACE
                        Because we’ve got children! Because 
                        I might just still love you!

           She said it. It hits him right between the eyes. She sits, 
           exasperated. Two people trapped in the same circumstance. A 
           silent void between them. 

           Rainier regards the private detective photos in his hand, 
           then up at the portraits of PRINCE PIERRE, his father, and 
           PRINCESS CHARLOTTE, his real mother, looking down on them.  

                                 RAINIER
                        My parents never loved each other, 
                        you know. I could never understand 
                        how two people could be married yet 
                        not stand to be in each other’s 
                        company. 

                                 GRACE
                        People do it all the time.

                                 RAINIER
                        Not me, Grace. I spent most of my 
                        childhood in English boarding 
                        schools. Because I think I reminded 
                        them of how unhappy they were in 
                        their marriage. You know what the 
                        kids of the English nobility called 
                        me? Daddy’s little croupier. That 
                        wasn’t what I ever wanted for our 
                        children. I wanted them to have 
                        respect, I wanted them to grow up 
                        with parents who loved them, who 
                        loved each other. A family that 
                        would be the envy of everybody. 
                        When I saw you in The Swan, I said 
                        to myself ‘she’s the one’. An angel 
                        fit to be a Princess, a Princess 
                        fit to be a mother. 
                                 GRACE
                        If you’d looked a little harder 
                        you’d have seen Gracie the clod.

                                 RAINIER
                        And you would have seen Ray, the 
                        fat spoilt little Monaco, incapable 
                        of making the right decision if his 
                        life depended on it.

           Grace ... moved by his unusual candor ... 

                                 RAINIER (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        You looked enchanting tonight. It 
                        reminded me of the first time I met 
                        you in Cannes. 

           The moment settles ... 

                                 GRACE
                        What happened tonight?

                                 RAINIER
                        They all walked out. All of them. 
                        And when De Gaulle rolls his tanks 
                        through Monte Carlo, I’ll be Ray 
                        who lost everything to France.
                             (turns way)
                        I’m sorry for everything I haven’t 
                        been, Grace. For the disappointment 
                        I’ve become. 

           He grows silent. She eyes him, then gets up and turns him 
           around, to see he’s crying. It moves her, seeing him so 
           vulnerable. She comforts him.

                                 GRACE
                        Hey, stop it. Stop it right now. 

                                 RAINIER
                        I don’t know what to do, Grace.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m your wife. For richer for 
                        poorer. In sickness and in health. 
                        Til death us do part. 
                             (off his silence, she 
                              holds him)
                        So we lose a stupid old throne. 
                        What’s the worst that can happen? 
                        We buy a nice little house in 
                        Montpelier.

                                 GRACE (CONT'D)
                        You go to work every day, I’ll have 
                        dinner ready every night when you 
                        come home. At least our kids might 
                        have a shot at growing up 
                        moderately well-adjusted. This is 
                        the only thing that matters, and no 
                        one can take that away from us.

           Rainier, absorbing her courage, her perspective, her 
           pragmatism, her strength-

                                 RAINIER
                        Can you make pumpkin soup? 

                                 GRACE
                        My own special recipe.

           Beat. He laughs through the tears. She wipes them for him-

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Now pull yourself together. We 
                        still need to figure out what to do 
                        about the other ten thousand people 
                        you’re responsible for.

           Grace and Rainier. On a level. Through thick and thin. 

           She kisses him. 

           They observe each other for a moment longer. 

           Before they kiss again. 

           EXT. RECTORY - DAWN

           RAIN pelts the ground. Father Tucker steps out with his 
           suitcases, loading them into a waiting taxi. He surveys the 
           church one final time before getting in. The taxi pulls away.

           INT. RAINIER’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - DAWN

           Grace opens her eyes. She’s facing Rainier, who is fast 
           asleep in bed with her. She lingers on him momentarily. He 
           looks so peaceful, her charming prince, just an ordinary 
           vulnerable man. The man she fell in love with and married. 
           She crawls out of bed and grabs a robe. 

           INT. GRACE’S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

           Grace places a call ...
                                 GRACE (PHONE)
                        Hitch? It’s me. Did I wake you?

           INT. BEL AIR, LOS ANGELES. HITCHCOCK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Hitchcock, groggy, in bed, on the bedside phone-

                                 HITCHCOCK (PHONE)
                        No ... what time is it?

                                 GRACE (PHONE)
                        I’ve reached my decision. I’ve 
                        thought about it long and hard.
                             (beat)
                        I think you should find somebody 
                        else for the role.

                                 HITCHCOCK (PHONE)
                        Is everything okay, Gracie?

                                 GRACE (PHONE)
                        Everything’s fine. I’ll explain all 
                        the next time we see each other. 
                        Good luck. And I’m sorry.

           Hitchcock. Hears the finality in her tone, but also a sense 
           of purpose that was never there before ... 

                                 HITCHCOCK
                        To be honest, I never thought you 
                        were right for the role anyway.
                             (beat)
                        Look after yourself, your highness.

           INT. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - EARLY MORNING

           Grace, clearer than she’s ever been, hangs up and regards the  
           TWO UNOPENED ENVELOPES on her desk. Tucker’s handwriting. One 
           addressed to her, and one to Rainier. She’s formulating a 
           thought ... off RED CROSS COMMITTEE documentation ... 

                                 RAINIER
                        What time is it ... ?

           Rainier enters, yawning, in his robe.

                                 GRACE
                        Six A.M.

           He sees the envelopes- picks up the one in his name-
                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Tucker’s gone.

                                 RAINIER
                        Gone?

                                 GRACE
                        Home.

                                 RAINIER
                        He didn’t say goodbye ... ?

                                 GRACE
                        I think his work here was done. 
                             (then)
                        What if I have a solution to our 
                        problem? Will you let me try 
                        something?

                                 RAINIER
                        Like what?

                                 GRACE
                        To show the world what every bully 
                        really is. An ogre.

           Rainier, blank. She walks past him-

                                 RAINIER
                        What about the movie?

                                 GRACE
                        What movie?

           INT. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - EARLY MORNING

           Grace, before a great mirror, getting dressed in her WHITE 
           CEREMONIAL ROYAL DRESS. The make-up. The hair. Her staff are 
           helping her. Phyllis and Madge dutifully involved. 

                                 GRACE
                        I owe you an apology, Madge.

                                 MADGE
                        A princess must never apologize to 
                        her servants, ma’am. It’s not the 
                        done thing.

           A look of mutual respect. Before Phyllis hands Madge the 
           tiara, which she places carefully on Grace’s head, as Grace 
           eyes the GREAT PORTRAITS of Monaco’s past monarchs staring 
           down at her. The weight Rainier feels all so clearly, now on 
           her shoulders, as she rips open Tucker’s letter to her-
           INT. RAINIER’S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

           Rainier sits reading the letter Tucker left for him. We don’t 
           see what it says, but it has moved him profoundly.

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE OF MONACO. ANTOINETTE’S QUARTERS - DAY

           SHARP PERSISTENT KNOCKING on the door. Antoinette, pulling 
           her robes together over her pajamas, opens it to see MADGE 
           standing on the other side.

                                 MADGE
                        The Princess has summoned you, 
                        ma’am.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        What? What time is it?

                                 MADGE
                        She insists. It’s very urgent.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        Alright, alright, I’m coming.

           INT. MAIN PALACE HALLWAYS - DAY

           Antoinette and Jean-Charles, still in their pajamas, being 
           escorted by Madge, appearing at the throne room, to find 
           GUARDS, perfectly turned out, the palace staff, opening doors 
           for them, as they head into the throne room -- where --

           INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

           PRINCESS GRACE OF MONACO sits on the throne, awaiting their 
           arrival. She’s an ominous, regal sight. They are surrounded 
           by Delavenne, Madge, Phyllis, the ministers, all summoned, in 
           reverential silence. 

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        Grace? What’s the meaning of this?

                                 GRACE
                        You’ve brought shame to this house, 
                        Antoinette.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        How?

                                 GRACE
                        You’ve betrayed us.
                                 ANTOINETTE
                        Betrayed you?

           Grace approaches her, and drops the dossier of evidence at 
           their feet. The paper and photos scatter across the marble. 

                                 GRACE
                        What did it take to sell your own 
                        family out to France? Money? Or the 
                        promise of the throne? 

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        This is preposterous, Grace-

                                 GRACE
                        Altesse when you address me.

           Grace. Her expression like ice.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        We’ll see what Rainier has to say 
                        about this.

                                 GRACE
                        He’s right behind you.

           Antoinette and Jean-Charles turn to see Rainier standing by 
           the doors. Antoinette grows pale at his silent stare of pity 
           and bitter disappointment.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        Ray, this must be some kind of 
                        misunderstanding-

                                 GRACE
                        You’re to leave Monaco and never to 
                        return. 

                                 ANTOINETTE
                             (incredulous)
                        You can’t banish me.
                             (she clearly can)
                        Rainier, please-

                                 RAINIER
                        Listen to what Grace has to say.

                                 JEAN-CHARLES
                        I will not be accused like this by 
                        the Princess-

                                 RAINIER
                        SHUT UP!
           Jean-Charles and Antoinette at a loss before a united couple. 

                                 GRACE
                        The decision has been made. You’re 
                        being banished. Before you go, you 
                        and your wife will perform one 
                        final act of service for Monaco. 

                                 ANTOINETTE
                             (grimly)
                        Why would we do such a thing?

                                 GRACE
                        Because if you do, I’ll make sure 
                        your son is looked after, even if 
                        you are to never to set foot in 
                        Monaco again.

           Antoinette, for a brief moment she can no longer see Grace 
           Kelly behind the eyes, but an able adversary. She smiles.

                                 ANTOINETTE
                        How long do you think you’re going 
                        to last here, ma cherie?

                                 GRACE
                        Long enough to see the back of you, 
                        dear. Or would you prefer being 
                        guillotined for treason? The law is 
                        still on the statute books.

           INT. GRACE’S ROYAL CHAMBERS - DAY

           Grace sweeps in, her staff working double-time. She spins out 
           of her ceremonial dress and into modern suit, fashionable 
           heels, horn-rimmed glasses, an elaborate costume and hair 
           change- as Rupert looks in-

                                 RUPERT
                        Okay, we’re all set. The committee 
                        room awaits, you highness.

           INT. PRINCESS GRACE HOSPITAL. COMMITTEE ROOM - DAY

           Countess Baciochi and the ladies of the Red Cross, assembled 
           hastily, as Grace enters, Phyllis and Madge behind her-

                                 COUNTESS BACIOCHI (MONEGASQUE)
                        It’s like we have nothing better to 
                        do than be at her beck and call.
                                 RED CROSS NOBLE LADY 1 (MONEGASQUE)
                        Does she think those glasses make 
                        her appear any more capable?

                                 GRACE (MONEGASQUE)
                        Good morning, ladies. Thank you for 
                        arriving at such short notice. I 
                        apologize if I may have 
                        inconvenienced some of you. 

           A glance at Baciochi, who is shocked and embarrassed into 
           silence at Grace speaking her language. 

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        But your country needs you more 
                        than ever and we don’t have much 
                        time.

                                 COUNTESS BACIOCHI
                        For what?

                                 GRACE
                        We’re going ahead with the Ball in 
                        October as a matter of urgency. 
                        You, Countess, are to reach out to 
                        the International Committee in 
                        Geneva and inform them. We’ll need 
                        to get our invite list done and out 
                        today. October is only a couple of 
                        weeks away.

                                 COUNTESS BACIOCHI
                        Wouldn’t it seem unseemly to have a 
                        party when we are only days from 
                        being invaded?

                                 GRACE
                        Let’s see if we can’t solve this 
                        problem by doing what we do best, 
                        shall we? Throwing a Ball. I am a 
                        Princess after all.

           Baciochi glances at the other ladies, wondering if Grace may 
           have just about lost her mind.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        And I’d be grateful if you were to 
                        accompany me to Paris tomorrow.

                                 COUNTESS BACIOCHI
                        What would we do in Paris, ma’am?

                                 GRACE
                        Shopping, of course.
           Baciochi, unsure if that was a joke or not.

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. PRESS OFFICE - DAY

           Rupert places a stack of boxes on Rainier’s desk. RED CROSS 
           INVITES, carrying the SEAL OF THE HOUSE OF GRIMALDI. He looks 
           to Delavenne and the others, then starts the long process of 
           signing each invite personally. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The INVITES going into RED ENVELOPES by the palace staff.

           EXT. AUTOROUTE MONACO/FRANCE BORDER - DAY

           The French army. Literally camped on Monaco’s border. Ready 
           to move in ahead of the timetable

           A FRENCH SOLDIER notices a CONVOY of cars appearing from the 
           French side. NEWS CREWS, pulling up, disembarking. 

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER (FRENCH)
                        Hey- you can’t stop here. 

           But he’s helpless, as a ROYAL CONVOY appears from the Monaco 
           side of the line ... and pulls up. The French Soldier 
           suddenly very nervous under the glare of the media’s cameras, 
           as the window winds down, and Grace holds out her papers to 
           him. He takes them, glances at her passengers in the vehicle, 
           which includes Phyllis, Madge and Countess Baciochi.

                                 FRENCH SOLDIER (FRENCH) (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 GRACE
                        We’re flying to Paris!

           The soldier, dazzled by her Hollywood smile, nervously drops 
           the papers, picks them back up, and waves the party through. 

           INT. GRACE’S ROLLS ROYCE (MOVING) - DAY

           Countess Baciochi watches the press cameras flashing away as 
           they pass through the military blockade into France. She 
           turns to Grace, who puts on her sunglasses. One moment Grace 
           Kelly, the next Princess Grace. This is quite a skillful 
           display of acting ability.

                                                                CUT TO:
           SEQUENCE: The RED ENVELOPES travel around the world. They 
           land in the mail-bags and on the desks of the great and the 
           good. From Onassis, to Hitchcock, to Count Fernando, to the 
           Hollywood talent agencies, to Buckingham Palace, to the halls 
           of the Kremlin-  

           INT. WASHINGTON, OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           The SEAL of the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES. We are behind 
           the President’s leather chair. We don’t see him, just his 
           hands sliding a letter opener through the red envelope, to 
           reveal the invite: “To President John F Kennedy... We 
           cordially invite you to the Annual Ball of the International 
           Red Cross, Monaco... (signed) HSH Prince Rainier III and HSH 
           Princess Grace.” An RSVP card is attached-

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. FRENCH PRESIDENT’S PALACE - DAY

           De Gaulle stands holding an invite too, his arm in a sling.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        What is the meaning of this? Most 
                        of Europe walked out on him last 
                        month.

                                 PELLETIER
                        They walked out on Rainier. This is 
                        for charity. And it’s for Grace.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        What’s wrong with them? Don’t they 
                        know their people are suffering?

                                 PELLETIER
                        It gets even better.

           Pelletier walks over and puts the TV on. It’s on a French 
           game-show. De Gaulle looks at him blank. Pelletier realizes 
           he’s on the wrong channel, changes it to show the NEWS:-

           Footage of Grace and her entourage going from store to store 
           in Paris. It’s fun, lighthearted. She’s trying on outfits. 

                                 PELLETIER (CONT’D)
                        She’s been in Paris for the past 
                        few days. Staying at the Ritz. 
                        She’s shopping.

           De Gaulle regards the screen, then the invite ...

                                 DE GAULLE
                        Is Kennedy going?
                                 PELLETIER
                        He hasn’t confirmed yet. He has 
                        plenty of problems with Cuba right 
                        now. But Khrushchev’s sending his 
                        foreign envoy, and I’m told the 
                        Prince of Wales will attend along 
                        with the British Prime Minister. 

           INT. PARIS, RUE SAINT HONORÉ - DAY

           Grace and her entourage, hunted by the press, as she 
           navigates the haute couture stores. She’s sublime, suave, a 
           European Princess and Hollywood movie star rolled into one -- 
           avoiding EVERY question, mostly about the ‘CRISIS’ and 
           ‘RETURNING TO HOLLYWOOD’ -- which seems to drive the press 
           crazy - now diving into the nearest BOUTIQUE-

           INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

           Grace holed up at the back of the boutique, glancing from a 
           side-window at the press congregated out the front.

                                 GRACE
                        How long do you think before De 
                        Gaulle interferes?

                                 RUPERT
                        I doubt he’ll cause a scene. Better 
                        let you hang yourself. Are you 
                        ready?

           EXT. RUE SAINT HONORÉ - DAY

           The press SCRAMBLE as Grace steps out of the boutique. 
           Questions fly from every angle: “is Rainier happy with you 
           spending time in Paris given the crisis with France?”, “What 
           about Marnie, Grace? When do you start filming?” 

           Grace. In the eye of the storm. She removes her sunglasses. 
           Holds them all firmly in a warm gaze. Time to face the music.

                                 GRACE
                        I called Mr Alfred Hitchcock a few 
                        days ago. I informed him of my 
                        decision. I will not be returning 
                        to Hollywood. I left Grace Kelly 
                        behind when I married Prince 
                        Rainier. That will not change.
                             (the silence settles)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT'D)
                        As long as I am able and permitted, 
                        I will keep focus on my family and 
                        my humanitarian work. Countess 
                        Baciochi, my chief officer for The 
                        Princess Grace Hospital Red Cross 
                        Committee has an announcement to 
                        make, which I’d like you all to pay 
                        very close attention to. 

           The press jostle to get closer, as Baciochi takes her cue and 
           unfolds a piece of paper, reading, clearly coached by Grace- 

                                 COUNTESS BACIOCHI
                        I am pleased to announce that on 
                        the ninth of October, the Prince’s 
                        Palace of Monaco will host the 
                        Annual Ball for the International 
                        Red Cross. In a large measure to 
                        the kindness of Her Serene Highness 
                        Princess Grace, we have the 
                        opportunity to use this white tie, 
                        tails, and tiara event, to reaffirm 
                        awareness of a global organization 
                        that has given so much to the 
                        world, and the need to support its 
                        humanitarian endeavors.

                                 REPORTER
                        Who’s going to attend?

                                 GRACE
                        Everybody, I hope.

                                 REPORTER
                        Has President De Gaulle been 
                        invited?

                                 GRACE
                        Of course. 

           Her smile creates a hell of a response- 

           FLASH BULBS.

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. FRENCH PRESIDENT’S PALACE - DAY

           De Gaulle and Pelletier are on a CONFERENCE CALL. 

                                 PELLETIER (PHONE)
                        Are you absolutely sure there’s no 
                        other motive behind this?
                                 JEAN-CHARLES (PHONE)
                        The Red Cross means a lot to her, 
                        Mr President. She’s keeping herself 
                        busy, that’s all. 

           INT. MONACO, OFFICE - DAY

           Jean-Charles on the other end of the line. 

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        Do we have Rainier where we want 
                        him?

                                 JEAN-CHARLES (PHONE)
                        He has nowhere else to turn. I 
                        think he’ll just about agree to 
                        anything, including handing over 
                        Monaco’s sovereignty.

           Jean-Charles wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                 DE GAULLE (PHONE)
                        Your loyalty to France won’t go 
                        without reward, Jean-Charles.

                                 JEAN-CHARLES (PHONE)
                        Thank you, Mr President.

           Jean-Charles hangs up. Beat. He looks to the others in the 
           room. Rainier, Onassis, Delavenne, listening to every word. 

           INT. PARIS, FRANCE. FRENCH PRESIDENT’S PALACE - DAY

           De Gaulle and Pelletier sit back and absorb the moment. De 
           Gaulle surveys his MAP, where tiny Monaco is encircled by the 
           mighty French troops. He moves more pieces into place, eyeing 
           his prize, shortly to become his.  

                                 PELLETIER
                        Maybe we should snub the Ball.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        I’ve had paramilitary organizations 
                        try to kill me. I’m not afraid of 
                        an ex-actress. There are moments, 
                        Emile. Moments where greatness is 
                        defined. Where what has gone before 
                        is just a prelude. 

                                 PELLETIER
                        Monaco means that much to you?
                                 DE GAULLE
                        Monaco means nothing to me. It’s a 
                        message. I am Charles De Gaulle. 
                        And this is France’s Fifth 
                        Republic.
                             (off the thought)
                        Call Rainier and tell him I will 
                        accept his wife’s invitation. We 
                        will ride into Monte Carlo before 
                        the eyes of the world in triumph. 
                             (then)
                        Besides, if Cary Grant is going to 
                        be there, Yvonne will kill me if I 
                        turn down the invitation.

           INT. PARIS AIRPORT - DAY

           Father Tucker sits in the DEPARTURE LOUNGE, reading a 
           NEWSPAPER. He scans PHOTOS of PRINCESS GRACE shopping, the 
           announcement of the RED CROSS BALL. He smiles to himself. His 
           flight is called -- the boards flicker -- from PARIS to NEW 
           YORK INTERNATIONAL. He gets up and heads for the gate.

           EXT. MONTE CARLO, PRINCE’S PALACE OF MONACO - NIGHT

           It is October 1962.

           We’re outside the palace gates, RAIN POURS, FLASH BULBS, 
           people struggling to rubberneck at convoys of BLACK 
           LIMOUSINES sweeping past and into the PALACE GATES.

           The Palace itself is lit up like it’s in a fairy-tale. The 
           ANNUAL BALL OF THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS.

           We’re seeing it all through the eyes of the ordinary people 
           who despite the circumstances have gathered to witness the 
           untouchable, the rich and the powerful in their opulence.

           INT. DE GAULLE’S CITROËN DS LIMOUSINE (MOVING) - NIGHT

           De Gaulle watches the streets of Monaco passing. He’s dressed 
           in his trademark military uniform. Here to make his statement 
           with as much pomp and circumstance as possible. He regards 
           the barbed wire splitting the country in two with a sense of 
           satisfaction.

           Yvonne sits alongside him, reading the LE MONDE newspaper. 

                                 YVONNE
                        Mr Hitchcock’s giving the role to 
                        someone called Tippi Hedren.
                                 DE GAULLE
                        Never heard of her. 

           EXT. MONTE CARLO. SQUARE - NIGHT

           The FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL CONVOY navigates the streets. It is 
           an ominous sight. Not just the imposing Citroëns whose 
           headlights cut through the rain, but also the huge army 
           escort that bookends the cars as a result of the earlier 
           failed assassination attempt. 

           INT. RAINIER’S LIMO (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Grace, nervous but determined for what’s to come, the rain-
           soaked streets rolling by as she travels to the palace from 
           another part of town. Rainier at her side. He holds her hand 
           and gives it a squeeze. She takes strength from it.

           EXT. PRINCE’S PALACE OF MONACO - NIGHT

           Someone throws a rotten vegetable at De Gaulle’s convoy, 
           which hits his limo’s windscreen. The wipers just washes it 
           away with the rain --  

           -- and the convoy pulls into the grounds -- footmen are quick 
           to open the doors. De Gaulle and Yvonne disembark, as 
           umbrellas are held over them. The French contingent set off a 
           barrage of CAMERA FLASHES, BLINDING us. De Gaulle, proudly 
           making an imperial entrance at the Palace. 

                                 YVONNE
                        Oh look, there’s Cary Grant. 

           De Gaulle casts his gaze around to see stars of stage and 
           screen mingling with statesmen, the red carpet a blinding 
           flash of photographers-

                                 DE GAULLE
                        He’s only an actor, dear, you’re 
                        the wife of a world leader. 

           Pelletier joins them, as De Gaulle lingers on something else-

                                 DE GAULLE (CONT’D)
                        Emile, we didn’t blockade the 
                        palace, did we? 

                                 PELLETIER
                        No, why?

           Pelletier follows his gaze to BARBED WIRE lining the palace-
                                 DE GAULLE
                        So why the chicken wire?

                                 PELLETIER
                             (whispers)
                        Mcnamara’s here.

           ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, the US DEFENSE SECRETARY, is getting out 
           of a convoy of US government representatives.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        I suppose nobody can resist a ball.

           A ROAR goes up from the crowd, the press goes nuts, because 
           the ROYAL MONEGASQUE CONVOY has arrived, and out steps --  

           Rainier ... leading out ... Grace. In all her majesty.

                                                                CUT TO:

           We’re Grace in the eye of the storm. A heartstopping entrance 
           of astonishing beauty and glamor. She is blinded by the 
           flashbulbs, holds her smile, waves to the crowds, can see the 
           palace lit up. It is disorienting and crazy.

           Her convoy has stopped JUST BEFORE the BARBED WIRE, which we 
           now realize (with De Gaulle) has been strategically placed. 
           As she waves, as she holds her smile, she is forced to step 
           over a part of the barbed wire, with Rainier’s help. Only for 
           her dress to get caught on the razor wire. She stops-

           A sudden HUSH. Rainier, Madge, Phyllis, all run to her aid to 
           make sure the dress isn’t damaged. The press go crazy. The 
           incongruity of the beautiful Princess getting caught by a 
           siege line. An image of a damsel in distress, as her charming 
           prince tries to help her-

           The rest of the guests, including Mcnamara are all distracted 
           from their conversations by Grace’s moment of distress. They 
           are pointing to the barbed wire quizzically, then pointing to 
           De Gaulle. 

           Mcnamara looks over to De Gaulle, a nod, but he doesn’t look 
           too happy. 

           The color drains from De Gaulle’s face. A sinking feeling at 
           what just happened -- feeling everyone singling him out -- 

           -- as Rainier frees Grace. She keeps the smile genuine, 
           waving to the crowd, moment of crisis over, rising above it -- 

           De Gaulle realizes Delavenne is standing next to them.
                                 DELAVENNE
                        Welcome to Monaco, Mr President. 

           De Gaulle pushes past him and goes up the steps. Pelletier 
           follows. Trying to get away from this spectacle. 

           INT. PRINCE’S PALACE. MAIN RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Grace, into the hall, the lights, the string orchestra 
           playing music, the waiters serving, the guests talking to us, 
           it’s all so ghostly. Center of the world. Eyes scanning for 
           De Gaulle-

           De Gaulle and his people take their seats. He eyes Grace 
           gliding through the roll-call of celebrities. Locking eyes 
           across the serene surroundings. As Grace --

           -- comes face to face with ANTOINETTE and JEAN-CHARLES, who 
           takes her hand and publicly curtseys. Grace, knowing De 
           Gaulle’s eyes are on her, steps in, and KISSES Antoinette on 
           BOTH CHEEKS.

           Grace holds Antoinette in an intent stare, this was her final 
           act of service, a public display of unity and affection with 
           Monaco’s royal family.

           De Gaulle realizes what’s happening here. An ogre in a trap. 
           He shoots a desperate glance at Jean-Charles, who looks 
           sheepish, looks away apologetically from De Gaulle, leads 
           Antoinette across to their seat at RAINIER’S TABLE-

                                 DE GAULLE
                        We can’t stay here, Emile. We have 
                        to walk out, right now. 

                                 PELLETIER
                        We can’t-

                                 DE GAULLE
                        She won’t make a fool of me-

                                 PELLETIER
                        If you storm out now, it will look 
                        very bad. It’s the Red Cross. It’s 
                        an international charity that has 
                        frequently helped France.  

           A VOICE wafts over ... calling De Gaulle ... 

           It’s Mcnamara, from a nearby table of the US delegation. 
                                 MCNAMARA
                        You’re not really going to drop a 
                        bomb on Princess Grace, are you, 
                        Charles? 

                                 DE GAULLE
                        What would it matter to you if I 
                        did?

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Let’s grab some time to chat after 
                        dinner, shall we? Jack sends his 
                        regards, by the way. 

           Mcnamara, friendly, but his tone pretty firm, sits and turns 
           his attention back to his own table. But it’s apparent the 
           Americans have taken the incident badly. They’re clearly 
           still talking about what America’s Princess had to endure.

           De Gaulle, tasting helplessness and an impending sense of 
           defeat. He slumps down, trapped, next to Yvonne, who is 
           enjoying herself immensely, oblivious to the politics being 
           played below the surface of this facade.

                                                              TIME CUT:

           The BALL is under way. The serene strings play. We’re with 
           Grace. She’s watching De Gaulle not eating and not taking his 
           eyes off her. He knows who just check-mated him.  

           APPLAUSE. 

           Grace realizes it’s for her. She’s been introduced by the MC 
           on the stage to welcome everybody. A ghostly voice. Ghostly 
           applause. Lights in our eyes. Clutching her notes to stop her 
           hands from shaking. She walks up to stage, to the MICROPHONE-
           The faces in the crowd, looking up at her. 

                                 GRACE
                             (nervous to start ...)
                        I’m truly touched that you would 
                        all honor our tiny corner of the 
                        world with your presence. Goodness, 
                        we’ve had a spot of trouble lately.

           A gentle laugh ripples through the audience. Which grows 
           quiet again, in anticipation of what’s to come-

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        When I was acting in New York, with
                        my Uncle George, I used to pray 
                        every night. The same prayer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        That should I ever make it, 
                        whatever ‘make it’ means, I would 
                        never be ungrateful. That if I was 
                        ever in a position of influence, I 
                        would use it for good. Some of you 
                        ask, why did I leave Hollywood? I 
                        left because I fell in love with a 
                        charming Prince. A man who inspired 
                        me to see the world with enough 
                        compassion that I might want to do 
                        something about all the unfair 
                        things I see in it. We get so 
                        caught up in our day- to-day lives, 
                        we forget that there’s a huge world 
                        out there, beyond what little 
                        problems we each may have. That’s 
                        why we’re honoring the Red Cross 
                        tonight. A force for good that’s 
                        been so close to my heart.

           Grace pauses. She can’t see the faces now, the lights have 
           blinded her ...

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        A wonderful man said to me once, 
                        not so long ago in fact, that when 
                        people dream of marrying royalty, 
                        they never comprehend what it 
                        actually means. It means having to 
                        choose in life. I chose the House 
                        of Monaco. It may not seem a noble 
                        place, it may seem pompous and 
                        circumstantial. I may not speak its 
                        language, and heavens it may 
                        frustrate me at times. But it’s my 
                        home. These are my people. And 
                        they’re a good people. Trying to do 
                        the right thing, in their own small 
                        corner of the world, even when they 
                        may not know how- 
                             (looks to Rainier)
                        Those of you who are married will 
                        know what I mean. 

           A ripple of laughter from everyone except De Gaulle. Grace 
           observes him glaring at her. The beast in the military 
           uniform. Grace, the Princess under siege.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Because I believe fairy-tales can 
                        exist if we really want them to. If 
                        we’re prepared to work hard enough. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        I believe that the world won’t 
                        always be full of hatred and 
                        conflict, but eventually love will 
                        win out, no matter what your 
                        differences may be. That’s what 
                        Monaco means to me. 

           She grows silent, calling on her steel, a sense of belief-

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        And in a way, that’s why I am 
                        Monaco. I have no army. I wish ill 
                        on nobody. I wage no war. I offer 
                        no resistance to aggression. I only 
                        seek to make a little difference in 
                        the world I live in. But it 
                        wouldn’t be real life, or the fairy-
                        tale, if there wasn’t someone 
                        trying to destroy it, or crush it, 
                        simply because it doesn’t please 
                        them, or simply because they can. 
                        And some of you might think it’s 
                        their right to so. But I don’t 
                        believe anybody should have the 
                        right to crush beauty where they 
                        see it. That’s not how I was 
                        raised. That’s not the world I want 
                        to be a part of. I would rather see 
                        the bombs fall on my house, I would 
                        rather see the tanks roll through 
                        my lawn, than know that I live in a 
                        world where love doesn’t conquer 
                        all. Because, you see, I believe in 
                        love. And it’s love that has 
                        brought us here tonight. It’s love 
                        that’s made you put your guns away, 
                        and your politics, and your fears 
                        and prejudices, and it’s love that 
                        will make everything right, 
                        wherever you may be, whatever you 
                        may be doing. And tonight I’m going 
                        to celebrate it, and be willing to 
                        defend it. I hope you will do the 
                        same. Not just here, but out there, 
                        in your own way, in your own lives.

           Grace. De Gaulle. A ghostly quiet. The beauty and the beast.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Welcome.

           Grace ... stops. Beat. Nobody’s clapping. She turns away from 
           the microphone ... awkwardly ... walks down the podium in the 
           silent HUSH. Still nobody’s clapping.
           Rainier regards the audience, everyone watching her return to 
           her seat, at his side. 

           Grace sits down to silence. 

           ... when ... a LONE CLAP from the back of the hall ... two 
           more joining in ... the guests ... getting to their feet ... 
           becoming applause ... and ...  

           ... the applause becomes a standing ovation for a very honest 
           and serene princess.

           De Gaulle. Blown away by her strength ...  

           ... as the RUSSIAN foreign ministers, Mcnamara, the US 
           delegates ... all joining in the applause. 

           Grace, breaking into a relieved grin at the ovation. Rainier, 
           at her side, clapping for her along with her adoring 
           audience, gives her a warm kiss. 

                                 RAINIER
                             (whispers)
                        I love you.

           De Gaulle meanwhile is growing puce at the colossal image of 
           fairy-tale romance Grace has erected before him. The applause 
           dying down. Everyone returning to their conversations. The 
           MUSIC STARTS. Beat. He throws his napkin down-

                                                                CUT TO:

           Grace is being congratulated on a fine speech by a long line 
           of guests, only to see De Gaulle pushing through bodies. 
           Rainier subtly blocks De Gaulle’s path, as Pelletier tries to 
           stop the Frenchman making a scene. Now face to face with 
           Grace. Pulling himself to his full height. Looking down on 
           her. An ogre over the Princess. 

           Her face, perfectly blank. Innocent. Somewhere in the 
           background, Count Fernando is smiling to himself.

                                 DE GAULLE
                        You, my lady, are ... are ... 
                             (here it comes-)
                        l’aphrodite americain. 

           De Gaulle, no more to be said, motions to Pelletier to leave, 
           and he strides back the way he came. Grace looks to Rainier 
           as they watch him go- 

                                 GRACE
                        American Aphrodite. That’s good, 
                        right?
                                 RAINIER
                        You know, I think it might actually 
                        have been a complement.

           They watch De Gaulle take his seat and be scolded by his wife 
           for making such a show all the time. Grace takes Rainier’s 
           hand, a smile between them, a job well done ... before 
           returning to their guests ... as we PULL AWAY, and HEAR:

                                 FATHER TUCKER (V.O.)
                        Long after I’m gone, long after the 
                        Grimaldis have fallen, the world 
                        will remember your name, your 
                        highness-

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Rainier and Grace DANCE at the ball. The Prince and the 
           Princess. A husband and wife, together in their fairytale. 
           The world around them blurring.

                                 FATHER TUCKER (V.O.)
                        For you are the fairy-tale. The 
                        beauty and serenity we all aspire 
                        to achieve. A peace that comes not 
                        from what others think of you, but 
                        of the confidence you have in the 
                        role you are destined to play.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           YEARS LATER. The ERA is LATE-1960s. Grace in her office at 
           the palace. She is nearing 40. The first lines on her face. 
           Reading Father Tucker’s note, which had given her the 
           strength, for the thousandth time. Which we are HEARING:

                                 FATHER TUCKER (V.O.)
                        A devout mother, a loyal wife, a 
                        compassionate leader. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SOMEWHERE IN DELAWARE. Father Tucker in a SMALL TOWN CHURCH. 
           Now 80. Opening a LETTER that carries the SEAL OF THE ROYAL 
           HOUSE OF GRIMALDI: H.S.H. PRINCESS GRACE OF MONACO. Her 
           looped handwriting, now so familiar to us-

                                 FATHER TUCKER (V.O.)
                        Those that preceded you will be 
                        forgotten. Those that follow you 
                        will aspire to your greatness. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           Grace writing the LETTER that Tucker has just opened. Time 
           has made her more graceful. Her hand is steady and assured- 

                                 FATHER TUCKER (V.O.)
                        For no matter where you are, they 
                        will continue to whisper your name: 
                        The Princess Grace. A timeless 
                        symbol of everything that is good. 
                        And I will forever remain your 
                        servant. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Father Tucker looks to the bottom of the letter from Grace. 
           The SIGNATURE ... and he is proud because-

                                                                CUT TO:

           Grace, hovering over the signature portion of the letter. 
           Like she did at the start of the movie. Except now she signs 
           it perfectly, confidently, first time.

                            “GRACE DE MONACO.”

           She surveys it for a moment, before sitting back and looking 
           out of the window. As we leave her at the same desk we once 
           found her, now with a sense of peace. Of serenity. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           END TITLES:

           “In October 1962, De Gaulle lifted his blockade and demands 
           for total taxation. This was considered a total victory for 
           Prince Rainier, and led to the foundation of Monaco’s new 
           constitution. 

           For attempting to depose her brother, Princess Antoinette was 
           exiled from the palace, but permitted by Princess Grace to 
           stay in Monaco, where she passed away in March 18, 2011.  

           Father Francis Tucker never returned to Monaco, living the 
           rest of his natural life in the United States. Though he had 
           many successors in the Prince’s Palace, no one managed to 
           recreate the bond he had formed with the royal household.

           In 1964, the Princess Grace Foundation was formed, a first 
           milestone in Grace’s many humanitarian endeavors.  

           Grace and Rainier went on to have a third child, Stephanie. 

           Grace Kelly never acted again.”
