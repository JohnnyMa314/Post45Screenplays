           THE SCREEN IS BLACK

           The clean sound of canoe-paddles cutting through calm water. 

           EXT. LAKE MOHAWK - FADE IN - MORNING

           We track the front of an ANTIQUE WOODEN CANOE as it makes 
           landfall on the beach. BARE MANLY LEGS, clad only in OLD 
           LEATHER MOCCASINS, stumble out of the boat. An EMPTY WINE 
           BOTTLE falls to the ground next to him. 

           EXT. QUAINT LAKE HOUSE - MORNING

           JOYCE CLARK, 50s, is gardening. She waves to a FAMILY as they 
           walk towards their boat. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Have fun out there, gang. How ‘bout 
                        those fireworks?

                                 FAMILY MAN
                        Best Fourth in years. 
                             (something catches his 
                              eye, concerned)
                        Joyce, do you know that man? 

           Joyce turns, perplexed. We ZOOM ON her SHOCKED FACE. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Clay?

           The camera turns onto CLAY MASON, 30s, as he stumbles across 
           the yard dressed only in a traditional Native American CROTCH 
           COVERING. A red line of WAR PAINT under each eye and a 
           crudely shaved MOHAWK. -- Clay Mason is not Native American.

                                 CLAY
                             (slurred speech)
                        Oh, g’morning Misses Clark. I was 
                        just wondering if Hol--
                             (hiccup, burp)
                        Holly was around?

                                 JOYCE
                             (calls towards house)
                        Robert... Robert?... Robert!

           INSIDE HOUSE: HOLLY CLARK, late 20s, very pretty, races to 
           her window, still in her night-shirt. She sees Clay. 
                                 HOLLY
                             (turns, frantic)
                        Dad! Don’t go outside! 

           But it’s too late...

           FRONT DOOR: It opens, and out walks ROBERT CLARK, a no-
           nonsense Chris-Cooper-esque father. He’s furious. 

                                 ROBERT
                             (into house, direct order)
                        Holly, stay in the house - call an 
                        ambulance. 

           Robert slams the front door. He makes a fist. 

                                 CLAY
                             (raises hand like Indian 
                              saying How)
                        Look, Bobby. I just wanted to 
                        apologizes for last night... and to 
                        ask permission’s daughter to take 
                        your hand in marriage--

                             (sober, serious)
                        My name is Clay Mason and I’m an 
                        alcoholic. 
                             (a beat)
                        It’s taken me my entire life to say 
                        those nine simple words...

           UN-FREEZE: Clay’s BODY falls to the ground, his head crashing 
           directly atop a CERAMIC GARDEN GNOME, shattering it. 

                                 CLAY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...but sometimes the simplest words 
                        are the hardest to say. 

           CLOSE ON: The smiling face of the GNOME, whose POINTED HAT 
           has successfully punctured the side of Clay’s cheek. 

           FADE TO BLACK. 

                                     SOBERED UP

           The classic guitar riff of FREE’S “All Right Now” drops as we 
           FADE IN:
           EXT. MEMORIAL DAY COOKOUT - ABOUT A MONTH AGO - DAY

           CLAY MASON, full head of hair, and looking great, blends 
           margaritas for friends and family at his father’s summer 
           house over-looking SAG HARBOR. 

                                 CLAY
                             (lifts blender like a foot-
                              ball)
                        And he’s looking long... long... 
                        can’t find anybody and oooh, he 
                        checks down.
                             (pours blender over 
                              glasses)
                        It’s a screen-pass. 

           A hot girl named JENNY smiles as she takes her margarita and 
           walks over to her pretty friend, CLAIRE. 

                                 JENNY
                        Clay looks good. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Yeah, well... you’d have better 
                        luck taming Kiefer Sutherland. 

           They look over as Clay pantomimes what R-Kelly might look 
           like giving a sex-ed demonstration. They shake their heads. 

           An older, impeccably-dressed gentlemen, BEN NEWTON, 70, 
           approaches Clay with his TROPHY WIFE. -- Clay rearranges his 
           posture. Responsible, as if he’s meeting a dignitary. 

                                 CLAY
                        Mr. Newton. - I was just uh, 
                        demonstrating to these heathens,
                             (motions to friends)
                        How not to behave when you’ve had 
                        too much to drink. 

           Mr. Newton and his wife laugh. 

                                 MR. NEWTON
                        Well I gotta’ tell you, Clay. This 
                        is without-a-doubt, the best damn 
                        margarita I’ve had outside Cabo San 
                        Lucas. - What is your secret? 

                                 CLAY
                        Tequila. 

           They laugh. 
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        But speaking of secrets, sir. I’ve 
                        been meaning to ask...
                             (charmingly takes his 
                              wife’s hand, admires)
                        What is yours?

           Wife is flattered. Mr. Newton takes a moment to find an 
           answer. He looks at his young hot wife. 

                                 MR. NEWTON
                        Tequila.
                             (they all laugh)
                        Lots and lots of tequila. 

                                 CLAY
                        Well in that case, how about a 
                        round of shots?

                                 MR. NEWTON
                             (cautious)
                        I appreciate that, Clay. But if I’m 
                        gonna’ make a toast at my grand-
                        daughter’s wedding tonight--

                                 CLAY
                        Good point, Mr. Newton. - Better 
                        make ‘em doubles. 

           Clay reaches for the bottle of Patron. -- We move onto Clay’s 
           father, JACK MASON, 60s. Well-dressed, well spoken, but care-
           free. He is laughing with his business associate, MARVIN. 

                                 JACK
                        And if that wasn’t enough...
                             (looks over at Clay)
                        This lunatic almost gave his 
                        grandmother a stroke this morning. 

                                 MARVIN
                             (chuckles)
                        Is that right?

                                 JACK
                             (creates the scenario)
                        Out she walks, first day a’ summer, 
                        and there’s her favorite grandson 
                        cathin’ flies in the hammock - 
                        pants around his ankles - pecker
                        ‘stiffer than Her Majesties’ 
                        sceptor...
                             (they laugh)
                        Coulda’ flown the flag off the damn 
                        thing. 
                                 MARVIN
                             (belly laughs, looks at 
                              Clay)
                        ‘Junk yard dog just like his old 
                        man. 

           Jack laughs proudly, as he looks to his son who is shaking 
           Mr. and Mrs. Newton’s hands good-bye as they leave. 

                                 CLAY
                             (gracious)
                        Thanks again for coming. Best a’ 
                        luck on that speech tonight. 

           They nod, thank Clay, and walk to the car. -- Jack motions to 
           Clay. 

                                 JACK
                        Clayton!

           Clay looks over. Jack playfully waves his empty glass. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Get your priorities in order. 

           Clay nods, smiles, and pours tequila into the blender. 

                                 CLAY
                        I’m working on it. 

           We ZOOM ON Clay’s pleasantly trashed EYES.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Those same eyes, but now behind the shield of STYLISH 
           TORTOISESHELL READING GLASSES. -- An ELEVATOR DOOR opens. 
           Clay exits. 

           INT. LOBBY OF OFFICE - MORNING

           The iconic logo of THE NEW YORKER magazine is emblazed on the 
           wall above the SECRETARIES’ DESK. Her head perks up. -- Clay 
           enters, well put together. He pushes his glasses up. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        Oh hey Clay. Mitchell’s waiting in 
                        your office. 

                                 CLAY
                        Shit.

           He hustles in. 
           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Clay enters. MITCHELL RYAN, late 30s, is leaned back in 
           Clay’s chair with his feet on his desk. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Top of the morning to ya’, buddy. 
                             (looks at watch)
                        Just in time to catch the end of 
                        Price is Right. 

           Clay opens ALKA-SELTZER and chews them like candy. Sips 
           coffee, swishes it around, and swallows. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                             (disgusted)
                        Are you fuckin’ serious?

                                 CLAY
                        Tread lightly. It’s been a rough 
                        recovery from the long weekend. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        The long weekend that ended...
                             (looks at blackberry)
                        Four days ago? 

                                 CLAY
                        So says the man who’s been working 
                        from his Hampton’s pad all week. 

                                 MITCHELL
                             (stands up, stern)
                        The key word here being ‘working’. 
                             (picks up magazine proof)
                        I read your little review of that 
                        new bar, “Design”. - We’re gonna’
                        get death-threats if I print this. 

                                 CLAY
                             (at a loss)
                        What are they gonna’ do? Throw a 
                        molotov-cosmo through the window? 

           Clay looks for a laugh, but nothing. He defends, flustered. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m sorry... but a designer
                        vodka bar? Was I that out of line? 

           Mitchell thinks for a beat, looks at article, and exhales. 
                                 MITCHELL
                        No. - In fact, you were so in line 
                        that I’m choosing you over two 
                        published authors and that prick 
                        from Brown who skateboards to work. 

           Clay looks up, surprised: You little dick...

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        Congrats, Mason. You’re the new 
                        restaurant and nightlife critic for 
                        the most prestigious magazine in 
                        the world. 

           Laughter. Sigh of relief. Clay looks at proof. 

                                 CLAY
                        Has Newton approved this?

                                 MITCHELL
                        It’s two paragraphs a week, pal. I 
                        don’t need Newton’s blessing. 
                             (chuckles)
                        But it was his idea. 
                             (a beat, shakes head)
                        Bold move inviting the head of the 
                        corporation to your backyard 
                        barbecue... Nicely done. 

                                 CLAY
                             (proud of himself)
                        I don’t know what to say?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Well I’d love to waste more of my 
                        day waiting around for ya’...
                             (looks at watch)
                        But I’m already late for lunch with 
                        David Sedaris.

           Mitchell walks out. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have your assignments sent 
                        over later. 
                             (turns, grins)
                        And don’t make me regret your new 
                        expense account. 

           He winks and exits. Clay smiles. 

                                 CLAY
                        Come on. Who are you talking to? 
           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           There are congratulatory bottles of champagne and scotch on 
           his desk that Clay happily enjoys directly from the bottle. 

           He looks over some papers and types information into the 
           CALENDER on his computer. 

           TONIGHT: Le Petit Cafe, 235 E. 4th St. 

           SATURDAY: Mom’s B-Day -- Golf w/Dad @2 in Sag. 

           Clay focuses on “MOM’S B-DAY” for a thoughtful second. He 
           turns and looks out his window overlooking the city. He sips 
           his scotch. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - EVENING

           Clay walks down the street. He looks at the address in his 
           Blackberry (that’s held together with duct-tape) and looks up 
           at LE PETIT CAFE. He walks in. 

           INT. LE PETIT CAFE - EVENING 

           It’s a classic French Bistro. The MAITRE D does a double-take 
           when he sees Clay. 

                                 MAITRE D
                             (French accent, playful)
                        Uh oh, here marks the beginning of 
                        the end for us. Don’t you still 
                        have a tab open at my last bar? 

           Clay squints to jog his memory. He’s got it. 

                                 CLAY
                        Eduard! It’s been a while.
                             (looks around)
                        Is this your place? 

           They shake. Eduard looks around and nods. 

                                 EDUARD
                        For now, yes... How long it 
                        remains, I suppose, is in your 
                        hands now. 

                                 CLAY
                        Word must travel fast in the foodie 
                        underworld. - Who told you I was a 
                        critic?
           A beat. Now Eduard is confused. 

                                 EDUARD
                        No, I was... talking about how long 
                        this would be my restaurant before 
                        you came in, drank everything in 
                        sight, and urinated atop someone’s 
                        table in your undershorts. 

           Clay is slightly embarrassed/slightly honored by his rep. 

                                 EDUARD (CONT’D)
                             (arm around Clay, walks 
                              towards bar)
                        Tell me, Monsieur... What 
                        publication hires a restaurant 
                        critic who’s been banned from 
                        ninety percent of the cities’ 
                        restaurants?

                                 CLAY
                             (devilish smile)
                        Well I guess you’ll find out soon 
                        enough, won’t you?

                                 EDUARD
                        Avec plaisir.

           Eduard calls to the bartender in rapid-fire French in a tone 
           that sounds as if Clay is an old friend. 

                                 EDUARD (CONT’D)
                        Philipe!
                             (in French, subtitles)
                        This is the man that every 
                        restaurateur in town was alerted of 
                        today. - Start him off with a 
                        tasting of our best champagne and 
                        I’ll take care of the rest. 

           Philip nods. Clay, oblivious to what he said, looks around. 

           HOLLY CLARK, the girl from the opening of the movie, sits in 
           a stool next to him incredibly intrigued. -- Clay turns and 
           catches her gaze, slightly taken aback, but also taken in. 

                                 CLAY
                        Uh... How’s it goin’?

                                 HOLLY
                        I take it you don’t speak French?
                                 CLAY
                        Why? Did he just defame my 
                        character?

           A clever smile forms on her face. She’s gonna’ have some fun. 

                                 HOLLY
                        So you have no idea what he just 
                        said?

                                 CLAY
                        No, because...
                             (like I just said)
                        I don’t speak French. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Right...
                             (shrugs)
                        That’s too bad. 

           She sips her drink and remains silent, ignoring him.

                                 CLAY
                        Ok, now I wanna’ know.

                                 HOLLY
                        Well I don’t know exactly, but...
                             (thinks)
                        Did you fuck his wife or something?

                                 CLAY
                             (snarfs, bad French)
                        Pardonnez moi?

                                 HOLLY
                        Sorry, forget I said anything. It’s 
                        just... I wouldn’t put anything in 
                        my mouth that comes out of that 
                        kitchen if I were you. 

           A SMALL MEXICAN BUS-BOY emerges, drenched in sweat. 

                                 CLAY
                             (considers)
                        I don’t know... That looks pretty 
                        damn tasty. 

           She laughs. 

                                 HOLLY
                        You’re disgusting.

                                 CLAY
                        You started it. 
           He likes her. Philipe walks over, pops champagne. 

                                 PHILIPE
                        For the Madame?

           Clay turns: For the madame?

                                 HOLLY
                        Oh... no... Thanks. I’m good. 

           She sips her drink.

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just have another Sprite. 

                                 CLAY
                        Sprite, eh? - You don’t drink on 
                        the job?

                                 HOLLY
                             (confused)
                        Working? What are you talking 
                        about?

           Clay steps back... totally mis-read the situation. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, I was supposed to meet a, uh...
                             (leans in, discrete)
                        Escort. - I thought maybe you 
                        were...
                             (looks around, 
                              embarrassed)
                        Sorry for wasting your time. 

           She wasn’t expecting that one. Her eyes widen. Clay grins.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m just fuckin’ with you. 

           She laughs. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Clay.

                                 HOLLY
                        Holly. 

           They shake. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        So tell me something, Clay. - Why 
                        was every restaurateur in town 
                        alerted of you today?
           He’s confused, but looks over at Eduard and then back to her. 
           He puts it all together and smiles. He holds his glass of 
           fancy champagne, and sniffs and twirls it like he expects 
           someone in his position to do just before answering that very 
           question. -- But she beats him to it. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Lemme’ guess... You’re some hot-
                        shot wine dickhead?

           He spits his champagne back into his glass and laughs. 

                                 CLAY
                        Wine dickhead... I need to remember 
                        that. 
                             (puts glass down)
                        Trust me, I’m not. 
                             (to Philipe)
                        Hey Philly-boy, can I get a Maker’s 
                        up?

           Philipe nods. Clay turns to Holly. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You sure I can’t get you anything?

                                 HOLLY
                        No, thanks though.
                             (looks at watch, looks 
                              around)
                        I’m actually meeting someone. 

           Clay is a bit taken back by that: Uhhhh...

                                 CLAY
                        So what am I, your warm-up?

           Holly laughs. Almost feels bad. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Oh my God, no. Nothing like that--

                                 CLAY
                        Na’, na’ na’. I see how it is...

           Clay nods and smooths out the awkwardness this way:

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you what, sweet-heart. -- 
                        I’m gonna’ go drain the liz... and 
                        if I come back and you’re still 
                        here, I’ll know you’re my girl. -- 
                        If not, I’ll know ya’ aint.
                        Cappice?
           She takes a moment to process that earful and smiles. 

                                 HOLLY
                        You had me at drain the liz.

           He chuckles and walks towards the bathroom. 

           EXT. LE PETIT CAFE - NIGHT

           A YELLOW CAB pulls up to the restaurant and ROBERT CLARK 
           steps out. He sees holly in the window. She perks up. Waves. -
           - He walks inside and through the window we see them hug. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Clay zips up and looks at himself in the mirror. He cuts his 
           losses and sips a flask from his back pocket. Oh well. 

           INT. LE PETIT CAFE - NIGHT

           Clay walks through the restaurant and shakes his head when he 
           sees Holly engaged in conversation with an older man. He 
           casually takes his Makers and shoots her a look: Really? 

                                 HOLLY
                        Dad, that’s the guy that thought I 
                        was a hooker. 

           Robert stands slowly. A no bull-shit look on his face. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Robert Clark. Retired General, 
                        United States Marine Corps. 

                                 CLAY
                             (steps back)
                        No, I, uh, I mean I did but...
                             (to Holly)
                        I thought we established the 
                        humorous nature of--

                                 ROBERT
                        Why would you ever think that was 
                        funny, son?

                                 HOLLY
                             (tries to diffuse)
                        Dad, relax. It’s Ok, I was just--

           Robert smiles and turns to Holly. 
                                 ROBERT
                        Did you see his face? I thought he 
                        was gonna’ have a constitution in 
                        his drawers.

                                 CLAY
                        I think I just did. 

           They laugh. Clay offers a casual salute. 

                                 HOLLY
                        At ease, Clay. He’s not really a 
                        marine. 

           A WAITER comes over and motions that their table is ready. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                             (to Clay)
                        Sorry we can’t chat longer, but if 
                        you’re ever on the Upper East Side, 
                        stop into my shop for a scone. 

           She hands him a BUSINESS CARD: THE COOK SHOP - HOLLY CLARK - 
           OWNER/BAKER.

                                 CLAY
                        Thanks... I love scones. 

           He shakes her hand and then Robert’s. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Pleasure to meet you. 

                                 ROBERT
                        You too, Clint. Take care of 
                        yourself. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (smiles, flirtatious)
                        Nice meeting you too... Clint. 

           She winks and smiles as they walk to their table. Clay looks 
           at the business card. There is an ARROW to flip-over. She’s 
           written: In case my Dad showed up before you could ask: 
           Holly: 585-410-5246.

           Clay downs his drink, grabs a TWENTY from his wallet and 
           walks over to Eduard. 

                                 EDUARD
                        Everything alright, Monsieur?
                                 CLAY
                        This place is great. 
                             (hands bill and motions to 
                              Holly and Robert)
                        Take good care of that table and 
                        I’ll have this place packed for 
                        months. 

           Eduard looks over and sees Holly. He nods and understands. 

                                 EDUARD
                        Of course, Monsieur.

           Clay leaves. 

           EXT. LE PETIT CAFE - NIGHT

           Clay walks outside and hails a cab. The door opens and Peter 
           Gabriel’s SOLSBURY HILL is blasting. He chuckles. 

                                 CLAY
                        Nice. 

           He gets in.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Reade Street Pub. Greenwich and 
                        Hudson. -- And turn this shit up. 

           The Indian Cabby nods as Clay nips his flask. Peter Gabriel 
           scores this very un-Peter Gabriel MONTAGE: Climbin’ up on 
           Solsbury Hill. 

           --Clay enters the SEEDY NYC PUB to welcoming cheers. Clearly 
           a local hero here. Without asking, a shot is slid his way. 

           --Holly and Robert sit at the table as six waiters give them 
           VIP service. 

           --Clay is now at the DIGITAL JUKE BOX. He slides a TWENTY in 
           and hits SOLSBURY HILL over and over again. 

           --Holly and Robert talk and laugh... both hold their stomachs 
           as desert comes. 

           --Clay is at the bar. The song ends and immediately begins 
           again. 

                                 ANGRY BAR PATRON
                        Come on! Play a different song! 
                                 CLAY
                             (turns, drunk)
                        My money. My music. Your music? Put 
                        money. This is a free country. 
                             (singing)
                        My heart goin’ BOOM BOOM BOOM!

           --The tab arrives and Holly opens it: $29.00. She shakes her 
           head and smiles. 

                                 HOLLY
                        I got it, Dad. 

           --Clay is back at the juke-box as a FRAT GUY is being 
           restrained by his friends from kicking his ass. -- Clay is 
           egged on by his pals at the bar, laughing.  

                                 CLAY’S PAL
                             (wise-ass)
                        Clay, ‘that juke-box have any Peter 
                        Gabriel in it? 

           Clay smiles and hits “Play Next” over and over again. 

           --Holly sets her alarm for 4:30AM and gets into bed. -- Her 
           Dad sacks out on the couch. 

           --Clay is tossed out of the bar with his shirt around his 
           head. Solsbury Hill can be heard blaring. 

                                 CLAY
                        Dude, deal. It’s just urine. 

           The door slams. Clay gets up and stumbles down the street. 

           --The sun comes up as Holly raises the gate to THE COOK SHOP. 
           -- Her Dad works on repairing broken A/C as she begins 
           baking. 

           --Clay is now in CHINATOWN, playing checkers with an Asian 
           guy as he drinks a 40. The Asian Man wants Clay to “King 
           him”, but Clay refuses. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        King this. 

           He slides his arm across the table, knocking all the checkers 
           to the ground. 

           --Clay reaches for his wallet at a bodega and HOLLY’S NUMBER 
           falls out. He looks at it. Smiles. 

           --Holly’s PHONE vibrates atop her purse, but she’s too busy 
           baking to notice. MISSED CALL. It immediately vibrates again. 
           --Clay sits in an alley leaving a message into phone. A 
           CHINESE WOMAN screams at him from a window, in Chinese!

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (into phone, drunker)
                        So if you’re still out, call me. 
                        Bring your pops. Let’s get butt-
                        faced! - Hold on. 
                             (to screaming Chinese 
                              woman, he yells)
                        Can you stop singing please?  

           She continues screaming in frantic Chinese. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        That’s it, I’m callin’ the cops.
                             (into phone)
                        I’ll call you back, Molly. 

           --Holly behind the counter. Nobody is coming in. 

           --Clay is on a park bench talking on the phone next to a 
           HOMELESS BLACK WOMAN. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (into phone, even drunker)
                        I’m just really glad I met you. - 
                        So get over here! Let’s get a 
                        mimosa! - Bring scones! 
                             (turns to Black Woman)
                        You wanna’ say hi?
                             (into phone)
                        Here Holly, say hi to Hot Dog. 

           He hands “Hot Dog” the phone. 

                                 “HOT DOG”
                             (into phone)
                        ‘Sup girl. This ‘Hot Dog. Your 
                        boyfriend here is fuckin’ crazy
                        fucked up. 

           --Holly hands out samples on the street. People thank her, 
           but keep on her way. Her phone VIBRATES on her purse again. 

           PETER GABRIEL: Hey, I said, you can pack my things they’ve 
           come to take me home. 

           FADE TO BLACK.

                             (startled)
                        Honey, is that Clay?

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - FADE IN - MORNING

           A YUPPY COUPLE, off for a jog, race down the hallway to where 
           Clay lays passed-out, using his pants as a blanket. 

                                 YUPPY MAN
                             (shakes him)
                        Clay? Clay? You with us, Mason?
                             (Clay mumbles)
                        Atta’ boy. Time to get up. 

           Clay’s eyes flicker open. They are completely blood-shot. 

                                 YUPPY WOMAN
                        Should we call an ambulance?

                                 YUPPY MAN
                        This is nothing. We just gotta’ get 
                        him into bed. 

           He rummages through Clay’s pockets to find his keys. 

                                 YUPPY WOMAN
                        Honey, look. 

           She motions to a DOOR KNOB. There is a KEY in the lock, but 
           it’s Clay’s TINY MAIL-BOX KEY. They can’t help but chuckle as 
           they remove the key-chain and walk two doors down the hall to 
           put the correct key in the correct lock. 

           She opens the door as he lifts Clay. Clay comes-to a bit and 
           scratches his head as he looks at the Yuppy Man. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, hey Billy. 

           She whispers to her boyfriend. 

                                 YUPPY WOMAN
                        Who’s Billy?

                                 YUPPY MAN
                        No clue. 
                             (to Clay)
                        Come on, Clay. Up n’ at ‘em. 

           They walk him into his apartment that is actually really nice 
           with an amazing view of the HUDSON RIVER. 
                                 CLAY
                        Where am I?

                                 YUPPY MAN
                        You’re home, Clay. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh...
                             (looks around)
                        Thanks, Billy. 

           He walks over and falls face down onto his bed. 

                                 YUPPY MAN
                        Don’t mention it. 
                             (turns to girlfriend)
                        Now do you see why I didn’t want to 
                        set him up with your sister?

           She looks at Clay. She feels bad for him. 

                                 YUPPY WOMAN
                        Poor thing...

           A beat. 

           Clay farts.

           EXT. SAG HARBOR GOLF CLUB - DAY

           Jack Mason is on a golf-cart, talking into cell-phone. 

                                 JACK
                             (into phone)
                        Clay? Where are you, bud? It’s Dad.

                        wanna’ lose our spot. 

           EXT. THE COOK SHOP - AFTERNOON

           Holly turns the sign: SORRY, WE’RE CLOSED. Robert helps her 
           close the gate. He can tell she’s bummed. 

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s gonna’ work, Holls.

           She nods. She looks at her phone: 17 NEW VOICE-MAILS. She’s 
           concerned and checks them. CLOSE ON: Her shocked face.
           EXT. GOLF COURSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           The sun is going down as Jack replaces the flag at HOLE 18. 
           He looks around, not pissed, but a little concerned. 

           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Clay is snoring. We TIME LAPSE through the night as he shifts 
           in bed and the sun rises a brand new day. -- His eyes open 
           and he looks over at the clock: 11 AM

                                 CLAY
                        Shit!

           He grabs a towel and races to the bathroom. 

           EXT. SAG HARBOR TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Clay gets off the train, cleaned up in his golf-gear, his bag 
           over his shoulder as he walks into the village of Sag Harbor, 
           sipping on a roadie.  

           EXT. JACK MASON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jack sits on the porch reading the paper in a BLACK SILK 
           ROBE.

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        Hey Benihana, get dressed. 

           Jack looks over the paper. Sees Clay and stands, concerned. 

                                 JACK
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 CLAY
                        Me? 
                             (re: black robe)
                        Since when do you practice Wiccan?

                                 JACK
                             (humor lost)
                        I called you five... six times... 
                        didn’t you get my messages?

           Clay pulls out his Blackberry with duct-tape on it. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, Dad, I’m sorry... I woke up and 
                        my phone was dead. Let’s talk on 
                        the way. We’re gonna’ be late. 
           A beat. Jack is trying to process. 

                                 JACK
                        We’re not playing today. 

                                 CLAY
                        We have a 2 O’Clock tee-time. I 
                        confirmed is yesterday. 

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, for Saturday. - It’s Sunday. 
                        The course is closed for a 
                        tournament. 

           Clay drops his bag. Dumb-struck.

                        I feel awful... I... thought we 
                        were playing...
                             (searches for plausible 
                              excuse)
                        Today. 

                                 JACK
                        Clay, your mom’s birthday was 
                        yesterday. How could you possibly 
                        mix that date up?

           Clay looks at the front page of the SUNDAY TIMES. Swallows.

                                 CLAY
                        Dad, I’m so sorry. I... I got that 
                        promotion I was telling you 
                        about... I had to work and...
                             (looks at phone)
                        This phone’s a piece a’ shit... I 
                        must have just...

           Jack is clearly pissed, but he lets it slide. 

                                 JACK
                        Well hey, you got the new job. 
                        That’s great news, kiddo.
                             (a beat)
                        To hell with golf. You’re here 
                        now... Yanks game’s about to 
                        start... I’ll get a batch of 
                        bloodies going and we’ll look 
                        towards the bright future, eh?

           Clay has a totally dejected look on his face. 
           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE AT NEW YORKER - DAY

           Clay sits at his desk working. He’s wearing his reading 
           glasses that make him look too smart to be a mess. He kicks 
           back and ponders HOLLY’S BUSINESS CARD. He taps it on his 
           desk, thinking. 

           He’s nervous... bites his lip... He takes a deep breath and 
           picks up the phone, but is saved by the Mitch. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        My lunch just cancelled... Steak 
                        and martinis at the Rainbow Room? 

                                 CLAY
                        God, yes. 

           Clay hangs up the phone, leans back, huge exhale of relief. 

           INT. THE RAINBOW ROOM - DAY

           They sit at a table next to the window overlooking the city. 
           We catch them in mid-laughter sipping their martinis. 

                                 CLAY
                        ...that same Hampton’s pad that I 
                        still haven’t been invited to. 

           Mitchell searches for a chummy excuse. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Listen pal, I’d love to have you 
                        out. But Andrea’s into this, like, 
                        perfect life, get your house 
                        profiled in magazine’s bull-shit.

                                 CLAY
                             (laughs)
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 MITCHELL
                        You know what it means. 

                                 CLAY
                        Come on. That was six years ago. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        It was a tough image to shake, 
                        Mason. - You sixty-nining a caterer 
                        at our wedding reception doesn’t 
                        exactly make for an ideal 
                        centerfold in “Better Homes”. 
           They laugh. Mitchell sips his martini and admires it. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        God! Why do martinis always taste 
                        the best when you’re not supposed 
                        to be drinking them?

                                 CLAY
                             (sips)
                        Lunch has always been the right 
                        time for me. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        I concur. - Three martinis at home? 
                        Wifey looks at me like I just 
                        crawled out of a needle exchange.

           This strikes a chord with Clay, as if the remote concept of 
           “settling down” has been a lingering thought. 

                                 CLAY
                        Really? She’s changed that much?

                                 MITCHELL
                        It was gradual...
                             (runs down the list)
                        First came the yoga, and that was 
                        fine - But then I woke up one day 
                        and everything in the house was 
                        free-range...
                             (Clay laughs)
                        Christ, even my kid’s diapers are 
                        grass-fed. 

           Clay laughs. Sips. 

                                 CLAY
                        And what do diapers have to do with 
                        martinis?

                                 MITCHELL
                        More than you’d think. 
                             (a beat)
                        There’s just not a lot of room left 
                        over in Andrea’s Brave New World
                        for my cynical martini-laced...
                             (searches)
                        Vibe.

           Clay gets it and this troubles him. 

                                 CLAY
                        So you guys really don’t cut loose 
                        anymore?
                                 MITCHELL
                        Sure we do...
                             (looks on bright side)
                        I mean, we split a bottle a’ red 
                        when we watched Hurt Locker, but in 
                        all honesty...
                             (raises martini glass and 
                              reflects upon it)
                        You appreciate the sun a lot more 
                        when it’s not always shining. 
                             (he sips, ahhh)
                        Believe it or not, I heard that in 
                        a yoga class. 

           Clay chuckles and looks outside at the sunny day. 

                                 CLAY
                        Well then here’s to sunny days. 

           Mitchell nods. They drink. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE ACROSS TOWN - DAY

           Holly sits having lunch across from her girlfriend, KRISTEN, 
           30s. Kristen is trying desperately to tame her misbehaving 5 
           and 6 year old kids who are playing with their food. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Keep this up and I’m dropping you 
                        both off in the Bronx on our way 
                        home. 

           Holly laughs. Kristen returns to the conversation. 

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        Well you’re getting your number 
                        changed and that’s all there is to 
                        it.

                                 HOLLY
                        He hasn’t called back. I think he 
                        got the point. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        But you need to get the point. You 
                        seem to have an irresistible 
                        compulsion towards these high-risk 
                        lunatics...
                             (she sips her wine)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                        And I know what you went through 
                        with your father - But you’re way 
                        too smart - and pretty - to be a 
                        cliche that’s drivin’ by a need to 
                        nurture fuck-ups.

                                 HOLLY
                        Eloquently put. 
                             (she thinks)
                        There was something about him. He 
                        was the first guy I’ve met in a 
                        while that didn’t take himself 
                        retardedly serious. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Oh, well, believe me, that much is 
                        clear. I’ve heard those messages 
                        and if that’s the kind of guy 
                        you’re looking for - congrats - You 
                        found your Yoda.

                                 HOLLY
                             (laughs)
                        No, I know... I just--

                                 KRISTEN
                        You just wanted to take in a 
                        rescue. But all you have to do is 
                        go to the kill-shelter and adopt 
                        one. - Believe me, they’re a lot 
                        easier to tame than the ones that 
                        come in human form. 
                             (to kid)
                        Don’t fuck with me, Julian. 

           Holly laughs. 

           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - DAY

           He’s chilled after a good martini session as he looks over 
           his notes. He thinks and smiles as he types under the 
           heading: LE PETIT CAFE... Do you ever wish you spoke French?

           He looks up at Holly’s card and smiles. 

           He picks up the phone. Dials. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE ACROSS TOWN - DAY

           Holly’s phone vibrates on the table. She looks at it: Uh oh. 
                                 KRISTEN
                        Give me the phone. 

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m not going to answer. 

                                 KRISTEN
                        Give me - the phone. 
                             (she answers, mock polite)
                        Hey Clay! 

           INTERCUT TO CLAY: He’s slightly confused.

                                 CLAY
                        Uh, hey. How did you know it was 
                        me?

                                 KRISTEN
                        It’s this neat-o new phone app that 
                        leaves a certain impression when a 
                        desperate maniacal low-life calls 
                        someone seventeen times in the 
                        middle of the night. 
                             (a beat)
                        That’s right, loser. - Never call 
                        this number ever again. 

           Clay swallows nervously: What the hell is this?

                                 CLAY
                        Is this Holly?

                                 KRISTEN
                        No, mother-fucker. This is Kristen. 
                        -- Oh, and if you happen to bump 
                        into Hot Dog, please send her my 
                        very warmest regards. 

           She hangs up. A beat. 

                                 KRISTEN (CONT’D)
                             (polite, to waiter)
                        Could I get another Chardonay
                        please?

           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - DAY

           He looks at his phone like it’ll detonate if he touches it. 
           He scrolls through his CALL LOG: Office, office, Dad, missed-
           call, and then endless calls within minutes to 585-410-5249. -
           - His face is white like he just saw a ghost -- A WOMAN walks 
           past his office door. He looks up and clears his throat. 
                                 CLAY
                        Uh, Sharon?

           She stops and pops her head in, clearly in a rush. 

                                 SHARON
                        What’s up, Clay?

           Clay thinks: How best to put this?

                                 CLAY
                        Let me ask you something. 
                             (casually creates the 
                              scenario)
                        A guy you just met drunk-dials you 
                        seventeen times in a night. -- 
                        Would there be any way that you 
                        could ever see him as anything 
                        other than a complete psychopath?

                                 SHARON
                        Uh...
                             (clucks tongue three times 
                              to think)
                        No. 
                             (a beat)
                        Anything else?

                                 CLAY
                        No. That’s it, thanks. 

           She hustles off. -- The camera pulls back outside the window, 
           until Clay’s becomes just one in a million little cages 
           containing New Yorkers with a problem. 

           CAT STEVENS: Another Saturday Night and I aint got nobody...

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Clay knocks a ball down the fair-way. His Dad follows it, 
           smiles and tosses him a cold can of beer. 

           INT. READE STREET PUB - NIGHT

           A group of SOCCER HOOLIGANS are standing at the end of the 
           bar doing a count-off and back-and-forth rowing motion. 

                                 SOCCER HOOLIGANS
                        One... Two... Three...
           The camera moves back as they slide Clay down the bar, 
           shirtless and some-how oiled up, crashing pint-glasses over. 
           He flies off the end of the bar. They all laugh. 

           ...if I don’t find a honey to help me spend my money, I’m 
           gonna’ have to blow this town. 

           Clay emerges, arms-raised. A perfect 10. They cheer. 

           AN HOUR LATER: Clay is tossed out of the bar, soaking wet.   

           INT. NYC BODEGA - NIGHT

           Clay, trashed, ponders a cooler filled with 40s. But this 
           time he debates. He grabs a GIANT WATER instead. 

           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           He stands at his bed, pounds the water, and crashes. 

           ..How I wish I had someone to talk to... I’m in an awful way. 

           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - MORNING

           He removes two ALKA-SELTZER tabs and chews them. Then a nip 
           of his flask, a sip of coffee, swishes and swallows. -- A 
           really annoying eager-beaver intern-girl, TAMMY, walks past 
           his office holding a BOX. 

                                 TAMMY
                             (mouth-full)
                        Hey, Clay. You want a bran-muffin?

           Clay covers his mouth.  

                                 TAMMY (CONT’D)
                        Are you OK?

                                 CLAY
                        I’m fine, Tammy. I just can’t think 
                        of anything more revolting right 
                        now than a bran-muffin. 
                             (looks up, eyes blood-
                              shot)
                        Please don’t take it personally. 

                                 TAMMY
                        Oh, sorry...
                             (she looks in box, finds 
                              renewed enthusiasm)
                        How about a raisin custard tort--
                                 CLAY
                        How ‘bout some diaper-shit? You got 
                        any diaper-shit torts--

           He holds his stomach. Ugh. Points to the door. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Out... outoutoutoutoutout.

           She quickly paces down the hall as we hear the sound of 
           vomiting from his office. 

           INT. NEW YORKER LOBBY - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Clay walks in, laughing with Mitchell. Looking fresh.

                                 MITCHELL
                        I told you you’d feel better after 
                        a Turkish bath and a bottle a’ bub.

           Clay nods and they part ways. He passes the COFFEE/KITCHEN 
           AREA and sees Tammy doing intern tasks. Clay stops and enters 
           with a charming smile and his glasses on. Ready to make good. 

                                 CLAY
                        Offer still stand for that bran-
                        muffin? 

                                 TAMMY
                        Uh, you sure you can handle it?

                                 CLAY
                        Come on... I don’t let a little 
                        morning sickness get between me and 
                        my bran. You know that, Tammy. 

           She smiles. She opens the box and hands him a bran-muffin. 
           Clay takes a bite, chews and admires muffin. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        That’s fuckin’ delicious. Bran-
                        muffins usually taste like--

                                 TAMMY
                        Diaper-shit?

                                 CLAY
                             (laughs)
                        Yeah. Exactly. 
                             (chews more, impressed)
                        Where’d these come from? 
                                 TAMMY
                        My sister’s bakery. 
                             (clever)
                        Why? Think you might want to review 
                        it? 

           Clay pauses a moment as if sets in what he’s capable of. 

                                 TAMMY (CONT’D)
                        She would love you forever. 

                                 CLAY
                        It’s not called the Cook Shop, is 
                        it?

                                 TAMMY
                        No. Brantastic.

                                 CLAY
                             (nods)
                        I’ll see what I can do. 

           Clay exits and walks towards his ASSISTANT. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Can you find out if anyone’s 
                        written any compelling pieces about 
                        a bakery called the Cook Shop?

           She nods. Clay enters his OFFICE. -- A moment later his 
           assistant walks in. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        There’s nothing in any significant 
                        print. Just a few Yelps. 

                                 CLAY
                        Yelps? 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        You know, Citysearch... random 
                        stuff people write...
                             (looks down at print-out)
                        “Stopped here to use the toilet, 
                        which was squeaky clean”... “best 
                        muffins I saw were on the chick 
                        behind the counter”... “Bummed to 
                        hear they might be closing”, this 
                        last one says. 

           Clay smiles. 
                                 CLAY
                        Go up and bring me a sample of 
                        everything they got. 
                             (hands cash)
                        I need this back before three. 

           She nods, takes the cash and leaves. 

           THAT NIGHT: Clay samples a plethora of treats as he writes. 

           INT. THE COOK SHOP - ABOUT A WEEK LATER - MORNING

           Holly is in the basement working. Her employee, JESSE, races 
           downstairs out of breath. Can’t believe it. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Did we get robbed?

                                 JESSE
                             (shakes head)
                        I need your help. We’ve got like a 
                        huge morning rush. 

                                 HOLLY
                        What?

           Holly follows Jesse upstairs. The place is slammed with 
           people from all walks of life. She races behind the counter. 

           FLASH FORWARD: A variety of New Yorkers place orders. 

                                 LOUD NEW YORK GUY
                        Yeah, lemme get five-a-dem wild 
                        berry scone thingies...

           --A CONSTRUCTION GUY:

                             (mouth full, impressed)
                        You bake da cream-cheese right inta-
                        da-bagel?

           --TWO OLD JEWISH WOMEN:

                                 JEWISH WOMAN
                        We read ya’ article in the New 
                        Yorka’ and came all the way from 
                        Lynnbrook.

           ZOOM ON: Holly’s face. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Did you just say The New Yorker?
           --It’s a bit later and things have chilled a bit. Jesse walks 
           in laughing and reading The New Yorker. 

                                 JESSE
                        You’re not gonna’ believe this...
                             (reads)
                        Despite sounding a little too much 
                        like DEA slang for a meth-lab, new 
                        kid on the block The Cook Shop 
                        might as well be, that’s how 
                        deliciously addictive their--

           --Holly grabs the magazine. She looks: THE COOK SHOP HEATS 
           THINGS UP by Clay Mason.

                                 HOLLY
                        You gotta’ be kidding me. 

           She looks at the classic cover: THE NEW YORKER. She can’t 
           deny it. She’s impressed. 

           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER - EVENING

           Clay is kicked back, drinking a beer, bs’ing with Mitch. 

                                 CLAY
                        ...and it took three bouncers to 
                        get this lunatic outa’ there... 
                        I’ve got a very simple solution for 
                        getting kicked out of a New York 
                        City bar...
                             (as if it’s the most 
                              logical answer)
                        ...I go to the one next door. 

           Mitch laughs. A SECRETARY chimes in on Clay’s intercom as 
           Clay sips his beer. 

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Hey Clay. There’s a Holly Clark 
                        here to see you. 

           But he doesn’t spray his beer, he just gulps and gulps until 
           it’s gone. A nervous look in his eye. 

                                 CLAY
                             (rapid, into intercom)
                        Is she with a cop or a detective? 
                        Someone who looks like a cop or a 
                        FED? Or someone named Kristen? Or a 
                        dude named Robert that looks like a 
                        skinnier, white Danny Trejo?
                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                             (slight chuckle)
                        Uh, I don’t think so, should I ask 
                        if she’s expecting a guest--

                                 CLAY
                        --No. Just give me a sec. 

           Clay bites his lip as he thinks. He picks up their empties 
           and puts them in the trash. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        What the hell are you mixed up in, 
                        Mason?

                                 CLAY
                        It’s a long story... Depending on 
                        how this goes, I’ll tell you if I 
                        have an ending. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Never a dull moment, Clay. 

           He exits. Clay looks over at some unopened dress-shirts on 
           his couch. He reaches for one. 

           FLASH FORWARD: Clay is leaned back in his chair, looking out 
           the window, a brand-new shirt on with visible crease-folds. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Is Hot Dog chained up?

           Clay shuts his eyes and exhales. He turns in his chair. 

                                 CLAY
                             (into intercom)
                        Julie, can you make sure that Miss 
                        Dog is properly restrained in the 
                        storage closet...

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?--

                                 CLAY
                        Could you see if we have any Sprite 
                        in the kitchen for Miss Clark?

                                 HOLLY
                             (smiles)
                        I’m surprised you remembered.
                             (takes note of Clay’s 
                              creased-shirt)
                        Nice shirt. 
           Clay looks down. Sees the creases. Rationalizes.  

                                 CLAY
                        Yup... I have my cleaner give me 
                        that... new-shirt look. 

           She nods and diverts the awkwardness as she looks along the 
           wall that has FRAMED NEW YORKER CARTOONS. She reads one. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (smiles)
                        Are these yours?

                                 CLAY
                        Sort of. - You know that contest in 
                        the back of the magazine where you 
                        send in your best cartoon caption?

                                 HOLLY
                             (amused)

                        A few times... That’s how I got 
                        here. 

                                 HOLLY
                        As a cartoonist?

                                 CLAY
                        I can’t draw worth shit. They just 
                        brought me on board to help out 
                        when the cartoonists have... 
                        cartoonist block, I guess. 

           The secretary enters and hands Holly her Sprite. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Thanks...
                             (looks around, impressed)
                        So you became a staff-writer at the 
                        New Yorker... by accident?

                                 CLAY
                        Story of my life. 
                             (motions to sofa)
                        Have a seat. 

                                 HOLLY
                        No, I can’t stay. I just came to 
                        give you this...
                             (hands bakery box)
                        Thanks to you I have to get back 
                        and train my new night-staff. 
           Clay opens the box and looks in: Smells good. He closes it. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        According to you, they’re the best 
                        reason to go above 14th Street 
                        since Central Park.
                             (Clay smiles. She looks at 
                              her watch)
                        But I really have to get going--

                                 CLAY
                             (stands)
                        At least let me walk you out. 

           She hesitates. He puts on his linen-blazer and his beat-up 
           leather messenger bag over his shoulder. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Come on. I’m leaving anyway. 

           She nods. He leads her out and shuts his light off. 

           EXT. ELEVATOR DOOR - OPENING - EVENING

           Clay and Holly exit the packed elevator and walk through the 
           crowded CONDE NAST LOBBY. 

                                 CLAY
                        Look, I wish I had any recollection 
                        of leaving those - what I’m sure 
                        were - very frightening messages... 
                        but I don’t. 

                                 HOLLY
                        I believe you. 

                                 CLAY
                        I’d just gotten a promotion... one 
                        thing led to another... I bumped 
                        into some old friends...

           They enter the REVOLVING DOOR and EXIT onto the SIDEWALK:

                                 HOLLY
                        Ah yes, the screaming Chinese 
                        people -- This is your posse?

           Clay stops and looks around the BUSY NYC STREET. 

                                 CLAY
                        Wild nights, Holly. 
                             (she stops)
                        Van Morrison sings about ‘em.

                                 CLAY (CONT'D)
                        The new job. You seemed like a nice 
                        cherry on top. Sweet Peter Gabriel 
                        song in the cab. One too many shots 
                        on an empty stomach... the 
                        invention of the cell phone, but 
                        come on...
                             (lays it down)
                        Haven’t you ever drunk dialed 
                        anyone before?

           She snarfs: So we’re calling it drunk-dialing???

                                 HOLLY
                        Sure I’ve put my foot in my mouth, 
                        but your messages were hardly...
                             (she thinks, exhales, 
                              chuckles slightly)
                        Look, I don’t drink. 

           Clay fumbles on that one for a moment and makes an 
           involuntary Deniro expression. He coughs. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I know that’s hard for people to 
                        wrap their heads around, but--

                                 CLAY
                        So you don’t drink anymore? Or you 
                        don’t drink because you don’t 
                        drink?

                                 HOLLY
                        I don’t drink because I can’t 
                        drink. 

                                 CLAY
                             (perplexed)
                        Can’t?

                                 HOLLY
                        Did you ever see The Fly?

                                 CLAY
                        Twice. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well that’s not far off from what 
                        too many copper enzymes do with 
                        anything stronger than red meat. 

           Clay nods and thinks. 

                                 CLAY
                        You turn into Jeff Goldblum?
           She laughs, but lays it down: 

                                 HOLLY
                        Clay, I don’t mind drunk people. 
                        And I’m not here to judge, believe 
                        me. - But your...
                             (searches for right word)
                        Level of intensity, is just 
                        something I really don’t wanna’ be 
                        around anymore. 

           A beat. This hurts. -- Holly shrugs and walks to the street. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           She raises her hand to hail a taxi. A cab stops. She opens 
           the back door. Clay follows after. 

                                 CLAY
                        No, I’m sorry. 
                             (she stops)
                        The night got a little out of hand 
                        and I probably thought I was being 
                        funny, and that in some ass-
                        backwards way you’d find it 
                        charming... 
                             (a beat, she didn’t)
                        But, Holly. That’s not me. 
                             (scout’s honor)
                        If anything, I’m a couple long-
                        necks, let’s see what’s On-Demand 
                        kinda’ guy. 
                             (holds door open)
                        And I’d really like to show you 
                        that. 

                                 HOLLY
                        I believe you’re not a mental-
                        case... and what you did for me was 
                        very, very nice. But--

                                 CAB DRIVER

                        Chill.
                             (to Holly)
                        Come on, let’s start over. No 
                        Chinese people. No Hot Dog... Just 
                        a quiet dinner. - Low intensity. 

           She half-smiles. 
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        If you change your mind, you can 
                        call me. 
                             (he hands card)
                        If I don’t hear from you, I’ll 
                        understand...
                             (clever smile)
                        But I will be forced to do a cover-
                        story on the Cook Shop. 

           She considers. 

                                 HOLLY
                        It does sound like a Meth Lab, 
                        doesn’t it?

           He grins. She takes the card and puts it in her purse. -- 
           Clay shuts the door and waves as it drives off. -- CLOSE ON 
           HIS FACE: An expression of uncertainty. 

           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - A FEW NIGHT LATER - NIGHT

           Clay, cleaned up and looking sharp for a date, paces around 
           his apartment nervously. He ponders his liquor stash, but 
           instead opens his fridge for a long-neck. -- He checks 
           himself out in the mirror -- messes with his hair a bit -- 
           changes a few different shirts -- A tight v-neck sweater with 
           no under-shirt, metro-look. Flexes “Blue Steel”. 

                                 CLAY
                        No fuckin’ way. 

           He laughs, takes it off and grabs an old polo-shirt. -- He 
           walks to the fridge for another beer, but stops, slams the 
           fridge door and looks in the mirror. Shadow boxes. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You can do this, champ. 

           He grabs his keys and exits the apartment.

           EXT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Clay walks out and sees the YUPPY COUPLE who helped him into 
           his apartment last week. He’s a little awkward without a buzz 
           and they’re a little awkward, well, because it’s awkward. 

                                 CLAY
                        Hey, Billy. 

           The couple look at each other: Who the hell is Billy?
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I’m in a rush, but...
                             (looks for words, snaps 
                              finger, he’s got it)
                        Enjoy your night. 

           Clay turns and walks out. They roll their eyes. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

           Clay walks down a bustling West Village street towards a BUSY 
           RESTAURANT... all sidewalk seating at capacity. His phone 
           VIBRATES in his pocket and he looks. 

           TEXT FROM HOLLY: 2 hour wait at that spot. At cool spot two 
           blocks away - Polcino’s - Love this place! 

           Clay thinks: Polcino’s... Polcino’s... He gets it. 

                                 CLAY
                        Fuck - me. 

           He paces quickly down the street. 

           INT. POLCINO’S - NIGHT

           Holly sits at the bar in a restaurant that couldn’t be more 
           chill. Clay enters, takes a cautious look around, but nobody 
           seems to notice him. He sees Holly and tries to find charm. 

                                 CLAY
                        Hey...

           He kisses her cheek. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Hey yourself... Have you ever been 
                        here?

                                 CLAY
                             (looking around)
                        I don’t think so...
                             (nods, approves)
                        But I’m into it. 

           The BARTENDER walks out from the kitchen and does a double-
           take when he sees Clay. He shakes his head. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        No... Absolutely not. 
                                 HOLLY
                             (turns)
                        Excuse me?

                                 BARTENDER
                             (to Clay, disbelief)
                        You’ve got some big balls showing 
                        your face around here. 

                                 CLAY
                             (slight recognition)
                        Wait, how do I know you?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Don’t play dumb with me, tiny-
                        dancer. 

           Holly’s confused. Clay takes a deep breath and tries to 
           figure out the best way to play this one. 

                                 CLAY
                        Come on... It was just a, uh... 
                        pick-up basketball game. You’re not 
                        still--

           Bartender picks up a WOODEN CLUB. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Out!

           Holly grabs her purse. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Come on. Let’s just go. 

                                 CLAY
                             (looks back)
                        It was just a pick-up game, man. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Pick up game? What the hell’s the--

                                 CLAY
                        Just a pick-up game. 

           They walk out. The bartender shakes his head. A WAITRESS 
           approaches confused. She looks out the window. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Isn’t that the guy that tried to 
                        fight Elton John when he refused to 
                        sing a duet with him?
           The bartender looks over at a PIANO in the corner with 
           missing keys and a cracked-top. 

                                 BARTENDER
                             (pissed)
                        Yeah. 

           OUTSIDE: Holly looks to Clay with breathless confusion.

                                 HOLLY
                        This is low-intensity?

           Clay laughs it off and tells his version of the story. 

                                 CLAY
                        This bozo’s still cryin’ about some 
                        b-ball game from years ago. I 
                        blocked a shot. He called foul, but 
                        these black-dudes on my team almost 
                        knifed him.
                             (shrugs)
                        Technically, it was a foul, but you 
                        know... that’s street-ball. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Why did he call you tiny dancer?

           A beat. Good question. 

                                 CLAY
                        It was my nick-name on the courts. 

           She shakes her head and exhales. Not so sure... Clay is a 
           little nervous, but he wipes his forehead and smiles. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Now let me ask you something, 
                        Holly. 
                             (a beat)
                        Do you like pulled-pork?

           How can she not be charmed?

           EXT. BUBBY’S RESTAURANT TRIBECA - NIGHT

           Clay and Holly enter. The bartenders and waitresses all smile 
           and greet Clay with open arms as he introduces Holly. 

           FLASH FORWARD: Clay exits the bathroom and walks towards 
           Holly who sits at a table in the laid-back southern-themed
           restaurant. Clay starts doing something animated with his 
           hands, like he’s making an invisible snow-ball. She laughs.
                                 CLAY
                             (picks up where he left 
                              off)
                        But nobody told me you’re supposed 
                        to pass the ball. So I got kind of 
                        a bad-vibe from the glow-stick 
                        mafia for being some kind of 
                        invisible ball-hog raver.
                             (she laughs)
                        It just wasn’t my thing. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well I wasn’t exactly a made-member 
                        of the glow-stick mafia... It’s 
                        just what my friends did. 

           The waitress comes over and looks at their empty glasses. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Another round of lemonades?

           They both nod. 

                                 CLAY
                        I told you it was amazing. 

           She smiles. Thinks. 

                                 HOLLY
                        You know, you can drink if you want 
                        to. I’m not Betty Ford. 

                                 CLAY
                             (leans back, considers)
                        Of course... But it’s a school 
                        night. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Ok, good. 
                             (she thinks)
                        You seemed a little jumpy earlier 
                        pushing the lemonade on me, school 
                        boy. 

                                 CLAY
                             (what can I say...)
                        First date jitters. 

           She nods. There’s a brief silence. Clay nods to a beat going 
           on in his head and starts: untce, untce, untce, untce as he 
           forms the invisible ball and passes it. She takes it and 
           explodes with laughter as Clay starts moving like that girl 
           in that old annoying car commercial. 
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Just breath...
                             (they laugh)
                        I can’t believe you were into that 
                        rave shit.
                             (she nods)
                        Could your copper enzymes process 
                        the E, the K, the G or whatever 
                        other letters the kids were 
                        snorting back then?

                                 HOLLY
                             (laughs)
                        No. I just danced. It was really 
                        fun. 
                             (makes a point)
                        I don’t doubt I missed out on some 
                        wild nights like Van Morrison sings 
                        about...
                             (Clay laughs)
                        But it wasn’t an option. -- So I 
                        had to find alternatives. 

                                 CLAY
                        Alternatives?

                                 HOLLY
                        Painting... hiking... getting 
                        banged-out by the hockey team. 

           Clay nods casually. 

                                 CLAY
                             (and...)
                        Baking. 

           She laughs and nods. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        You know I used to play hockey, 
                        right?

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m kidding, Clay. But just because 
                        I wasn’t blacked out at parties 
                        doesn’t mean I was an angel. 

           Clay chews his food and thinks. 

                                 CLAY
                             (bad Steven Tyler)
                        You’re my aaaaaangel... come and 
                        save me tonight... ight... ight...
           She shakes her head and laughs. He wipes his mouth with a 
           napkin, stands, smiles and excuses himself. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Drain the liz?

           He nods. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Cool... Can you take Steven Tyler 
                        with you?

           He laughs and walks towards the bathroom and makes eye-
           contact with the bartender who nods, indicating some type of 
           sketchy pre-arrangement. 

           INT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

           Clay whistles “Angel” as he pees into the toilet. He casually 
           lifts his hand up to the shelf above the john. He feels 
           around. The camera moves up: There are THREE GLASSES. Two 
           already empty that he’s already knocked back, and one full. 
           He grabs the full one and gulps it down. 

                                 CLAY
                             (Al Pacino impression)
                        Hoo-ahh.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Holly sits looking out the window. She sees something 
           peculiar sliding towards her in the reflection. She turns, 
           stunned, as Clay MOON-WALKS almost better than Michael 
           Jackson through the tables. He twists, does that leg-shake, 
           stands on his toes, pulls up his pants, dips his head. 

                                 CLAY
                        Who’s Bad?

           Tables and staff clap and laugh. It was too perfect to be 
           embarrassing and Clay’s clearly on his home-turf. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Part of me wants to hit you right 
                        now, but that was without-a-doubt 
                        one of the best moon-walks I have 
                        ever seen. 

                                 CLAY
                             (sips lemonade, smiles)
                        Wait ‘til you see my dolphin. 
           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door opens and they both walk in, laughing. She looks 
           around. The place is so big with amazing views of the city. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Whoa! Charlie Sheen over here. 

                                 CLAY
                        Charlie Sheen?

                                 HOLLY
                        Isn’t there a movie where he has a 
                        sick apartment with a view?

           Clay laughs. 

                                 CLAY
                        Don’t get too excited. I don’t make 
                        that much. 
                             (looks around)
                        This place is rent-controlled from 
                        the 70s - My mom was a real-estate 
                        broker and this was where she lived 
                        when my parents split up. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Where is she now?

           Clay points up, casually. 

                                 CLAY
                        Upstairs.

                                 HOLLY
                        Ok, isn’t that kinda’ borderline 
                        still living at home?

                                 CLAY
                        No, I mean way upstairs. Like, a 
                        thousand flights up. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Clay, I’m sorry...

                                 CLAY
                        No biggy. I was a kid. It was a 
                        while ago. She was a great gal, but 
                        don’t worry - I don’t pull out the 
                        scrap-book until the second date. 

           She smiles. She looks at a photo of Clay and Jack on a boat. 
                                 HOLLY
                        What about your Dad?

                                 CLAY
                        He moved from the city a while back 
                        and lives out on Long Island.

                                 HOLLY
                        Retired?

                                 CLAY
                        Might as well be. He’s a 
                        “consultant”. Who he consults and 
                        what he consults them about, I have 
                        no idea, but whatever it is, it 
                        involves a lot of golf and 
                        apparently...
                             (examines photo)
                        ...really short shorts. 

           She laughs. Looks at the picture of them on the boat. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Where are you guys here?

                                 CLAY
                        There...
                             (looks closer)
                        I believe was off the coast of New 
                        Zealand. -- We traveled a lot after 
                        mom checked out. I wish I could do 
                        it more, but one day you wake up 
                        with a job and... responsibilities 
                        and... life moves pretty fast, 
                        Holly. If you don’t--

                                 HOLLY
                             (laughs)
                        I got it, Ferris.
                             (looks at another picture)
                        Ok, what is this?

                                 CLAY
                             (slightly embarrassed)
                        Yeah, there was about a week when I 
                        thought I wanted to be an actor. 

           CLOSE ON: A BLACK AND WHITE PORTRAIT of Clay with a very
           serious expression on his face. 

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m definitely going to need one of 
                        these.
                                 CLAY
                        Take this one... Here, I’ll sign it 
                        for you. 

           He takes it out and grabs a pen. Writes: For Holly. Keep 
           cookin, good lookin’. Clay xoxo. He hands it to her. 

           She smiles. -- There is a moment of silence. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (looks around)
                        You know, I think I’ve got my 
                        hockey equipment stashed around 
                        here somewhere if you--

           She kisses him. He walks backwards, and they land on the 
           couch. She removes her blouse and he digs in. -- The camera 
           moves up onto a FRAMED PHOTO of JACK NICHOLSON smiling in his 
           gold helmet on the back of a motorcycle from EASY RIDER. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLAY AND HOLLY LAYING IN BED TOGETHER - SAME NIGHT

           She is fast asleep, her arm draped over his chest. He’s 
           smiling. He looks over and quietly gets out of bed. -- He 
           walks to the kitchen in his boxers and pours himself a 
           SCOTCH. -- He walks out onto his patio and looks out onto the 
           city and contemplates his life... He chuckles. 

                                 CLAY
                        Charlie Sheen...

           He sips his drink and looks out over the city. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t fuck this up. 

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND SUBWAY STATION - THAT WEEKEND - DAY

           Clay and Holly exit and look out onto the beach, boardwalk, 
           rides of Coney Island. Clay loves it. 

                                 CLAY
                        I haven’t been here since I was a 
                        kid. 

                                 HOLLY
                        So you’ve never shot the freak?

                                 CLAY
                        What do you mean, like heroin?
           She grabs his hand. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Follow me. 

           EXT. SHOOT THE FREAK - DAY

           A real Coney Island attraction, SHOOT THE FREAK, you pay to 
           aim and shoot a LIVE MOVING TARGET with a paint-ball gun as 
           he runs around an obstacle course. -- Clay aims but keeps 
           missing. Holly shakes her head and walks over.

                                 HOLLY
                        You gotta’ anticipate the freak’s 
                        next move. 

           She puts her arm around his and aims for him. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Pull!

           He does and hits the freak. People cheer. She aims again, and 
           this time through her POV we see a TWO INCH SPOT between the 
           freak’s mask and his chest-pad where his throat is exposed. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Pull!

           Clay does. The freak grabs his throat: Aguhgah! and rolls to 
           the ground. People cheer louder. Holly aims. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Again!

                                 THE FREAK
                        Alright! You got me you crazy 
                        bitch!
                             (to attendant)
                        Hey Frankie! What the fuck?

           The guido attendant, FRANKIE, preoccupied with some juicy 
           Coney Island guidettes, sees this and races over. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Alright, ‘dats enough Oswald.

           He takes her gun. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Come on, we paid for those rounds. 
                                 CLAY
                        Yeah, it’s not our fault your boy’s 
                        a shitty freak. 

           Frankie shakes his head. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well can I at least get my t-
                        shirt!?

           She motions to the “I Shot The Freak” T-shirt, but Frankie is 
           already attending to his wounded freak. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Take a hike, psycho!

           Clay and Holly walk off, laughing. 

                                 CLAY
                             (runs down the list)
                        Painting... hiking... sniping. 

           She laughs. 

           LOU REED’S “Coney Island Baby” plays coolly as we DISSOLVE:

           -Clay and Holly, arms raised, screaming with excitement, as 
           the Cyclone roller-coaster descends in slow motion.

           -Clay at a BEER CONCESSION at a Brooklyn Cyclone’s baseball 
           game. He orders a beer, looks around, and rips it in like 
           four sips... he really needed that. 

           -He walks through the crowd at the ball-game holding two 
           peanut-bags. He spots Holly. She smiles. -- They cheer. 

           -The sun sets as Clay sits at a table on the Boardwalk. He 
           looks over at Holly ordering food from RUBY’S BAR AND GRILL. 
           He removes a FLASK. He opens it, swigs, but it’s empty. He 
           looks over at her as she walks towards the table, smiling, 
           holding clams. He smiles, but also swallows how sickened he 
           is with himself. Under the table, he tosses the flask in the 
           sand. 

           -EXTERIOR SHOT: Clay and Holly ride the Subway. She has a 
           GIANT STUFFED HOT-DOG. He puts his arm around hers and she 
           leans onto him as the N TRAIN rides over the MANHATTAN BRIDGE 
           and descends into the tunnel entering the city. 

           LOU REED: Coney Island Baby... man I swear I’d give the whole 
           thing up for you. 
           INT. CLAY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Clay is kicked-back on his sofa talking into a DICTAPHONE. 

                                 CLAY
                             (into dictaphone) 
                        Clay’s goals: -- Bloody Marys: 
                        Sunday Morning only...
                             (he thinks)
                        Fuck that. Saturday and Sunday 
                        only. -- And try to cut out gin 
                        even if it means no Tom Collins at 
                        El Quiote.
                             (clucks tongue to think)
                        Invite Holly to Sag Harbor for the 
                        Fourth...
                             (a beat)
                        But is that too soon? - It might 
                        be. 
                             (a beat, he nods)
                        Try to get through one week without 
                        drinking during lunch... How does 
                        it feel? Could I go two weeks?

           There is a KNOCK on his door. Clay sits up and sees Mitch. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Liquid lunch?

           Clay thinks. He looks at the tape-recorder. 

                                 CLAY
                        Fuck...
                             (into dictaphone, with 
                              conviction)
                        Plan starts tomorrow. 

           He gets up.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Since when do you have a plan?

           Clay laughs: Good point. They walk out. 

           EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Mitch and Clay exit. Not hammered, but buzzed. Mitchell hails 
           a cab. One stops and Mitch opens the door. -- Clay looks 
           across the street at MODELL’S SPORTING GOODS. There is a 
           paint-ball gear display in the window. 
                                 CLAY
                        You know what? I gotta’ run a few 
                        errands. I’ll be back later. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Whatever’s clever, Clayton. 

           He shuts the door and drives off. Clay hails another cab.

                                 CLAY
                             (to driver)
                        Coney Island. 

           The cab drives. 

           EXT. THE COOK SHOP - A FEW HOURS LATER - AFTERNOON

           Clay approaches, a REALLY NICE GIFT BAG in his hand. He’s 
           cool, a nice glow from the martinis and a few pops in Coney. 

           INT. THE COOK SHOP - DAY

           There’s a good crowd. Jesse is working the counter. A MAN IN 
           WORK CLOTHES fixes a cooler- his back to Clay. 

                                 JESSE
                        You must be Clay.

                                 CLAY
                        I am. How did you--

           She points to the wall: His HEAD-SHOT is hanging up. He 
           smiles: What a gal...

                                 GIRL
                        Have you been in anything lately?

                                 CLAY
                        Yeah. Have you ever seen Shoot The 
                        Freak?

           She shakes her head, no, but laughs. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Clay?

           Clay turns. Robert was the man working on the cooler. He 
           stands, wipes his hands on his pants, and extends to shake. 

                                 CLAY
                        Mr. Clark. How are you?
                                 ROBERT
                        A lot better if I could fix this 
                        damn thing. 

           Clay looks over at the broken cooler and nods. 

                                 CLAY
                        I like it. Holly’s putting you to 
                        work. Is she here?

                                 ROBERT
                        ‘Just missed her. She had to drive 
                        out to East Hampton to meet some 
                        restaurant that wants to carry her 
                        desserts. 

                                 CLAY
                        That’s great. 

           Robert nods and looks around. 

                                 ROBERT
                             (sincere)
                        Hell of a thing you did for us, 
                        Clay.

                                 CLAY
                        Us?

                                 ROBERT
                        We nearly went bankrupt helping 
                        Holly open this place. 

                                 CLAY
                             (modest)
                        I only helped spread the word. If 
                        she didn’t have the goods, people 
                        in this town wouldn’t be coming 
                        back. 

           Robert nods. He looks down and notices the gift. 

                                 ROBERT
                        What have you got there, son?

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, this is... this...

           Robert’s eyes are held on the card that clearly says HOLLY. 

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m not a dumb-shit, Clay. I know 
                        my daughter has relationships with 
                        men. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                             (smiles, eases tension)
                        And as long as it doesn’t contain 
                        fancy underpants, I’d be glad to 
                        pass it along to her. 

                                 CLAY
                             (fair enough)
                        I believe I could entrust this into 
                        your hands. 

           Clay passes the gift. There is a brief silence. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Well hell, Clay. I’d buy ya’ a 
                        beer, but I’ve gotta’ fix this 
                        piece a’ shit cooler before the 5 
                        PM train. 

                                 CLAY
                        Rain check?

                                 ROBERT
                        I look forward to that. 

           They shake. Clay exits. 

           LATER THAT NIGHT: Holly walks into the bakery. She sees the 
           bag. She opens it. She looks up at his HEAD-SHOT and smiles. 

           LOU REED: (Reprise): Coney Island Baby. 

           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A record is skipping. Clay is passed out on his couch, all 
           the lights on, a half-bottle of SCOTCH on the table. There is 
           a LOUD KNOCK on the door. He comes to. Huh? Another knock. 
           His hair is a mess. 

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Clay? 

           Clay gets up and shakes the cobwebs out. Notices the bottle.

                                 CLAY
                        Jus’ a sec. 

           He quickly takes the bottle and puts it away. He runs the 
           sink and sticks his head under, putting a towel around his 
           neck like he just got out of the shower. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, just got out of the shower. 
           She smiles and walks in wearing a long rain-coat. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Still raining?

           She stops, confused. 

                                 HOLLY
                        When was it raining?

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, I... thought I heard some 
                        pitter-patter earlier. No?

           She shakes her head, and then notices something. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Tough day at the office?

                                 CLAY
                        Huh?

           She turns, steps aside, revealing EIGHT EMPTY BEER BOTTLES 
           scattered around the kitchen that Clay hadn’t noticed or 
           remembered. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (laughs, shakes head)
                        Those jerks...
                             (walks over and throws 
                              them away)
                        These bums from the office. No 
                        decency. They treat my pad like 
                        it’s a redemption-center. 

           She smiles, undoes the belt on her rain-coat. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well it’s a good thing they left. 

           She removes it, wearing nothing but a black I SHOT THE FREAK 
           T-SHIRT. Clay smiles. They kiss. ZOOM-ON Clay’s EYE’S. He’s 
           into it, but he’s hurting. 

           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - FOLLOWING MORNING

           Holly is fixing breakfast in her t-shirt and looks over at 
           Clay who looks like SHIT. He’s able to justify his pale looks 
           and expression with what he’s just heard on his VOICEMAIL.

                                 CLAY
                        Shit!
                                 HOLLY
                        Are you OK? You don’t look well. 

           He rubs his eyes. Exhales. 

                                 CLAY
                        My Dad’s in Santa Fe and he rented 
                        our house out for the weekend. -- 
                        I’ve never missed a Fourth of July 
                        out there in my life. 

           Holly’s not quite sure how to comfort him. 

                                 HOLLY
                        I’m... sorry...

           Clay rubs his eyes, a little too stressed for that type of 
           let-down, but shakes it out. 

                                 CLAY
                        It just sucks because I was 
                        actually...
                             (looks up, hopefull)
                        Gonna’ see if you wanted to maybe 
                        head out there this weekend? - I 
                        mean, I know we kinda’ just met, 
                        but...

           She thinks it’s sweet. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Not at all. - I’m sure it would 
                        have been a blast... but I already 
                        told my mom that I’d come home this 
                        weekend.

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, oh, yeah... totally. 

           Holly smiles. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Uh, oh... was that a where’s my 
                        invitation?

           Couldn’t be further from where he’s at, but forces a smile.

                                 CLAY
                        Busted. 
                                 HOLLY
                        Trust me. You don’t know “too soon” 
                        until you’ve had a we kinda’ just 
                        met let’s spend a long weekend at 
                        my parent’s house weekend. 

           He nods. Leans back, eyes closed. 

                                 CLAY
                             (eyes closed, uninspired)
                        When are you headin’ up?

                                 HOLLY
                        I think tomorrow after work. 
                             (she walks around kitchen)
                        Sarah’s really kicking ass right 
                        now, so she’ll be good to run the 
                        shop on Thursday...

           She looks into the eggs and thinks for a moment. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Is it psychotic that I’m gonna’
                        miss you?

           Clay doesn’t answer. She looks up. Clay’s neck is tilted 
           back. His mouth wide-open as he lets out a gigantic SNORE. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - FOURTH OF JULY - DAY

           CHICAGO: Saturday, in the park, I think it was the Fourth of 
           July... 

           The streets are empty. Clay exits his building in shorts and 
           Hawaiian shirt... blinded by the SWELTERING SUN. 

           We MONTAGE on Clay as he walks through the grocery store 
           filling his cart with burgers, buns, charcoal, beers, 
           margarita mix, and bags of ice. 

                                 CLAY
                             (into phone)
                        Yo, it’s Clay. I know it’s last 
                        minute, but if you’re in the city, 
                        I’m having a cookout on my roof 
                        today. Hit me up. 
                             (another call)
                        So if you or anyone you know is in 
                        the city, definitely swing by.
                             (another call)
                        Hey man. Long time. No talk...
                             (another call)
                        Should be a good time, so...
           --Clay walks past the READE STREET PUB, hands filled with 
           bags, and stops to talk with two LINGERING DRUNKS smoking 
           outside. He tells them about the party. They nod. 

           INT. PENTHOUSE OF HOTEL GANSEVORT - DAY

           Mitchell is in downward-dog, in a private yoga session with 
           his wife, ANDREA. He hears his phone vibrate and looks next 
           to his mat: CALL FROM CLAY.

           Without stopping as he transitions into standing-bow 
           position, he clicks ANSWER and talks through his BLUE-TOOTH. 

           INTERCUT to Clay setting up a bar on his roof. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Mace! Happy Fourth!

           The uber-zen FEMALE YOGA INSTRUCTOR and ANDREA are appalled: 
           Really?

                                 CLAY
                             (surprised)
                        Mitchell, oh, my bad. I was 
                        scrolling through my phone. I meant 
                        to call someone else.

                                 MITCHELL
                        No worries, but you actually caught 
                        me in the middle of a Lotus pose... 
                        Can I get back to you?

                                 CLAY
                        Nothing pressing. We’ll catch up 
                        next week. Enjoy the Hamptons.

                                 MITCHELL
                        I wish. The kids wouldn’t shut up 
                        about fireworks, so I got the 
                        penthouse at the Gansevort.

           He looks out at the amazing view. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s fuckin’ dope up here. 

           And now the Yoga Instructor and Andrea have had it. 

                                 YOGA INSTRUCTOR
                        Mitchell, this is really disruptive 
                        to your practice. 

           As he perfectly transitions into a flawless down-ward dog. 
                                 MITCHELL
                        You call that disruptive? That was 
                        money. 

           The instructor rolls her eyes. Clay laughs. 

                                 CLAY
                        Well listen. I’m having a barbecue 
                        on my roof today. Bring the kids, 
                        I’ll even whip up some Shirley 
                        Temples. 

                                 MITCHELL
                             (laughs)
                        Namaste, my man. I’ll be in touch. 

           He hangs up. He and his wife transition poses. 

                                 ANDREA
                             (quietly)
                        Who the hell is “Mace”?

                                 MITCHELL
                        That was Clay, babe. ‘Having some 
                        cook-out today. 

           This even gets her to stop yoga. She’s delighted. 

                                 ANDREA
                        Clay? How is he?

           The instructor exhales obnoxiously. Not a yoga-breath. 

                                 ANDREA (CONT’D)
                             (to instructor)
                        For what we’re paying, I found that 
                        breath to be a little offensive.  
                             (to Mitchell)
                        How come you never have him out to 
                        the house? - You’re not still upset 
                        about what he did at our wedding 
                        are you?

           Mitchell transitions and inhales deeply. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        ‘Course not. I love Clay.
                             (exhales)
                        On my terms. 
           EXT. CLAY’S ROOF - DAY

           He’s behind the bar, almost like at the Memorial Cookout. 
           He’s on fire, doing his foot-ball pass trick...

                                 CLAY
                        But, ohhh. He checks down.
                             (pours drinks)
                        It’s a screen pass.

           But there’s not laughter this time. 

                                 DRUNK MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ga’ any Cutty?

           The camera turns and the only party Clay has is the two 
           GREASY DRUNKS he saw outside the Reade and their small posse 
           of toothless 50-somethings. It’s a bad scene. 

           Clay looks at his watch, and up at the sweltering heat. He 
           wipes the sweat of his forehead... He’s noticeably bummed and 
           downs a margarita in one long rip. 

           EXT. CLAY’S BUILDING - DAY

           Mitch and Andrea stand at the entrance with their two kids, 8 
           and 10, both dressed as preppy as their parents. Andrea has a 
           bottle of wine in Fourth of July gift-wrap. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        This is just a quick hello, Andy. 
                             (looks at watch)
                        I’m not missing my massage. 

                                 ANDREA
                             (shakes head)
                        You’re such a diva. 

           They walk in, met by DOORMAN. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        You here for Clay?
                             (they nod)
                        Go right on up.

           They enter the elevator. 

           ROOF: Clay is sitting in a chair, his feet in a kiddy-pool, 
           head leaned back, crushing a Corona. He wets a towel and puts 
           it on his head. 

           The ROOF DOOR opens and Mitchell and his family walk in. 
           Mitchell and Andrea both examine the scene with shock. 
           Two drunks are in mid-discussion. 

                                 DRUNK
                        So I said, give me back wha’s mine 
                        bitch, or go back ta’ Boise! 

           The other drunk laughs a revolting smoker’s laugh/cough which 
           becomes full blown dry-heave. Andrea is horrified. -- Clay 
           gets up and races over to them. 

                                 CLAY
                        Mitchell! Andrea! You made it! 
                             (looks around, 
                              embarrassed)
                        Sorry, I’m kinda’ just getting set 
                        up here.

                                 ANDREA
                        Clay... it’s... so... great to see 
                        you. 

           She musters a half-hearted hug and kiss and hands him the 
           bottle of wine. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, this wasn’t necessary.
                             (looks towards bar)
                        What can I get for ya’?

           Mitch looks around. His two kids have already made contact 
           with one of the drunks.

                                 DRUNK 2
                        Wanna’ see a magic trick?

                                 MITCHELL
                        No, no, no, no...
                             (he paces over and picks 
                              up his kids)
                        There’s no magic here. 

           He carries them over to Andrea.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        Wait here with mommy. 

                                 KID
                        I wanna’ see magic.

                                 MITCHELL
                        We’ll see magic later...
                             (to Clay)
                        Clay. A word?
           He steps away. Clay follows.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        What is this?
                             (Clay speechless)
                        You call me... tell me to bring my 
                        kids... and you’re up here chillin’
                        with fuckin’ drifters?

           Clay looks around at the pathetic drunks. 

                                 CLAY
                        Sorry. They’re from the bar 
                        downstairs. They helped me carry 
                        some ice up... More people are on 
                        the way. 

                                 MITCHELL
                             (examines scene)
                        Not gonna’ lie. That kinda’ scares 
                        me. 

           They hear a dry heave. Everyone turns and one of the drunks 
           vomits in the baby-pool. Andrea turns her head in disgust. 

                                 KID
                             (scared)
                        Daddy.

                                 MITCHELL
                             (claps hands, rounds up 
                              troops)
                        Alright, that’s it. Bus is leavin’.

                                 CLAY
                        Mitch, I’m--

                                 MITCHELL
                        No hard feelings. Last minute 
                        parties don’t always pan out. 

           Clay exhales. Looks at Andrea: I’m sorry. 

                                 ANDREA
                        It was great seeing you, Clay.
                             (she walks out, but stops, 
                              turns)
                        By the way... congrats on the new 
                        job. 

           Clay nods. She walks out with Mitchell and the kids. Clay 
           looks over at the drunk rinsing his face in the pool. 
                                 DRUNK
                             (to Clay)
                        Ga’ any more Cutty?

           A beat. He looks around at how pathetic this scene is. 

                                 CLAY
                        Party’s over. 

           INT. HOLLY’S LAKE HOUSE - DAY

           Holly is finishing up a phone conversation. She’s excited. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (into phone)
                        Ok, great. Talk to you Tuesday. 

           She hangs up. Her MOM and DAD are eager to hear what’s up. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT’D)
                        The owner of that Hampton’s 
                        restaurant? - Wants to have me as a 
                        guest on his cooking show. 

           Her mom screams! Robert folds the paper.

                                 ROBERT
                        Well how about that. 

           Holly’s mom, JOYCE, walks over and hugs her. 

                                 HOLLY
                        This is so weird. Three weeks ago I 
                        was going out of business and now 
                        I’m gonna’ be on TV. 

                                 JOYCE
                        That’s how it happens, Holly. The 
                        right people just get discovered. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well they aren’t exactly etching my 
                        star on Hollywood boulevard, but...
                             (she thinks)
                        I should call Clay. Technically, 
                        he’s the one who “discovered” me. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Yeah, what’s he up to this weekend 
                        anyways?

                                 HOLLY
                        ‘Just in the city. 
                                 JOYCE
                        Doesn’t he have a family?

                                 HOLLY
                        His Dad’s in Santa Fe, so...

                                 JOYCE
                        Poor thing. He’s probably dying of 
                        heat stroke. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (considers)
                        We talked about coming up here, but 
                        we’ve only been dating a few weeks 
                        and I didn’t want it to be weird. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Don’t be silly, Holly. That’s what 
                        the pull-out couch is for. You’re a 
                        grown woman, you certainly don’t 
                        have to be married to have your 
                        friends up. 
                             (to Robert)
                        You’ve met Clay. 

           Robert thinks. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Of course. That’s what the pull-out 
                        couch is for. 

           He goes back to reading the paper. 

           INT. CLAY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Clay sits with his head next to his A/C as he drinks 
           margarita directly from the blender. It’s half-empty. He’s 
           got a bummed-out buzz goin’. His PHONE RINGS. It’s Holly. 
           Clay is almost relieved. He answers. Intercut. 

                                 CLAY
                        You just made my day. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (smiles)
                        City’s that hot?

                                 CLAY
                        You have no idea. 
                                 HOLLY
                        Well there’s a 3 O’Clock train to 
                        Awkwardsville if you wanna’ be 
                        cool. 

                                 CLAY
                             (perks up, eager)
                        Really? Why the change of heart?

                                 HOLLY
                        Danny Montaine wants me to be a 
                        guest on Montaine’s Flame and now 
                        my mom won’t stop talking about 
                        meeting the guy who “made it all 
                        possible”. 

                                 CLAY
                             (laughs)
                        Montaine, eh???
                             (bad impression)
                        Blizam!

                                 HOLLY
                             (laughs)
                        Yeah, well... Now she’s acting like 
                        it’s her civic duty to get you out 
                        of the heat. 

                                 CLAY
                        That would be great. - What train 
                        do I take?

           FLASH FORWARD: Clay exits his apartment with a duffel bag. 
           The camera pans over onto the kitchen counter... the blender 
           of margarita is empty. 

           INT. HUDSON NEWS - GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

           Clay is definitely buzzed as he grabs some magazines and 
           looks at the ice-filled cooler of 24 oz. Budweiser cans. He 
           looks up at the INDIAN WOMAN behind the counter. 

                                 CLAY
                        Can you still drink on the Metro 
                        North? 

           EXT. TRAIN - MOVING - DAY

           Clay drinks a beer as he looks out the window and slips into:
           DAYDREAM: He’s sitting on Holly’s front porch, that in his 
           version is a GIANT ADIRONDACK CABIN over-looking a GIANT 
           LAKE. Robert reaches in slow-motion like a beer commercial 
           and pulls out an ICE COLD BEER. He’s manning the grill. 

                                 ROBERT
                        How about another cold one, son?

                                 CLAY
                        It’s always Miller Time for me, 
                        Bobby. 

           Holly emerges from the lake in a SKIMPY BIKINI and shakes her 
           head as she runs towards him, breasts juggling. 

                                 ROBERT
                        How do you like your bison?

                                 CLAY
                        Bloody as hell, Bobby. Bloody as 
                        hell. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Man after my own heart. 

           The dream is interrupted as we hear a TRAIN CONDUCTOR: 
           Wassaic... last stop on da’ train... eh pal. Rise n’ shine. 

           RETURN TO REALITY: This “daydream” was actually a DREAM as 
           Clay startles awake: A large line of DROOL hangs from his 
           open mouth. He’s pale and totally out of it. A large RED-LINE 
           across his face from sleeping on the window’s ledge. 

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Last stop, Chief.

                                 CLAY
                        Huh? Where am I?

           He looks around... completely out of it. 

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Wassaic...
                             (a beat)
                        Take your trash wit’cha.

           Clay looks down. THREE EMPTY 24oz. BUD CANS. Clay hurts bad 
           and looks like he has the flu. 

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Holly stands next to her families’ BEAT UP WAGONEER. She 
           looks around, a little confused: Where is he?
           Her face drops and the camera turns to show Clay, disheveled, 
           pale, and confused. 

                                 HOLLY
                        What the hell happened? You look 
                        like Billy Joel.

                                 CLAY
                        I’ve got a really bad nap-hangover. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Nap hangover?

                                 CLAY
                        You know, when you meant to take a 
                        ten minute cat-nap but instead you 
                        sleep for two hours and wake up in 
                        another dimension. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Well, are you OK?

                                 CLAY
                        I’ll be fine after a Miller High 
                        Life and a bison burger. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Huh?

                                 CLAY
                             (a little curt)
                        Forget it. 

           She shakes it off and gets in the car. Clay gets in, the door 
           is kinda’ hard to open and rust is flimzy at the bottom. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Sweet ride. 

           He slams the door. 

           INT. WAGONEER - DRIVING - DAY

           The radio is playing that annoying pop-song from a few years 
           back, “Califooooooorniaaaa... here we coooooooome!”

                                 CLAY
                        Fuck - off. 

           He turns the radio off kind off aggressive, leans his head 
           against the window and exhales. 
                                 HOLLY
                        Ok, what’s your deal?

                                 CLAY
                        I can’t fucking stand that song. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Neither can I, but you’re acting 
                        like a girl on her period with 
                        diarrhea. 

                                 CLAY
                        I told you already. I don’t nap
                        well. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (mock-drama)
                        Well you’re awake now. And one 
                        breath at a time we’ll get you 
                        back. 
                             (chuckle)
                        Ok?

           Clay just stares out the window like she just talked him 
           through some serious shit.

                                 CLAY
                             (sniffs, nods)
                        Alright. 

           She’s not so sure... something’s up and she doesn’t like it. 

           EXT. CLARK’S HOUSE - DAY

           Holly waves to her neighbors. Everyone’s smiling and 
           friendly. Clay looks around. 

                                 CLAY
                        I gotta’ piss so bad. 

           She shakes her head and gets out. Clay exits the car and 
           stretches. Holly looks into the car and it occurs to her...

                                 HOLLY
                        Didn’t you bring anything?

                                 CLAY
                        What, like a gift?

                                 HOLLY
                        No, like a change of clothes...
                             (looks him over)
                        Deoderant?
                                 CLAY
                        Oh, shit.
                             (he looks back)
                        I left it on the train. Damnit.

                                 HOLLY
                             (cuts loss)
                        Come on, we’ll call them inside. 

                                 CLAY
                        Yeah, I’m sure customer service is 
                        gonna’ be real attentive to our 
                        needs at 5PM on Fourth of July.

                                 HOLLY
                        What are you gonna’ do? Wear my 
                        dad’s clothes all weekend?

                                 CLAY
                             (uh...)
                        Ever heard of a store?

           She’s at a loss. 

                                 HOLLY
                             (under-breath)
                        Who invited this guy?

           Robert walks out the front door, much like he does at the 
           beginning of the movie, but a bit more welcoming. 

                                 ROBERT
                        There he is. 

           Clay’s uncharacteristically stiff and Robert takes note. 

                                 CLAY
                        Mr. Clark. How are you?

                                 ROBERT
                        Fine. Just fine. Glad you could 
                        make it. 

           A sliding door opens and Joyce walks out, like a mom. They 
           shake hands. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Welcome, Clay. You must have been 
                        dying in that city. I just read it 
                        was over 100. 

                                 CLAY
                             (looks around)
                        Yeah, it sucked. 
           Not the response they had in mind, but Clay is oblivious. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Well it’s great to finally meet 
                        this mystery man who has made all 
                        these exciting things possible for 
                        Holly--

           Clay looks out to the small lake. 

                                 CLAY
                        So what do you call that out there?
                             (they all turn)
                        A lake or... pond... what do they 
                        call a body of water that size? - A 
                        little lake?

                                 JOYCE
                             (nods)
                        Sure, Clay. You could call it that. 
                        - The Indians called it Lake 
                        Mohawk. 

                                 CLAY
                        Ah, yes. Lake Mohawk... The Mighty 
                        Mo. - The Hawk! - You guy’s have 
                        jet-skis?

           They all look out to the small quiet lake. 

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s more of a canoeing lake, Clay. 
                        Now what can I get for you?

                                 CLAY
                        You know, when I’m in a lake 
                        setting like this... nothin’ better 
                        than a cold beer. 

           Robert nods, but cautiously. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Of course. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Come on in, Clay. Let’s see what we 
                        got. 

                                 CLAY
                             (to Holly and Robert - bad 
                              Schwarzenager impression)
                        I’ll be back. 

           Robert and Holly look at each other: Huh?
           INSIDE HOUSE: Joyce looks through the fridge.

                                 JOYCE
                        I would have stocked the fridge if 
                        I knew you were coming, but the 
                        Country Store closes at noon on 
                        holidays. 
                             (she moves some things)
                        But I’m pretty sure we’ve got a few 
                        beers left over from Bob’s poker 
                        night. - And you’re in luck. 
                             (she turns)
                        One left. Do you like the micro-
                        brews, Clay?

           She hands him a bottle of Pete’s Wicked Summer Bullshit in 
           slow-motion. He takes it. 

                                 CLAY
                             (forced smile)
                        So long as it’s cold. 
                             (looks around)
                        But if there’s some warm ones, 
                        that’s fine too. - I actually like 
                        to taste the hops in these micro-
                        brews at their natural temp. You 
                        know, experience the true essence 
                        of the barley. 

           CLOSE ON: A BEAD OF SWEAT runs down Clay’s forehead. ZOOM ON: 
           Joyce’s mouth as it moves in slow-motion w/ zombie-effect. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I think that’s the laaaaaast one. 
                        The laaaast one. The laaaaaast one.

           The crack of her opening it, breaks his transe. She hands it 
           and he takes a generous sip: Ahhh.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        I know that feeling. Nothing like a 
                        cold beer on a hot night. 

                                 CLAY
                             (sips, nods, cheers)
                        Happy birthday, America. 

           PORCH: Clay walks out. Robert is lighting the grill. Clay 
           looks over at Holly sitting in a basic, ordinary chair.

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Now that looks like a comfortable 
                        chair. 
           He walks over. Robert takes note of how empty his beer 
           already is. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Feeling better?

                                 CLAY
                        Like a new man. 
                             (looks around)
                        This’ll be great. A nice 
                        dinner...put the dishes away... and 
                        then I would just love to pop on 
                        into town and buy you all some pie 
                        and coffee. 
                             (buddy-buddy with Robert)
                        We’ll make that an Irish coffee for 
                        the lads. 

           Robert gives Holly a strange look. 

                                 ROBERT
                        That’s nice of you, Clay. But we 
                        got a front row seat here and 
                        you’re not gonna’ wanna’ miss the 
                        fireworks over the lake. 

                                 CLAY
                        Good call. Then we can head into 
                        town. Right, Holly?

           He slaps his hand on her knee. She’s not into it. At all. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Unfortunately most things will be 
                        closed except the Mohawk Tavern. 
                        And that gets a bit of a rough 
                        crowd after dark. 

                                 CLAY
                        Nonsense, Joyce... That’s the 
                        heartbeat of America. 

           Robert nods and his picture of the situation becomes clearer. 
           Nervously, Holly bites her lip, as if she sees this too. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I suppose we could--

                                 HOLLY
                        We’ll see where the night takes us. 
                        I can always go into town with Clay 
                        if you’re not up for it--

           Robert clears his throat. Sternly. 
                                 ROBERT
                        Why don’t we play it by ear. 

                                 CLAY
                             (snaps, points to Robert, 
                              winks)
                        That’s the only way to play. 

           He raises his hand for a high-five. Robert reluctantly meets 
           it. Holly is like, what? -- Joyce leans into Holly, discrete. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Is he on drugs?

           FLASH FORWARD: They sit around the dinner table. Awkward 
           silence: the sound of chewing and forks and knives. Clay is 
           struggling, staring into his food. He nods. 

                                 CLAY
                        Yup... This is the best bison I’ve 
                        ever had. 

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s not bison. 

                                 HOLLY
                        You said that earlier. Where did 
                        you get bison from?

                                 CLAY
                        This isn’t bison? I thought it was 
                        bison...
                             (takes bite)
                        Tastes like bison. 

                                 ROBERT
                        It’s just your basic cheeseburger, 
                        Clay. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh no, there’s nothing basic about 
                        this. - Now I know where Holly gets 
                        her culinary skills. 

           Joyce notices that Clay is sweating. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Are you alright, Clay? I was 
                        actually going to go in for a 
                        sweater. 

                                 CLAY
                             (sipes forehead)
                        It must be from the city. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLAY (CONT'D)
                        I’ve always been really sensitive 
                        to the heat. It sticks with me. 
                             (a beat)
                        Are you from the city, Mrs. Clark?

                                 HOLLY
                        You know I’m from Albany. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, I didn’t realize that your 
                        mother and everyone was from there. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Third generation. 

           Robert zeros in on Clay’s hand, shaking, as he holds his 
           fork. 

                                 CLAY
                             (well how about that)
                        Third generation Albany. - That’s 
                        really exciting. Did you know any 
                        politicians or have family that 
                        were into politics? - Ever met any 
                        Cuomo’s?

           Holly spits out her drink. 

                                 HOLLY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOYCE
                        Holly. 

                                 HOLLY
                        No, mom. I wanna’ know what’s going 
                        on here. 

           Clay exhales like he’s about to crumble. He swallows. 

                                 CLAY
                        I don’t know what’s going on. We’re 
                        just talking New York politics. 
                        What’s going on with you?

           Holly shakes her head and takes her plate and gets up. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (stands)
                        No, Holly. Let me get that. I’ll do 
                        the dishes. 
                                 HOLLY
                        It’s a paper plate, Clay. And I’m 
                        just getting more noodle-salad. 

           And for the first time we get Clay’s POV: His vision trails, 
           delirious from withdrawal. 

                                 CLAY
                        I’m happy to do the dishes...
                             (looks around)
                        What do you got here? Machine? Hand 
                        wash? I’m the dish master. 

           He reaches for Joyce’s plate. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Clay, no. I’m still eating. 

                                 CLAY
                        Oh, sorry. I guess I’ll just, uh, 
                        get started on mine and then come 
                        back and maybe you’ll be done 
                        eating and I can do your dishes 
                        then. 

           He walks into the house. Panic-attack breathing. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m worried, Holly. Does he need a 
                        doctor?

                                 ROBERT
                        He needs a drink. 

                                 JOYCE
                        What do you mean he needs a drink?

                                 ROBERT
                        You know damn well what I mean. 

           Robert stands and looks at Holly. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        How did you not see this?

                                 HOLLY
                             (firm)
                        Dad. I’ll handle it. 

           INSIDE: Clay is leaned over with one hand on the counter, the 
           other on his forehead, quietly breathing. 
                                 CLAY
                        Getittogether - getittogether - 
                        getittogether.

           He turns when he hears Holly’s footsteps. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Sorry, Clay. I knew it was too soon 
                        for this. 

                                 CLAY
                             (qipes sweat)
                        I’m just trying to be a good guest 
                        here. 

                                 HOLLY
                        It’s all good. But you and I are 
                        going back to the city right now. 

                                 CLAY
                             (looks around)
                        I just need a minute. 
                             (thinks)
                        Would it be weird if I took a 
                        shower?

                                 HOLLY
                        Clay, no, it’s cool. We can talk 
                        about it in the car. Come on...

                                 CLAY
                        No, you know what?
                             (he looks around, looks 
                              outside at Robert and 
                              Joyce, and back to Holly)
                        I just need to get the fuck outa’
                        here. 

           He turns and walks out. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Clay, wait. 

                                 CLAY
                             (stops, turns)
                        And I don’t need you. 

           The door slams. She stars to follow after, but is stopped by 
           Robert who grabs her arm. He holds her. 

                                 ROBERT
                        Let him go, Holly. There’s nothing 
                        you can do. Just let him go. 
                                 HOLLY
                             (into his arms)
                        I knew it, Dad... I convinced 
                        myself that I was wrong. 

                                 ROBERT
                        This isn’t your fault. 

           Robert looks out at Clay as he walks towards the road. There 
           is anger in his eyes, but also understanding for what he’s 
           going through. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY EVENING

           Clay is delirious, but relieved to be out of there. He looks 
           back towards the house. 

                                 CLAY
                        Eesh.

           He turns and walks down the road. Crickets and seccades buzz. 

           FADE TO BLACK. 

           The sound of kids partying and laughing.

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - FADE IN - EARLY EVENING

           A smoke-filled car filled with kids in their early 20s is 
           driving down the winding road. Case of beer. Couple dudes. 
           Couple chicks. They smoke, drink, and shoot bottle-rockets 
           out the window. 

           The driver turns, taking his eyes off the road. 

                                 DRIVER
                             (reaches for joint)
                        Yo man, lemme hit that. 

           Passenger sees something. 

                                 PASSENGER
                        Dude! Watch out! 

           Driver turns, slams on the break and skids as CLAY turns. - 
           The car hits him like a football tackle. He is knocked up 
           onto the windshield, and when the car stops completely, Clay 
           flies forward onto the road. A NON-DEADLY HIT. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!
           The girls in the back scream! 

                                 PASSENGER
                             (frantic)
                        Drive! Just drive!

                                 DRIVER
                             (panic)
                        I’m not gonna’ “just drive” and 
                        then start getting scary notes next 
                        summer!

           They look over the hood. Clay is still alive and moving. 
           After a few moans and groans, slowly gets up, turns and looks 
           at them, and then turns back and walks down the road. -- The 
           kids all get out of the car in awe. 

                                 PASSENGER
                        Dude! Dude! Are you OK, man? Hey! 
                        Where are you going?

                                 DRIVER
                             (panic)
                        He’s going to the cops! He’s going 
                        to the cops! - Please, don’t! I’ll 
                        pay you. My parents are rich. 
                        Whatever you want. 

           Clay stops and turns. A deathly serious look in his eye:

                                 CLAY
                        How about a lift to the Mohawk 
                        Tavern?

           UB40: Red, red, wine... Stay close to me... 

           INT. MOHAWK TAVERN - NIGHT

           Clay hangs out shots to everyone around him at the crowded 
           bar on the lake and leads a sing-a-long.

           Just one thing helps me forget...

                                 EVERYONE IN BAR
                        Red! Red! Wine! 

           One of the dudes from the car in on his cell-phone.

                                 DUDE 1
                             (into phone)
                        You gotta’ get over here now. We’re 
                        at the Mohawk hanging with this 
                        chill mother-fucker from New York. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DUDE 1 (CONT'D)
                        - Yeah, John hit him with his car, 
                        but he wasn’t even mad. All he 
                        wanted was a lift to the Hawk. 
                             (looks to Clay holding 
                              court at the bar)
                        Now he’s got a tab down and buying 
                        the whole bar drinks...
                             (holds phone up to bar)
                        Red! Red! Wine! 

           Clay takes his tequila shot and sucks the lime. 

                                 CLAY
                        Wait, wait, this my favorite part. 
                             (breakdown - bad Jamaican 
                              accent)
                        Red red wine you make me feel so 
                        fine keep me rocking’ all of de’ 
                        time...

           The bar chants to the beat as Clay sings. 

                                 EVERYONE IN BAR
                        Clay! Clay! Clay! Clay! Clay! 

           Clay drops to the floor and there is a moment of concern as 
           the people around him shout to clear a path, but when they 
           do: Clay DOLPHIN’S across the floor with perfection. - 
           Everyone cheers! Clay rises and the BARTENDER motions to him. 

                                 CLAY
                        What’s on your mind, sunshine?

                                 BARTENDER
                        I just wanted to let you know, your 
                        tab’s almost at a grand. 

                                 CLAY
                        Good look, but we’re ridin’ this 
                        pony into the sunset.

           BARTENDER: Whatever you say, pal. 

           An explosion of BRIGHT LIGHT fills the bar. Clay turns as 
           everyone moves out to the bar’s packed patio overlooking the 
           lake. FIREWORKS fill the sky. -- People cheer. 

           TWO DRINKS LATER: Clay emerges from the bathroom with a few 
           of the dudes. He is rubbing his nose. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Whoo! That’s some serious cheese!

           The kid nods. One leans into the other. 
                                 KID
                             (discrete)
                        He thinks it’s blow. 

           They shake their heads and laugh. But whatever it is, Clay is 
           feeling it and loving it. 

           FIVE DRINKS LATER: Clay’s at the bar. One of the girls from 
           the car, NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE, is enamored with him.

                                 UNATTRACTIVE GIRL
                        So what were you doing walking by 
                        yourself in the middle of nowhere 
                        on Fourth of July?

                                 CLAY
                             (over-dramatic)
                        I’ve been trying to find and answer 
                        to that question my entire life... 
                        But when I woke up and saw you, I 
                        finally found what I’ve been 
                        looking for. 

                                 UNATTRACTIVE GIRL
                             (heart melts)
                        You’re so mysterious. 

           She shuts her eyes and Clay leans in for a kiss. They make-
           out. The group of DUDES behind Clay see this and: Oooh!

           One of the dudes taps Clay on the shoulder. Clay leans in. 

                                 DUDE 2
                        Pardon the interruption, but I feel 
                        obligated to do you a solid here...
                             (discrete)
                        I think that chick you’re with just 
                        blew some dude in the bathroom. 

           Clay steps back. He thinks and nods. 

                                 CLAY
                        Thanks for the heads up, brother. 

                                 DUDE 2
                        No doubt. 

           They fist-pound and Clay turns right back around and moves in 
           for another kiss. The dudes are speechless. 

                                 DUDE 2 (CONT’D)
                        This guy’s a legend! 
           LAST CALL: The bar empties as Clay whispers sweet nothings to 
           the girl. He’s no longer wearing a shirt. 

                                 UNATTRACTIVE GIRL
                             (excuses herself)
                        I’ll be right back and then we’ll 
                        go. 

                                 CLAY
                        Right on. 

           She walks to the bathroom. Clay’s new posse comes over. 

                                 DUDE 3
                        Yo. There’s a bon-fire party at our 
                        boy’s house... Apparently they have 
                        mad shrooms.

                                 CLAY
                        Word. Let’s roll. 

           And without even looking back to the bathroom, he leaves. 

           EXT. CABIN ON LAKE - NIGHT

           It’s an old A-FRAME WOODEN CABIN with a huge BON-FIRE 
           overlooking the lake. A JEEP pulls up Clay hops out of the 
           back with the dudes. 

                                 CLAY
                             (looks around)
                        Who’s got the boomers?

           TWO HOURS INTO SHROOMING: A massive bongo-drum circle has 
           formed as Clay sits wide-eyed looking around and talking to a 
           TRIPPING DUDE.

                                 TRIPPING DUDE
                        So, like this whole land is sacred 
                        Indian ground. There were 
                        warriors... battles... The souls of 
                        the Mohawk are all around us. Can 
                        you feel it?

           Clay looks around... As his vision trails on the kids 
           dancing, his mind’s eye transforms them into ACTUAL INDIANS 
           dancing around the fire. 

                                 CLAY
                        I can feel it. 
           THREE HOURS INTO SHROOMING: The bon-fire is fading, and the 
           vibe is chilling, but Clay is PEAKING as he sits in (what 
           looks like) some kind of “trust-circle”. A TRIPPING GIRL 
           holds a candle. 

                                 TRIPPING GIRL
                             (heady)
                        ...that’s when I realized that John 
                        Lennon was right... All you need is 
                        love... love is all you need. 

           She passes the candle to Clay in ceremonial fashion. 

                                 TRIPPING GIRL (CONT’D)
                        What about you, Clay? Do you 
                        believe in love?

           Clay stares into the candle’s flame... His eyes widen... He 
           pulls some grass from the ground and rubs it on his face. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        Oh, shit man. He’s bugging. 
                             (hands bottle of wine)
                        It’s all good. Sip this... It’ll 
                        help contain your restless spirit. 

           Clay takes the wine, puts it to his lips, tilts back and 
           downs like two glasses. Whoa. 

                                 DUDE 1 (CONT’D)
                        You are so official. 

           Clay nods. He looks back into the candle. 

                                 CLAY
                        I think I’ve finally found love... 
                        but I’m running away from it. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        You gotta’ run towards that shit.

                                 CLAY
                        I’ve gotta’ run towards it...
                             (nods)
                        I’ve gotta’ run towards it...

           He looks over into the window of the A-Frame house. Above the 
           fire-place, an ANTIQUE WOODEN CANOE is mounted- as well as an 
           assortment of Native American art and artifacts. 

           Clay gets up and walks towards the house. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        Where you going, man?
                                 CLAY
                        Towards it. 

                                 TRIPPING GIRL
                        That’s so beautiful. 

           Clay enters the house and his tribe follows after him. He 
           climbs up onto the fire-place and grabs the canoe. 

                                 DUDE 3
                             (moment of clarity)
                        Whoa, wait. That’s my parent’s 
                        expensive shit!

                                 TRIPPING GIRL
                             (calms)
                        This is bigger than your parents, 
                        Jeremy... Let it be. 

           Clay lifts the DECORATIVE CANOE, about half the size of a 
           conventional canoe, and drops it to the floor. He takes a 
           huge sip of wine and sizes up the LEATHER INDIAN SKIRT and 
           MOCCASSINS encased in glass on the wall. 

                                 CLAY
                        Warrior.
                             (turns to kids)
                        Warrior. 

           He takes a moment to size-up how to get inside before 
           realizing that punching the glass is the best way: Crash!

                                 DUDE 3
                             (covers eyes)
                        What is happening right now?

                                 DUDE 1
                        I don’t know. But I’m starting to 
                        freak. 

           Clay takes the skirt and moccasins into another room. 

           NOT TOO LONG LATER: The sun rises over the lake. The gang 
           looks out in amazement. 

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        I’m ready. 

           They turn. Bugged-out laughter: Oh - my - God. 

           Clay stands with a crudely shaved mohawk, dressed only in the 
           leather dress and moccasins. 
                                 TRIPPING GIRL
                        Wait. 

           She reaches into her purse, removes lip-stick and applies it 
           under his eyes and down nose. War paint. 

                                 CLAY
                        I want you to be the one that 
                        marries us. 

                                 TRIPPING GIRL
                             (verge of tears)
                        I would be honored. 

           Clay stumbles outside and looks out over the lake. He points 
           to a FAMILIAR HOUSE: The Clarks.

                                 CLAY
                        Journey. 

           The dudes look at each other. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        I love you, dude. But this is your 
                        journey now. 

           EXT. CLARK’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The front door opens and Joyce Clark walks out with her 
           gardening tools. 

           EXT. A-FRAME HOUSE - MORNING

           Clay pushes the small canoe into the lake and gets in. He 
           sits in the middle and starts paddling, taking breaks to 
           drink his wine. 

           The dudes stand on the porch and shake their heads. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        This guy is on auto-pilot like I’ve 
                        never fucking seen. 

                                 DUDE 2
                        Where does he think he’s going?

                                 DUDE 3
                        I’ve got a telescope inside. 

           LAKE: Clay is almost to shore as he paddles with 
           determination across the small lake. 
           A-FRAME PORCH: Dude is looking through telescope. 

                                 DUDE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Oh - my - God. 

           Through the POV of the scope, Clay makes land-fall. He 
           finishes the wine, stumbles out and drops the bottle. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        What is it?

                                 DUDE 3
                             (worried)
                        He’s going up to the Clark’s house. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        What!?

           Clay approaches Mrs. Clark as her neighbor motions towards 
           him with concern. She turns... Clay?

                                 DUDE 3
                        This is not good. This is not good 
                        at all...
                             (startled)
                        Oh, shit! There’s Mr. Clark! 

           The other dude grabs the telescope and looks. 

                                 DUDE 1
                        He is not a happy camper. 

           Through the TELESCOPE we see Clay get drilled. 

                                 DUDE 1 (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhhh!

                                 DUDE 2
                        What happened?

           Clay’s head smashes the GARDEN GNOME.

                                 DUDE 1
                        He just got dropped by Mr. Clark! - 
                        I don’t think he’s moving... I 
                        don’t think he’s moving... Dude, I 
                        think he’s dead. 

           FADE TO BLACK.

                                 DUDE 1 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I am never eating mushrooms again. 

           The sound of MEDICAL EQUIPMENT BEEPING. 
                                31 HOURS LATER

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - FADE IN - DAY

           Clay sits on the edge of the hospital bed. His mohawked head 
           buried in his hands. He looks up to reveal stitches on his 
           cheek, a swelled jaw and a black eye. -- A DOCTOR stands over 
           him looking at his chart. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        So you have no recollection of how 
                        you got here?

                                 CLAY
                        The last thing I remember was 
                        getting hit by a car and going to 
                        the Mohawk Tavern.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (shocked)
                        Wait, you were hit by a car? - When 
                        was this?

                                 CLAY
                        Yesterday, I think... maybe around 
                        7. It was still light out. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        And you didn’t go to the hospital?

                                 CLAY
                        It just felt like a bad hockey 
                        check. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well that might explain the 
                        concussion a bit more, but it could 
                        have come from any number of 
                        things...
                             (reaches for something)
                        We extracted this from the side of 
                        your face. 

           Doc holds up the smiling head of the GARDEN GNOME.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You fell on this after Mr. Clark 
                        struck you upon your attempt to 
                        enter his residence.

                                 CLAY
                        What?
                                 DOCTOR
                        The Clark’s have dropped the 
                        trespassing charge, but your blood-
                        alcohol content Mr. Mason...
                             (no-nonsense)
                        Was near lethal. - With an 
                        extraordinary level of psilocybin 
                        and traces of methamphetamine.

           Clay is speechless and noticeably scared. 

                                 CLAY
                        Meth?

                                 DOCTOR
                             (nods)
                        We got a hold of your father--

                                 CLAY
                        Wait, my father knows about this?

                                 DOCTOR
                        He’s on a flight back from Santa Fe 
                        as we speak. 

           Clay stares into space. The Doc closes his chart. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Clark is here now and wants to 
                        have a word--

                                 CLAY
                        What?

                                 DOCTOR
                        He’s the one that admitted you. If 
                        you’re not ready for a visitor, I 
                        can--

           Clay shakes his head. Thinks for a moment. Nervous. 

                                 CLAY
                        Fuck it. Let’s get this over with. 

           The Doc nods and walks out. Clay turns when he hears 
           footsteps that stop at his door. He turns. Sees Robert. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Clark, I have no idea what--

                                 ROBERT
                        Shut up and listen. 
                             (stern)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        I don’t live my daughter’s life for 
                        her and I’m not gonna’ live yours 
                        for you. 
                             (a beat)
                        But I will end yours if you ever 
                        take another drink and go anywhere 
                        near her. - Do you hear me?

                                 CLAY
                        Robert, whatever happened, I can 
                        assure you--

                                 ROBERT
                        I will find you and I will end you. 

           Clay swallows nervously. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t think it’s gonna’ come 
                        to that, because you’ve already got 
                        one foot in the grave... 
                             (he takes a few steps 
                              closer)
                        Look at yourself, son. 

           Clay turns and catches his CONTORTED REFLECTION in a PAPER-
           TOWEL DISPENSER. His blood-shot eyes beneath the mohawk... 
           The strand of stitches across his face, swollen lip and eye. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got a serious problem that’s 
                        gonna’ kill you if you don’t do 
                        something about it... And you might 
                        take more than a garden gnome along 
                        with you. 

           Clay exhales as he looks at his reflection. He turns. 

                                 CLAY
                        Why do you care?

                                 ROBERT
                        Because after talking to your 
                        father, I’ve got a feeling that 
                        nobody else does. 

           A beat. Robert swallows and nods. Sincere. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been there, Clay... and in 
                        much worse shape than you. 
                             (he swallows)
                        Didn’t Holly ever tell you why she 
                        doesn’t drink? 
           Clay now realizes why: Whoa. He nods. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Get your ass into rehab. 

           Robert puts his hat on and walks out. Clay buries his face in 
           his hands. 

                                 CLAY
                        Jesus Christ. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - THE NEXT DAY

           A BLACK BMW speeds up to the hospital and skids. Jack Mason 
           gets out and races inside wearing a Santa Fe motif jean-shirt
           and cowboy hat. 

           INT. CLAY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Clay sits in bed, his head now completely shaved, as he eats 
           lunch in silence staring out the window. Jack enters. 

                                 JACK
                        I got here as quickly as I could. 
                             (takes note of stitches 
                              and black eye)
                        Goodness gracious. That’s the last 
                        time I leave you alone on Fourth of 
                        July. 

           Jack races over and hugs him. He’s at a loss for words as he 
           examines Clay’s condition. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                             (looks around)
                        Detox unit, huh? What the hell 
                        happened? 

                                 CLAY
                        I don’t know - And to be honest, 
                        I’m getting a little tired of not 
                        having an answer to that question. 

                                 JACK
                        Well we can talk about it in the 
                        car. - We’ll get back to the 
                        homestead... throw some steaks on 
                        the grill and put this little bump 
                        in the road behind us. Whataya’
                        say, kiddo?
           Clay lowers his head. Thinks for a moment and turns to Jack. 

                                 CLAY
                        I say for a consultant, you give 
                        pretty shitty advice. 

           Jack is stunned. 

                                 JACK
                        Come on. We’ve seen tougher times 
                        than this--

                                 CLAY
                        Yeah, we have. And you know what we 
                        do about it? 
                             (a beat)
                        We whip up a hi-ball and laugh it 
                        off like it never happened.

                                 JACK
                        We don’t let the bastards get us 
                        down, Clay. What the hell’s gotten 
                        into you? 

           He picks up the garden gnomes head. 

                                 CLAY
                        This has gotten into me. It was 
                        jammed into my face, Dad! And I 
                        don’t even remember it. 
                             (he thinks)
                        A few inches higher and we might 
                        not be having this conversation at 
                        all. 
                             (stands up, passionate)
                        Two inches. - Two inches and you 
                        might have been down a son and a 
                        wife. 

           This hits Jack hard. He takes a step back and thinks.

                                 JACK
                        I’m sorry, Clay... 
                             (he thinks)
                        All I ever want is for us to be 
                        happy. - I guess it’s been a while 
                        since I’ve had someone around to 
                        teach me how I’m supposed to do 
                        that. 

           Clay nods. 

                                 CLAY
                        Me too. 
           INT. REHABILITATION CLINIC - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY

           Clay sits in a circle-discussion. He’s not ready for any of 
           this. There are all kinds of people at the clinic and it 
           appears to be a high-end facility. 

           A PREPPY GUY is talking in the circle- someone you’d never 
           expect to see in rehab. His hair is parted over, completely 
           covering his fore-head. 

                                 PREPPY GUY
                        ...but it was never a problem. I 
                        never hit my kids. I never cheated 
                        on my wife. A paid my taxes on time 
                        and even managed to coach my 
                        daughter’s tennis team. 
                             (a beat)
                        And then one morning my son woke me 
                        up on the couch and I had this
                        tattooed on my forehead. 

           He pulls his hair back to reveal a CRUDE TATTOO of an UPSIDE-
           DOWN CROSS on his forehead. There are moans and inhales of 
           shock from the group. Clay’s eyes widen: Nicely done.  

                                 PREPPY GUY (CONT’D)
                        The last thing I remember was 
                        having drinks at the club in 
                        Westchester. 

           It’s Clay’s turn. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Clay, are you ready to share 
                        something?

           Clay thinks... looks around and shakes his head, no.

           INT. CLAY’S DORM ROOM - DAY

           He’s sitting up in bed, looking at the phone trying to work 
           up the courage to make this call. 

           INT. MITCHELL’S OFFICE AT NEW YORKER - DAY

           Mitch is at his desk, typing. His assistant chimes in. 

                                 ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                             (intercom)
                        I have Clay on line one. 

           Mitchell picks up the phone, livid. 
                                 MITCHELL
                        You’d better be writing one hell of 
                        a piece on the Mohawk Tavern! 
                             (looks at memo)
                        Accounting just sent me a memo 
                        about a five-thousand dollar 
                        expense? - I hope you had a damn 
                        good time, because that’s the last--

                                 CLAY
                        Mitch, I’m in rehab. 

           A beat. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Rehab? - What happened?

           Clay looks out as the sun shines brightly into his room. 

                                 CLAY
                        The sun was shining all the time. 

           Mitchell remembers their chat. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Christ, I... are you OK? 

                                 CLAY
                        I’m not sure how I am, or who I am 
                        for that matter. I haven’t been 
                        three days sober since I was 
                        eighteen.
                             (a beat)
                        All I know is I don’t think I’m 
                        coming back to New York anytime 
                        soon. 

           Mitchell nods. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Whatever you need. I’m here. 

           INT. COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           A counselor talks to Clay. Clay has two weeks growth of hair. 
           His wounds are subsiding. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Nobody’s going to force you to talk 
                        here.
                             (looks into file)
                        But I see here that you’re a 
                        writer.
                                 CLAY
                        Hardly. I scribble notes and drunk 
                        wise-cracks on bar napkins that get 
                        strung together by an editor who 
                        likes having a drinking buddy 
                        during lunch. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Well try scribbling some sober wise-
                        cracks. You need to do something to 
                        communicate how you’re feeling... 
                        even if it’s only to yourself. 

           Clay nods. 

           INT. CLAY’S DORM ROOM - DAY

           Clay’s at his desk. There are some papers scattered around as 
           he writes. THE GARDEN GNOME sits atop a page as a paper-
           weight. 

           A counselor enters. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Hey Clay. Here’s that TV schedule 
                        you asked me about. 

           Clay takes it. 

                                 CLAY
                        Thanks. 

           INT. TV LOUNGE - DAY

           Clay is watching Danny Montaine’s cooking show “Montaine’s
           Flame”. Danny is a flaming gay “bear” cooking host. Holly is 
           next to him. She feeds him a bite of a danish. He makes a 
           growling sound like a grizzly bear as he chews. 

                                 DANNY
                        Girl, that is so effin’ delish, 
                        there is only one word I can think 
                        to describe it and I think you all
                        know what that is. Audience?

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Blizam!

           The camera is on Holly who is laughing. Clay smiles as the 
           camera zooms in on her shaking her head at the absurdity of 
           it all. She plays along. 
                                 HOLLY
                             (to audience)
                        A little effin’ louder!

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Blizam!

                                 HOLLY
                        I still can’t hear you!

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Blizam!

                                 HOLLY
                        One more effin’ time for the folks 
                        at home!

           Clay leans in and joins.

                                 CLAY
                        Blizam!

           Rehab people turn. A BLACK SECURITY GUARD comes in, 
           concerned, but sees everything is cool. Looks at TV. 

                                 BLACK SECURITY GUARD
                        Oh, blizam! I love Montaine’s
                        Flame.
                             (notices Holly)
                        Damn. I’d like to blend her batter. 

                                 CLAY
                             (laughs, looks around)
                        Dude, chill. There’s sex-addicts 
                        here. 
                             (lowers voice)
                        But between you and me, I have. 

                                 BLACK SECURITY GUARD
                        With her?
                             (cool black-guy impressed)
                        For reals? You still up in that?

           Clay looks around like it’s the most obvious answer. 

                                 CLAY
                        Uh, I’m in rehab. 

           The security guy laughs. 

                                 BLACK SECURITY GUARD
                        No sleep ‘til Brooklyn, baby- 
                        that’s why you’re here... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLACK SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        get your shit straight, you’ll get 
                        up in that ass again. 

           Clay laughs... looks around the facility. 

                                 CLAY
                        You fuckin’ rule, dude. 

           They fist-pound. The first great laugh he’s had in a while. 

           INT. CLAY’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           About a month of hair. He’s writing more in his journal and 
           notes and papers plaster his wall. He’s getting into it. 
           He’ll write something and leans back... he’ll laugh. 

           INT. GROUP SESSION - DAY

           A patient is finishing up. 

                                 PATIENT
                             (inspired tears)
                        ...but I think I’m finally ready to 
                        face tomorrow and try again. 

           Everyone claps. It’s Clay’s turn. The counselor doesn’t 
           expect anything, but he has to try. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Clay?

           Clay gathers his thoughts and leans forward, resting his 
           elbows on his knees. 

                                 CLAY
                        You know, I’ve been sitting here 
                        for a month now and I’ve kept my 
                        mouth shut because, in all 
                        honesty... my problems are an 
                        insult to rehab. 
                             (turns to upside-down 
                              cross guy)
                        I mean, you have kids.
                             (turns to petite woman)
                        And you killed someone. 
                             (a beat)
                        Here’s what I got: My mom died when 
                        I was a kid. Yeah, it sucked. And 
                        my father dealt with it by being 
                        more of a good-bud than a father 
                        figure. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLAY (CONT'D)
                        It aint sexy, but I suppose it 
                        paves a road that could lead me 
                        here. 
                             (a beat, he looks around)
                        But you wanna’ know my real 
                        breakthrough here? 
                             (he leans in, chuckles)
                        I love catchin’ a buzz. 

           Some slight laughter. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Well you must have regrets.

                                 CLAY
                        Sure I do. - But there’s a lot more 
                        that I don’t regret. 

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Such as?

                                 CLAY
                        Such as, the time I came-to in the 
                        middle of South Carolina in a New 
                        York City taxi... and the look on 
                        my friend’s face when I got out of 
                        that same cab onto Bourbon Street. 
                             (laughter)
                        Or the time I got so bent with 
                        Steven Tyler at a bar on the Lower 
                        East Side and then read in the 
                        paper the next day that he’d 
                        checked into rehab.
                             (impressed laughter)
                        And I definitely don’t regret 
                        whatever happened the night that 
                        got me here, because I know damn 
                        well that they’re telling stories 
                        at the Mohawk Tavern about the guy 
                        who expensed a five-G bar-tab to 
                        his corporate account. 
                             (a beat)
                        I love that shit.

           The counselor is about to make a point, but Clay stops him. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        But you know what? - That’s all I 
                        am. I’m nothing more than a funny 
                        story that people like to tell. 

           There’s a slight crack in his voice. He coughs it out. 
                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        I finally met this girl that I 
                        think wanted to be part of my real 
                        story, but I was too scared that 
                        without being the outrageous mess, 
                        there wasn’t a whole lot left to 
                        tell. 
                             (a beat)
                        And I was right. There isn’t. - But 
                        I think the good news is, I get to 
                        start from scratch and find out who 
                        the hell I really am. - And that’s 
                        my only option. 

           He looks around the clinic. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        If I end up back here in a few 
                        months or a few years, it better be 
                        for something like the rest of you 
                        have gone through. Because if not, 
                        the only story that people are 
                        going to be telling about me...
                             (a beat)
                        Is what a pathetic loser I am. 

           INT. MITCHELL’S OFFICE AT NEW YORKER - DAY

           Mitchell is working. 

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        Liquid lunch?

           Mitchell perks up. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Mace! Holy shit! You look...
                             (searches for right words)
                        Rested. It’s making me a little 
                        nervous. 

           Camera turns on Clay. He does. His hair is short and tight. 
           He’s got a healthy glow and even dropped a few pounds. They 
           hug. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                             (looks at watch)
                        I’d love to be your first enabler, 
                        but I’m already late for a lunch 
                        with Shepard Fairey.
                                 CLAY
                        No worries. I just came to drop 
                        this off. 

           He hands him a manilla envelope. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        What is this, your manifesto?

                                 CLAY
                        It’s my piece on the Mohawk Tavern. 
                        Sorry it’s late. 

                                 MITCHELL
                             (examines)
                        This better be a million dollar 
                        story.

                                 CLAY
                        More like five-thousand. 

                                 MITCHELL
                             (laughs)
                        You know we took that out of your 
                        severance, right?

                                 CLAY
                             (nods)
                        I saw that. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Fuck it. Most of the best writers 
                        at this rag have been hired and 
                        fired half a dozen times... I hope 
                        I can welcome you back soon. 

                                 CLAY
                        Well I don’t think I should do bars 
                        and restaurants for a while. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Oh, don’t worry. You won’t be. 

           They laugh. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                        So what’s the plan?

                                 CLAY
                             (considers)
                        Right now the plan is to find a 
                        plan. 

           Mitch nods.
                                 MITCHELL
                        Well make it quick. I’m hard 
                        pressed to find company that 
                        doesn’t shit when I reach for that 
                        third martini at lunch. 

                                 CLAY
                        You’re a sick bastard. 

           Mitch laughs and slaps him on the arm. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        It’s good to see you, pal. 

           Clay nods and watches Mitch walk down the hall. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT’D)
                             (turns)
                        By the way, Andrea was asking about 
                        you.

                                 CLAY
                        Oh yeah?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Yeah. We’re having a party next 
                        weekend out at our beach house.
                             (Clay lights up)
                        She wanted the number of that 
                        catering company you used for 
                        Fourth of July... ‘think you could 
                        fax that over to me when you get a 
                        sec?

           Mitch laughs and Clay nods, chummy laughter. He turns to 
           Mitch’s assistant and shakes his head.

                                 CLAY
                        You know what I just realized for 
                        the first time?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        What?

           A beat. Clay watches Mitchell walk out. 

                                 CLAY
                        Mitchell kinda’ sucks. 

           Everyone within’ earshot laughs. 

           Clay shakes his head and leaves. 
                                 SECRETARY
                             (to friend, impressed)
                        Clay looks good. 

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           Mitchell sits in the cab and removes the document. “THE LONG 
           WALK TO THE MOHAWK TAVERN” by Clay Mason. Mitch chuckles as 
           he reads the first few lines: My name is Clay Mason and I’m 
           an alcoholic. It’s taken me my entire life to say those nine 
           simple words, but sometimes the simplest words are the 
           hardest to say. 

           Mitchell continues reading. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. THE COOK SHOP - DAY

           Clay stands across the street looking over at the bakery. 
           Business is booming and he smiles as he watches Holly talking 
           to customers and them laughing at what she’s saying. 

           He takes a deep breath, about to walk over, but shakes his 
           head, no. 

                                 CLAY
                        I’m gonna’ need a drink for this.  

           INT. READE STREET PUB - DAY

           The door opens and Clay walks in. The neighborhood drunks all 
           perk up and nod. 

           An Irish bartender smiles. 

                                 IRISH BARTENDER
                        Clayton! We were just havin’ a 
                        laugh about you. - Jamison?

           Clay thinks. He pulls out his wallet. 

                                 CLAY
                        Nope. Just came to close out my 
                        tab. 

                                 IRISH BARTENDER
                        Where the hell ‘you off to?

           Clay looks out the window. The first falling leaves of Autumn 
           flurry past the window. 
                                 CLAY
                        That’s a good question. 

           The bartender nods. He walks behind the register and fishes 
           through the unpaid tabs... retrieves Clay’s and then 
           another... and another. The bartender tears them up. 

                                 IRISH BARTENDER
                        You’re all paid up, Clayton. We’ll 
                        call it even for the memories. 

           Fair enough. Clay opens his wallet and takes out a c-note. He 
           puts it on the bar. 

                                 IRISH BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell’s that?

                                 CLAY
                        For all the time’s I forgot to 
                        leave a tip. 

                                 IRISH BARTENDER
                             (laughs)
                        Oh, I’m afraid I’ll have to get 
                        back to you with a final figure on 
                        that, my friend.

           Clay laughs. He knocks his knuckles on the bill.

                        Well then at least buy these guys a 
                        few rounds on me...

           The bartender nods and pours shots for all the bar-flies. 
           Clay watches the Jamison empty into the glasses like it’s a 
           beautiful woman undressing. He laughs. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. I’m definately gonna’ need a 
                        drink for this. 

           He shakes his head and waves to everyone. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Cheers, fellas.

           Clay walks out.

                        He’ll be back...

           The bartender watches Clay walk past the window. He has an 
           all-knowing look in his eye as he dries a pint glass with a 
           bar-rag.

           EXT. JACK MASON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jack is sitting on the front porch, his legs crossed as he 
           reads the paper and sips a beer. 

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        You need to get your priorities in 
                        order, Dad. This porch looks like 
                        shit.

           Jack is startled. He puts the beer down and gets up, thrilled 
           to greet Clay who is examining the chipped paint. 

                                 JACK
                        It’s good to see you, Clay. 

           He walks over and they hug. Jack looks at Clay’s bags. He’s a 
           little overwhelmed. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Are you dropping those off? Do you 
                        have time for a, uh... what’s going 
                        on? Are you out of that clinic 
                        there? Are you going back? What’s 
                        the...

           Clay looks around and over at his dad’s beer. He takes a 
           breath, the kind that says this isn’t going to be easy, but 
           this is home. 

                                 CLAY
                        If it’s alright with you, I thought 
                        I might stay here for a while... 
                        you know...
                             (looks at chipped paint, 
                              and then at his Dad)
                        Fix some things around the house. 

           Jack nods and smiles. He hugs Clay again and holds it. 

                                 JACK
                        That’s terrific. - That’s just 
                        great news, Clay.
                             (slight tears, sincere)
                        That is great news, son.

           Jack and Clay stand over the grill, cooking steaks.

                             (uncomfortable)
                        So, you know, Jeter’s lookin’ good,

                        can handle Tampa Bay’s--

           Clay laughs. 

                                 CLAY
                        Jesus Christ, Dad. Go grab a beer. 

                                 JACK
                             (half-smiles, relieved)
                        You sure?

                                 CLAY
                        I’ve gotta’ learn to deal with this 
                        sooner or later... but listening to 
                        anymore of your sober Yankee stats
                        is gonna’ make me relapse. 

           Jack laughs. He walks inside, but stops. He smiles. 

                                 JACK
                        You know what, Clay? If Yankee 
                        stats is all I got sober, then I 
                        think we both have a lot of work to 
                        do. 

           He walks back over to the grill. The camera pulls back slowly 
           on them. It’s awkward, but we get a feeling that one turn-
           over of a steak at a time, they’re gonna’ make it work. 

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        So what the hell were you thinking 
                        charging some broad’s house dressed 
                        as a Comanche Indian?

           The first snow starts to fall as a few bar patrons sit and 
           drink at the Mohawk. A LOCAL walks in, reading an open 
           magazine, and shaking his head in disbelief.

           The local chuckles. He opens the magazine to a feature story.

           She smiles. 

                                 HOLLY
                        Your piece on meditation in India’s 
                        nursery schools was hilarious... 

           The camera starts to pull back and up on them talking. 

                                 CLAY
                        I genuinely loved the meditation 
                        and considered staying, but it’s 
                        kinda’ hard to maintain your chi in 
                        India when most of it ends up in 
                        the toilet. 

           She laughs and the camera pulls back further up over Sag 
           Harbor and the village.

                        So is my head-shot still up?

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        That’s actually why I was stopping 
                        by... I wanted to see if you had a 
                        few more for the new shops.

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        I think there’s a few collecting 
                        dust in the attic...

                        can’t dig some up?

           A beat. 

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        I really shouldn’t. I’ve got a 
                        really bad nap-hangover.

                                 CLAY (O.S.)
                        I know that feeling. 

           Credits roll over boats pulling in and out of Sag Harbor. 

           The sun is shining brightly.

           --Clay is trashed at the bar of a really quaint respectable 
           restaurant. The bartender is actually laughing, until:

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Have you ev’r see Phantom of the 
                        opera?

                                 BARTENDER 
                        It’s been a while. Why?

                                 CLAY
                        This’s my favorite part. 

           Clay stands on his stool, jumps across the room, onto a 
           chandelier and rips it down, crashing onto a dinner table. 

           --Commuters are waiting for an NYC Subway. They shrug when 
           they see it’s an express-train bypassing their stop, but all 
           look up when they hear a man screaming - The train flies 
           past, and Clay is hanging on to the back in his boxers:

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Whoo hoo! Comin’ through!!!  

           Mixture of horror and “only in New Yawk” awe from waiting 
           commuters as they watch Clay disappear into the dark tunnel.  

           --An Airplane stewardess stops suddenly as she pushes her 
           snack-cart down the aisle. 

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Oh my God. 

           She turns to the stewardess behind her. 
                                 STEWARDESS 2
                        What?

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Oh my God. 

           Stewardess one points to Clay. He is conked out in his aisle-
           seat, head back, snoring. She points to his pants. There is 
           rapidly growing dark wet stain forming in the lap of his 
           khakis. -- The Stewardess nudges him. 

                                 STEWARDESS (CONT’D)
                        Sir... Sir...

                                 CLAY
                             (comes to, delirious)
                        Oh. Hey.
                             (looks down at empty cup 
                              on his tray, holds it up)
                        Could I get another screw-driver?

           --A group of civilized people are grilling in their back yard 
           and Clay rips through their hedges, trashed, naked, in a golf-
           cart. They scream.  

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                        Anyone seen a white ball? 

           He stops, looks around for one second, hits the gas and exits 
           through the other hedges. 

           We hear the family next-door scream. 

                                 CLAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Anyone seen a white ball?

           --Clay and Steven Tyler, beyond wasted, arms around each-
           other, singing drunkenly over the juke-box. Clay has one of 
           Steven’s scarves around his head. 

                                 CLAY/STEVEN TYLER
                        You’re my annnnnnnngel. Come and 
                        save me toniggggggght.

           --Clay is swimming, floating on his back, doing a relaxed 
           back-stroke and smiling, basking in the sun. The camera moves 
           back, up over the water, revealing the STATUE OF LIBERTY. 

           --Clay funneling beers with the kids on the way to the Mohawk 
           Tavern...

           --Clay storms into the Mohawk Tavern... directly to the bar 
           and slams down the his card.
                                 CLAY
                        Drinks - on me. 
                             (motions around bar)
                        For everyone. 

           The crowd around him churns with disbelief. He raises the 
           first shot. 

                                 CLAY (CONT’D)
                             (to bar)
                        You’re gonna’ remember this night.

           The camera moves out of the bar and over the lake as 
           FIREWORKS EXPLODE OVER THE SKY.

           JOHNNY NASH: Bright, bright, bright... sunshiny day. 

           THE END.
