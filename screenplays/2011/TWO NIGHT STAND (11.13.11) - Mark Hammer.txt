                                                               FADE IN:

           INT.  MEGAN'S APARTMENT - BROOKLYN, NY - NIGHT

           We follow a trail of chocolate advent calendars marked with 
           clearance stickers to... MEGAN, 22.  She’s pretty, but what’s 
           most striking is the mind-boggling way she lies on her couch.

           Her legs are over the back of the couch, her back’s where her 
           butt should be and her head’s twisted to watch tv.  Her 
           macbook’s on her stomach as she clicks through gossip blogs.  

           Multi-tasking laziness is an art form she’s nearly perfected.

           She hears a KEY IN THE FRONT DOOR so she shuts her laptop, 
           turns off the tv, and grabs a random novel to be reading as--

           Her roommate FAIZA, 22, enters.  Faiza’s gorgeous, wearing 
           chic business attire with her hair up in a messy bun - messy 
           only because she’s been at work since 7am.

                                 FAIZA
                        Aw, right where I left you.  How...  
                        adorable.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Ya’ caught me red-handed.  I’m a 
                        sucker for the American novel.  I 
                        won’t apologize for it.

           Faiza audibly sighs.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Bad day?  

                                 FAIZA
                        I’m just exhausted.  

           Megan rises from the couch for the first time in hours and 
           stretches her arms on the way to the kitchen.   

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, me too...  

           Faiza grits her teeth - weighs not saying anything...  

                                 FAIZA
                        I’m sorry but what the fuck could 
                        you possibly be exhausted from?

           Megan playfully ducks behind the kitchen island like she’s 
           being bombarded with incoming fire.  
                                 MEGAN
                        Whoa!  Not-so-friendly fire!  
                        I would love to be busy.  I’m like 
                        that 4th grader two months into 
                        summer vacation who just wants 
                        school to start again.  Except that 
                        it never ever will...  Ever again.  

           Megan grabs a gogurt from the fridge and plops on the couch, 
           while Faiza hurries around changing out of work clothes, 
           opening mail, and scribbling utilities checks.

                                 FAIZA
                        Perhaps it’s time to get a job.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re telling me...

                                 FAIZA
                        Yes.  I am telling you.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Hey!  I look for fulfilling work 
                        all the time.  I just happen to be 
                        taking a break whenever you walk 
                        in.  It’s a curse...  like studying 
                        when mom’s watching.  

                                 FAIZA
                        Do you find it creepy that you’re a 
                        child in all your metaphors?  

                                 MEGAN
                        I didn’t before now...

                                 FAIZA
                        Did you make a decision on the 
                        lease?  Deadline’s on the first.

                                 MEGAN
                        I didn’t get around to a decision 
                        yet.  I’m stewing though.  I am.  

                                 FAIZA
                        How did you not get around to it?  
                        What did you do today?

           Megan is stumped.

                                 FAIZA (CONT’D)
                        How about this week?  

                                 MEGAN
                        I did Christmas.
                                 FAIZA
                             (not accepting the answer)
                        This month?  

                                 MEGAN
                             (with gravitas)
                        I graduated college.  Is that 
                        impressive enough or do you want 
                        something bigger?

                                 FAIZA
                        That was two months ago.  I know 
                        because I did it too.  I’m talking 
                        since then.  Have you done anything 
                        since then?  Anything at all?

                                 MEGAN
                        I started online dating.  

                                 FAIZA
                        Seriously?  I’m actually proud of 
                        you.  Back on the horse.  Have you 
                        met anyone?

                                 MEGAN
                        I said I started.  I’m not a 
                        machine.  

           Faiza gives up on the conversation and goes into her bedroom.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Also I feel very strongly about 
                        going dutch on principle but I 
                        don’t have the money for it so 
                        online dating is more of an 
                        intellectual exercise at this 
                        point.  

                                 FAIZA (O.S.)
                        Good luck with that.  

           Faiza returns.  In the time Megan has eaten half a small 
           yogurt, Faiza transformed from work mode to night-life mode.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Where are you going?  You just got 
                        home!

                                 FAIZA
                        I’m going to a thing with Cedric.  
                        I think it’s for the best so I 
                        don’t domestic-violence you in your 
                        sleep.    
                                 MEGAN
                        ...hey, that’s not nice.  

           Faiza grabs her coat and heads for the door.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        So...  I guess you’re...  not 
                        making dinner then?

           No words to express Faiza’s frustration so she holds out her 
           hand like a symbolic gun aimed at Megan’s head.  Megan 
           reaches for Faiza’s hand and turns it sideways so it’s 
           gangster-style.  Megan then nods, resigned to her fate.  
           Faiza can’t pull the imaginary trigger.  

                                 FAIZA
                             (giving in)
                        One of Cedric's friends is having a 
                        birthday thing at this bar.  
                        They’re having an appetizers/drinks 
                        special.  Do you want to come?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Ooo is it tapas?  I’ve always read 
                        about tapas and they really seem 
                        like something I’d be into!

                                 FAIZA
                        I have no idea.  What I do know, is 
                        that the birthday boy is single.  
                        He’s not the brightest but he’s 
                        pretty.  Perfect candidate for a 
                        one night stand.

                                 MEGAN
                        Do you think I’m ready for a one 
                        night stand?

                                 FAIZA
                        Who cares if you’re ready?  I’m 
                        ready for you to have one.  I mean, 
                        how long’s it been?  Aren’t you 
                        horny?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah...  But I’m also really lazy 
                        so they counteract each other like 
                        two wizards fighting...

                                 FAIZA
                             (tossing her a coat)
                        Tonight’s the night, baby.  Let’s 
                        get you laid.
           Off Megan’s face, excitement building...

           INT.  CEDRIC'S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Faiza’s boyfriend CEDRIC drives, looking miserable but 
           exchanging a polite smile to Megan -- in the backseat, 
           bopping her head, excited to be out of the apartment for a 
           change.  She pre-games from a flask and tries to pass it to 
           Faiza and Cedric...  both decline.  

           EXT.  HIP BAR - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

           A line outside a hip, hopping bar.  Faiza, Cedric, and Megan 
           reach the BOUNCER, who lets Faiza and Cedric through but 
           stops Megan:

                                 BOUNCER
                        ID?

                                 MEGAN
                        Seriously?  I’m a girl!

                                 BOUNCER
                        You look young.  Take it like a 
                        compliment.  C’mon, there’s a line.

                                 FAIZA
                        Just show him your ID.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine.  

           Megan digs through her purse, then her face goes sour.  Hmmm.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        So funny story...

                                 FAIZA
                        How’d you lose your ID again?  You 
                        don’t go anywhere!

                                 MEGAN
                             (rapid fire)
                        I had it out because this website 
                        needed it to sign up to be an 
                        ordained minister and I thought, 
                        there’s a job I could do, helping 
                        people find spiritual guidance 
                        through hard times.  But then I got 
                        bored filling out the form and 
                        forgot about it and haven’t been 
                        able to find my ID since!   
           The Bouncer doesn’t budge.  Cedric looks impatient.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m 22.  I swear.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Oh if you swear...

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh my god...  You’re really not 
                        letting me in.  I’m 22 and can’t go 
                        out drinking.  

                                 CEDRIC
                        You have to admit that’s sort of 
                        funny.

                                 MEGAN
                        No...  This is a serious pattern!  
                        I’m going backwards.  A few months 
                        ago I was in college and I was 
                        somebody’s fiance and I drank wine 
                        in restaurants.  And now I’m home 
                        all day in pajamas and I’m nobody’s 
                        nothing and I can’t even get into a 
                        bar!
                             (noticing something blue 
                              and sticky on her arm)
                        And I have gogurt on my arm, ‘cause 
                        why not, right?  Faiza?!  What’s 
                        happening to me?  I’m going 
                        backwards!  I’m Benjamin Button!

                                 FAIZA
                        Uh huh, I’m hearing you.  

                                 MEGAN
                        And I feel awful!  I know you were 
                        looking forward to this birthday 
                        thing and now you can’t go...

           She sees Faiza and Cedric not budging from the club entrance.  
           They’re going without her.  Megan is shocked!

                                 FAIZA
                        Honey, listen.  This changes 
                        nothing.  You need to get out of 
                        your rut.  Take a cab home, get on 
                        that dating site, pick a cute guy 
                        you’ve been messaging with and 
                        schedule some meaningless sex.  No 
                        drinks.  No dinner.  Just sex.  I’m 
                        prescribing you to get laid.
                                 MEGAN
                        It’s not an edible arrangement, you 
                        can’t just...  order it!

                                 FAIZA
                        Uh, yeah.  You can.  You’ve got 
                        tits and the internet.  Cedric, 
                        back me up.

           Cedric nods.  The Bouncer nods too.  Megan shoots him a weird 
           look for listening.  Cedric's phone rings--

                                 CEDRIC
                             (into the phone)
                        Hey birthday boy!  We’re coming!  
                        We’re just pimping out Faiza’s fake-
                        underage roommate first.

           Cedric drags Faiza in.  

                                 FAIZA
                             (hurried, to Megan)
                        Desperate times call for desperate 
                        measures!  Go get ‘em, tiger!

           Megan stands alone outside - all dressed up and nowhere to 
           go.  She waves a taxi down, but when she opens the door a 
           happy COUPLE bounces out, going into the club.  Megan groans.

           INT.  MEGAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Megan tosses the gogurt box in the trash and eyes her laptop 
           from across the room.  

           A hesitant dance of seduction is happening...  between her 
           and the laptop.  She moves closer to it, making the excuse of 
           cleaning up a little around the apartment.

           Finally Megan pulls the laptop onto her lap and opens 
           OkCupid.  It’s a nice, friendly looking site.  More like 
           facebook than a skeezy dating website.  

           She clicks on her inbox, which is full of messages.  The 
           first one is a SHIRTLESS GUY with long hair on a hiking trip.  

           His message reads: “Hailey, I’m gonna be 100% honest.  If 
           you’re anti- foot massages than I am NOT your man.”

           INT.  MEGAN'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON a wine glass being filled to the tippy top.  Megan 
           steels herself with a giant sip and returns to the laptop.  
           She clicks through message chains and gets to a handsome guy 
           named DAVID she’s gone back and forth with.  An icon says 
           he’s online now.  She IMs him: 

                 Megan: “Hey there”

           BING.  A response.  

                 David: “Sup?” 

                                 MEGAN
                        Nope.

           Megan instantly closes his IM.  Deal breaker.  

           She goes through the inbox and finds two others she’s been 
           talking to who seem okay and are online: ALEC and JOE.  
           Writes the same message.

                 Megan: “Hey there”

           Then she waits with the two IM windows open on her computer.  
           Two potential suitors.  Like a game show.  

           BING.  A response:

                 Alec: “hey, how’s it going?”

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                             (buzzed on wine, talking 
                              to herself)
                        Keeping it casual...  Keeping it 
                        lowercase...

           She studies Alec’s profile again.  Young, handsome, 
           surrounded by friends in his pictures.  He seems totally 
           suitable for a one night stand.  She types back:

                 Megan: “fantastic, how about yourself?”

           Meanwhile the other guy (Joe) writes back:

                 Joe: “Hey gourgeous!” (sp) 

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Really?

           She closes his IM.  Now it’s down to Alec.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  The bar is so very low...

                 Alec: “same.”
           We watch her type: “Cool, would you like to have sex with me?  
           Then she deletes the whole thing before sending it.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, I sound like a computer 
                        virus.

           She has a ‘What are you doing?’ moment.  She steps away from 
           the computer as if retreating from the awkwardness.  

           She starts drunkenly cleaning the kitchen to distract 
           herself.  She lifts a big see-through garbage bag out and 
           sees near the bottom that there’s an engagement picture of 
           her and her ex-fiance pressing against the plastic, mixed in 
           with fast food wrappers and discarded spaghetti.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Faiza...  no...    

           She digs through the bag and retrieves the soiled stack of 
           meticulously posed pictures.  She flips through them as if 
           precious artifacts...  This is a sign.  Time to do something 
           out-of-character.  She runs to her laptop, downs the wine, 
           and types rapid-fire:

                 Megan: “listen i know it’s late but i’m about to get 
                 sexiled by my roommate.  do you want to hang out?”

                 Alec: “sure.  are you thinking drinks?”

                 Megan: “actually i was thinking your place”

           Megan hits send before she can even think about it.  

                 (instant) Alec: “yes”

           A beat, then:

                 Alec: “sorry that yes was too quick.  pretend that I waited 
                 a second before saying yes.”

           Megan laughs.  

                 Alec: “i’m in chelsea.  166 8th Ave.  Apartment 2.”   

                 Megan: “cool.  i’m coming from brooklyn.  see you soon i 
                 guess.”

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                             (typing it as well)
                        Wait!

                 Megan: wait!
                 Alec: yeah?

                 Megan: do you have video chat?

                 Alec: sure

                 Megan: i wanna see your apartment first cause you can 
                 tell from someone’s apartment if they’re a psycho.  
                 and if you have newspaper clippings about unsolved 
                 murders on your wall i’m telling you right now that 
                 the deal’s off

                 Alec: totally fair.  just give me a minute to take 
                 off my mom’s dress

           He’s actually funny!  Megan clicks the video chat button and 
           nervously fixes her hair while it loads.  She suddenly 
           realizes to hide her wine glass as--

           Voilà!  Alec appears on her computer, just like his profile 
           picture.  Handsome with a nice smile.

                                 ALEC
                        Hi there.

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh man, I was so sure I was gonna 
                        see a close-up of a penis.  

                                 ALEC
                        So was I actually.  

           Megan laughs.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  You’re really, really pretty.  
                        Anyway, uh...  this is me and...
                             (lifting up his laptop to 
                              show the apartment)
                        This is a tour of my lovely 
                        apartment.  

           It’s a realistically small New York apartment, not the big 
           dream ones in most movies.  But it’s clean and nice-looking.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (casual dry humor)
                        I can show you it all but the east 
                        wing.  You just can’t ever see the 
                        east wing.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I can respect that.   
                                 ALEC
                        So...  did I pass the test?

                                 MEGAN
                        I think so.  I’ve never done this 
                        before.  

                                 ALEC
                        Yeah, me neither.

                                 MEGAN
                        Like, I know people say that, 
                        but...  I really haven’t.

                                 ALEC
                        I know.  Me neither.

                                 MEGAN
                        Well, I’ll see you soon I guess.  

                                 ALEC
                        Really?  Awesome.  I mean uh...  
                             (trying to be extremely 
                              mature and detached)
                        That would be a nice thing...  to 
                        happen.  

           Megan laughs and shuts her laptop.  She makes spunky gun-
           fingers at her reflection in the tv like she’s cheesily 
           flirting with herself across a bar.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (to herself)
                        Let’s get you laid, lady.  

                                 ALEC (O.S)
                             (coming from the shut 
                              laptop)
                        Sorry, I can still hear you.  I 
                        don’t think it shut off right...

           Megan’s mortified.  She yells at the shut laptop:

                                 MEGAN
                        Sorry, see you soon!  

           EXT.  BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Bundled in a coat and scarf, Megan walks out of her apartment 
           building down a street decorated with soggy Christmas 
           decorations and piles of asphalt-stained snow shoveled off 
           the sidewalk.  A few harmless snowflakes fall.
           Megan walks with a hop in her step, past a falafel stand 
           where the Vendor is listening to local news on the radio.  

                                 RADIO NEWS
                        ...WNYC is getting forecasts in of 
                        a hurricane-strength blizzard 
                        coming in the wee hours of the 
                        morning.  Word is flights out of 
                        JFK are already being canceled...

           ...but Megan has her ipod headphones in so she’s totally 
           oblivious.

           She walks past a Two Brothers pizza place with the local news 
           playing on their tv.  The newscast is all about the incoming 
           blizzard.  Pedestrians gather on the sidewalk to watch it.  

           Something big and ominous is coming, but once again, Megan is 
           oblivious because of her headphones.  She skips down the 
           steps into an L-line subway station.

           INT.  SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           Megan's walking down the steps, but she’s slowed by a 
           SLOPPILY-DRESSED ELDERLY MAN walking ahead of her.  He makes 
           conversation:

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        Storm’s gonna be a doozy, huh?  

           Megan (headphones in) makes a cringe-worthy misjudgment:

                                 MEGAN
                             (polite as can be)
                        Sorry, I don’t have any change.  

           Megan moves around him, swipes her metro card, and runs onto 
           the waiting train just as the doors slide shut.  Off her 
           nervous, excited face that screams “Everything’s coming up 
           Megan!” we...

           SMASH TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The early morning sun shines through cracks in the blinds.   
           Megan and Alec are on opposite sides of his bed.  She’s wide 
           awake.  He’s snoring.  The clock reads: 7am.
           Megan, looking very uncomfortable with this situation, slips 
           out of bed and quietly dresses.  

           INT.  ALEC’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She tiptoes through the living room, passing the remnants of 
           their boozy night.  She finds a piece of paper on his 
           counter, and writes on the back in lipstick: “Thanks for 
           this, it was just what I needed.” 

           Not knowing what else to write, she comes up with: “You have 
           a lovely apartment.  xoxo, Megan” She puts it on the counter, 
           moves to the door, unlocks the two locks, and opens it.  
           Suddenly there’s a FAINT BEEPING.  

           What the hell?  She turns and sees a flashing burglar alarm 
           asking for a password.  Shit shit shit...

           Megan doesn’t know what to do.  She shuts the door gently, 
           but the ominous BEEPING persists.  The alarm’s about to go 
           off!  Mortified, she runs back into his bedroom--

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The BURGLAR ALARM BLARES and Alec jumps up from his bed, 
           startled.  He glances to his left and sees Megan pretending 
           to be fast asleep next to him.   

           He digs under his bed for a weapon, but all he finds is a 
           tiny novelty bat from a Mets game.  It’ll have to do.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (pretending she’s just now 
                              waking up)
                        What is that?

                                 ALEC
                        Shhh...  Stay calm...  
                             (sees she’s dressed under 
                              the covers)
                        Did you sleep with your coat on?

                                 MEGAN
                        I get cold.  
                             (off his confused face)
                        Go get the intruder!

           Alec leaves to check the rest of the apartment and Megan sits 
           up in the bed, trying not to appear guilty.  The alarm shuts 
           off, and Alec returns, still not fully awake.
                                 ALEC
                        Must have been a false alarm.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (nervous about her lie)
                        Really?  Guess that’s the nice 
                        thing about a small apartment, you 
                        can check the whole place by 
                        turning around.  

           Alec tries to go back to sleep.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Well it’s a bummer it woke us up, 
                        but you know I should probably get 
                        going anyway...

           She hears him SNORING.  He’s back asleep already.  She’s 
           stuck.  She groans and takes off her shoes back off.

           She tries to go back to sleep but can’t.  She needs to wake 
           him up.  She sees an alarm clock on his end table and sets it 
           to go off in exactly an hour.  

           Bored, she opens a drawer and sees a twenty pack of condoms.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                             (judgemental)
                        Wow...  ambitious.  

           There’s a dog-eared, cheesy romance novel on the end table.  
           She gives sleeping Alec a weird look.  She cracks open the 
           book to pass the time.  

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - LATER

           The alarm clock RINGS.  Finally.  Megan tosses the book aside 
           and stretches her arms to pretend to be waking.  Alec stirs 
           awake, disoriented.    

                                 MEGAN
                        That’s some alarm you got there...

                                 ALEC
                        I don’t remember even setting it...  
                             (reading the clock, 
                              confused and sleepy)
                        ...for 8:03.  Uh, morning, Megan.

                                 MEGAN
                        Morning, Alex.  
                                 ALEC
                        It’s, uh, Alec actually.  

                                 MEGAN
                        What’d I say?

                                 ALEC
                        Alex.  

                                 MEGAN
                        And do your way, one more time.  

                                 ALEC
                        Alec.  With a c.   

                                 MEGAN
                        Gotcha.  Sorry.  

           Awkward silence.  Megan’s awful at post-hook up chats.

                                 MEGAN (CONT'D)
                        Well.  Last night was a blast.  
                        Thank you for...  having me.  

                                 ALEC
                        Sure, yeah...  
                             (dry sense of humor)
                        My only concern is how we’re gonna 
                        sugarcoat this when we tell our 
                        grandkids how we met.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (laughs)
                        Suppose we’ll cross that bridge 
                        when we come to it.  

           They’re making the best of the awkward situation with humor.  
           Megan slips on her shoes, still eager to leave.

                                 ALEC
                        So, uh, do you want breakfast or 
                        anything or do you normally just 
                        take off?

           Silence.  Megan almost lets it slide but can’t.

                                 MEGAN
                        “Normally”?  

                                 ALEC
                        Huh?
                                 MEGAN
                        “Normally” like I do this a lot?  
                        So much that I have normal and 
                        abnormal versions of it?

                                 ALEC
                        What?  No!  How’d you get that from 
                        what I said?  I have no idea how 
                        often you do this...

                                 MEGAN
                        I told you last night.  This is the 
                        first time I’ve done anything 
                        remotely like this.  

                                 ALEC
                        Yeah but...

           Silence.  Alec almost lets this slide but can’t.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Oh come on!

                                 MEGAN
                        What?

                                 ALEC
                        You really expect me to believe 
                        this was the first time you’ve had 
                        a one night stand?

                                 MEGAN
                             (shocked and offended)
                        Listen -- the only reason I even 
                        came here was because my roommate 
                        peer pressured the shit out of me.  

                                 ALEC
                        Yeah, ‘cause she wanted the place 
                        to herself.  I remember.

                                 MEGAN
                             (forgot her white lie)
                        Huh?

                                 ALEC
                        She “sexiled” you, right?

                                 MEGAN
                             (frazzled)
                        That’s right.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEGAN (CONT'D)
                        And yet now I’m feeling some 
                        distinctly judge-y vibes from your 
                        side of the bed which is odd 
                        considering the team work involved.  

                                 ALEC
                        Whoa whoa, slow down, there’s no 
                        judgement here.  Absolutely none.  
                        I actually really admire what you 
                        did.  I wish more girls were so  
                        forward.

                                 MEGAN
                        “Forward”.  Wow.  And here we go 
                        again with the slut thing.  
                        Unbelievable.  

                                 ALEC
                        I’m not calling you a slut!  Jesus!           
                             (can’t resist the joke)
                        I’m calling you...  a girl who came 
                        to a stranger’s apartment at 
                        midnight.  If only there was a word 
                        for that...

                                 MEGAN
                        Wow!  Screw you!  

                                 ALEC
                        That was a joke.  Hey come on...  
                        I’m sorry--

                                 MEGAN
                        You invited me over, you prick!  

                                 ALEC
                        I know I did.  I’m sorry.  It was a 
                        a terrible joke.  I didn’t mean to 
                        hurt your feelings.  Can I make you 
                        breakfast?  Please?  I do oatmeal 
                        with smiley faces made of jelly.  
                        I’m kinda known for it.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Save your oatmeal, I’m gonna head 
                        out.  It was real awesome meeting 
                        you.  Have a nice life, Alex.  

           Grabs her coat from the floor and walks out.  
                                 ALEC
                        Okay, cool, well I’m just gonna 
                        assume that time was on purpose, 
                        out of spite, because I told you my 
                        name is Alec with a c like a dozen 
                        times now.  

           INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Alec follows her into the tiny living room, clearly she 
           struck a nerve.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Don’t worry, wasn’t on purpose, you 
                        just have a stupid name.  But it’s 
                        good.  I love when names are 
                        helpful.  Like, it’s called bicycle 
                        'cause it’s two wheels.  Or it’s 
                        called Alec because he’s a fucking 
                        idiot.  You know, helpful.

                                 ALEC
                             (sarcastically upbeat)
                        Okaaay!  Bye, it was lovely having 
                        sex with you!

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh you’re sweet.  It was barely sex 
                        though.  It was more fingering 
                        myself with obstacles.  

           Alec’s face falls.  Low blow.   

                                 ALEC
                        You said you always needed to help 
                        yourself...

                                 MEGAN
                        Don’t believe what people tell you.  
                        Especially when it’s something 
                        like, “Cool name, Alec!”  I mean, 
                        listen to it: Alec.  It sounds like 
                        the first draft of a name.

                                 ALEC
                             (big smile)
                        Fuck you, Megan.

                                 MEGAN
                             (big smile)
                        Aw, fuck you back.  
           Alec disables the burglar alarm and opens the front door for 
           Megan to leave.  She happily obliges and he SLAMS the door.

           INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

           Megan charges down the steps, past Alec’s neighbor’s door, 
           and bursts through the front door of the building--  

           Or she tries to at least.  The wind slams it shut on her.  
           That’s odd.

                                 MEGAN
                        Hey!  What the...

           She tries to open it again but it only opens a crack.  The 
           sidewalk outside is packed with two feet of snow.  And more 
           every second.  The blizzard of the century has arrived.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                             (face falls)
                        No...  no no no no...

           She shuts the door, stuck here.  Exactly half of her is 
           covered with snow that came through the cracked door.  She 
           takes deep breathes to stay calm...  then forgets that and 
           kicks the door.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Ow.  Shit!

           She wipes snow off her hair and turns around, faced with the 
           daunting prospect of returning to his apartment.  Then--

                                 ALEC (O.S.)
                             (on the phone)
                        I am dead serious...  I don’t 
                        remember hitting a gold toothed old 
                        woman with my car but I must have.  
                        There’s no other explanation.  This 
                        girl was a gypsy curse.

           He appears at the top of the steps with his cell phone on his 
           shoulder, carrying his sheets and a jug of laundry detergent.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        ...lures you in with a pretty face 
                        and then wham, starts talking...  I 
                        feel like the survivor of a natural 
                        disaster.  I feel like I should be 
                        giving my scattered memories of the 
                        ordeal to a news crew...  I’m just 
                        glad it’s ooooooo...  
           He doesn’t finish saying “over” because he sees Megan still 
           here, at the bottom of the stairs.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        I’ll call you later.

           Megan gives a pained smile through gritted teeth.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Hi there...  Alec, right?

                                 ALEC
                             (filled with dread)
                        ...what?

           INT.  ALEC’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The tv news is on and the local meteorologist, RICK RAINES, 
           is talking.  Storms are his time to shine.  

                                 RICK RAINES (ON TV)
                        I hope you weren’t planning on 
                        going anywhere because it ain’t 
                        happening any time soon.  This 
                        thing came overnight and put the 
                        island of Manhattan in a white out.  
                        Tens of thousands of holiday 
                        travelers are stranded.  Subways 
                        aren’t running.  Cars can’t get on 
                        the road.  Streets aren’t being 
                        plowed because they can’t even get 
                        the plows on the road until the 
                        snow slows down and the whiteout 
                        clears.  Get cozy, folks.  It’s 
                        gonna be a loooooong weekend...  my 
                        advice?  Settle in for some quality 
                        time with the ones you love.

           Alec and Megan stare at the tv with blank, miserable 
           expressions on opposite ends of the tiny couch.

                        The walls just closed in a little.  
                        Your apartment just got smaller.

                        The walls did not close in.  The 
                        apartment is the same size.  

           INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

           CLOSE ON Megan, whispering urgently into her phone.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Faiza, you have to do something.  I 
                        can’t stay here.  He’s the worst.  

           Widen to reveal Alec sitting in the living room, which is 
           exactly five feet away from the kitchen where Megan stands.  
           He smiles politely, hearing every terrible word.

           INT.  MEGAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Faiza’s on the phone watching the same tv news.  Cedric is 
           making an extravagant breakfast feast in the background.  

                                 FAIZA 
                             (on the phone)
                        Sweetie?  Are you watching the 
                        news?  There’s nothing we can do.  

           Cedric walks over with breakfast for them.

                                 CEDRIC
                             (low, to Faiza)
                        See what it’s like when you’ve got 
                        the apartment to yourself.  This 
                        could be every morning.

           Faiza makes a face like “I know, but...”

                        Megan says hi.

           Cedric feeds Faiza a bite of perfectly golden banana pancakes 
           and she gestures that he did an amazing job.

           INT.  ALEC’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Megan hangs up, appalled, and joins Alec in the living room.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (clears her throat)
                        So you were right about the 
                        helicopter not being a...  viable 
                        option.

                        But have no fear, I have friends 
                        who live in the East Village.  
                        Pretty sure I can make it on foot.

           Alec raises the blinds of the nearest window as exhibit A:

                                 ALEC
                        Pretty sure you can’t.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Well I’m not staying here.  Nice 
                        try though.  

                                 ALEC
                        Yes, because it’s a special kind of 
                        joy being in your presence.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Y’know, what?  I’ll wait it out in 
                        the hall.  As soon as the white out 
                        clears, the plows will come and I 
                        can get a taxi home.    

                                 ALEC
                        You wanna be stubborn and sit in a 
                        cold hallway for a day and a half?  
                        Be my guest.

           Megan wavers, but she’s too stubborn to stay.

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine.

           She leaves and starts down the stairs.  Alec slams the door - 
           feeling bad but too stubborn to beg.

           INT.  ALEC’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Bacon drops into a pan and SIZZLES.  Alec distracts himself 
           by making a hearty breakfast.  

           Then he cracks his front door open ever so slightly and lets 
           the aroma of bacon waft downstairs and torture her.  

           INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

           Megan sits on the floor by the mail cubbies - shivering under 
           a blanket of newspapers.  She plays Solitaire on her iphone 
           but her gloves make it difficult.  She smells the bacon from 
           upstairs and her stomach RUMBLES.
                                 MEGAN
                             (to her stomach)

           INT.  ALEC’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Alec is about to take a bite of bacon from the skillet when 
           he hears FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS.

           INT.  STAIRS - DAY

           Alec opens his door and sees Megan halfway up the stairs.

                                 ALEC
                        I had a feeling you’d come back.

           Alec takes a smug bite of bacon.  Megan can’t let him be 
           right, so she’s lies through her teeth.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m not coming back.  I was getting 
                        cold down there and then your 
                        neighbor here...  
                             (gesturing to the closed 
                              door of Apartment 1)
                        ...very kindly offered to have me 
                        in for tea...  so that’s what I was 
                        doing.  I guess some people still 
                        know how to treat a lady.

                                 ALEC
                        Older guy?  Mustache?

           Megan makes a non-committal noise.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Is that a yes?

                                 MEGAN
                        Sounds about right.  

                                 ALEC
                        Wow, that’s Mr.  Saunders.  The 
                        only time I saw him leave his 
                        apartment was when he moved in and 
                        came knocking to tell me he’s a 
                        registered sex offender.  Didn’t 
                        take him for the chivalrous type.

                                 MEGAN
                             (nervous about her lie)
                        He seemed perfectly nice to me.  
           They stand there in silence.  Alec knows she’s bullshitting.

                                 ALEC
                        Well what are you waiting for?  
                        Tea’s probably getting cold.  

           Megan looks at the stranger’s door.  Not able to knock 
           because then her lie will be found out.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m waiting for you to leave first.  
                        He invited me, not you.  I don’t 
                        want him to think I’m inviting the 
                        whole neighborhood.  

                                 ALEC
                        Fair enough.  Well have fun.  Give 
                        Mr.  Saunders my best.  

           As soon as Alec re-enters his apartment Megan tiptoes as fast 
           as she can down the stairs to hide.  Alec swings his door 
           open and catches her.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Aha!

           Megan freezes - caught red-handed and refusing to face him.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (softens)
                        Look, just come inside and eat 
                        breakfast.  This is stupid.  We can 
                        handle being around each other for 
                        a little longer than anticipated.  
                        We’re two adults.

                                 MEGAN
                             (incoherently contrarian)
                        Speak for yourself.  

                                 ALEC
                        Oh my god.  Fine.  Whatever.  

           He starts back inside but she follows him inside.  

           INT.  DINING NOOK - ALEC’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Megan sits at the dining nook that passes for a kitchen 
           table.  Alec slides over a plate of bacon and oatmeal.  

           They eat in silence.  Megan watches the horrendous snowfall 
           pound against the window.  She has a depressing realization 
           as she turns the jelly smiley-face into a frowny-face:
                                 MEGAN
                        This is what I deserve.  This is 
                        penance.  

                                 ALEC
                        That’s officially the worst review 
                        my oatmeal has ever received.

                                 MEGAN
                        I mean being stuck here with you.  
                        This is what I get for slutting it 
                        up.

                                 ALEC
                        You’re really clinging to that?  
                        That you’ve never done this before?  

                                 MEGAN
                        You don’t have to believe it, it’s 
                        true.  And now I’m being punished 
                        for it.  I’ve made my bed and now I 
                        have to sleep in it.  Or rather...  
                        I’ve got to sleep in yours while 
                        you take the couch.  

                                 ALEC
                        Yeah that’s not happening.

                                 MEGAN
                        Rude.

                                 ALEC
                        You really think God made this 
                        blizzard to punish you for being 
                        slutty?  

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t think God did.  That’s 
                        ridiculous.  I think my parents 
                        did.  I just don’t know how.

           Alec laughs.  Megan makes jokes even when she’s miserable.

                                 ALEC
                        Right.  Well I would prefer not to 
                        spend the day in a 24 hour long 
                        uncomfortable silence if it can be 
                        avoided.  So how about we try this: 
                        Let’s pretend we didn’t sleep 
                        together.  It never happened.

                        Then we can pretend that this is 
                        just a random inconvenient weather 
                        occurrence and not your parents 
                        being passive aggressive about your 
                        lifestyle choices with their 
                        telekinetic powers.  We’re just two 
                        strangers who happen to be stuck 
                        together for a short time.  Can we 
                        do that?  Just start over?  

                                 MEGAN
                        That’s like putting the toothpaste 
                        back in the tube.  You can’t do it.  
                        It’s out there.  I’ve seen your 
                        penis.  You’ve implied I’m a slut.  
                        Those are big things.

                                 ALEC
                        Did you just call my penis big?

                                 MEGAN
                        No, I called the implications of 
                        your penis big.

                                 ALEC
                        Still the nicest thing you’ve said 
                        all day.

                                 MEGAN
                        You can’t erase the fact that 
                        you’ve had sex with someone.  

                                 ALEC
                        You can try!  I think you 
                        underestimate us - me in particular 
                        - and the lengths I’ll go to avoid 
                        uncomfortable situations.  Will you 
                        try the impossible with me?  How 
                        about it?

           Megan thinks long and hard.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll try.  But no promises.  

           Alec puts out a hand to shake.  To start over.  

                                 ALEC
                        Hi.  I’m Alec.

                        That’s a really cool name, is that 
                        English?  
           He lets her sarcasm slide.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m Megan.

                                 ALEC
                        Nice to meet you.  So...  where to 
                        start...  um, so what do you do for 
                        a living?

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh Jesus, this?  This is what we’re 
                        doing?  I don’t want to do this.  I 
                        quit.  You think I’m a slut and I 
                        think your average-sized penis has 
                        enormous implications.  We’re back 
                        to that.  

                                 ALEC
                        Seriously?? Already?

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m afraid so.

           Megan eats her bacon in silence.  Alec turns to the microwave 
           clock: 11:01.  After a while it clicks to 11:02.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Wow, how the time flies.  

           Megan rinses her plate in the sink, then sits on the counter.

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine, we’ll start over again.  But 
                        there are rules.  No upsetting 
                        questions.  

                                 ALEC
                        Didn’t realize it was one.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Well now you know.  

                                 ALEC
                        I’m trying very hard to form a 
                        question that could in no way be 
                        construed as upsetting in any way.  
                        Do...  you...  like...  dogs...?

                                 MEGAN
                             (emotional)
                        I liked my dog, before it was 
                        killed last weekend by a pack of 
                        cats...  
           Alec’s eyes widen, then--

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m just messing with you.  That 
                        was a perfectly non-upsetting 
                        question.  Good job.  Yes, I like 
                        dogs.  I need to use the restroom.

                                 ALEC
                        That’s allowed.  

           Megan rolls her eyes at his minor joke and shows herself to 
           the restroom.  Alec mouths “that’s allowed” to himself, 
           confused about why he even said it.   

           INT.  ALEC’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Megan sits on the toilet but it’s freezing cold.  As she pees 
           she’s amazed by the plethora of magazines and books in here.  
           Skimming covers, she zeroes in on an Esquire headline: 
           “Welcome to Internet Dating: Where the Easy Roam.” 

           Scandalized, she flips to a section titled: “The 5 Types of 
           Girls You’ll Meet Online”.  Her jaw drops at“Type #2: Damaged 
           Girl Getting Back on the Horse” - complete with an awful 
           cartoon of a crazy girl surrounded by mountains of kleenex 
           and smashed picture frames of her and her ex.  

           Megan’s aghast.  It hits way close to home.  She rips the 
           whole page out and balls it up and throws it in the toilet, 
           as if a spy getting rid of a file that would blow her cover.

           INT.  LIVING ROOM - ALEC’S APARTMENT - DAY

           We hear the TOILET FLUSH and the SINK RUN and then Megan 
           comes out with a big stack of magazines to keep her busy.

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s like a library in there.  I’ve 
                        never seen anything like it.  

                                 ALEC
                        You gotta have reading material.

                                 MEGAN
                        ...why?

                                 ALEC
                        You don’t read in the bathroom?  
                        What do you do?
                                 MEGAN
                        I pee.

                        Hmm.

                                 MEGAN
                        Also, kudos on the super girly 
                        soap.  My hands smell like 
                        cucumbers...  which until now I 
                        didn’t know was something I would 
                        want.   

                                 ALEC
                        See that.  An hour with me and 
                        already I’m expanding your 
                        horizons.

                        Ugh...  do you ever just get tired 
                        listening to yourself?  

           Megan plops on the couch and flips through the magazine.  
           Meanwhile, Alec is distracted staring at the water seeping 
           under the bathroom door and flooding the living room.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        If it’s all right with you I’m 
                        gonna pass the time pretending I’m 
                        somewhere happier...  Like a 
                        dentist’s office waiting room.  

                                 ALEC
                        Megan.

           Megan, oblivious, hums a waiting room song, ignoring him.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Megan!

           She finally looks and sees the flood.

                                 MEGAN
                        Ah!  What happened?

                                 ALEC
                        “What happened?”  You happened!

           Megan realizes where the water is coming from:

                        Don’t worry, I’ll deal with it.  
                        It’s actually the perfect, sexy 
                        development to a perfect, sexy day.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Step away from the bathroom!  I’m 
                        not having you clean up my...  
                        that.  You’ll just hold it over my 
                        head.  Go in your room.  I’ll fix 
                        it.  Go!

                                 ALEC

                        Be my guest.  

           Megan looks up at God for a brief “Why?!” then rolls up her 
           jeans and steps into the flooding bathroom.

                                 MEGAN
                        Cold, cold, cold!  What towels 
                        should I use?

                                 ALEC (O.S.)
                        The pink ones.  

           Megan lays the pink towels down, blocking the water from 
           living room.  She reaches behind the toilet and switches it 
           off to stop the water.  

                                 MEGAN
                        ...it just keeps coming...

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM

           Alec paces, not trusting her to fix it.

                                 ALEC
                        You gotta turn the knob! 

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t mean the toilet.  I mean 
                        the punishments from universe.  A 
                        flood?!  It’s practically biblical!  
                        Where’s your plunger?

                                 ALEC

                        My buddy borrowed it last weekend.  
                        This is why you don’t lend friends 
                        plungers!

                                 MEGAN
                        There’s like a thousand reasons you 
                        don’t lend friends plungers.

                             (frustrated)
                        Just shut the door and I’ll deal 
                        with it later.  

           Megan groans - this just keeps getting better.  She shuts the 
           bathroom door and plops on the living room couch, miserable.

           IN THE BEDROOM Alec’s trying to pass the time reading a book.  
           Then he gets an idea.

           INT.  ALEC’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alec appears in the doorway with a big grin:

                                 ALEC
                        I just had an idea that could fix 
                        this whole mess.  

           Does he mean the flood?  Does he mean being trapped here?  
           Either way Megan is all ears.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Do you wanna get high?

           Megan can’t believe that was his solution.  She returns to 
           her magazine, shaking her head in disgust.   

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (an awkward beat)
                        Yeah.  Me neither.  That was just a 
                        test...  
                             (then)
                        Actually, yeah, I’m gonna go ahead 
                        and get high.  You don’t mind, do 
                        ya?

                                 MEGAN
                        Your apartment.

           Alec opens a cubby underneath his bed and pulls out something 
           wrapped in a beach towel.  
                                 ALEC
                        You’re gonna make fun of this...  
                        but I got it from a college buddy.  

           He unveils a giant, gaudy bong adorned with ceramic cherubs.  
           Megan rolls her eyes.  Alex examines an old baggie of weed.

                        All my friends smoke way more than

                        year old.  But for special 
                        occasions like this one...  

           Alec rips the bong and coughs.  Smoke wafts over to Megan in 
           the living room.

                                 MEGAN
                        Jesus, your apartment’s so small 
                        the whole thing is hotboxing.  

                                 ALEC
                             (not sorry at all)
                        Sorry, I’d open a window but 
                        probably not a good idea at the 
                        moment.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re gonna get me high against my 
                        will.  You suck!

                                 ALEC
                        Just hold your breath.  It’ll go 
                        away.  

           Megan inhales deeply to hold her breath but accidentally 
           takes in a bunch of smoke, then coughs it out.

                                 MEGAN
                        Gah!  Tricked!  

           Alec laughs.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Make it stop!

                                 ALEC
                        There’s nothing I can do!

                                 MEGAN
                        You could stop smoking it!

           Alec looks surprised - didn’t think of that.  
                                 ALEC
                        Meh...  

           He rips the bong again and lets out a big lungful of smoke.  
           Megan flicks him off.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (coughing on the second-
                              hand smoke)
                        It’s a mystery why you don’t have a 
                        girlfriend.  Really.

                                 ALEC
                        Hey!  I’m a catch.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll bet you one hundred and fifty 
                        dollars you’ll die alone.

                        You could afford to take the edge 
                        off you know.  This could be good 
                        for you.  Embrace it.

                        I’ve gotten high before, moron.  I 
                        just don’t wanna get high with you.  

           Megan tries to re-focus on reading but the words go blurry.  
           She blinks - eyes red and dry.  Clearly high.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Whoops.  

           They both look at the kitchen with longing.  

           INT.  ALEC’S LIVING R00M - LATER

           A camouflaged boy scout’s pup tent, pitched incongruously in 
           the center of the tiny living room.  

           INSIDE THE PUP TENT

           Megan and Alec gorge on snacks.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (surveying the tent)
                        You really don’t think you’ll die 
                        alone, huh?  
                                 ALEC
                        I don’t think I’ll die, period.  
                        I’m extremely optimistic in that 
                        way.  What happened to no upsetting 
                        questions?

                                 MEGAN
                        I got over that.  Do you think I’ll 
                        die alone?  Like, is that the 
                        impression you get?  

                                 ALEC
                             (thinking)
                        I don’t think you’ll die either.

                                 MEGAN
                        ‘Cause your extreme optimism?

                                 ALEC
                        No, ‘cause harpy devils are 
                        immortal.  Everyone knows that.

           Megan nods, emotionless.  Alec senses his joke was tone deaf.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Wait, why aren’t you being mean 
                        anymore?  

                                 MEGAN
                        ‘Cause it’s not fun picking on the 
                        criminally retarded.

                        Your heart wasn’t in that one!

                                 MEGAN
                        Was too!

                                 ALEC
                        Nuh uh!  You phoned it in!  You’re 
                        really not being mean anymore.  
                        Why?  

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t know.  It gets exhausting 
                        after a while.  Plus you gave me a 
                        pie that I can hold in one hand.  I 
                        didn’t know to even dream of such 
                        things...

                             (smiling)
                        I finally wore you down, huh?  
           It’s quiet.  Alec stands up, lifting the whole tent with 
           him...  and off of Megan.  Alec walks the tent over to an 
           ihome and reaches through the flap to put on MUSIC.  Then he 
           returns to Megan in the living room and sits back down.  

                                 MEGAN

                        Earlier you asked what I did for a 
                        living and I got kind of defensive.  
                        Remember that?

                                 ALEC
                        Vaguely.

                                 MEGAN
                        Well the answer is I’m less-than-
                        employed at the moment.  I don’t do 
                        anything.  It’s embarrassing.  
                        Three months ago I was able to say 
                        “pre-med student”, which sounds 
                        extremely impressive, you know?  
                        But then I graduated so I’m not 
                        allowed to say it anymore...

                                 ALEC
                        I think your profile said pre-med 
                        student.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh I guess I didn’t update it yet.  

                                 ALEC
                        Wait, didn’t you just make the 
                        profile like last week?

                                 MEGAN
                        Wow, interrogator much?!  I don’t 
                        know, I guess I’m just in that 
                        limbo.  I mean, you go to 
                        elementary school, then middle 
                        school, then high school, then 
                        college...  but then what?  You’re 
                        basically kicked out on your ass 
                        and it’s not like your degree has 
                        instructions on it...

                                 ALEC
                        Well yours was called “pre-med” so 
                        that’s kind of...

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, no, not going to med school.  
                        Not for me.  Horrible profession.
                                 ALEC
                        But you majored in it for four 
                        years?

                                 MEGAN
                        I always meant to change it, but 
                        then I graduated.  Whoops.  

                                 ALEC
                        How does that happen?

                                 MEGAN
                        Easier than you’d think.  Speaking 
                        of changing the subject, what do 
                        you do?  Wait.  Lemme guess.
                             (thinks long and hard and 
                              very high)
                        Stenographer-comedian.  When you’re 
                        working a trial you type jokes into 
                        the official record and then when 
                        you read them back for the judge 
                        he’s like, “What are you a 
                        stenographer or a comedian?!”, and 
                        you say “Both!”  And everyone’s 
                        like “What?!”  Probably get a lot 
                        of publicity that way, especially 
                        if it’s a big case, like a serial 
                        killer or something.  

                                 ALEC
                        You are officially the highest 
                        person I’ve ever seen.  You should 
                        be studied by an international team 
                        of scientists.

                                 MEGAN
                        Well that was my only guess.  What 
                        do you do?

                                 ALEC
                        I work at a bank.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh, you’re in banking.  How fancy.

                                 ALEC
                        Nope, just “bank”.  “Banking” 
                        sounds much more impressive than 
                        what I do.

           Megan's kind of surprised it’s something so boring.

                                 MEGAN
                        What do you do at the bank?
                                 ALEC
                        So you know ATMs?  I’m like one of 
                        those but I’m less scary to elderly 
                        customers.

           She tries to hide her surprise that he’s just a bank teller.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh.  How’d you end up doing 
                        something so...

                                 ALEC
                        Wildly exciting?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah.

                                 ALEC
                        You know when you’re 17 and you 
                        wanna go to college and change the 
                        world?  Well...  I actually don’t 
                        know that because I never felt that 
                        way.  I just wanted a job that paid 
                        me money that I could use to do 
                        things I wanted to do.  I’m boring 
                        like that I guess.  I never felt I 
                        needed some job that had to define 
                        my life.  

                                 MEGAN
                        But you like your job?

                                 ALEC
                             (like it’s obvious)
                        No!  Since when are you supposed to 
                        like your job?  It’s a job.  I 
                        think our generation 
                        catastrophically misunderstands 
                        that.

                                 MEGAN
                        Maybe.  Or maybe you just tell 
                        yourself that to convince you 
                        you’re not wasting your one life on 
                        something you hate.    

                                 ALEC
                        Fair enough.  But I mean, it’s like 
                        you were saying, we have tons of 
                        people in college solely because 
                        that’s what you’re supposed to do, 
                        even though it has no bearing 
                        whatsoever on what they’ll do next.

                                 ALEC (CONT'D)
                        We don’t need everyone going to 
                        college just to feel better about 
                        themselves.  What a waste.

           Just as Alec realizes he might be hitting on a touchy subject 
           Megan exits the tent flap.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Hm.  Excuse me.

           Suddenly the walls of the tent start buckling as Megan beats 
           it (and him) with a couch cushion.  

                                 ALEC
                        I didn’t mean you-- I don’t mean 
                        what you did!

                                 MEGAN
                        Uh huh.

                                 ALEC
                        I’m just high.  I’m sorry, I say 
                        stupid things sometimes.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Hopefully you’ll meet someone who 
                        finds that endearing someday.

           Alec laughs at the backhanded insult.  Megan re-enters the 
           tent and plops back down.  

                                 ALEC
                        You’re a curious case though.  
                        Usually girls our age are so 
                        focused on a set plan for 
                        themselves.  You never bought into 
                        that though, huh?

                                 MEGAN
                             (defensive)
                        I had a plan.  

                                 ALEC
                        Becoming a doctor?

           Again, Megan's face changes.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        What made you not want to do that?  
                        What made you change your mind?  
                        Did you find out you’re afraid of 
                        blood or something?
                                 MEGAN
                        Let’s just...  not.  Okay?  We made 
                        a lot of progress being all civil 
                        and that’s great, but let’s not 
                        push our luck.

                                 ALEC
                             (steering back to safe 
                              territory)
                        So...  dogs.  You like them?  Is 
                        that right?

           Megan smiles, appreciative that he let the doctor thing go.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Dogs are solid in my book.  We 
                        never broached your thoughts on the 
                        subject.

           Megan lies back on the floor, feeling mellow.  

                                 ALEC
                        I rest firmly in the pro-dog camp 
                        as well.  How about music?  
                        Generally a fan of that?  Sunshine?  

           Megan smiles.  Then a slight furrow in her brow.  Something 
           is seriously amiss.

                                 MEGAN
                        I would like to frame what I’m 
                        about to ask in the context of the 
                        fact that junk food isn’t a normal 
                        part of my diet and with that in 
                        mind...

           Alec looks confused.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Theoretically...  if one were to 
                        need to make use of a restroom...  
                        how would one possibly do that 
                        under these...  special 
                        circumstances?

           Alec’s head pops out of the tent flap, and his eyes move from 
           the bathroom door with soaked towels wedged underneath...  to 
           the window, still white with torrential snow.

                                 ALEC
                        That...  is a terrific question.
           INT.  STAIRWAY - DAY

           Alec and Megan walk down the stairs to the neighbor’s door.  
           Alec KNOCKS.  No answer.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Is he gonna sex offend me?

                                 ALEC
                        Nah, I made that up.  A nice Korean 
                        family lives here.  Real gems.  

           Megan’s shocked he lied but too distracted to get mad.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (calling through the door)
                        Mrs.  Nyugen?  It’s Alec from 
                        upstairs.  Wondering if you had a 
                        plunger.  Sort of an emergency...

           No answer.  Alec peers downstairs to the mail cubbies and 
           sees his is empty while the Nyugen’s is overflowing.  Uh oh.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        It suddenly seems distinctly 
                        possible that the Nyugen family is 
                        away for the holidays...  

           Alec tries the building’s front door but it doesn’t even 
           budge.  Too much snow.  He almost laughs at the situation.

                                 MEGAN
                        You did not just laugh.

                                 ALEC
                        I’m sorry, it’s just a little...

                                 MEGAN
                        Do you see this face?  This is my 
                        panic face.  Do we understand?

                                 ALEC
                             (realizing the seriousness 
                              of the situation)
                        We do.

           INT.  ALEC’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 

           Alec marches into the flooded bathroom with a coat hanger and 
           begins to uncoil it.
                                 ALEC
                        Have no fear, the trusty coat 
                        hanger is here to save the day.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (dry)
                        You probably say that to all the 
                        girls.

           Alec feeds the straightened hanger into the toilet and tries 
           to unclog it.  Nothing.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re on a clock here, MacGyver.  

           He sees Megan bouncing on her toes, trying to hold it in.    

                                 ALEC
                        I have a Plan B.  But it might 
                        sound a little crazy...

                                 MEGAN
                        We are not getting high again!  

                                 ALEC
                        The windows of this building don’t 
                        lock right.  We can get into the 
                        Nyugen’s apartment through the fire 
                        escape and borrow their plunger.  

           INT.  ALEC’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Alec, now in way-too-small long underwear, rifles through a 
           living room closet and pulls out snowboarding gear.  He pulls 
           on a really tacky men’s snowsuit and boots.  Then tosses 
           Megan a pink woman’s snowsuit.

                                 MEGAN
                        Why can’t you just do it?

                                 ALEC
                        I’m not breaking and entering 
                        alone!  The whole reason we’re 
                        doing this is for you!

                                 MEGAN
                             (examining the pink 
                              woman’s snowsuit)
                        Why do you even have this?   

                                 ALEC
                        It was an ex’s.  Style complaints 
                        go straight to her.  
                                 MEGAN
                        You kept it?  What are you, making 
                        a lifesize doll of her out of 
                        shower hair?

           Alec ignores her.  They get dressed in the elaborate outfits.  
           Ending with pulling on goggles and a skimask.  

                                 ALEC
                        Let’s do this.

           Alec slides open the window.  Snow blows in as he climbs out.

           EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - DAY

           Alec climbs out onto the fire escape, gripping the handrail, 
           looking like an Arctic explorer as the snow whips at him.  
           Still inside, Megan cracks up and shouts over the wind:

                                 MEGAN
                        HOLY SHIT!

                                 ALEC
                        IF WE DIE IT’S ON YOU!  YOU SEALED 
                        BOTH OUR FATES WHEN YOU SELFISHLY 
                        REFUSED TO SHIT IN THE SINK!  

           Alec slips on the steps and falls on his ass but pulls 
           himself back to his feet.  Megan cracks up.

                                 MEGAN
                        REMEMBER WHEN YOU FELL ON YOUR ASS 
                        BACK THERE?  I WAS JUST REMEMBERING 
                        THAT.  SO GOOD!

           Megan climbs onto the fire escape and follows him down the 
           metal stairs to the apartment below, exhilarated by the sheer 
           ridiculousness of this.  

           Alec scrubs snow off the Nyugen’s window and peers in.  The 
           apartment is empty and dark.  He pulls at the window, trying 
           to open it.  Nothing.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        WHAT’S WRONG?

                                 ALEC
                        IT MUST BE FROZEN SHUT.  IT’S NOT 
                        BUDGING!

           Megan lifts an ashtray and smashes the window.  
                                 MEGAN
                        MARSHALL LAW!  EMERGENCY!

           Alec watches - wide-eyed - as Megan climbs in through the 
           broken window.  

           INT.  THE NYUGEN FAMILY APARTMENT - DAY

           Megan races into the bathroom in full snow gear and grabs the 
           plunger next to the toilet.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Go go go!

           Alec watches in disbelief from the window--

                                 ALEC
                        You’ll break someone’s window but 
                        you draw the line at using their 
                        toilet?

                                 MEGAN
                        I am a lady!  

           She climbs back onto the fire escape--

           INT.  ALEC’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Alec uses the plunger on his toilet.  It unclogs and a 
           crumbled magazine article rises to the surface of the water 
           as it begins to drain.  That’s what clogged it.  

           Confused, Alec stops the soggy article from flushing back 
           down by lifting it out with the handle of the plunger.  

           Megan is mortified.  Alec reads the headline: “Girl You’ll 
           Meet Online #2: Damaged Girl Getting Back on the Horse”.  
           Complete with the cartoon of a crazy girl surrounded by 
           mountains of kleenex and smashed pictures of her and her ex.  

           Alec looks to Megan, confused how it wound up in the toilet.

                                 MEGAN
                             (completely humiliated)
                        I don’t wanna talk about it.

                                 ALEC
                             (smart enough not to push)
                        ...okay.

           Megan orders Alec out of the bathroom and shuts the door 
           behind him.  Time for business.
           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Alec sits in his bedroom, thinking about Megan in a different 
           light after the discovery of the flushed article.  Seeing a 
           vulnerable, self-conscious side to her.  He hears a FLUSH.  

           INT.  ALEC’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Megan curls up on the couch and buries her head in shame.

                                 ALEC
                        You know, if you had a complaint 
                        about the bathroom reading material 
                        you could have just said so...

                                 MEGAN
                        Just one more cosmic humiliation in 
                        a lifetime of cosmic humiliations.  
                        To be quite honest I feel the 
                        universe’s piling on at this point.  

           Alec sits on the floor beside the couch.  

                                 ALEC
                        It was just some stupid article.  

                                 MEGAN
                        It wasn’t stupid though.  It was 
                        spot-on.  

           Alec doesn’t know what to say.  He makes a tiny snowman out 
           of the snow that blew through the window.

                                 ALEC
                        Do you really think my name sounds 
                        like the first draft of a name?

                                 MEGAN
                             (still not facing him)
                        Like a good first draft.  Like, 
                        it’s close.

           He laughs.  It’s quiet for a moment, but a comfortable quiet.  
           Alec sees a chance to talk about a bigger issue:

                                 ALEC
                        And do you really...  not always 
                        need to help yourself?  

           Megan pulls her head out of the couch cushion, flabbergasted:

                                 MEGAN
                        What are you talking about?
                                 ALEC
                        You know...  during sex.  At the 
                        time you said you always needed to 
                        help yourself in order to...  
                             (as clinical as possible)
                        ...reach climax...  and then when 
                        you were yelling at me you said 
                        that was a lie.

           Megan cracks up laughing.  Alec is embarrassed.

                                 MEGAN
                        What happened to pretending we 
                        didn’t have sex?

                                 ALEC
                        I’m over that.

                                 MEGAN
                        Why are you thinking about this 
                        again?

                                 ALEC
                        Are you kidding?  I barely stopped 
                        thinking about it!  

                                 MEGAN
                        Listen, I was just trying to hurt 
                        your feelings ‘cause you hurt mine.  
                        It was a low blow.  I apologize.  

                                 ALEC
                        I don’t buy it.  I’ve been around 
                        long enough to figure out girls are 
                        most honest when they’re trying to 
                        hurt someone’s feelings.  

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s not unusual at all for me to 
                        need to help myself.  Feel better?

                                 ALEC
                        But you don’t always have to?

                                 MEGAN
                        Not always.

                                 ALEC
                        So what did I do wrong?  

                                 MEGAN
                        You didn’t do anything wrong.  It’s 
                        just how people sync up, how they 
                        fit together.  
                                 ALEC
                        And we didn’t sync up well?

                                 MEGAN
                        Did you think we did?  

           Alec shrugs: not really.  

                                 ALEC
                        But that’s how it is the first time 
                        with someone new.  You’re awkward 
                        with each other.  You’re afraid to 
                        say anything--

                                 MEGAN
                        But it’s not like that changes 
                        after the first time.  

           Alec looks surprised by that statement.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I mean...  They eventually get to 
                        know what you like more but you’re 
                        never able to really say anything 
                        directly because guys are so 
                        sensitive.  If you suggest doing 
                        something a little differently it 
                        freaks them out ‘cause they think 
                        you’ve been thinking it every time 
                        and they’re mad you didn’t say 
                        something earlier but you didn’t 
                        earlier because you were in the 
                        getting-to-know you phase and it 
                        would’ve been too soon.  So there’s 
                        never a time to talk about the 
                        stuff openly.  Instead you try to 
                        just train them to recognize 
                        different levels of moans without 
                        them realizing you’re doing it.  

                                 ALEC
                        Wow...

                                 MEGAN
                        Or maybe that’s just me.     

                                 ALEC
                        No, you’re right!  It’s like those 
                        stupid games you played in camp 
                        where you had to do some activity 
                        with a partner but couldn’t speak 
                        to each other.  You just had to 
                        stumble through it...

                             (eyes widening)
                        Holy shit...

                                 MEGAN
                        Did you just remember a deeply 
                        repressed camp memory?

                                 ALEC
                        No, don’t you see...  This...  this 
                        right now...  This is a unique 
                        opportunity!

                                 MEGAN
                        What is?

                                 ALEC
                        Us.  Being trapped together.  We’re 
                        like lab rats.  We’re this 
                        incredible experiment...  We’ve had 
                        sex but we don’t have feelings for 
                        each other.  And as soon as that 
                        snow clears you’re gone.  Right?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Like Mexico-gone.

                                 ALEC
                        And we’re strangers.  We don’t have 
                        mutual friends.  We’ll never see 
                        each other again.  Right?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah.  So what?

                                 ALEC
                        So we can be totally honest with 
                        each other!  We can give advice, 
                        constructive criticism...  Don’t 
                        you see what an opportunity this 
                        is?  We can make each other better 
                        lovers for whoever we meet next who 
                        we actually, you know, care about!  

                                 MEGAN
                        First of all, you can’t pull off 
                        the word lovers.  Secondly, what 
                        you’re proposing is a terrible, 
                        awful, dangerous idea.  

                                 ALEC
                        Are you kidding?  It’s best idea 
                        I’ve ever had!  This is a once in a 
                        lifetime opportunity and you’re 
                        gonna pass it up?
                                 MEGAN
                        Guys can’t handle constructive 
                        criticism about that stuff.  You’ll 
                        get all pissy and we’ll still be 
                        stuck together.  

                                 ALEC
                             (like a dare)
                        I won’t get sensitive if you don’t.

                                 MEGAN
                        What do you mean if I don’t?  

                                 ALEC
                        Oh you thought this was a one way 
                        street, huh?

           Megan lets out a shocked laugh.

                                 MEGAN
                        You’ve got pointers for me?

                                 ALEC
                        A thing or two crossed my mind.  
                        But if you don’t think you can 
                        handle hearing it, forget it.  
                        We’ll go back to talking about 
                        dogs.  For instance, how cute would 
                        it be if they had occupations? 

                                 MEGAN
                        Fuck dogs with occupations.  I’m 
                        great in bed.  You’re bluffing.  

                                 ALEC
                        I guess you’ll never know.  Excuse 
                        me.  

           Alec goes to the restroom.  Megan sits, stewing.

           INT.  ALEC’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Alec reads a magazine on the closed toilet.  Killing time, 
           knowing Megan’s driving herself crazy thinking about it.

           INT.  LIVING ROOM - ALEC’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Alec re-enters to find Megan pacing.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine.  I’ll bite.  What do you got?
                                 ALEC
                        This isn’t just you.  I want that 
                        clear.  But...  the lights thing.  
                        If the lights are off, like you 
                        requested and I gentlemanly 
                        obliged, than I could be having sex 
                        with anybody.  But I don’t want to 
                        be having sex with anybody.  I want 
                        to be having sex with you.  The 
                        universal you, I mean.   

                                 MEGAN
                             (floored)
                        Lights on?  All guys feel this way?

                                 ALEC
                        I can only speak for myself and my 
                        friends but...  

                                 MEGAN
                        I was being sarcastic.  Girls hear 
                        this more than hello.

                                 ALEC
                        Hear me out though.  I get why some 
                        people turn out the lights.  I do.  
                        A lot of couples it would be 
                        mutually beneficial to help the 
                        process along.  I’ll go farther, 
                        sex in the dark is probably crucial 
                        for the continued repopulating of 
                        our planet.  But you and I are 
                        perfectly normal looking, healthy, 
                        young people.  And we should 
                        embrace that while we have it.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Guys are just used to porn.  

                                 ALEC
                        Are you reacting defensively to 
                        constructive criticism?  Because I 
                        thought we were having a 
                        revolutionary, once in a lifetime, 
                        open channel of communication 
                        between the sexes.  I thought this 
                        was a safe place.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine!  Guys like doing it with the 
                        lights on.  You really blindsided 
                        me with that one, Kinsey.  Next.

                        You want more?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Do you have more?

                        You do this thing where you stand 
                        up from the bed, turn kinda half-
                        away, and undress all at once as 
                        quick as possible.  Like you’re 
                        preparing for a physical.

                        I’ve never had complaints about how 
                        rapidly I undress.  Most guys like 
                        naked-me.

                        You could make it more of a...

                        Oh gawd...  

                                 ALEC
                        You know what?  You were right.  I 
                        thought we could help each other.  
                        It was overly idealistic on my 
                        part.  I apologize.  

                                 MEGAN
                        No!  Keep going.  Just get ready 
                        for an onslaught.  

                                 ALEC
                        That didn’t sound like it was 
                        totally in the spirit of 
                        constructive criticism but I’ll 
                        continue none the less.  All I’m 
                        suggesting is that guys like the 
                        process of undressing...  No need 
                        to rush through it.
                             (a beat)
                        And lastly...  when you insist on 
                        helping yourself...  while a guy 
                        is...  well, inside of you...

                        It might sorta make that guy feel 
                        as though he’s being put on the 
                        bench, y’know?

                        Duly noted.  My turn.  I don’t know 
                        who first taught guys the “do the 
                        alphabet with your tongue” thing,  
                        but it makes me feel like I’m Helen 
                        Keller getting fucked by her 
                        teacher.

                        That’s not a fantasy of yours?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Moving right along...  There was a 
                        moment - one moment - during 
                        foreplay in which I was close to 
                        coming.  And I believe I subtilely 
                        pointed this out to you.  Do you 
                        remember what I said?

                                 ALEC
                        “I’m close to coming.”

                                 MEGAN
                        Right.  Well after I said that you 
                        switched up what you were doing.  
                        What was the thought process there?  

                                 ALEC
                        I thought I’d do a finishing move.  
                        Like Mortal Kombat.  You know...
                             (in the deep Mortal Kombat

                              sort of hesitant)
                        “Finish her!”

           Megan shudders.

                        If by some miracle of happenstance 
                        you’re ever close to making a girl 
                        come, just keep doing what you’re 
                        doing.  It got her close, it can 
                        get her home.  

                                 ALEC
                        Okay, cool.  Well I think we 
                        learned a lot--
           Megan isn’t close to finished.  She opens the floodgates.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You waited for me to undress you, 
                        which is unnecessary and weird.  
                        I’m not your mom tucking you into 
                        bed.  You kept trying to give me 
                        hickies, which no one likes.  You 
                        found my g-spot but only briefly, 
                        which makes me think you didn’t 
                        find it so much as stumbled across 
                        it on the way to somewhere else.  I 
                        like this.  This is refreshing.  
                        I’m sure I have more...

                        Maybe I’d do a better job finding 
                        things if the lights were on.

                        Only if you’re talking about a 
                        flashlight planted directly in my 
                        vagina, which I’m not okay with.  

           Alec can’t help but laugh.

                        Oh and last night, when we were 
                        done, you retreated to the other 
                        side of the bed like you planted a 
                        bomb down there.  Next time you’re 
                        with a girl, hold her and count to 
                        ten.  I thought this was common 
                        knowledge but apparently not.  
                        Anyway I think that’s all for now.  
                        If I think of anything else I’ll 
                        let you know.

                        It actually really did.  How about

                        praise.  Oh well, I asked for it.  

           Alec plops on the couch.  Megan watches him.  He looks sort 
           of cute trying to not look crushed.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh geez.  I told you it was a bad 
                        idea...  I knew this would happen.

                        Nothing sticks.  We should probably 
                        check for updates, huh?

           Alec turns on the local news.  

           ON THE TV

           No sign of the white out ending.  The meteorologist from 
           earlier, Rick Raines, is doing a field report.

                             (way too excited)
                        IT’S REALLY NOT SHOWING ANY SIGN OF

                        SEE IT ‘CAUSE ALL YOU SEE IS SNOW!  
                        LIKE MAGIC!

                              earpiece)
                        OKAY, I’M REALIZING THE EMPIRE 
                        STATE BUILDING IS ACTUALLY OVER 
                        THAT WAY.  JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU 
                        THE DISORIENTING NATURE OF THIS 
                        INCREDIBLE STORM.

           Megan doesn’t pay much attention to the tv, instead watching 
           this quieter, sadder Alec.  

                                 ALEC
                             (dead pan)
                        I’ll bet you a thousand dollars 
                        Rick Raines is fully erect right 
                        now.
                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll bet you two thousand dollars 
                        Rick Raines has - more than once - 
                        hired prostitutes to watch his 
                        Hurricane Bill coverage with him.  

           Alec laughs, still not in a great mood, but amused by her.  
           Megan feels awful for being so hard on him.  She impulsively 
           grabs the remote and turns off the tv.

                        What if we tried again?

                        No I mean...  what if we tried 
                        again...  Like tested out our 
                        theories.  Put to use what we

                        Yeah.  It would probably be helpful 
                        for me.  I’m a hands-on learner.

                             (hesitant)
                        I guess we could try that.  

                                 MEGAN
                        And the channel of communication 
                        would stay open.  Say whatever’s on 
                        your mind.  That’s the deal.  

                                 ALEC
                             (caught up in the moment)
                        Yeah, yeah...  This is good!  And 
                        we should film it!  So we can watch 
                        the replay and get an objective 
                        view of--

           Alec sees Megan glaring at him.  He backpedals.

                        Too far.  Way too far.  Even I’m 
                        offended by what I just suggested.  
                        Do you know what it was?

                        Yes.  That’s exactly right.  

           Alec stands up, not knowing what to do with himself.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Okay...  So...  how do we start?

           Alec gently brushes a hand through her hair.  She cracks up.  

                                 MEGAN
                        This won’t work if you make me 
                        laugh.

                             (defensive)
                        Well how would you start?

                             (second thoughts)
                        You know what?  Actually...  

           Megan grabs her coat and walks out the front door.

                                 ALEC
                        Hey, what the hell?

           KNOCK KNOCK.  Confounded, Alec opens the door and sees Megan.

                        a professional child molester.

                        Sorry about the mess, had a girl 
                        over earlier who was a real slob.

                        Don’t talk about past girls with a 
                        new girl.  Even if both are me.  
                        Still rude.

                        What was I thinking?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Offer me a drink.  You didn’t the 
                        first time around.  I had to ask.

                                 ALEC
                        Do you want a drink?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Just water.  
                             (then)
                        Ask if I’m sure.  Maybe I said 
                        water just to sound easy going.  

                                 ALEC
                        Are you sure on the water?  I have 
                        a pretty fully stocked bar.

                                 MEGAN
                        Water’s fine.  
                             (then)
                        Maybe she just wants water.  You 
                        really never know.  

           Alec laughs and fills her a glass of water from the tap.

                        Burden’s on you to initiate the

                                 ALEC
                        Did you know New York City’s tap 
                        water is the second best in the 
                        country?

                                 MEGAN
                        Pssh, yeah!  Why do you think I 
                        moved here?
           Alec hands her the glass and sits on the couch next to her, 
           leaving a comfortable distance between them.  

                                 ALEC
                        I like your...
                             (all that’s showing of her 
                              outfit is her coat)
                        ...coat.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Thanks.  
                             (then, breaking character)
                        That was good.  I’m feeling more 
                        comfortable now so I’m gonna take 
                        off my coat and stay a while.
                        Now, normally after a date or 
                        something there would be more build 
                        up here but since this was 
                        explicitly a hook up scenario I 
                        think it’d be fine for you to make 
                        a move now.  

                                 ALEC
                        What kind of move?

                                 MEGAN
                        The first time you waited for me.  
                        I totally understand not wanting to 
                        seem aggressive, but it was kind of 
                        a let down.  At this point, I’m at 
                        your apartment, we both know what’s 
                        going to happen, obviously I’m okay 
                        with it, so just man up and--

           Alec interrupts her with a kiss.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                             (muffled through kissing)
                        Hm.  Not bad.

           Megan breaks the moment by giving him a high five like he did 
           a good job.  Then slips off her shoes and walks into the 
           bedroom without even looking back to see if he’s following.  
           Alec watches this from the couch, stunned.

                                 ALEC
                        Wow.  

           She reappears in the doorway, adorably excited:

                                 MEGAN
                        That was pretty hot, right?  How I 
                        just walked away like that?  I’ve 
                        never tried that before.  
           Alec smiles.  He can’t believe this is happening.

           INT.  BEDROOM - ALEC’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Megan stares at the bed, which has all the sheets off it from 
           when he was going to do laundry this morning.

                                 MEGAN
                        The lack of sheets makes it feel a 
                        bit crack den-y.

                                 ALEC
                        Sorry, I was doing laundry.  

           Alec grabs fresh sheets from the hall closet and quickly 
           makes the bed.

                                 MEGAN
                        Much better.  Where were we?

                                 ALEC
                        Maybe uh...

           Alec takes her hands and uses them to push himself back onto 
           the bed.

                                 MEGAN
                        Ah, a fan of the bed push.  
                        Classic.  

           Alec starts to take off his shirt.   

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Socks first.  There’s no good time 
                        for it.  Just get them out of the 
                        way.  I’ll wait.

           He takes off his socks, then shirt.  Megan flicks off the 
           light.  Alec is about to object but then Megan flicks on a 
           desk lamp so it’s like mood lighting.  

                                 ALEC
                        Nice compromise.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m like the U.N.  of “doing it”.  

           Megan stands over the bed.  This is normally the part where 
           she turns away and undresses as quickly as possible.  But 
           she’s trying it his way.  She nervously bites her lip but 
           looks him in the eye as she undresses one article at a time.  

           Alec’s mouth goes dry from hanging open.  
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Is this...  sorta what you had in 
                        mind?

                                 ALEC
                             (clearing his throat)
                        That’s uh...  You got the hang of 
                        that pretty good...  

           Alec struggles to strip off his jeans and Megan moves onto 
           the bed with him.  He kisses her.  Then he moves down her 
           belly gracefully, kissing as he goes, and then ruins the 
           moment completely by blowing a noisy, ticklish raspberry.  

                                 MEGAN
                        NEVER EVER NEVER!

                                 ALEC
                        That was a joke.  

                                 MEGAN
                        If there’s one thing you take away 
                        from this experience...  Never.
                        My dad did those.  Now I’m thinking 
                        about my dad.  

                                 ALEC
                        Maybe I wanted to cool you off.  I 
                        don’t want to get you so aroused 
                        that you, like, explode, you know?

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t think we have to worry 
                        about that.

                                 ALEC
                        Oh I worry.

           Megan rolls her eyes.  They kiss and fool around.  Alec 
           slides below, going down on her.  We hang on Megan's face.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Much better...

                        Oh my god, you’re embarrassing on 
                        like fifteen overlapping levels.
           Megan pulls him up by his hair and then slides below the 
           camera frame, reciprocating the gesture.  We hang on Alec’s 
           face this time.

                                 MEGAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Any complaints?

                             (in heaven)
                        Nuh huh.  

           With that Megan instantly comes back up.

                                 MEGAN
                        Good.  Usually there’d be more 
                        foreplay but we seem to have got 
                        that down.  Since this is strictly 
                        a learning opportunity I think we 
                        can move on.

           Alec grabs one from his night stand.  

                                 ALEC
                        Okay, here’s something.  I think I 
                        speak for all guys when I mention 
                        that condoms are kinda terrible.

                             (sarcastic)
                        You’re blowing my mind.

                                 ALEC
                        But if you put it on the guy it 
                        makes it more like foreplay.

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m open to that on a conceptual 
                        level but I think I speak for girls 
                        when I say we’re afraid it’ll snap 
                        and hurt and there will be a less 
                        than sexy hospital visit.

                                 ALEC
                        That’s a fair concern but if you 
                        just go slow and steady and...
                             (she puts it on him while 
                              we hang on his face)
                        Yup.  Seamless.  Beautiful.

           This next part is shot like a classic movie sex scene: all

           She comes.  No crazy scream of pleasure, just a quivering, 
           satisfied exhale that tells us everything we need to know.    

           He rolls off her but stays close.  They both look happy and 
           wiped out.  Her fingers shake a little, in a good way.  She 
           shows him this as if to say “Look what you did!”

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you come too?

                                 ALEC
                        Not yet.  But I don’t even care.  
                        That was awesome.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (smiling)
                        We’ll get you yours.  Just give me 
                        second.  

           She closes her eyes, resting just for a moment.  Then peeks.  
           His eyes are closed and he’s holding her just like she 
           suggested.  She counts with her fingers...

           But she gets past the agreed-upon ten seconds and then 
           realizes he’s fallen asleep holding her.  She smiles, 
           surprised, and closes her eyes.

           FADE TO BLACK.  

           FADE IN:

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Megan wakes up.  Alec’s still curled up with her.  She checks 
           the clock: 4am.  She slips out of his spooning to grab 
           underwear and her shirt.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Hey.  Up and at ‘em.  Wake up.   

           She punches his shoulder.  He wakes up, groggily.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        We fell asleep.  

                                 ALEC
                        Okay...  Is that a problem?

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t see what the educational 
                        purposes of it are.  Plus I’m 
                        starving.  
                                 ALEC
                             (still trying to wake up)
                        We can fix that.  

           INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Cupboards open to reveal barren shelves.  The refrigerator 
           door opens to reveal condiments and wilted lettuce.

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh my god, we’re gonna starve.

                                 ALEC
                        We’re not gonna starve.

           Megan runs to the window and sees it’s still snowing.  The 
           snow looks odd in the dark of night - like it’s glowing.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Why don’t you have food?

                                 ALEC
                        I did have food!  We ate it when we 
                        were high, remember?

                                 MEGAN
                        Also your fault.  

           Megan digs through her purse and finds a loose stick of gum.  
           She finds a butter knife and cuts it into six pieces.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        This might have to last days.  
                        We’ll ration it.  

                                 ALEC
                             (surveying the cupboards)
                        Calm down.  We have things to work 
                        with here.  We just have to get 
                        creative.  Go back to bed.  Give me 
                        ten minutes, okay?  

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Megan gets under the covers, then decides it’s too intimate.  
           She sits above the covers.  

                                 ALEC (O.S.)
                        Ready?

           Alec enters with a dinner plate.  A upside-down cereal bowl 
           is on top of it, as if it’s a serving platter.  Megan laughs.
                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        For our first course, we have a 
                        delightful pairing of saltines and 
                        two vintages of ketchup.   

           He reveals the nicely displayed row of crackers surrounded by 
           two fancy drizzles of ketchup.  Megan laughs.  

                                 MEGAN
                        What do you mean vintages?

                                 ALEC
                        I mean I’m pretty sure one of ‘em 
                        came with the apartment.  You’ll 
                        notice hints of sour that come with 
                        age.

           Megan takes a bite and frowns at the sour ketchup.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Maybe an acquired taste.

                                 ALEC
                        That might be.  But don’t fill up 
                        on appetizers!

           INT.  BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alec enters with a second covered plate.  Megan claps, having 
           fun with this.  

                                 ALEC
                        For our entree course, we have crab 
                        cakes over a bed of seasoned 
                        vegetables.

           REVEAL: Two small, misshapen crab cakes sit on a layer of 
           crumbled BBQ potato chips.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Oh how fancy.  
                             (eyeing the color of the 
                              crab cakes suspiciously)
                        If you don’t mind me asking...  
                        What kind of crab is that?

                                 ALEC
                        Tuna.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (taking a bite)
                        It’s actually not terrible.  
           INT.  BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alec enters with one last plate.  

                                 ALEC
                        Finally for the dessert course:  
                        Depression-Era Crumb Cake.  

           He unveils a quite literal crumb cake.  It’s falling apart.

                                 MEGAN
                        What am I looking at here?

                                 ALEC
                        During our earlier smorgasbord, we 
                        left behind quite a few crumbs in 
                        the wrappers, so I re-purposed them 
                        and used some butter and sugar as a 
                        binding agent.  

           Megan eats a handful and puts her fingers to her lips and 
           does that kiss gesture like a satisfied restaurant critic.  

           There’s silence but it’s a comfortable silence.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You know, you’re not the...  worst 
                        person in the world to be stuck 
                        with.

                                 ALEC
                        Right back at ya’.

           Megan smiles.  She gets under the covers.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Plus you’re handy.  If I was 
                        choking to death on crumb cake you 
                        could save me with that fancy pre-
                        med education of yours, right?

                                 MEGAN
                        Nope.  School was biology and 
                        stuff.  Any actual medical stuff 
                        isn’t until med-school.  If you 
                        choke right now you’re a dead man.   

                                 ALEC
                        Comforting.  Are your parents 
                        doctors?

           Megan shakes her head.  
                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hm.  I thought maybe that’s why 
                        you were on that track.  And then 
                        you rebelled and didn’t want to do 
                        it anymore.  

           Megan shakes her head again.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Then what was it?

                                 MEGAN
                        Does it matter?  

                                 ALEC
                        Come on...

                                 MEGAN
                        No, it’s embarrassing.  

                                 ALEC
                        I doubt that.  

                                 MEGAN
                        It won’t make sense to you.  

                                 ALEC
                        Try me.  

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s not that I stopped wanting to 
                        become a doctor...  

                                 ALEC
                        So you still do!

                                 MEGAN
                        No, I mean, it’s not like I changed 
                        my mind.  I never wanted to be a 
                        doctor.  Ever.  Okay?

                                 ALEC
                             (baffled)
                        Then why pick pre-med?

           Megan thinks about the best way to explain it.    

                                 MEGAN
                        So I was engaged once.  That’s 
                        something about me.  We were 
                        together for three years of high 
                        school in Arizona and I followed 
                        him to NYU.  I had to pick a major 
                        but I never really planned on...  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEGAN (CONT'D)
                        needing it.  Or using it.  I kinda, 
                        sorta just wanted to be a wife and 
                        a mom.  People look at you funny 
                        when you say that.  Like they feel 
                        bad for you.  Like you’re giving up 
                        on something...  And I get it, I 
                        do, but...  Anyway, when I was 
                        picking a major I thought, one day 
                        when I have kids and they ask if I 
                        went to college I’d say yeah and I 
                        majored in pre-med.  I thought it 
                        would be a cool footnote about me, 
                        you know?  Like a cool mom thing.  
                        And then the universe called my 
                        bluff.  And after being together 
                        for six and a half years and 
                        engaged for almost two...  he broke 
                        it off.  

                                 ALEC
                        Why?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Short answer?  He was a chauvinist.  

                                 ALEC
                             (confused)
                        He thought men were better than 
                        women?

                                 MEGAN
                             (embarrassed to admit)
                        Yes...  he thought men were so much 
                        better than women that he would 
                        rather sleep with men...  
                        exclusively.   

                                 ALEC
                        He was gay?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, whatever.  The funny thing is 
                        when he finally broke down and told 
                        me...  it wasn’t even a total deal 
                        breaker for me.  But apparently it 
                        was for him.  A semester later I 
                        graduated with a major I had no 
                        intention of using.  And here I am.  
                        I told you it was embarrassing.

                                 ALEC
                             (sincere)
                        Not at all.  You got screwed.

                        Wow, you were with that guy since 
                        high school.  You weren’t lying.  
                        You really never had a one night 
                        stand before.

                                 MEGAN
                        Told ya’.

                        usually don’t last this long.  

           Megan laughs.  There’s something between them and they seem 
           to both know it.  Alec smiles at her.  

                                 MEGAN
                        What’s that for?

           Alec, still smiling, just shakes his head and shrugs.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Tell me!  Why are you all googly-
                        eyed?

           Alec’s clearly falling in love with this girl but doesn’t 
           want to say it.

                                 ALEC
                        Do you want a drink?

                                 MEGAN
                        Sure.  Whatever you’re having.  

           Alec fetches drinks.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I have a sweatshirt?  I’m cold.  

                                 ALEC (O.S.)
                        Sure.  One sec.

           Megan scoots off the bed, and opens the closet to get one.  
           Almost right away she’s notices...  Hard not to.  

           Half the closet is filled with some woman’s clothes.  Only 
           the right side is Alec’s clothes.  He shares this closet.  
           This bedroom.  This apartment.  

           Megan looks sick.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (under her breath)
                        Please be a cross dresser.  
           She sees a stack of picture frames in the closet.  Each one 
           has a picture of Alec and a girl, obviously his girlfriend.  

           Megan closes the closet doors and sits on the bed.  Then 
           instantly stands up, thinking about the girl in the picture 
           who’s bed it is.  She needs to get out of here.  

           She checks the window and sees the street blanketed with 
           glowing white snow.  The downpour has slowed but it’s not 
           been plowed.  She’s still stuck.   

           Alec walks in, holding a bottle of wine and two plastic cups.  

                                 ALEC
                        The dishwasher didn’t run so we’re 
                        drinking out of plastic tonight.  

           Alec hands Megan a cup.  She takes it, not knowing what to do 
           or say.  He pours her wine but the weight of it causes the 
           cup to fall from Megan's numb fingers and spill on the floor.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (joking)
                        Whoops.  Perhaps you’ve had enough.

           Then he sees the closet door open just the littlest bit.  He 
           looks at Megan's face and puts together what happened.  Shit.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I know what you must be 
                        thinking but--  

                                 MEGAN
                        Where is she?

           Alec thinks about lying but can’t do it.  

                                 ALEC
                        Home for the holidays.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re with her?

                                 ALEC
                        That’s a hard question to answer.  

                                 MEGAN
                        No, it’s not.  See?  You just did.  

                                 ALEC
                        Megan...
                                 MEGAN
                        You get the place to yourself for a 
                        few days and, boy, do you make the 
                        most of it.  When does she get 
                        back?  

           Alec sits down at a desk.  Quiet.  

                                 ALEC
                        Uh...  She was supposed to get home 
                        this afternoon...  but the flight 
                        was canceled.

                                 MEGAN
                             (dry)
                        Yeah, I heard about that.  
                        Apparently there’s this huge 
                        fucking blizzard.

           Alec doesn’t know what to say.  Megan doesn’t react well to 
           his silence.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Wow.  

           Megan walks out of his room.

                                 ALEC
                        You don’t understand...

           INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Megan turns on the tv to the early morning news.  The kind 
           that’s on before the sun comes up.  They’re talking about the 
           storm, of course.  No more fun, passionate Rick Raines 
           though.  The EARLY MORNING METEOROLOGIST is a total bore:

                                 EARLY MORNING METEOROLGIST (ON TV)
                        ...there’s been a lot of complaints 
                        about how slow the progress of 
                        plowing has been, but it has begun.  

           The news will be on in the b.g.  of the entire scene, adding 
           a din of inane banter.  It should give us the feeling that 
           Megan and Alec are no longer alone in their little world.  
           The outside world is creeping back.

           Megan sits in the dining nook, holding her purse in her lap.  
           Watching the window, waiting to be able to leave.

           She hears Alec enter but doesn’t look at him.
                                 MEGAN
                        Please, just leave me alone.  
                        Please give me that.  I’m not even 
                        mad.  How could I be?  I didn’t 
                        ask.  You didn’t lie.  I wanted 
                        meaningless sex and I got it.  

           Alec looks stung.  

                                 ALEC
                        Can I show you something?

                                 MEGAN
                        You don’t have to explain your 
                        actions.  Just don’t make me 
                        explain mine...  when I leave here 
                        as soon as humanly possible.  

           Alec goes to the bedroom closet and digs through the girl’s 
           side.  He finds what he was looking for.   

           He walks out and hands Megan a handwritten letter.  The 
           writing is girly and messy.  She reads it.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 ALEC
                        It’s a break up letter.  From her 
                        to me.  

                                 MEGAN
                        So you’re broken up but she still 
                        lives here?

                                 ALEC
                        Not exactly.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Than why the hell are you showing 
                        me this?

                                 ALEC
                        She didn’t give it to me.  Not yet.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I don’t understand.  

                                 ALEC
                        Three weeks ago she called me from 
                        work because she didn’t have her 
                        wallet.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALEC (CONT'D)
                        It fell out of her purse so she 
                        called me and had me look for it 
                        and I accidentally found this note.  
                        She never gave it to me, I guess 
                        she’s been working up the courage.  
                        Anyway, I gave her the wallet at 
                        lunch and she flew home for 
                        Christmas the next day.  I didn’t 
                        mention the note.  I didn’t know 
                        how.  While she was gone I made 
                        that account online.  I wanted to 
                        hook up with someone and have 
                        something to throw in her face when 
                        she finally gave me the letter.  
                        What was I supposed to do?  Wait 
                        around to be broken up with?  

                                 MEGAN
                        You could have broken up with her.  

                                 ALEC
                        The pre-emptive strike.  Yeah, 
                        thought about it.  Couldn’t do it.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Why?

                                 ALEC
                        I was afraid.  People say it's 
                        great being single.  Single people 
                        say that.  And their friends in 
                        relationships actually fall for it.  
                        They get tricked into thinking it’s 
                        better out there alone and they get 
                        tempted out of their relationships 
                        and then they’re the ones lying 
                        about how fucking great it is to be 
                        single.  It’s a cycle I stopped 
                        falling for a long time ago.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (unmoved by his story)
                        Excuse me.  

           Megan goes into the restroom.  

           INT.  ALEC’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Megan splashes water on her face and looks at the girly 
           cucumber soap - realizing now it’s the girlfriend’s.  She 
           throws it in the trash, then feels ridiculous and puts it 
           back on the sink.
           She sits on the cold toilet lid and breaks down.  She tries 
           to cry quietly so he doesn’t hear.  Tries to steel herself.

           INT.  DINING NOOK - ALEC’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Alec feels like shit.  He hears the NOISE OF HEAVY MACHINERY 
           outside and knows what it is before he even looks.  

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW a huge SNOW PLOW trudges by, clearing 8th 
           Avenue.  All it means to Alec is that Megan’s leaving.  

                                 ALEC
                             (under his breath)
                        Not yet...  Please...

           Megan comes out of the bathroom.  Not showing any signs of 
           tears.  She sees Alec facing her, standing in front of the 
           window as if to block the view.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Just sit down, please.  Talk to me.

           She pushes past him and sees the plow clearing the street and 
           the first brave taxis starting to come back out with chains 
           on their tires.  The city is coming back to life.

                                 MEGAN
                        Bye, Alec.

                                 ALEC
                        Megan!  Wait!  Please.  If I had 
                        known that you existed...  
                             (sincere)
                        I don’t want her.  I want you.  

                                 MEGAN
                        What the hell makes you think I 
                        want you?  You’re just some sad guy 
                        who works at a bank.  Not exactly 
                        breaking my heart, ya know?

           Megan walks out the door.  Alec is crushed.   

           INT.  STEPS - NIGHT

           Megan sprints down the steps.  She tries opening the door but 
           the snow is still packing it in.  She slams her shoulder 
           against it, again and again.  It hurts but she forces it open 
           just enough for her to slip through and escape.  
           EXT.  8TH AVENUE - NIGHT

           Megan trudges through what used to be the sidewalk and is now 
           waist deep snow.  She forgot her coat in her hurry to leave.  

                                 ALEC (O.S.)
                             (from inside)
                        Megan!  Wait!  Megan!  

           BACK INSIDE THE BUILDING,

           Alec tears down the stairs.  He struggles out the door and 
           into the snow, wearing nothing but his boxers and undershirt.  

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (teeth chattering)
                        Megan!  Megan?

           He scans the street but doesn’t see her anywhere.  She’s 
           gone.  He stands there for a moment, shaking uncontrollably 
           in the cold.  Devastated.  He turns back and goes inside.

           We then see Megan hiding in the nook of a neighboring door.  
           Teary-eyed and not wanting him to see her.  Now that he’s 
           inside she waves down a taxi.

           Megan climbs in the backseat and doesn’t let herself look 
           back at his building as it gets smaller out the window.

           INT.  MEGAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Megan enters her apartment - shivering and wet - interrupting 
           Faiza and Cedric, who are lying on the couch under a blanket 
           watching a movie.  

           It’s clear the two are having sex but they freeze under the 
           blanket and Megan’s too distracted to realize the obvious.

                                 CEDRIC
                        Whoa, hey, hey there...

                                 FAIZA
                             (not able to stand because 
                              Cedric’s inside of her)
                        Oh my god, hey, Meg!

                                 MEGAN
                        You’re not even gonna get up and 
                        hug me?  I just went through memoir-
                        worthy trauma!  Memoir-worthy!

                                 FAIZA
                        Here, let me just...
           Faiza starts to pivot, almost taking too much of the blanket 
           off a naked-from-the-waist down Cedric.

                                 FAIZA (CONT’D)
                        Let me just hold your hand...

           Faiza reaches awkwardly over the couch to try to hold Megan’s 
           hand.  Megan leaves her hanging.  She takes off her soaked 
           shoes and walks into her bedroom.  

           While Megan’s away Faiza and Cedric try reaching for their 
           clothes but before they can, Megan comes back in wearing 
           pajamas.  The couple on the couch freeze again, stuck.

           Megan grabs the gogurt box from the trash (this is what rock 
           bottom looks like) and opens one.  She gestures for Cedric 
           and Faiza to make room on the couch.  They stare at her.

                                 MEGAN
                        What?

           Cedric and Faiza avoid eye contact.  Megan notices the 
           underwear discarded nearby and finally reads the situation.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  I’m away for two nights 
                        and you make this whole apartment 
                        into your own personal, craven, sex 
                        den!  You guys are monsters!

           Megan runs into her bedroom and slams the door.  

                                 FAIZA
                             (walking on eggshells)
                        So...  your night was good?

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Alec sits at his computer on OkCupid.  He writes a message to 
           Megan: “Please, I need to talk to you.  At least let me give 
           you your coat back.” 

           INT.  MEGAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Megan opens her laptop and logs onto OkCupid.  She sees the 
           blinking new message from Alec.  She closes that one and we 
           see six other new messages from him.  She looks conflicted...

           FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:
           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - DAY

           The sun shines through the blinds.  The ALARM BLARES.  Alec 
           wakes up in his same clothes and checks the time: 8:03.  The 
           strange time Megan set the alarm to yesterday morning.  

           The bed feels empty without her.  Alec logs onto OkCupid and 
           checks his inbox.  Nothing new.  He clicks Megan's profile 
           but it says: “Profile De-Activated.  But don’t worry, there 
           are plenty of fish in the sea!”

           Alec looks heartbroken.  

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        You looked tired so I let you 
                        sleep.  

           Alec whips around and sees an attractive girl named DAISY in 
           his doorway.  He’s shocked to see her and disappointed it’s 
           not Megan, but tries to hide it.  

                                 DAISY
                        Caught a bus to surprise you.  

                                 ALEC
                        You did...  do that.

                                 DAISY 
                        Try to contain your excitement a 
                        little.  

                                 ALEC
                        Yeah, yeah, sorry...  Listen, we 
                        need to talk...

                                 DAISY
                        I know.  I found the note in the 
                        trash.  And I get why you wanted me 
                        to find it.  

                                 ALEC
                        What note?

           Daisy hands him a crumbled paper with lipstick writing on it:

           “Thanks for this, it was just what I needed.  You have a 
           lovely apartment, xoxo Megan”

           It’s the note she wrote that first morning but then 
           discarded.  This is the first Alec’s seeing of it.  

                                 DAISY
                        You made your point, Alec.  And 
                        you’re right.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAISY (CONT'D)
                        I took you for granted lately.  And 
                        everything that happened with me 
                        and Brian--  Sorry, I--

                                 ALEC
                        You can say his name.  

                                 DAISY
                        I know I can.  I don’t want to 
                        though.  I only want to say your 
                        name from now on...

           Alec laughs at the idiotic, meant-to-be-sincere statement.  

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                             (not getting it)
                        What?

           Alec just shakes his head.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, baby, the past few weeks 
                        I thought we were done.  But seeing 
                        this made me realize I don’t want 
                        you with someone else.  I want you 
                        with me.  Forever.    

           Daisy tries to kiss him but he pulls away.  He stares at the 
           Megan’s hand-writing on the note.

                                 ALEC
                        Actually...  I think you were right 
                        the first time.  

           TIME CUT:

           Furious, Daisy carries all her bags, and soggy pink towels, 
           into the stairway--

                                 DAISY
                        For the record: this apartment 
                        looks like a fucking refugee camp!   

           She SLAMS the door.

           INT.  MEGAN'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Megan wakes up bitterly to a KNOCK on her bedroom door.

                                 MEGAN
                        What?  Now you guys wanna have sex 
                        in my bed?
           Faiza and Cedric enter with a tray: breakfast in bed.  

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                             (genuinely surprised)
                        For me?

                                 FAIZA
                        We thought you could use a nice 
                        hearty breakfast.

           Faiza and Cedric sit and watch her eat as if they’re visiting 
           their friend in the hospital.  

                                 MEGAN
                        I always ask for breakfast in bed 
                        but this is the first time you’ve 
                        actually done it.  I feel like 
                        there’s a catch.

                                 FAIZA
                        Nope, no catch.

                                 CEDRIC
                             (low, to Faiza)
                        Why would you say that?  There’s 
                        totally a catch.  

           Megan chews, awkwardly listening.

                                 FAIZA
                        So listen...  Normally I’d wait to 
                        bring this up until after you’d 
                        recovered a bit, but...  the lease 
                        is up tomorrow and...  Cedric and I 
                        sort of enjoyed having the place to 
                        ourselves the past couple nights.  
                        I wasn’t sure we would because I 
                        was so used to you always being 
                        here, you know? Like always, all 
                        the time...  but, um...  
                              (realizing she’s getting 
                              nowhere, to Cedric)
                        Help me, babe.

                                 CEDRIC
                        Yeah, um...  we were thinking you 
                        could move out.  But you could, of 
                        course, stay as long as you need to 
                        figure things out.  Ya’ know...  A 
                        couple days...  Three days...  
                             (nearing his limit)
                        Four days...
                                 MEGAN
                        I think this is a good idea.

           Faiza is stunned.  Cedric is gleeful.

                                 FAIZA
                        You do?

                                 MEGAN
                        Yeah, I mean, I didn’t even want to 
                        go to college in New York.  I just 
                        came ‘cause my ex wanted to be 
                        close to Broadway.  
                             (off Cedric’s face)
                        I know.  Hindsight.  Anyway, New 
                        York isn’t for me.  I hate winter 
                        and I hate tiny apartments...  I’ve 
                        been thinking about moving back 
                        home for a while.  The past two 
                        days were just the push I needed.  

           Faiza gets emotional and hugs Megan.  

                                 FAIZA
                        Do you realize what this means?  
                        This is our last New Years Eve as 
                        roommates...

                                 MEGAN
                             (emotionless, realizing)
                        Aw shit, it’s New Years Eve.

           INT.  ALEC’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Outside we hear CAR HONKS and CELEBRATORY SHOUTS as 
           anticipation builds for tonight.  Alec, on the other hand, is 
           a man on a mission.  He’s dialing a phone number off OkCupid 
           for “Questions and Concerns”.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT.  CALL CENTER - DAY

           DARELLA, a tired woman in a headset, answers:

                                 DARELLA
                        Hello, my name is Darrella at 
                        OkCupid, how can I help you?

           Alec paces his apartment.
                                 ALEC
                        Hello.  I was wondering if you 
                        could help me out.  I met this girl 
                        from your site a few nights ago--

                                 DARELLA
                        Sir, I believe I know where this is 
                        going and I might be able to save 
                        both of us some time--

                                 ALEC
                        Please, Darella, I know how this 
                        sounds but hear me out.  This was 
                        not some one night stand, okay?  
                        This was two nights.  
                             (realizes that doesn’t 
                              sound very impressive)
                        Anyway, she left her coat and I 
                        accidentally didn’t get her phone 
                        number and now her account is 
                        somehow, um, deleted.  I don’t know 
                        if she accidentally did that, or 
                        somehow maybe the snow in New York 
                        maybe took down a...  server.  Is 
                        that a thing that happens?  Not a 
                        computer guy, I’ll be completely 
                        honest.  The point is I just need 
                        some way to contact her so I can 
                        explain...   
                             (catching himself)
                        ...where her coat is.  And get that 
                        back to her.

                                 DARELLA
                        Sir...

                                 ALEC
                        I realize this is word-for-word 
                        what a crazy person trying to track 
                        down some girl to murder would say.  
                        I get that, but please Darrella...  
                        open your heart to the possibility 
                        that I am not a crazy person trying 
                        to murder someone.  I’m just a guy 
                        who cares...  about coats.   

                                 DARELLA
                             (recites this a hundred 
                              times a day)
                        Sir, we cannot give out any 
                        customers’ personal information 
                        beyond what they choose to share on 
                        the site.  Is there anything else I 
                        can help you with today?
                                 ALEC
                        Just a last name then.  Please.  
                        Just a last name.  You could pull 
                        it up on your computer so easily, 
                        couldn’t you?  You could single-
                        handedly give a happy ending to 
                        this delightful modern day 
                        Cinderella story.  Just a touch of 
                        the keyboard and I swear to God if 
                        I win her back we’ll name our kids 
                        Darella.  Every single one.  Boys 
                        too.  
                             (silence)
                        Darella, you’re killing me.  Say 
                        something.

           Darella eyes her surrounding cubicles.  Waits for her 
           Supervisor to pass by...  lowers her voice...

                                 DARELLA
                        Sir, the only people who can get 
                        customers’ personal information is 
                        the police.  I’m sharing that 
                        knowledge as a kindness, so you 
                        think twice before you try to 
                        serial kill anybody, okay?

           Her Supervisor returns and she returns to her normal voice.

                                 DARELLA (CONT’D)
                        Now...  Is there anything else I 
                        can help you with today, Sir?

           Alec hangs up, frustrated.  Then he sees into the bathroom 
           where the neighbor’s plunger is drying in the bathtub.  

                                 ALEC
                        Alec, you’re a genius.

           INT.  MEGAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Faiza and Cedric are hosting a hopping New Year’s Eve party.  
           A mountain of winter coats sits by the door.  We scan the 
           happy, drunken revelers all dressed up and eventually reach 
           the sad and very drunk Megan wearing pajamas.  Megan’s packed 
           on the couch like a sardine but somehow completely alone.  

           She’s watching Rick Raines and the the local newscasters 
           banter in New Year’s party hats.
                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        Rick, the wife and I were watching 
                        your coverage all last night from 
                        the warmth of our living room.  Did 
                        not envy you one bit.  Helluva job, 
                        pal.

                                 RICK RAINES (ON TV)
                        Thanks, Scott.  Ya know, it’s 
                        storms like that...  that make a 
                        weather boy into a weather man.  

           Megan drunkenly laughs at the moronic statement but then 
           realizes no one else is paying attention to the tv.  

           A stupidly handsome guy named BEN sees her.

                                 BEN
                        Megan!  Long time no see!  
                             (no recognition)
                        It’s Ben.  From Bio last year? 

                                 MEGAN
                        How are you here?  Do you know 
                        Faiza?

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, I’m buddies with Cedric.  
                        They came to my birthday thing a 
                        couple nights ago.  You should have 
                        come!

                                 MEGAN
                             (dawning on her)
                        It’s you...  You’re the dumb, 
                        pretty guy...  

                                 BEN
                        Uh, excuse me?

                                 MEGAN
                        You and I were supposed to have a 
                        one night stand but I couldn’t find 
                        my stupid ID!  Faiza was gonna hook 
                        it up!  You’re the one I was 
                        supposed to be with that night!  
                        This is amazing!  It’s like the 
                        universe is correcting itself!   

           Megan nervously downs her drink, then sees Ben smiling.
                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a big drinker.  Really.  I 
                        drink less than all my other 
                        friends combined.  

                                 BEN
                             (laughs)
                        I should hope so.

           Megan realizes what she said.  She’s embarrassed.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You know what I mean.

                                 BEN
                        I always wanted to ask you out back 
                        in college, but you were always 
                        dating that gay guy.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (attempting to be flirty)
                        Yup, that’s me.  Very open-minded.    

           Ben puts a hand on her face, almost petting her.  

                                 BEN
                        Wanna talk somewhere quieter?

           Megan sees Faiza across the room giving her a thumbs up.  

                                 FAIZA
                        I’m going to Cedric’s to pick up 
                        more booze.  Have fun!  

           Megan re-fills her drink and smiles at Ben.

           INT.  MEGAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben sits down on the bed and Megan shuts the door.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (buzzed, rambling)
                        Gonna be honest here, I’m not great 
                        at one night stands.  But practice 
                        makes perfect, right? 

           Ben doesn’t know how to respond to such forwardness so he 
           awkwardly makes small talk.

                                 BEN
                        So where’d you decide on med 
                        school?
                                 MEGAN
                             (dancing towards him)
                        Shhh.  Not going.  Never wanted to.  

           Ben, realizing how sober he is, takes her drink and sips it:

                                 BEN
                        Maybe I should catch up a bit, huh?  

           Megan shoves him onto the bed.  It’s like Alec’s request but 
           way too hard.  He spills his drink.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Boo ya!  Bed push!  Take your 
                        clothes off.  

                                 BEN
                        Okie dokie. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Don’t say okie dokie. 

                                 BEN
                        Oki- yup. Okay. 

                                 MEGAN
                             (clapping at him like a 
                              dog)
                        Socks off too.  Now.  Do it.

                                 BEN
                        You’re kinda bossy...

                                 MEGAN
                             (drunkenly trying to make 
                              it sound sexy)
                        It’s called... an open channel of 
                        communication... 

                                 BEN
                        Kinky.

           Megan turns off the lights.  Then Ben turns them back on with 
           a suggestive grin.  

           Megan pulls the lamp’s cord out of the wall, putting them 
           back in the dark.  

                                 MEGAN 
                        Take it or leave it.  

                                 BEN
                             (immediate)
                        I’ll take it.  
           We hear sloppy kissing.

                                 MEGAN
                             (muffled demands)
                        Kiss better.  Kiss a lot better.

                                 BEN 
                        How about I skip ahead just a 
                        little bit?

           Silence for a second as he slides below.  Then:

                                 MEGAN
                        Nope.  Get out.  Out. 

                                 BEN 
                             (genuinely confused)
                        Do you mean out of your vagina or 
                        out of your room?

                                 MEGAN
                        Both!  A thousands times both!  I 
                        already know my abc’s, I don’t need 
                        a refresher course.  Get out.  

                                 BEN
                        Are you serious?

           Suddenly we hear the DANCE MUSIC from the living room cut out 
           and panicked voices: 

                                 PARTY-GOERS (O.S.)
                        Holy shit! / Shh! / What the hell?  

           A DRUNK GUY opens the door, letting light in:

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        Hey, sorry, am I interrupting 
                        something?

                                 MEGAN
                        No, you aren’t.  He’s leaving.  

           Ben bitterly gathers his clothes.  Megan lies back on her 
           bed, upset.  The Abc’s thing was an excuse.  Clearly she’s 
           thinking about Alec.  

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        Uh, Megan?  The cops are here.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Noise complaints go to Faiza or 
                        Cedric, it’s their apartment now.  
                                 GUY
                        Yeah we tried, they’re not here...  
                        Actually, though, the cops asking 
                        for you specifically.

           Megan looks baffled.  She peeks her head into... 

           INT. MEGAN’S LIVING ROOM  - CONTINUOUS

           ...where sure enough, two uniformed COPS are waiting.  All 
           the party-goers are watching in total silence.  

                                 COP
                        Megan Pagano?  You wanna step into 
                        the hall with us?  

                                 MEGAN
                        What’s this about?

                                 COP
                             (well aware of all the 
                              people watching)
                        We’d really rather not embarrass 
                        you with the specifics...

           INT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           Megan sits across from the Cop in his cubicle in the Brooklyn 
           police station.  New Years Eve is a busy night here.  A lot 
           of loud, drunk people.  

           The Officer lays out an evidence baggie with Megan’s lipstick 
           note in it: “Thanks for this, it was just what I needed.  You 
           have a lovely apartment, xoxo Megan”

                                 COP
                        Officers found this in the Nyugen’s 
                        bathroom.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (rapid-fire, furious, 
                              slurring a tiny bit)
                        You don’t understand.  This guy is 
                        a psychopath.  He’s setting me up!  
                        He set up this whole thing!  And I 
                        realize that’s exactly what some 
                        psychopath would say but that 
                        explains the situation I’m in!  
                        He’s so crazy that he’s forcing me 
                        to sound crazy!  Do you see what 
                        he’s doing??  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEGAN (CONT'D)
                        Officer, I don’t know how else to 
                        say it: this man is playing you!

                                 OFFICER
                        Ma’am, I hear what you’re saying.  
                        Now did you, or did you not, break 
                        in through the window of Mr.  and 
                        Mrs.  Nyugen’s apartment and steal 
                        their plunger?

           Silence.  Megan is stuck.  

                                 MEGAN
                        That is such a “gotcha” question.

           INT.  OVERNIGHT HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           Megan sits in a holding cell, drunk and miserable, surrounded 
           by other miserable, drunk girls wearing slutty New Year’s 
           dresses and a shit-ton of glitter.  A heavy set POLICE CLERK 
           waddles and slides open the cell door.

                                 POLICE CLERK
                        Megan Pagano?  Someone’s here with 
                        bail.  Come on.  Let’s go.

                                 MEGAN
                        That’s impossible.  I didn’t do my 
                        phone call yet ‘cause you won’t let 
                        me get a number from my cell.  

           The Clerk shrugs and waves her out.  

           INT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           The Clerk and Megan turn a corner and see Alec at the end of 
           a long corridor standing at the front desk with a very 
           misguided, enormous bouquet of flowers, an “I’m Sorry” 
           balloon and her winter coat.  

           Megan freezes at the other end of the hall, rage barely 
           contained.  Alec doesn’t see her yet.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (to the Clerk)
                        He’s the one posting bail??

                                 POLICE CLERK
                        Yup.

                                 MEGAN
                        I refuse his bail.  Can I do that?
           The Clerk looks at her like she’s crazy.  

           INT.  FRONT DESK - LATER

           The Clerk has returned to the front desk without Megan.  
           Alec’s baffled.

                                 ALEC
                        Can she do that??

           The Clerk shrugs.  Alec looks panic-stricken.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        Well, can I talk to her?  

                                 POLICE CLERK
                        You can only visit during visiting 
                        hours...  and if the person wants 
                        to see you.  Which I’m going to 
                        take a wild guess and say she 
                        doesn’t if she would rather remain 
                        locked in a jail cell than see your 
                        face.

                                 ALEC
                        I need to talk to her though.  
                             (aha!)
                        What if I told you I helped her 
                        steal the plunger?  Would I be 
                        locked up with her?

                                 POLICE CLERK
                        Why would you be locked up with 
                        her?  These aren’t co-ed dorms.  
                        Are you stupid?

                                 ALEC
                        Isn’t there anything you can do?  
                        This is a matter of...  of...  
                        love.  

           The Clerk sighs.  He touched a nerve.  

                                 POLICE CLERK
                        I don’t normally do this...  but 
                        tonight is New Year’s Eve.  And 
                        that’s supposed to be about second 
                        chances.  Y’know what, screw the 
                        rules.  Follow that hall until it 
                        turns left, then hang your first 
                        right, and I believe you’ll find 
                        what you’re looking for in the 
                        third door on your right.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 POLICE CLERK (CONT'D)
                             (Alec hesitates, shocked)
                        Go!  Run!  This is a matter of 
                        love, you damn fool!

           Alec can’t hardly believe the Clerk’s helping him.  

           INT.  POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Alec sprints down the hall...  whips around the corner...  
           then hangs right...  and skids to a stop in front of the 
           third door on the right...

           ...which reads: “Psychiatric Evaluations”.

           His face falls.  The Clerk was messing with him.  

           INT.  POLICE STATION - CLERK’S DESK - NIGHT

           The Clerk’s now enjoying a cup-o-noodles.  Alec returns.

                                 ALEC
                        I think I made a tiny navigational 
                        hiccup.  The door I ended up at 
                        was...

                                 POLICE CLERK
                        Psychiatric Evaluations.  Which is 
                        exactly where you belong if you 
                        think a uniformed police officer is 
                        going to bend the rules so you can 
                        make nice with your girlfriend.  

           Alec plops in a chair, no choice but to wait.  He hears 
           FIREWORKS outside.  Alec checks the clock: 12am.  

                                 POLICE CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Better luck next year, buddy.  

           Alec groans.  This wasn’t supposed to go this way.  

           INT.  POLICE STATION - FRONT DESK - EARLY MORNING

           Alec’s asleep in his chair with Megan’s coat as a blanket and 
           the “I’m Sorry” balloon as a pillow.  He awakens to the front 
           door banging open.

           Faiza and Cedric run to the front desk.  Faiza looks frantic.  

                                 FAIZA
                             (to the Clerk)
                        Hello?  I’m here for Megan Pagano.  
           Alec’s ears perk, eavesdropping.  

                                 FAIZA (CONT’D)
                        I came as soon as I got her 
                        message.  Is she here?  Am I in the 
                        right place?

           INT.  POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Again, Megan is walked down the corridor by the Clerk.  It’s 
           been a long night.  She sees Faiza and Cedric down the hall.

                                 CLERK
                        How about these two?  You good with 
                        these two bailing you out?

           Megan nods.

           INT.  POLICE STATION - FRONT DESK - DAY

           Megan walks into the arms of Faiza.

                                 FAIZA
                        Babe, what happened?

                                 MEGAN
                        Take me home please.  I don’t want 
                        to talk about it for at least three 
                        years.  

           Megan breaks out of the hug and sees Alec still waiting.  He 
           looks downright scared.  

                                 ALEC
                        Megan...  listen...  

                                 FAIZA
                        Who’s that?

                                 CEDRIC
                        Making prison friends already?  I’m 
                        impressed.  

                                 FAIZA
                        Oh my god, wait...  is that...

           Megan doesn’t say a word, just stares daggers at Alec.  
           Trying not to explode.  
                                 MEGAN
                             (to Faiza, through gritted 
                              teeth)
                        Take me home.  

                                 ALEC
                        I had to see you.  And I didn’t 
                        even know you’re last name!  What 
                        was I supposed to do?

                                 MEGAN
                        Literally anything but this!  

           Megan, Faiza and Cedric move out the door.  

                                 ALEC
                        Wait!  Please!  

           EXT.  POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING

           The sun is coming up.

           Alec chases them down the icy steps, slips and falls on his 
           back.  Faiza and Cedric hesitate, wondering if they should 
           help him up.

           Megan shoots them a look and shakes her head vigorously: No.

                                 ALEC
                        Megan!  Wait!

           He climbs back onto his feet, gripping the hand rail.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                        I know this was extreme, but I had 
                        to see you again.

                                 MEGAN
                        And you didn’t think I should have 
                        a choice in the matter!?  I could 
                        have responded to your messages, I 
                        chose not to!  What don’t you 
                        understand about that?

                                 ALEC
                        I needed to talk to you in person.  
                        There’s something between us.  
                        Admit it.  You feel something too!  

                                 MEGAN
                        You don’t wanna know what I feel 
                        for you right now.
                                 ALEC
                        I know you’re upset now but we’re 
                        good together!  You felt it too!

                                 MEGAN
                        What I felt was not love.  It was 
                        Stockholm syndrome!  

           Megan waves down a taxi.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D)
                        You have a fucking girlfriend, 
                        Alec!

                                 ALEC
                        Not anymore.

           Alec runs in front of the taxi, not letting it go.  It’s a 
           stand off.

                                 MEGAN
                        So she finally broke up with you 
                        and now you want me.  

                                 ALEC
                        I broke up with her because I want 
                        you.  

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                             (not wanting to deal with 
                              this)
                        Screw this.

           The taxi backs up and drives away with no one inside.  Megan 
           is furious.

                                 MEGAN
                        Go away!  Stop ruining my life!  

                                 ALEC
                        Just hear me out, okay?  

                                 MEGAN
                        Fine!  Fine!  What is it you wanted 
                        to say so badly??  Tell me, please!

           Alec looks at Faiza and Cedric watching awkwardly.  Everyone 
           is shivering.  Not exactly the best conditions for spilling 
           one’s heart, but Alec powers through.  
                                 ALEC
                        When I told you that I didn't dream 
                        about going to college and changing 
                        the world or anything, all that was 
                        true.  And you felt that meant I 
                        was wasting my life sitting in a 
                        bank doing a job I hated.  But it's 
                        not like that.  I hate my job, but 
                        that's completely besides the 
                        point.  

                                 CEDRIC
                             (teeth chattering)
                        C’mon, man, fast forward.  It’s 
                        freezing.

                                 ALEC
                             (skips ahead)
                        My dad was always working late.

                                 CEDRIC
                        That’s skipping ahead?  We’re 
                        talking childhoods right now?

           Faiza hits Cedric.  

                                 ALEC
                        My dad always missed dinner with 
                        his family.  And I knew I wanted a 
                        job that didn’t do that to the 
                        family I had one day.  That was 
                        what was important to me.  So when 
                        I was looking for a job, well...  
                        Banks close at five.  Everyone 
                        knows that.
                             (a beat)
                        I'm not proposing to you or 
                        anything like that, we barely know 
                        each other...  I'm just saying I 
                        think we want the same things.  And 
                        I've never had more fun with anyone 
                        in my whole life than I did stuck 
                        in a shitty one bedroom apartment 
                        with you.

                                 CEDRIC
                             (teeth chattering, moving 
                              things along)
                        Cool.  Megan, what do we think?

           Megan waves down a second taxi.  Alec is crestfallen.  Faiza 
           and Cedric climb in the back.  Megan lingers for a moment:
                                 MEGAN
                        You put me in jail.

                                 ALEC
                        Someday you’ll laugh about that...

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll make you a deal.  You give me 
                        your phone number and then you let 
                        me leave...  and I promise I’ll 
                        call the minute I laugh about this.

           Megan’s nowhere near smiling.  Alec knows this means she’ll 
           probably never call.  But he enters in his number into her 
           phone and hands it back.  He puts her coat over her shoulders 
           and fits the flowers and balloon in the back of the taxi.  

           Alec starts walking away, devastated.  Giving up.

           Megan squeezes into the backseat with Faiza and Cedric...  

           Or at least tries to.  With the balloon and flowers and their 
           winter coats, it’s a tight fit back there.  Faiza shoots 
           Cedric a look to make room, he tries valiantly to make 
           himself smaller.  Megan starts to cry.  Softly at first, but 
           then hysterically.

           Faiza and Cedric worry.  Megan can’t stop crying.

           EXT.  STREET - DAY

           Alec walks past workers shoveling sidewalks and cleaning up 
           confetti and trash from the celebration last night.  Alec 
           begins to cry as well.  He knows he blew it.

           EXT.  TAXI - DAY

           Faiza and Cedric continue to watch Megan heave with sobs in 
           the doorway of the cab.  The DRIVER looks impatient.  But 
           then we notice something...  

           Megan’s not hysterically crying anymore.  She’s laughing.

           EXT.  SUBWAY STATION - STEPS - DAY

           Alec descends into a subway station, full on sobbing now.  A 
           pathetic sight.  Then suddenly his phone rings with a number 
           he doesn’t have programmed in.  He can’t believe it.   

           He answers, hoping...  praying...
                                 ALEC
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT.  TAXI - DAY

           It’s Megan, on the phone.  

                                 MEGAN
                             (sniffling back tears but 
                              laughing)
                        You’re an idiot, did you know that 
                        about yourself?

           Alec’s teary face brightens as he races up the subway steps, 
           to get better reception.

                                 ALEC
                        Wait, I’m in the subway, wait a 
                        second, one second...  

           He reaches the top of the stairs and keeps running towards 
           the police station.

                                 ALEC (CONT’D)
                             (never been more nervous)
                        Hey.  Hey there.  Can you hear me?

                                 MEGAN
                        Did you hear what I said?

                                 ALEC
                             (still running)
                        I did, I did...

                                 MEGAN
                        And?

           Alec finally sees Megan.  She’s still out in front of the 
           police station.  Her friends left in the taxi.  

           Alec and Megan make eye contact from across the street.  

                                 ALEC
                        And I love you too.
                             (a beat, unsure)
                        You said I love you, right?

           Alec breaks and we can tell he’s joking.  He runs to her and 
           tries to hug her, but she dodges him like a matador.
                                 MEGAN
                        Nope.  Too soon.  Way too soon.  

                                 ALEC
                        That’s fair.  

                                 MEGAN
                        As punishment, you might never get 
                        to see me naked again.  That needs 
                        to be okay with you.

           Alec can’t wipe the smile off his face.  

                                 ALEC
                        It is.  Totally fair.  

           Megan starts walking, not looking back to see if Alec 
           follows.  He does, happily.  

           The camera hangs back and the following conversation trails 
           off as they get smaller in the distance:

                                 MEGAN
                        You know what we’re like right now?  
                        I used to dance and sometimes your 
                        pinky toe nail falls off--

                                 ALEC
                        We’re like that?!  That’s your 
                        analogy?

                                 MEGAN
                        It happens when you dance!  Anyway, 
                        mine always grew back.  But 
                        sometimes they don’t.  We’re like 
                        that right now.  The nail is off.  
                        Maybe it’ll grow back.  Maybe it 
                        won’t.

                                 ALEC
                        I reject your analogy on the 
                        grounds that it’s gross.
                             (realizing)
                        Hey, it’s snowing!

                                 MEGAN
                        Ugh.  Goddamn it.  

                                 ALEC
                             (the happiest man alive)
                        Thanks, snowflakes!  Look at ‘em, a 
                        million tiny, little matchmakers.
                                 MEGAN
                             (to the snowflakes)
                        All your fault.  Stupid snowflakes.  
                        Sure, alone they’re cute but then 
                        they gang up.  

           Megan swats a snowflake and punches another.

                                 ALEC
                        Did you just punch a snowflake?  
                        That’s like a top five sign you’re 
                        gonna grow up to be a serial 
                        killer.  I read that somewhere.  

                                 MEGAN
                        You don’t get to make jokes yet.  
                        We are so not there yet.  I’ll let 
                        you know.  

                                 ALEC
                             (laughing)
                        Let me know.

                                 MEGAN
                        And I’m moving to somewhere it 
                        doesn’t snow.  That’s happening.  
                        So if you wanna date me you’re 
                        moving too.  Not like, moving in 
                        with me.  Just moving to the same 
                        state.  I’ll make sure they have a 
                        bank.  Take it or leave it.

                                 ALEC
                        That’s fine.  

                                 MEGAN
                        Good.

                                 ALEC
                        So where are we moving?

                                 MEGAN
                        I’ll let you know when you need to 
                        know.

           They’re so far away we barely hear Alec’s laugh.  We see them 
           disappear in the distance as the snow picks up its pace...

           FADE TO BLACK.  

                                 THE END
