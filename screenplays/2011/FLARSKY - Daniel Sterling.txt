                        DOCUMENTARIAN (V.O.)
           What are your feelings about 
           Secretary Field?

                We open on INTERVIEW SUBJECT #1, direct to camera:

                        MIDWESTERN MOM
           Well, normally I find women with 
           that much power to be a little, 
           you know...
                              (whispering)
           Bitchy.  But she’s so graceful, 
           and smart, and kind.  She’s been 
           such an inspiration to my 
           daughters.
                              (welling up)
           ... She gives me hope.  

                INTERVIEW SUBJECT #2:

                        FRAT GUY
           To be honest, I’d like to fuck her 
           until her eyeballs pop out.
                              (then)
           But that’s based on looks and 
           personality.

                              (with SUBTITLES)
           In forty years, we have not 
           witnessed an American figure with 
           genuine understanding of Middle 
           Eastern and Arab issues.  
                              (then)
           With the possible exception of 
           Charlotte Field.

                OPENING CREDITS:

                Quick cuts to illustrate the staggeringly complex 
                operation of moving our Secretary of State from her 
                office in Washington to mid-town Manhattan: Snipers on 
                rooftops.  Men in suits, earpieces and sunglasses.  
                Armored vehicles, ambulances, counter assault SUV’s. 
                Motorcycle cops.  Helicopters, decoy helicopters.

                EXT. CBS NEWS BUILDING - DAY

                A MOTORCADE pulls up to the building.  Behind barricades, 
                a crowd of ONLOOKERS spasms with excitement.  
                CHARLOTTE FIELD steps out of the limo.  Late 30’s, 
                gorgeous, elegant.  The crowd ERUPTS with cheers.  She 
                smiles and waves, but one can look closer and see 
                discomfort.  SECURITY whisks her into the building.

                        KATIE COURIC (V.O.)
           Not yet forty, Charlotte Field has 
           been a Rhodes scholar, a Pulitzer 
           winner, and as Secretary of State, 
           stands fourth in the presidential 
           chain of succession.  She and her 
           husband Kent Field, the rakish 
           junior senator from Rhode Island, 
           reign as the world’s ultimate 
           glamour-power couple.

                INT. NEWS STUDIO - DAY

                Couric sits with Charlotte.

                        KATIE COURIC
           Madame Secretary, how does it feel 
           to be the most popular government 
           official in the world?

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (laughs)
           Like you’re engaging in hyperbole.

                        KATIE COURIC
           I’m quoting a study by the Gallup 
           organization released today.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Seriously?

                Katie shows her the document.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Oh.  
                              (flummoxed)
           Well... I - of course it’s nice.  
           But I’m concerned that some of 
           this current, you know, frenzy 
           about me, might be more about our 
           culture’s passion for celebrity,  
           rather than for the specific work 
           of the State Department.

                        KATIE COURIC
           But your popularity is a political 
           consideration.

           With President Chambers so widely 
           viewed at home and abroad as tone-
           deaf, he seems to rely on the 
           respect you command.  He’s been 
           sending you in his place to the 
           highest level meetings around the 
           world.  Are you carrying too much 
           of his burden?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Not all.  I think...
                              (signals a time out)
           I’m sorry, can we pause for just a 
           minute?  
                              (then)
           Katie, I’m feeling... what’s the 
           opposite of “attacked”? 
           “Fellated”, I suppose?  Yes, it 
           feels like you’re fellating me. 

                        KATIE COURIC
           Oh god, Madame Secretary, I am so--

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s okay, it’s just - are you 
           planning to challenge me at all?

                        KATIE COURIC
           Absolutely.  If you’re pressed for 
           time we can get right to it.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Let’s. 

                Both women resume formal interview posture.

                        KATIE COURIC
           In the past week, you’ve met with 
           military leaders in China, Israel, 
           and South Korea. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yes, that’s correct.

                        KATIE COURIC
           But despite that inhuman travel 
           schedule, your hair looks 
           consistently gorgeous.  Be candid: 
           are you flying with a personal 
           stylist?

                Off Charlotte’s sadness, we go to
                INT. TIKI TORCH LOUNGE - DAY

                A grimy dive bar somewhere in the south-eastern-ish no 
                man’s land of Los Angeles.  

                FRED FLARKSY, mid 30’s, slovenly, bearded, drinks alone 
                at the bar.  He’s DRUNK.  

                At the other end of the bar, are several MEATHEADS.  
                They’re huge, tattooed, drinking beer, eating lunches 
                procured at 7-11, and TALKING ANNOYINGLY LOUD.

                        MEATHEAD #1
           Can you believe that shit?  
           Fucking guy was coming onto me.  
           There’s faggots everywhere now.

                Fred tries to ignore these irritating guys.

                        FRED
                              (to bartender, re: 
                               shot glass)
           Let’s go again.

                        BARTENDER
           That’s number five.  It’s not even 
           one pm.

                        MEATHEAD #1
           They run the fucking media.  
           Forget the Jews, it’s the fucking 
           queers.  

                        FRED
           I lost my job today.

                        BARTENDER
           You mind if I go ahead and express 
           no surprise at all?

                        FRED
           You run a bar that opens at nine 
           AM.  What kind of people were you 
           hoping to meet?

                        MEATHEAD #1
           If our own military doesn’t have 
           the balls to keep faggots off the 
           battlefield, we got no chance.  
           The sand niggers are crazy fucks, 
           but they don’t put up with that 
           gay shit for a minute.

                Fred’s heard enough.  He walks over to the meatheads. 
                        FRED
           Hi, guys.

                The meatheads look at Fred incredulously.

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           I couldn’t help overhearing your 
           trenchant commentary on America’s 
           geopolitical conundrums.  I 
           thought I’d lend a counterpoint, 
           and say that maybe your objection 
           to gays in the military stems from 
           the fear that if homosexuality 
           were fully legitimized in America, 
           you’d launch into such a ferocious 
           cock-sucking binge it would knock 
           your spinal cord out of alignment.

                        MEATHEAD #1
           Holy shit, dude.  Are you 
           suicidal?

                        FRED
           I don’t know.  Why don’t you suck 
           my balls and find out?

                        MEATHEAD #1
           Wait... What??

                        FRED
                              (shrugs)
           I don’t know. 

                        MEATHEAD #2
           Come on, fuck this guy!

                The meatheads start POUNDING Fred.  He tries to fight 
                back, but meathead #2 pours WING SAUCE in Fred’s eyes, 
                blinding him.  Meathead #1 jams a taquito into Fred’s 
                throat, causing him to GASP for air.  Meathead #2 stuffs 
                his Asian dragon wings into Fred’s open gullet, causing 
                him to GAG AND CHOKE.  A final frenzy of body kicks to 
                Fred, and it’s over.  As Fred lies in a heap, the 
                meatheads exit the bar.  Fred pulls out a bottle of 
                prescription VICODIN.

                        FRED
           Joke’s on you fuckers!  I can’t 
           even feel anything!  

                Fred POURS THE PILLS into his mouth, crunches them, then 
                rests his head back on the filthy bar floor.
                INT. THE LOS ANGELES ADVOCATE BUILDING - DAY

                The shabby offices of an alternative newspaper in 
                LIQUIDATION.  Employees pack their cubicles.  

                Fred, sporting a GRUESOME BLACK EYE, carries his box of 
                personal effects, about to leave.  

                        FRED
                              (to CO-WORKER)
           We had a good run, eh?

                        MAX
           We didn’t have any readers.

                        FRED
           No, I know, it’s... just something 
           to say when you walk out a door 
           for the last time.

                        MAX
           As a journalist, why not bid 
           farewell by saying something true?

                Fred considers this, then offers:

                        FRED
           When I was 16 I hired a 
           prostitute, but the 
           antidepressants I was taking to 
           cope with my mother’s death made 
           it impossible to get an erection.

                SHELLY, the receptionist, joins them.

                        SHELLY
           Alistair Wembley’s office called - 
           he’d like to meet with you.

                        FRED
           I don’t follow.

                        SHELLY
           Mr. Wembley would like to see you.

                        FRED
           Alistair Wembley.
                              (off her nod)
           He knows who I am?

                        SHELLY
           Evidently.
                        FRED
           Well... I guess he can’t hurt me 
           at this point - he’s already 
           liquidated the paper.  And the 
           rest of the print journalism 
           industry.  We’re all as fucked as 
           we can be.

                Shelly starts to SOB.  Fred instantly regrets this.

                        MAX
           Dude, why?  She’s got three kids.

                EXT. WEMBLEY MEDIA BUILDING - DAY

                A menacing tower of glass slices the LA skyline.

                INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

                Fred watches the Wembley Media News network on the MINI 
                VIDEO DISPLAY.  

                ON SCREEN: the gleaming WMN LOGO

           President Chambers and Adolf

                              (to his guest)
           Maryann, how was young Clark 
           Chambers like young Hitler? 

                        MARYANN JOHANNSEN
           As teenagers, they both seemed to

                Fred watches this in quiet amazement.

                INT. ALISTAIR WEMBLEY’S OFFICE - DAY

                The imposing, sleek office of the world’s ultimate 
                international media mogul.  Fred sits across the desk 
                from ALISTAIR WEMBLEY, 70, a generally glowering Brit, 
                who at the moment takes a congenial affect.
                        WEMBLEY
           Fred Flarksy.  How are things?

                        FRED
           They’re a bit confusing - you seem 
           to know who I am.  

                        WEMBLEY
           What’s confusing in that?

                        FRED
           You own about 30 percent of the 
           world’s media outlets, and I wrote 
           for a paper financed by the used 
           futon market.

                        WEMBLEY
           There’s no writer who’s devoted 
           more inches to attacking me.

                        FRED
           Oh.  That.  Well, it’s true - I do 
           believe you’re completely evil.  
           But right now all I can think is 
           how nice it is to meet someone who 
           actually read my column.

                        WEMBLEY
           Sadly, I’m one of the few who 
           still loves newspapers.

                        FRED
           You... love newspapers?

                        WEMBLEY
           Does that surprise you?

                        FRED
           Kinda.  Since you keep, you know, 
           buying them up and then destroying 
           them.

                Wembley laughs.

                        WEMBLEY
           Another day, we’ll review the P&L 
           sheets and see if that’s true.  In 
           the mean time, how would you like 
           to stay on the payroll here a bit 
           longer? 
                              (off Fred’s 
                               incredulity)

           critics, and I intend to answer 
           them. 

                        FRED
           Of what exactly do you want to 
           persuade them?

                        WEMBLEY
           That Wembley Media News is 
           legitimate and unbiased.  

                        FRED
           Is this by any chance an audience 
           of blind and deaf journalists?  

                        WEMBLEY
           Come on, Flarsky.  You’re an 
           opinion columnist.  You guys 
           switch sides all the time.  And 
           you’re an excellent writer.  Your 
           attacks have almost made me hate 
           myself, and that takes talent.  To 
           have your abilities working for me-
                              (with meaning)
           -that would be worth quite a bit.

                Fred starts to see this guy is serious.

                EXT. MALIBU RANCH - DAY

                Fred and his best friend, LANCE BELL, 30’s, handsome, 
                intense, hike in the unspoiled mountains of Malibu.

                        LANCE
           I never had a passion for 
           software.  But when you get listed 
           in the Fortune 400, you don’t just 
           walk away.

                        FRED
           It’s a certain kind of 
           predicament.

                        LANCE
           I mean look at all this.

                Lance gestures to the hundreds of acres of nature.  

                        LANCE (CONT’D)
           It’s all mine, and I’m not even 
           35.  Where’s the challenge?  It’s 
           sure as hell not in my personal 
           life.  Franci and I are so in 
           love, we’re disgusting.
                        FRED
           Maybe you’ll develop a 
           neurological disease?

                Lance ponders, then stops and turns to Fred:

                        LANCE
           Listen, buddy, I love you.  And I 
           know you’re in a rough time.  When 
           we get back to the house, I’m 
           going to write you a check for 100 
           thousand dollars.  As a gift.

                Fred opens his mouth to yell at Lance, but then takes a 
                moment really review this offer in his head.  Finally:

                        FRED
           Yeah, we can’t do that.  But 
           thanks for the offer.

                        LANCE
           Why not? 

                        FRED
           Because that’s... that’s not life.   
           I didn’t do anything to earn it.  

                        LANCE
           Do you think I earned my fortune?

                        FRED
           No, but that’s the universe’s 
           crime, not yours.

                INT. LANCE’S PICKUP TRUCK - LATER

                Lance and Fred ride across the ranch.

                        FRED
           I’m gonna take Wembley’s offer.  
           It won’t have my name on it, and 
           it’ll keep a roof over my head for 
           another couple of months.

                        LANCE
           Fine.  But if you won’t let me 
           help you change your life, then 
           you owe it to me - and yourself- 
           to change it on your own.

                        FRED
           And how might I accomplish that?
                        LANCE
           Simple: see something you want and 
           go get it.  Girl, job, whatever.  

                        FRED
           Just “go get it.”

                        LANCE
           That’s the awesome thing about 
           life.  Anyone can have anything 
           they want.

                Fred takes a moment to process this astounding idiocy.  

                        FRED
           I don’t think that’s really true, 
           Lance.  I think for most people on 
           the planet, life is a struggle.

                        LANCE
           Maybe some make it that way, but I 
           think people mostly get what they 
           want.  I always have.  

                        FRED
           Do you understand the difference 
           between you and everybody else?

                        LANCE
           No.

                        FRED
           You’re tall and athletic.  You 
           have perfect teeth.  Your body is 
           ridiculous.  As a result, you’ve 
           been having sex with beautiful 
           women since age thirteen.  As a 
           result of that, you are wildly 
           confident, which has led to even 
           more sex.  All of which has a 
           cumulative effect on your health, 
           which causes you to become even 
           better-looking with age.  You 
           exist in an a perpetual feedback 
           loop of being profoundly 
           attractive and enjoying life’s 
           greatest pleasures.  And somehow, 
           on top of all of that, you were 
           blessed with a freakish genius for 
           writing code.

                Lance considers this, then:

                        LANCE
           No.  That’s all bullshit.
                Off Fred’s exasperation, we go to

                INT. LANCE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

                A spectacular modern home with genuine warmth.  FRANCI, 
                Lance’s INSANELY HOT WIFE, serves them iced tea.

                        FRED
           Thanks, Franci.

                        FRANCI
           No problem - I made a pitcher for 
           myself after tennis this morning.
                              (kisses Lance)
           I’m gonna go get some work done on 
           the Botwin case.

                Franci exits.  Fred gives Lance a “Really?” look.

                        LANCE
           What I’ve got isn’t because of my 
           looks.  I have a winning attitude.

                        FRED
           I know.  And it’s putting a strain 
           on our friendship.  As we get 
           older, you’re becoming more 
           positive.  I don’t feel free to 
           hate things in front of you.  I 
           don’t know if we’re gonna make it.

                Lance is distracted by what’s on TV: the KATIE COURIC 
                INTERVIEW WITH CHARLOTTE FIELD.

                        LANCE
           There you go.  How about that? 

                Fred looks at Lance.

                        FRED
           What are you talking about?  

                        LANCE
           Do you want her?

                        FRED
           That’s Charlotte Field.

                        LANCE
           Do.  You.  Want.  Her?

                        FRED
           Everybody wants her.
                        LANCE
           But not everybody deserves her.

                        FRED
           Lance, come on--

                        LANCE
           You kissed her didn’t you?

                        FRED
           Yes.  I kissed her.  Not the other 
           way around.  She was my baby-
           sitter.  

                        LANCE
           There’s a decent chance she went 
           home and touched herself while 
           thinking about you.

                        FRED
           She was 15 and I was 11!

                        LANCE
           Show me how it happened.  

                        FRED
           It was over 20 years ago.  I don’t 
           remember exactly how it went.  

                        LANCE
           Yeah, right.  Come on, I’ll be 
           Charlotte.

                Fred sighs, and reluctantly indulges.  

                        FRED
           There was really nothing to it.

           We were watching TV on the couch.  
           I spent 45 minutes screwing up my 
           courage, and then I finally just 
           turned... 
                              (turns)
           leaned in... 
                              (leans in)
           And I kissed her on the mouth.

           And then?

                        FRED
           And then... she said my name.  

                        LANCE
           With what inflection?
                        FRED
           A mixture of kindness, pity, and 
           scolding.

                Lance thinks hard for several moments.  

                        LANCE
           Are you sure you’re telling me 
           everything?

                Fred looks away, his conscience clearly bothering him.

           I don’t want secrets in this 
           relationship.

           I... I think my hand might’ve 
           grazed across her breast.  

                        LANCE
           You were gonna leave that out?!

           No!  I need to see.  Show me.

                Fred, in disbelief that he’s actually indulging this, 
                GENTLY SWEEPS HIS HAND across Lance’s left breast.

                        LANCE (CONT’D)

           Yes, Lance.  I do.

           And?

                        FRED
           It’s possible there was a

           memory. 
                        LANCE
           No.  Memories like that are 
           engraved.  Her nipple was erect.  
           The physiological response proves 
           beyond a doubt that to Charlotte 
           Field, the touch of Fred Flarsky 
           is a legitimate sexual stimulus. 

                        FRED
           Fine.  I’ll make that buy.  I’ll 
           even buy that an ordinary woman 
           might still remember me.  But

                a FRENZIED TALK SHOW HOST on the WMN studio feed monitor:

           At long last, is there any 
           difference between America in 
           2012... and The Third Reich?

                Exasperated, Fred shuts off the TV.  He becomes forlorn.  
                After moments of hesitation, he resolves: he Googles 
                “State Department,” then dials a number on SPEAKERPHONE.

                INT. GEORGETOWN MANSION - NIGHT

                A formal dinner honoring SENATOR LEONARD FINCH, 95, 
                incredibly frail.  Finch sits on the DAIS, as a 
                WASHINGTON INSIDER makes good-natured jabs at a podium.  

                        WASHINGTON INSIDER #1
           Leonard Finch stands among the 
           great senators in American 
           history.  But it takes an act of 
           congress to get him to pick up a 
           check.

                As the audience laughs and the speech drags on, we join 
                CHARLOTTE and her husband, SENATOR KENT FIELD at their 
                table, in a hushed conversation:

                        KENT
                              (re: Finch)
           Look at him.  You can see his 
           Alzheimer’s from space.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Honey, can you not say that while 
           we’re at a dinner honoring him?

                        KENT
           He’s got Senate Finance paralyzed.  
           I can’t chair a subcommittee until 
           he dies.

                        CHARLOTTE
           You’re young.  You’ll be fine.  
           Have you read the draft of my 
           Riyadh talk yet? 

                        KENT
           I haven’t had a chance.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I always find time to read your

                        KENT
           Charlotte, I’ve been busy - I’ve 
           got an important job.

                She stares at Kent.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Don’t you think my job’s kind of 
           important?  The counterassault 
           team on our roof doesn’t impress 
           you?

                        KENT
           It’s a ceremonial position.  You 
           run errands for the President.  In 
           a sense, you’re literally a 
           secretary. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fuck you.

                        KENT
           Come on.  You’re doing great.  
           Keep your nose clean for the next

           I don’t know if I’m built for 
           electoral politics.

                        KENT
           Speaking of what you’re built for, 
           do you think we’ll be having sex 
           at any point this year?  It’s 
           getting ridiculous.

                        WASHINGTON INSIDER #1
           And now it’s my distinct honor to 
           introduce Senator Leonard Finch!

                Finch rises with agonizing slowness, and swatting away 
                THOSE WHO TRY TO HELP, begins a seemingly eternal voyage 
                to the podium.  Tiny steps, long pauses.  He WOBBLES and 
                nearly falls, eliciting audience GASPS.

                KENT is losing his mind with impatience watching this.  

                        KENT
                              (under his breath)
           Come on!

                At last, the Senator reaches the stand.  He opens his 
                mouth, and after a long moment, expels the word:
                        SENATOR FINCH
           ... I...

                The audience waits for more.

                        SENATOR FINCH (CONT’D)
           ... would...  like... to thank...

                        KENT
                              (a little too loud)
           Jesus Christ, you’ve gotta be 
           kidding me.

                Charlotte gives Kent a light SMACK.

                Finch’s mouth remains open, everyone holds their breath 
                in anticipation of the next word... He CRUMPLES to the 
                floor in a manner that is unmistakably DEATH.  

                Kent reflexively springs out of his seat:

                        KENT (CONT’D)
           YEEEESS!

                Others look to Kent in shock.  Kent is shocked himself.  
                And suddenly aware of C-SPAN CAMERAS pointed at him.

                LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE with Charlotte. 

                        REPORTER (O.S.)
           Madame Secretary, can you comment 
           on your husband’s outburst at the 
           Leonard Finch banquet?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I can tell you that he’s deeply 
           regretful, and that the Finch 
           family has accepted his personal 
           apology.  Leonard Finch was a 
           great public servant, and his 
           death is a profound loss for 
           America.

           Given Mr. Field’s disgraceful 
           behavior, and how strongly 
           Americans associate the two of 
           you, does integrity dictate that 
           you both resign?

                Charlotte’s gaze turns icy.  
                        CHARLOTTE
           You’re from WMN, right?

                        REPORTER #2 (O.S.)
           Yes, ma’am.

           Well, I appreciate the irony in 
           being asked by you folks about 
           integrity, so I’ll offer this 
           deal: I’ll agree to resign if

                Fred and several WEMBLEY AIDES flank the media titan as 
                he makes a final skim through his speech. 

                        WEMBLEY
           Good job on this, Flarsky.  It’s a 
           solid start on addressing my 
           public perception issues.
                              (then)
           Should we add something to address 
           that jibe from Charlotte Field?

                        FRED
           I wouldn’t advise it.  There’s no 
           percentage in hitting back at her.  
           She’s too well-liked.

                        WEMBLEY
           Mmm.  For the moment, anyway.
                              (then, to his aides)
           We’ll sink that bitch this year, 
           though.  That’s company policy. 

                The aides quickly JOT that down in their NOTEBOOKS.

           She calls me an enemy of free 
           speech, then bullies all of

           staggering.  

                The aides MURMUR in agreement.

           Flarksy, if you can reconcile it 
           with your deranged sense of

           Oh, I’m just looking for the men’s 
           room.

           Down the hall to the right.  Any

           Ladies and gentlemen, please

                Wembley takes the podium as the crowd politely APPLAUDS.  
                INT. CONVENTION CENTER, GREEN ROOM - DAY

                Fred and Wembley’s aides watch the speech on the monitor.

                        WEMBLEY
           Good afternoon, and thanks to the 
           NABJ board for the invitation.  
           You know me as a man involved in 
           many enterprises.  But the 
           business closest to my heart is 
           the news.  I began my career at 
           age 10, delivering the paper to my 
           neighborhood on a black, chainless 
           Pierce bicycle.  After 40 years of 
           working in news, I’ve come to own 
           a company that manufactures it.

                Wembley stops, a bit confused.  A few UNCOMFORTABLE 
                MURMURS in the audience.  

                Wembley’s aides look to each other with concern. 

                        WEMBLEY  (CONT'D)
           I beg your pardon.  We don’t  
           “manufacture” news.  I intended to 
           say “reports.”  We report news.  

                Fred quickly stifles a smile.

                        WEMBLEY (CONT’D)
           We’re in the noble business of 
           conveying truth.  Of course, 
           philosophers have long debated the 
           meaning of “truth.”  But 
           ultimately, truth is simple.  
           Truth is whatever we can make 
           people believe.

                Upon the audience LAUGHTER, Wembley realizes what he’s 
                just said.

                        WEMBLEY AIDE #1
           What the FUCK is going on?

                Fred doesn’t move.  He’s got a good poker face on, and 
                the slightest shift could break it.

                        WEMBLEY
           My friends, I’m compelled to 
           reveal my use of a machine known 
           as a Teleprompter.  The operator 
           of which apparently holds stock in 
           my competitors.

                The audience LAUGHS, rewarding his poise under pressure.
                        WEMBLEY (CONT'D)
           Now then.  When reporting a story, 
           our producers are bound by company 
           policy to ensure that it advances 
           the agenda of the Republican 
           Party.

                The audience ERUPTS with a mix of horror and laughter.

                The aides SCREAM in outrage.  Fred quietly slips out. 

                INT. CONVENTION CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER

                Fred scrambles to find his way out of the building when 
                he runs SMACK into Wembley and his coterie.

                        FRED
           Oh.  Hey.  So... How did it go?

                        WEMBLEY
           What were you thinking, Flarksy?

                        FRED
           Well... For one thing, I didn’t 
           care for your ungentlemanly tone 
           about Charlotte Field.

                Wembley and his AIDE, CONNOR, exchange confused looks.

                        CONNOR
           What’s she to you?

                        FRED
           I just think it was uncalled for.

                        WEMBLEY
           I know you’re aware of my 
           vindictive streak - you’ve written 
           about it.  Of course, to be as 
           destructive to you as you are to 
           yourself will be a challenge.  But 
           we’ll find something that 
           satisfies.  Best of luck.

                As Wembley and his retinue march off, Fred calls out:

           Oh my god what are you doing?

                Lance, reaches into Fred’s sport coat, pulls out the 
                VICODIN BOTTLE, pops it open and dumps the pills.

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           Oh come on!

                Lance, still keeping Fred in the hold, pivots to the 
                side, pulls out his dick and starts PISSING on the pile 
                of Vicodin pills.  

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           You motherfucker!!!

                Lance then UNBUCKLES FRED’S PANTS, and pulls them down.  

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           What the fuck?!

                Lance lets go of Fred.  Fred STOOPS to pull up his own 
                pants, giving Lance the opportunity to SHOVE HIM INTO THE  
                BACK SEAT OF THE OPEN SEDAN and shut the door.

                INT. CAR - LATER

                Fred and Lance sit quietly, and stare ahead.  They just 
                need to collect themselves...  Finally:

                        FRED
           What was that?  Did you study with 
           some... Israeli buzz-killing unit?

                Lance shrugs.

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           Look, I’ll do it, but I’m scared, 
           okay?  I’m aware of your concerns 
           about my self-medicating, but I 
           just cannot walk into that place

           Sure.  Wouldn’t wanna lose control 
           and wind up urinating in public or 
           anything.  

                Fred breaks a pill and eats it.

                enough slivers of a woman to positively identify as

           You just lit your own fuse.  

                Lance forges toward Charlotte.  Fred follows.  As they 
                approach, they contend with dozens of others moving into 
                Charlotte’s gravitational pull.  At last, Fred decisively 
                STOPS FOLLOWING.  He just can’t be another suckup in this 
                pathetic sea of ass-kissers.  Fred stares at Charlotte 
                from a safe distance, studying this creature who’s 
                reached mythological status in his life.  But as she 
                turns to greet an admirer, 

                CHARLOTTE AND FRED LOCK EYES.  

                Charlotte takes a strange expression - somewhere between 
                recognition and confusion, tinged with alarm - Fred does 
                have a gruesome black eye.  In a flash, the moment is 
                gone, and she’s engaged in a new conversation.

                Fred’s got his answer.  

                He heads toward GRAND STAIRCASE leading to the BALCONY.  

                BACK TO CHARLOTTE

                She excuses herself from conversation, turns to an AIDE, 
                and whispers in her ear.  The aide nods and steps away.

                ON THE BALCONY

                Lance and Fred have their postmortem.

           Hi!  I’m Charlotte.  I’m so sorry - 
           I hope I’m not holding you up.  I 
           saw you downstairs, and I thought, 
           “That man looks so familiar!”  But 
           then I thought, well I am standing 
           in a room packed with celebrities.  
           I mean, have you seen who’s down 
           there?  It’s ridiculous.  I asked 
           if anyone knew who you were and no 
           one did, and I thought, but why 
           does he seem... Oh for god’s sake.  
           Do we know each other?

           a regular left eye.

           Fred, are you okay?  You’re 
           starting to look a bit wan.

                Lance looks at Fred.  He’s GHOST WHITE, with sweat beads 
                forming on his head, and soaked pits.

                Fred STUMBLES hard.  The momentum sends him RUNNING OVER 
                THE EDGE OF THE STAIRCASE which must be 200 steps long.  
                He TUMBLES ass over teakettle down, down, down.

           I’m strangely okay with the whole 
           thing.  I got the satisfaction of

           He’s not your responsibility.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I know, Tom.  But he actually was,  
           once.  It’s just depressing.
                              (light bulb)
           I’ll pay for his medical bill.

                        TOM
           You know you can’t do that.

                Charlotte folds her arms in frustration...

                EXT. USC MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT

                Fred and Lance exit the trauma center and start toward 
                the parking lot, but are stopped in their tracks as a 
                phalanx of MOTORCYCLE COPS rolls through.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Need you guys to step back.

                        LANCE
           We’re just trying to get to...

                Lance and Fred see a MOTORCADE headed right for them.  

                        LANCE (CONT’D)
           Holy shit.  

                        FRED
           Holy shit.

                100 feet away, the motorcade slows but NEVER STOPS. 
                Amanda jumps out and charges toward Fred and Lance.

                        AMANDA
           Mr. Flarksy!

                Amanda reaches Fred and Lance.  

                        AMANDA (CONT’D)
           I’m Amanda - we met earlier.  
           Secretary Field was hoping you 
           could join us for dinner?

                        FRED
           Are you shitting me?
                        AMANDA
           No, and this isn’t a planned stop - 
           the vehicles need to keep moving - 
           so I’ll need your answer.

                        LANCE
           His answer is yes!  Have fun!

                        FRED
           Um...  Okay, I’ll--

                Amanda signals to the DS agents.  The motorcade pulls up 
                WITHOUT STOPPING, Agents Forester and Charles leap out 
                and spirit Amanda and Fred into the moving limo.  Lance 
                watches the motorcade take off, deliriously happy.

                INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

                Fred climbs in, joining Charlotte and company.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred!  Thanks so much for joining.  
           I know it’s last minute and my 
           god, how are you not paralyzed?!

                        FRED
           Apparently it helped that I was 
           drunk.  They say it made my fall 
           more fluid or something.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh, that makes sense.  And what a 
           terrific lesson for the kids.

                Fred laughs - Charlotte makes it easy to be at ease.

                INT. FOUR SEASONS, PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

                Charlotte and Fred are deep into their meal in the dining 
                room of Charlotte’s suite.  They drink wine and LAUGH.  

                        FRED
           You lectured Mr. Koons on the 
           outrages of the Iran-Contra 
           scandal.

                        CHARLOTTE
           It was outrageous.

                        FRED
           Yes, but you were nine.  
                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, you lectured my father on 
           nuclear strategy.  

                        FRED
           I was 11, that’s different.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           My father was a nuclear 
           strategist.

                        FRED
           We were obnoxious little children.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I suppose we were just parroting 
           our fathers’ politics like all 
           good Beltway kids.  I still do 24 
           hours a day.

                        FRED
           He must be proud of you.

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (shrugs)
           Some say my job isn’t much 
           different from being an actual 
           secretary. 

                        FRED
           Those people sound like assholes.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Mm.  Well, Dad would still love it 
           if I had a bigger job.

                        FRED
           Right.  You applying for that one 
           in 2016?  I bet I’m the first to 
           ask since we got off the elevator.

                Charlotte LAUGHS, then mindlessly grabs some FRENCH FRIES 
                from Fred’s plate, dips them in his mini ketchup bottle 
                and stuffs them in her mouth.  Fred watches this breach 
                of etiquette, most intrigued.

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (mouth still full)
           The perfect moment to leave the 
           subject of me.  Who are you now, 
           exactly?  What’s with the broken 
           face and suicidal antics?

                        FRED
           I was a columnist at The Los 
           Angeles Advocate.  
                        (MORE)
                        FRED (CONT'D)
           It was fringe enough that I 
           enjoyed almost complete 
           journalistic freedom.  Which I 
           used mostly to attack Alistair 
           Wembley.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Good for you.  He’s the most 
           destructive global cancer since 
           actual cancer. 

                        FRED
           I took a job with him.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh.  Well, work is work.  So... 
           how’s that going?

                        FRED
           Depends on your view.  I wrote a 
           speech for him, then sabotaged it 
           when the Teleprompter operator 
           presented an opportunity.

                Charlotte is amazed.

                        CHARLOTTE
           That was you?

                        FRED
           You know about it?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred...

                Charlotte pulls out her BLACKBERRY, and punches a key.  
                It launches a HUFFINGTON POST VIDEO CLIP:

                        WEMBLEY
           ... Truth is whatever we can make 
           people believe.  

                Audience LAUGHTER.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I can’t tell you how much joy this 
           has brought me. 
                              (to Agent Forester)
           Bill, how many times did I play 
           the Wembley video today?

                        AGENT FORESTER
           About ten, Ma’am.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, you’re my hero.  
                Fred is overwhelmed by the compliment.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           The writing was pitch perfect.  It 
           was a devastating attack, but just 
           subtle enough that he didn’t 
           notice it coming from his own 
           mouth.  That’s talent.  

                        FRED
           I come by it honestly.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Wait a minute - you do.  Wasn’t 
           your dad someone really big? 

                        FRED
           Bernard Flarksy.  Columnist for 
           The Washington Post.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh, of course!  He was the best.
                              (then)
           And... he drank a bit?

                        FRED
           “A bit”?  You are a diplomat.  No, 
           he drank himself to death.  

                An uncomfortable silence.

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           That was unnecessarily morbid.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, no, I shouldn’t have--

                        FRED
           No, you were just--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Well anyway, I should probably--

                        FRED
                              (hopping up)
           Oh, of course.  I’ve taken up your 
           whole night.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s been fun, Fred.  

                        FRED
           Yes.
                        CHARLOTTE
                              (with concern)
           Please try to take care of 
           yourself, okay?

                        FRED
           Okay.

                Fred exits.  Once on the other side of door, he reaches 
                for the Xanax.  Just before swallowing half whole bottle, 
                he reconsiders, and puts it back in his pocket.  

                INT. DELICATESSEN - DAY

                Fred and Lance occupy a booth.

           Do you realize how awesome I am?

           You?

                        LANCE
           I told you you could get this 
           woman.  I pushed you through the 
           door, and you got her!

                        FRED
           She felt sorry for me.  Especially 
           when I capped the night with tales 
           of my father’s alcoholic demise.

                        LANCE
           Did you get her number?

                        FRED
           She’s not some chick I met in a 
           bar.  I’m telling you, our re-
           acquaintance began and ended last 
           night.

                Fred’s CELL rings.  He doesn’t recognize the number.

           Hello?

                INTERCUT WITH:

                INT. LIMO - DAY

                        CHARLOTTE
           Hi, Fred.  Charlotte Field.
                Fred looks to Lance and mouths, “It’s Charlotte.”

                        LANCE
           Holy FUCK!!

                Fred throws a GLASS OF WATER in Lance’s face.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred?  Hello?

                        FRED
           Good morning.  Thanks again for 
           dinner.

                        CHARLOTTE
           It was great reliving the Fairfax 
           days.  And to meet a genuine hero.  

                        FRED
           Didn’t you recently meet Nelson 
           Mandela? 

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m wondering if you can join us 
           on a quick trip to Kashmir.

                        FRED
           The Indian place downtown?

                        CHARLOTTE
           The Indian place in India - 
           Himalayan mountains?  Disputed 
           territory most likely to spark a 
           nuclear exchange with Pakistan

                        FRED
           With a chain reaction that could 
           incinerate a third of the world’s 
           population, yes, I’m familiar.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’d like your help on a speech I’m 
           giving next month.  We can work on 
           it during the flight.

                        FRED
           Don’t you have a staff for that?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yes, and they’re excellent.  But 
           this could use the Fred Flarksy 
           touch.

                        FRED
           I haven’t really done this sort of 
           thing before.
                        CHARLOTTE
           At worst, you’ll see the Himalayas 
           on the State Department’s dime.

                        FRED
           Can I give it some thought and get 
           back to you?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Of course.  We’ll be in town for a 
           few more hours.

                Fred hangs up and turns to Lance.

                        LANCE
           What’d she say?

                        FRED
           She invited me to Kashmir.  I’m 
           not sure what her agenda is, so I 
           told her I’d think about it and 
           call her back.

                Lance SLAPS THE DAYLIGHTS out of Fred.  Fred SCREAMS in 
                pain.  The entire restaurant is startled.

                        FRED (CONT'D)
           What the fuck?!

                        LANCE
           What’s the matter with you?!  You 
           just got invited to an exotic 
           destination by the woman of your

           eat corned beef with some asshole?  
           How long do you think life is?! 

                Two POLICEMEN get up from the counter and approach.

                        OFFICER #1
           Everything alright here?

                        LANCE
           No.  Officer, I love this man, but 
           you can’t even comprehend how self-
           defeating he is.

                        OFFICER #1
           Okay, but you can’t physically 
           assault him in here.  Can I count 
           on you to restrain yourself while 
           you’re in the restaurant?

                        LANCE
           Honestly, I don’t know.
                Fred gives the “it’s okay” wave.  The officers exchange a 
                look of relative indifference, and return to the counter.

                        FRED
           She just wants my help with a 
           speech.

                        LANCE
           Will you wake up?  She wants you.  
           She has seen your beautiful, sexy 
           soul, and she needs a piece of 
           that hot action.  You think she 
           can’t find a better writer than 
           some unemployed hack from The LA 
           Advocate?  No offense.

                        FRED
           No, it’s a fair point.  

                EXT. LAX TARMAC - LATE AFTERNOON

                Fred, with an outdated sport jacket, RATTY BACKPACK and 
                collage of bruises, gets searched at the magnetometer.  

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, STATE ROOM - DAY

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yes, I know he’s a mess.  He’s 
           also an outstanding writer.

                        TOM
           That doesn’t mean he can channel 
           your rhetorical style.

                        CHARLOTTE
           He can augment it.  Fred’s got an 
           audacity most people in this 
           department get beaten out of them 
           when they walk through the door.

                        TOM
           Can he make it up the boarding 
           stairs?

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, PASSENGER AISLE - DAY

                Fred’s wretched appearance draws STARES as Amanda leads 
                him down the aisle.  He looks as uncomfortable with 
                himself as the other passengers do with him.
                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, STATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                Amanda leads Fred into the room.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Hi, Fred!  You remember Tom. 

                        TOM
           Fred.  How’s your... entire body?

                        FRED
           Sore, but in a good way.  Last 
           night was really just my own 
           version of a triathlon.  

                Tom, to his own surprise, laughs.

                        TOM
           Madame Secretary, I’ll catch up 
           with you later. 

                Tom exits.  Fred’s staring at a large BANK OF MONITORS 
                glowing with grid maps, multicolored nodes and numbers.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Maps of the neighborhood.  Earth 
           and outer space, and the position 
           coordinates for key instruments of 
           American power.

                        FRED
                              (points to a monitor)
           What’s this one tell us?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Steady dots denote acknowledged 
           U.S. military bases, surface 
           warships, and satellite positions.

                Fred marvels with boyish excitement - this is so cool.

                        FRED
           How about this one with the 
           pulsing yellow dots?

                        CHARLOTTE
           You’re four levels of security 
           clearance shy of privilege.  Don’t 
           take it personally.

                        FRED
           I don’t.  In fact I find that to 
           be awesome.

                Charlotte’s enjoying this.
                        CHARLOTTE
           See those tracking red squares?  

                Fred finds them.  

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           They won’t tell me what those are.

                        FRED
           Don’t tell anyone I said this,  
           but America kicks ass.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Excellent.  You’re in just the 
           right frame of mind...  
                              (on to business)
           I’ve been invited to speak at the 
           Islamic University of Medina in 
           Saudi Arabia.  And as I’m sure you 
           know, Saudi women exist in a state 
           of gender apartheid.  They’re 
           forbidden to drive, hold jobs, 
           show their skin in public, choose 
           their own husbands and simply 
           leave the house without the 
           permission of a male guardian.  
           Last year we supported this system 
           with over 40 billion dollars in 
           oil revenue.  We’re hypocrites, 
           and while I can’t change that, I 
           can at least acknowledge it.  If 
           there’s any truth in all the media 
           hype about me and my beautiful 
           hair commanding so much 
           international respect, then I’d 
           like to exploit it.  I want it on 
           record that I confronted one of 
           the most powerful woman-hating 
           countries on earth and called for 
           them to change.  The advancement 
           of women’s rights in the 21st 
           Century will be the core of my 
           legacy.

                Charlotte grabs an APPLE from the basket on the end 
                table, and takes a bite.  

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                              (mouth way too full)
           Oh my god, that’s good!
                              (giggles)
           Sorry, I just wasn’t expecting it 
           to be so good.  
                              (offering an apple)
           Would you like one?
                Fred silently waves no.  He is overwhelmed by attraction.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           But I’m fenced in.  The White 
           House wants me to avoid anything 
           that might damage the U.S.-Saudi 
           strategic partnership.  I need a 
           speech that doesn’t get me in 
           trouble with The President, but 
           still sends a strong message.

                        FRED
           I... I don’t know if I can do 
           that.  It sounds impossible.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Where’s the intrepid spirit that 
           ruined Alistair Wembley’s day?

                        FRED
           This is high level stuff.  I don’t 
           know anything about statecraft.  
           This is way over my--

                        CAPTAIN (V.O.)
           This is Lieutenant Colonel Rogers 
           with the Special Air Mission.  
           We’ll be getting off the ground in 
           just a few moments, so please 
           fasten your seat belts.  

                        FRED
           Oh Christ.  

                The jet TURBINES start whirring.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Is everything alright?

                        FRED
           Sure, everything’s great.  I 
           haven’t seen you in 20 years, we 
           have dinner, and the next morning 
           we’re taking off for Kashmir.  
           It’s all very routine.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What are you saying?

                        FRED
           It’s just... this is all moving 
           pretty fast.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What’s all moving pretty fast?
                Fred gathers some courage, and then:

                        FRED
           This affair.  You’re putting me on 
           this pedestal, and I’m concerned 
           you might discover I’m not as 
           brilliant as you think.

                She searches Fred’s face for any sign he’s kidding.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Affair?

                        FRED
           Well... I just assumed you could 
           find a better speech writer than 
           some unemployed hack from the LA 
           Advocate.

                Charlotte hits an INTERCOM BUTTON. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Can you bring the binder on Fred?

                        AMANDA (O.S.)
           I’ll be right in.

                Amanda enters, hands Charlotte a LOOSELEAF BINDER, and 
                exits.  Charlotte flips through the binder, showing Fred 
                the collection of his photocopied opinion columns.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           After we met, I read your work.  
           I’m a fan of your writing.  It’s 
           eloquent, it’s funny, it’s 
           scholarly, it’s bold.  

                        FRED
           Thank you.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I think your writing would mesh 
           well with my message.  This 
           happens all the time - government 
           officials find speech writing 
           talent in the journalism field.

                        FRED
           Right, I suppose that’s true.
                              (to himself)
           Goddamnit Lance.

                        CHARLOTTE
           And while I know my husband has 
           certain public relations problems, 
           I actually love him.
                        FRED
           Ah.  Good, good.  That’s...

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m sorry if you misinterpreted 
           this.

                Fred collects himself from the gut punch, then gets up.  

                        FRED
           Well, now that I’ve made this 
           toxically awkward-- 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, it’s fine.  

                        FRED
           Is is possible they can still let 
           me off before--

                EXT. LAX TARMAC - SAME

                The plane takes off...

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, PASSENGER AISLE - NIGHT

                Most passengers are asleep.

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, EXECUTIVE OFFICE - NIGHT

                Charlotte and Fred burn the midnight oil.  A FLIGHT 
                ATTENDANT clears away their dinner dishes.  

                        FRED
           ... In this section, we can disarm 
           them.  Preface every critique of 
           the Saudis with an acknowledgement 
           of America’s own failings on 
           women’s rights.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Right, so it’s a call for both 
           sides to aim higher.  Fred, that’s 
           a great way in!

                        FRED
           I’ve spent my life attacking 
           myself before the other guy gets 
           the drop on me.

                Amanda pops in.
                        AMANDA
           It’s 11:30.

                        FRED
           I’ll let you get some sleep.

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, I’m prepping for tomorrow’s 
           meeting with the Prime Minister.

                Charlotte opens the door to REVEAL her coterie of aides 
                standing by.   

                        FRED
           Ah.  
                              (then)
           Um, but can we just... for a 
           second...

                Fred motions to the door.  Charlotte shuts it.

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           I want to apologize for my remarks 
           earlier.

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (enjoying this)
           No, listen, I’m just glad to know 
           if I ever weaken and attempt to 
           seduce you, your superior self-
           control would save us both.

                        FRED
           No no, I wouldn’t say--

                Fred stops.

                        FRED (CONT'D)
           Quitting while I’m ahead.

                Fred leaves on the high note.

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, PASSENGER AISLE - NIGHT

                Fred reclines at the end of this long day.  The OVERHEAD 
                LIGHT of the passenger next to him suddenly clicks on.  
                It’s MINDY, a second-tier aide.  30’s, nerdy cute, hyper.

                        MINDY
           So who are you, exactly?

                        FRED
           I’m an old friend of the 
           Secretary.
                        MINDY
           Oh, that makes sense.  I thought 
           maybe you were some ousted eastern 
           bloc official, or like an autistic 
           Cal Tech professor.

                Fred has no viable response to this obnoxiousness.

                        MINDY (CONT’D)
           So on a scale of one to ten, how 
           in love with her are you?

                        FRED
           She and I are old friends.  

                        MINDY
           Your point being?

                        FRED
           I don’t love her.  I’m helping her 
           with the Riyadh talk.

                        MINDY
           Every man loves Charlotte Field.

                Fred quickly evaluates Mindy, then replies:

                        FRED
           Yeah, I get why guys are into her.  
           The classic good looks, the 
           illusion of approachability, the 
           intimidating resume.  That’s all 
           nice in an obvious way, but I 
           prefer women with more distinctive 
           character contours.

                Mindy evaluates Fred, then:

                        MINDY
           No.  You’re full of shit.  But a 
           genuinely nice try.  I see why she 
           brought you in on her speech.

                Mindy turns off her overhead light.

                INT. FRED’S KASHMIR HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

                Fred enters, drops his bag and COLLAPSES onto the bed, 
                utterly exhausted from the 8,000 mile flight.  

                Amanda enters.

                        AMANDA
           Secretary’s ready for you.
                        FRED
           What?

                        AMANDA
           She’d wants to keep going on the 
           speech until her meeting starts.

                        FRED
           We just flew one third the 
           circumference of the earth.  She 
           doesn’t need to freshen up?

                        AMANDA
           She looks the same with or without 
           sleep and makeup.

                        FRED
                              (realizing)
           So do I.

                Amanda gives Fred a hand, pulling him up off the bed.

                EXT. KASHMIR VALLEY - DAY

                Fred and Charlotte stroll the BREATHTAKINGLY LUSH AND 
                UNSPOILED LANDSCAPE as they hash out the speech. 

                        FRED
           How can this be a global flash 
           point?  It’s the most beautiful, 
           peaceful place I’ve ever seen.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Look behind you.

                Fred sees that their stroll is protected by a TANK and a 
                phalanx of INDIAN SPECIAL FORCES.

                        FRED
           Yeah, that makes more sense.

                        CHARLOTTE
           How does paragraph 2 read now?

                        FRED
                              (reading aloud)
           “We acknowledge that the United 
           States has in recent times failed 
           to live up to its own high 
           standards for human rights.  The 
           torture and abuse witnessed at Abu 
           Ghraib endures as a shameful--”

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, no - you can’t use that word.  
                        FRED
           What word?

                        CHARLOTTE
           “Torture.”

                        FRED
           But that’s the whole point.  This 
           is an acknowledgement of our own--

                        CHARLOTTE
           If we call the U.S. a torturing 
           nation, the speech won’t get past 
           the White House.  

                        FRED
           Okay, instead of “torture”, how 
           about “inverse tickling”?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Come on, Fred.  It’s just a little 
           too bold.  I warned you this would 
           be a balancing act.

                        FRED
           I understand.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Good.

                        FRED
           I mean, you’ve done well in life, 
           and it hasn’t been because of your 
           renegade nature.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           What’s that supposed to mean?  

                        FRED
           You were a straight A student, you 
           married your high school 
           sweetheart, and you went into the 
           family business.  You’re the most 
           powerful woman on earth, and 
           you’re still afraid to rock the 
           boat.

                        CHARLOTTE
           So I ask you to change a word, and 
           you vivisect my entire psyche?  
           That’s quite an ego lurking behind 
           all the charming self-deprecation.
                        FRED
           I’m just saying get some balls.  
           If you learn to be confrontational 
           and rebellious, you can become 
           master of the universe - like me.

                Charlotte laughs.  

                        FRED (CONT’D)
                              (makes a note)
           Alright, I’ll strike the word.  
           “Abuse” is broad enough to--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred.

                        FRED
           Yes?

                Charlotte points.  They have reached a VISTA at the banks 
                of a stream rushing down from the snow-covered HIMALAYAS, 
                which are suddenly before them.  The most spectacular 
                natural formations on earth.  Fred’s in awe.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Your first time? 

                Fred nods.  It’s been an intense 24 hours.  He sits down.   *

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           Fred?

                Members of the security team move toward them, but 
                Charlotte signals to stay back.  A few TEARS escape from 
                Fred’s eyes.  Charlotte, moved, sits with Fred.  

                        FRED
           The closest I’ve come to seeing 
           something like that... was when I 
           took DMT.  
                              (off her confusion)
           A high-potency hallucinogen.  
                              (then)
           I saw these beautiful, snow-
           covered mountains towering over 
           the planet.  They spoke to me.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What did they say?

                Fred takes a moment to remember.  

                        FRED
           They said I should get my teeth 
           bleached.
                Charlotte FALLS BACKWARDS, laughing.

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           That’s actually what they said.

                Charlotte’ still laughing...

                INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

                Charlotte sits at the main table, directly between HIGH-
                RANKING OFFICERS from the Pakistani and Indian armies.  

                Fred’s at an overflow table next to Mindy, who is tipsy.

                        FRED
           Did they actually make progress?  

                        MINDY
           They’re pulling back on each side 
           by 250 miles.

                        FRED
           You’ve gotta be fucking kidding 
           me.

                        MINDY
           It has no bearing on what 
           terrorists and paramilitary groups 
           choose to do.

                        FRED
           But that’s an incredible start.  
           The dominoes could fall right up 
           to our doorstep!

                Mindy shrugs. 

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           She made your planet safer.  That 
           kinda transcends jadedness, no?

                        MINDY
           Yes.  She’s God’s gift to mankind.

                        FRED
           How do you live at this level of 
           bitter jealousy?  Eventually won’t 
           your colon perforate?

                        MINDY
           I can handle it most of the time.  
           But ever since her husband made an 
           epic jackass of himself, men think 
           they have a chance; they’re even 
           more fawning than usual.  
                Mindy nods to the scene at Charlotte’s table:  Various 
                MALE DIGNITARIES muscle for Charlotte’s attention.

                        MINDY (CONT’D)
           She’s siphoning the male energy 
           from those who actually need it.

                Fred’s jaw drops as he witnesses Charlotte break off a 
                piece of nan, habitually reach across the table and mop 
                up sauce from the Pakistani GENERAL’S PLATE (hers being 
                clean), then eat it.  A moment later, Charlotte’s eyes 
                bulge when she realizes what she’s just done.  She scans 
                to see if anyone noticed.  She spots Fred looking at her.  
                She smiles and gives a little WAVE.  Fred waves back.  
                Mindy observes the interaction and seethes with jealousy.

                        MINDY (CONT’D)
                              (inching closer)
           What are you up to later?  You 
           wanna come check out my room?

                        FRED
           Your room?

                ON CHARLOTTE AND TOM

                They have a private moment.

                        CHARLOTTE
           At the risk of shallowness, the 
           clothing here is so gorgeous.  Why 
           can’t Westerners dress like this?

                        TOM
           Eh, everything just looks 
           different at 8,000 feet.
                              (then laughs, points)
           Except Mindy.

                Charlotte observes Mindy’s and Fred’s blatant flirtation, 
                and is momentarily shocked.  Then, recovering:

                        CHARLOTTE
           Well... she’s a gifted negotiator.  
           If she put that energy into her 
           work, she’d be running State.

                BACK TO FRED AND MINDY

                        MINDY
           So what do you think?

                        FRED
           Listen, I don’t know if...
                Fred looks back at Charlotte who has reengaged with the 
                male world leaders surrounding her.  He turns to Mindy:

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           You know what?  Why not?
                              (then)
           But just for expectations 
           management, I’ll be pretty honest 
           and tell you it’s been a year 
           since I’ve had sex.  

                        MINDY
           How long’s it been if you were 
           really honest?

                        FRED
           Two years.  

                        MINDY
           So... three, then?

                        FRED
           As the crow flies.  So the first 
           time’s gonna be quick, but the 
           second should be fine.
                              (then)
           Though there’ll be about two hours 
           in between.  

                        MINDY
           You’re quite the stallion.

                        FRED
           I’m not especially virile, but my 
           pillow talk is devastating. 

                        MINDY
                              (leans in 
                               seductively)
           I like you.  Come by in an hour.

                Mindy gets up and quietly exits.  

                INT. FRED’S KASHMIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER

                Fred primps for the impending rendezvous.  There’s a 
                KNOCK at his door.  He answers to find Charlotte.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Hi, Fred.

                        FRED
           Oh, hi...  Are we working? 
                        CHARLOTTE
           I’d hoped to, but it looks like 
           you’ve got somewhere else to be.  
           Where you off to?

                        FRED
           I sense you know where.  And also 
           that you’re displeased.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Pretty serious lack of 
           professionalism, don’t you think?  

                        FRED
           I’m not a professional.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           You’re here in a professional 
           capacity.  My staff is already 
           irritated by your presence, and 
           now you’re about to create more 
           awkwardness?

                        FRED
           I’m pretty sure none of this is 
           your business.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Excuse me?

                        FRED
           I can exist happily in the second-
           tier of your royal court, but 
           during off-duty hours, I’m my own 
           man.  No one controls me.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I see.  And Mindy is worth it?

                        FRED
           For the next two hours, I suspect 
           she’ll do quite nicely, so--
                              (snapping out of it)
           Wait... Okay, I swear this all 
           feels like flirting.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What?

                        FRED
           You’re in my room in the middle of 
           the night having a 16 year old’s 
           argument.
                        CHARLOTTE
           That’s completely... 
                              (flustered)
           That is just completely...

                Charlotte notices a distant FLASH OF LIGHT though Fred’s 
                window.  Lightning?  Fred turns to look.  Out in the 
                MOONLIT FIELD a PEASANT walks beside his YAK.  A sudden 
                SCREECHING SOUND and the yak EXPLODES. 

                        FRED
           AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH!!!

                        CHARLOTTE
           That’s a rocket.

                The valley LIGHTS UP with ROCKETS.  ALARMS blare.  

                        FRED
           Holy shit!  Holy shit!!

                DS agents rush in.  

                        AGENT FORESTER
           Ma’am, we’re evacuating.  The 
           hotel is under attack.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yep, I can see that.  

                We TRACK WITH Charlotte, Fred and the Agents as they move 
                swiftly through the corridors and out of the building.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           I’m sorry, Fred, but I don’t see 
           what’s childish in my effort to 
           maintain order on my staff.  

                        FRED
                              (completely freaked)
           Good point.  Are we going to die?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Unlikely.  The fire looked random.  
           Probably teenage bandits with 
           1970’s RPG launchers.  I wasn’t 
           flirting, I was observing your 
           unprofessional behavior.  You have 
           to admit it’s a pattern with you.

                        FRED
           It doesn’t matter.  I’ve gained a 
           new clarity due to my impending 
           death, and I realize that I have 
           no attraction to Mindy.  
                Fred is RIGHT IN MINDY’S FACE.  She’s SHATTERED.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh dear.

                        FRED
           Oh god!  Mindy, I--

                        MINDY
           Fred, it’s fine, it’s fine.

                KA-BOOM!!!  The whole building SHAKES!

                        FRED
           FUCK!!  FUCK!!  That hit!!

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, that’s outgoing tank fire. 

                At this point they are OUTSIDE, and LOADING INTO LARGE 
                HELICOPTERS.  The musical chairs game puts Fred in a seat 
                between Mindy and Charlotte.  The doors shut, the helo 
                lifts off, and suddenly, despite the noise, it feels very 
                quiet...

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, EXECUTIVE LOUNGE - DAY

                Charlotte and Tom review the morning briefing. 

                        TOM
           Did I see tears on Mindy’s face?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Let’s just say there was melodrama 
           and leave it alone.

                        TOM
           What has her so bewitched?  He’s 
           not exactly James Bond.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Don’t discount Fred.  He’s got 
           something.

                        TOM
                              (intrigued)
           Really.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Well, you know... He’s 
           independent, he’s funny, and he’s 
           frighteningly smart.  
                              (laughs)
           And sometimes he’s so brave it 
           almost looks like stupidity.  
                        (MORE)
                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           He’s very in touch with himself.  
           He knows exactly what his issues 
           are, and he can laugh at them - 
           which is so rare.  And he’s even 
           handsome in his slovenly way. I 
           know he can take a dark and 
           cynical tone, but it’s the kind of 
           cynicism I think really just 
           protects a romantic interior.  
           He’s sort of part H.L. Mencken, 
           part Lord Byron.

                Charlotte suddenly realizes how long she’s been talking.  
                Tom is SPEECHLESS.  

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           What?

                Tom gets up.  

                        TOM
           I’m gonna get my organization 
           charts together.  I’ll give you an 
           hour to, uh, collect yourself.

                Tom exits.  Charlotte, a basket case, lies down on her 
                couch, and pulls a blanket completely over her head.

                INT. SECRETARY’S PLANE, PASSENGER AISLE - DAY

                Fred waves to Amanda as she makes her way down the aisle.

                        FRED
           Hi.  Do you know when The 
           Secretary and I are meeting today?  

                        AMANDA
                              (quickly glances at 
                               her folio)
           You’re not on her schedule.  

                        FRED
           For the entire 15 hour flight?

                        AMANDA
           Right.  

                Fred nods.  Got it.  It’s over. 

                INT. LAX AIRPORT - DAY

                Fred, depressed and travel weary, lumbers off the ramp 
                into the terminal.  He gets a CALL on his cell.  We TRACK 
                with Fred as he walks through the concourse.
                        FRED
           Hello?

                INT. CHARLOTTE’S WASHINGTON OFFICE - SAME

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s Charlotte.

                        FRED
           Oh.  Hi.  Wasn’t sure I’d hear 
           from you again.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I couldn’t face you on the plane.  
           I was so embarrassed by my 
           behavior in your room the other 
           night.  I was childish and 
           inappropriate.  I humiliated 
           myself.

                        FRED
           If you say so.  I don’t personally 
           know what humiliation looks like, 
           but I can imagine it’s unpleasant.  

                Charlotte laughs.

                        CHARLOTTE
           So listen.  My staff is growing.  
           We’ve created a special management 
           post for Tom, so he no longer has 
           time for writing supervision.  
           Ellen Attie takes over that role, 
           which leaves an opening for a new 
           full-time speech-writer.  

                Fred waits for more.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           Fred?  That means you.  What do 
           you think?

                        FRED
           I... I’d love that.  
                              (then)
           I get the sense Tom dislikes me.

                        CHARLOTTE
           You make him nervous, but you can 
           help that.  Trim the beard, buy a 
           suit made in the post-Cold War 
           era, don’t make anyone else on the 
           staff cry.  We leave Wednesday.
                        FRED
           Where to?

                        CHARLOTTE
           On this non-secure connection, 
           we’ll say it’s a wine tour of the 
           Loire Valley.

                        FRED
           Sound glamorous.  I’ll see you 
           soon.  

                They hang up.  Fred finds himself now ON THE SIDEWALK 
                outside the terminal.  He was heading for the taxis, 
                but... is there a point in going home?  He shrugs to 
                himself, turns around, and heads BACK INTO THE AIRPORT.

                EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY, THE SUDAN - DAY

                An ARMORED CONVOY traverses a lonely, rugged road.   

                TITLE: NORTHERN DARFUR, THE SUDAN

                INT. VAN - SAME

                Fred is with Charlotte and entourage.  SMOKE rises from a 
                village in the distance.  Charlotte sees Fred’s anxiety.

                        CHARLOTTE
           On the plus side, we’re staying at 
           a gorgeous hotel in Dubai tonight.

                        FRED
           The wine tour would’ve been nicer.

                        CHARLOTTE
           This is going to suck.  The 
           attacks are only five days old. 
                              (pointedly to Fred)
           But what we see today becomes the 
           basis of my address to President 
           Bashir at the U.N. summit.  I’m 
           determined for this to be the year 
           we get a coherent policy on Sudan.

                        FRED
           Why the rush?  It’s only been 10 
           years.
                EXT. VILLAGE, DARFUR - DAY

                Charlotte and company are on a walking tour of a 
                DESTROYED DESERT VILLAGE, led by the MAYOR, a striking 
                man in flowing robes, who speaks English well.  

                        MAYOR
           This house belonged to the Mashar 
           family, close friends of mine.  

                It’s pile of CHARRED STICKS.  Fred is beset by the 
                visions of horror in all directions.  

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (re: depressions in 
                               the ground)
           These craters can’t be from mortar 
           shells.  They look like 500 pound 
           bombs.

                        MAYOR
           Yes, this time, no men with jeeps  
           or camels.  Just A-5.

                        AMANDA
                              (to Fred)
           Chinese war planes.

                Fred spots a TEDDY BEAR, slightly charred but in okay 
                condition, beneath a twisted bed frame.  He grabs it.  

                        FRED
           It’s still intact - can someone 
           get it to the Mashar family?  

                The Mayor looks at Fred.  

                        MAYOR
           The Mashar family no longer 
           exists.  Please take it.  Show it 
           to President Chambers.  

                Fred is shattered.  The group moves on, as Fred stands 
                and stares at this ghastly mausoleum.  Finally he pulls 
                himself away and rejoins the group. 

                They come upon a DEAD HORSE.  It’s mostly intact, though 
                its EYEBALLS are in advanced state of decay.  Fred’s 
                STAGGERS, then doubles over and PUKES.  Charlotte 
                notices, but stays on track and lets Amanda tend to Fred.

                They come upon a sea of small, charred SCHOOL DESKS in 
                the middle of nothingness.  Some have charred books atop 
                them.
                        MAYOR (CONT’D)
           This was the elementary school.

                The spookiest image yet.  Fred’s on the verge of LOSING 
                IT.  He’s mildly HYPERVENTILATING.  Amanda and Tom 
                exchange looks of concern.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Did any children survive the 
           attacks?

                        MAYOR
           Several.  They were collecting 
           water from a well two kilometers 
           north, outside the blast radius.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Can we meet them? 

                        MAYOR
           If you’d like.  They’re in school 
           now.

                The Mayor points to a DISTANT, LONE ACACIA TREE.  Several 
                CHILDREN sit beneath it, as a TEACHER lectures.  

                By now, Fred is quietly SOBBING, Charlotte notices, but 
                again, stays on track and lets Amanda tend to Fred.

                        AMANDA
                              (offering a bottle)
           Fred, drink.

                        FRED
           I’m okay.  I’m okay.

                        AMANDA
           It’s 100 degrees, you need to stay 
           hydrated.  

                Fred drinks, and clings to his teddy bear.  The group 
                reaches the “school” - FIVE CHILDREN and a TEACHER.

                WITH SUBTITLES:

                        MAYOR
                              (in tribal Fur)
           These are our friends from the 
           United States.  Say hello to them 
           in English.

                        CHILDREN
                              (in unison)
           Good morning!
                The children’s cheer in the midst of unspeakable tragedy 
                is moving - even Charlotte looks strained.  

                A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL points to Fred:  

                        BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL
                              (laughing)
           Jùtà!  Jùtà!

                        MAYOR
                              (to Fred)
           You have a thick beard like her 
           father’s.  She calls it “forest.”

                        FRED
           What a sweet little girl.  Did we 
           meet her father?

                        MAYOR
           No, her parents were vaporized in 
           last week’s attack.

                Fred FALLS to the ground, HOWLING, clinging to his Teddy 
                Bear.  The children - and the adults - behold Fred’s 
                explosive grief in quiet sympathy.  It’s undignified, but 
                at some level maybe a little refreshing, too.

                INT. FRED’S HOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

                Fred’s having a drink, writing his draft of the address 
                to Bashir.  He’s fried - by sun and life.  A KNOCK at the 
                door.  Fred opens the door to find Charlotte.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I just wanted to make sure you 
           were alright.

                        FRED
           I don’t know if I was helpful to 
           the children.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m sure it was the first time 
           they’ve seen a member of the U.S. 
           government shed a tear for them.  
           Listen, I just finished work, I 
           need a drink and some company.
                        FRED
           Really?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Everyone else seems to be in their 
           rooms weeping and vomiting.  You 
           managed to get it out of your 
           system earlier, so I figured you 
           might actually be in the mood.

                        FRED
           Always.  Let me just put my shoe--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Let’s just have one here.  It’s 
           easier. 

                INT. FRED’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

                Charlotte and Fred have drinks in the living room area.

                        CHARLOTTE
           So.

                        FRED
           So.

                        CHARLOTTE
           How’s your drink?

                        FRED
           It’s good.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Good.

                Silence.

                        FRED
                              (re: having drinks)
           You suggested this, right?

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (laughs)
           What, are you not having fun?

                        FRED
           No.  It’s too loud and relaxing.  
           Maybe we could make it quieter and 
           more stressful?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, why haven’t you ever been 
           married?
                        FRED
           I... uh, I’m not sure I unders--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Just answer the question.

                Fred takes a moment to conjure the answer.

                        FRED
           Because I only want to do it once. 

                Charlotte considers this, then suddenly starts to CRY.

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (wiping her tears)
           I’m sorry.

                        FRED
           It’s okay.  What’s going on?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I don’t think I love my husband 
           anymore.  
                              (sobbing)
           I don’t think I ever did.

                        FRED
           Oh dear.  That’s intense.  I... 
           um... Do you have anyone you can 
           talk to about these things?  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yes, but...  Lately I keep feeling 
           like the person I want to talk to 
           is you.  And then I think, that’s 
           the problem.  

                        FRED
           I don’t understand.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I don’t know.  
                              (sobbing more)
           I think I have a crush on you?

                Fred hangs in SUSPENDED ANIMATION.

                        FRED
           What?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I have a crush on you.

                Fred tries to keep from falling over as his head REELS.
                        FRED
           Oh...  Oh.
                              (then)
           Wait, when you say you have a--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred.  Yes.

                        FRED
           Okay... Well... that’s not a bad 
           thing.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I can’t ever do anything about it.

                        FRED
           That’s not necessarily true.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, believe me, I can’t.

                        FRED
           Madame Sec... Uh, look, can I call  
           you Charlotte at this point?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Definitely not.

                        FRED
           Okay, then.  Madame Secretary, 
           have you ever done anything 
           morally questionable, or even just 
           ill-advised, in your life?

                        CHARLOTTE
           No.  Have you?

                        FRED
           Of course.  I’m a human being. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m a human being.

                        FRED
           No.  Actual human beings fail.  
           They have flaws, and yield to 
           impulses.  You not only haven’t 
           ever done that, you’ve created a 
           life in which you couldn’t even if 
           you wanted to.  There’s a man with 
           gun on the other side of that 
           door.  You’re surrounded at all 
           times by people impossible to let 
           down or be human in front of.
                        CHARLOTTE
           I see.

                Charlotte thinks for several moments, then RIPS OPEN HER 
                BLOUSE.  Fred considers it, then:

                        FRED
           That was a bit studied, but for 
           you, it’s progress.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Thank you.

                Fred grabs Charlotte and KISSES her.  After several 
                passionate moments, they take a breather.  They both seem 
                a million miles away.  Finally:

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           What are you thinking?

                        FRED
           I’m just picturing myself at age 
           11, picturing myself in the 
           future, kissing you.  I didn’t 
           picture it happening like this, 
           and I wish that I had, because 
           there’s something amazing about 
           when things end up happening 
           exactly the way you always 
           pictured it. Does that make sense?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I think so.

                        FRED
           What were you thinking?

                        CHARLOTTE
           That this is the first time I’ve 
           kissed someone other than my 
           husband in 22 years.

                        FRED
           Wow.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Do you think there’s any chance we 
           can do this, and not be too inside 
           our own heads?

                        FRED
           Based on my observation of us, no. 

                Charlotte LEAPS ONTO FRED, knocking him onto the bed, and 
                they are off and running.  After a few moments, 
                Charlotte, breathless, suddenly stops the kissing:
                        CHARLOTTE
           I need to warn you...

                        FRED
           Yes?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I just... it’s been a while.  The 
           first time might go a little fast.

                Something wild is going on in Fred’s eyes.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           Fred?  Fred are you...

                A little TEAR OF JOY escapes from Fred’s eye.  

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           Fred?

                        FRED
           Sorry, got overwhelmed for a 
           second.  I’m good.  

                Fred grabs Charlotte like an animal, and this time 
                they’re really off and running...

                INT. FRED’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

                Charlotte and Fred are in bed, sweaty and breathless.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I can’t believe I got laid!

                        FRED
           You can’t believe?  How do you 
           think I feel?  I just had sex with 
           you. Can you imagine such a thing?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I can’t.  It’s too implausible.

                        FRED
           We both lasted about ninety 
           seconds - does that count?  

                        CHARLOTTE
           No.  I need to go again.  

                        FRED
           Seriously?
                        CHARLOTTE
           Do you have any idea how long it’s 
           been since I’ve had sex?  Since 
           I’ve had good sex?

                        FRED
           You think I’m good? 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred.  Oh my god.  I want you to 
           make love to me right now.  
                              (grabbing him)
           I want you to fuck me. 

                        FRED
           Holy shit!  You’re out of control!

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (giddy)
           I’m out of control!
                              (grabs his face)
           Do you know how long I’ve wanted 
           to fuck you? 

                        FRED
           No!  How long?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Since that night in LA. 

                        FRED
           Are you serious??  I was going--

                        CHARLOTTE
           FRED!  Just please fuck me!  

                        FRED
                              (getting on top)
           I’m on it!
                              (then)
           Can I call you “Madame Secretary”?

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (wincing)
           No, don’t.  My husband does that.  
           It’s cheesy.  I’m sorry!

                        FRED
           No, totally, you’re right.  
           Christ, I forgot you were marr--

                        CHARLOTTE
           I want you to take me from behind.  

                        FRED
           What??
                        CHARLOTTE
           I want it from behind.  Be rough 
           this time.  Please, Fred--

                        FRED
           Whoa! No no no.  I can’t do that.

                        CHARLOTTE
           You don’t like it that way?

                        FRED
           No, I do.  I just... I can’t do 
           that with you.  I mean, you’re...

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh god, is it because I’m older 
           than you?

                Fred LAUGHS HIS HEAD OFF.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           What??

                        FRED
           I have too much respect.  I mean 
           you’re you!  Come on!

                        CHARLOTTE
           If you respect me, you’ll do what 
           I ask.

                Fred falls onto his back and shouts at the ceiling:

                        FRED
           I’m so fucking happy!

                INT. BURJ AL ARAB LOBBY - LATER

                Fred, joyfully trots off the elevator and heads for the 
                exit where the American delegation is gathering to leave.

                        VOICE (O.S.)
           Flarksy?

                Fred turns around to see Connor (Wembley’s aide). 

                        FRED
           Connor!  

                Connor stares at Fred, perplexed - what could this wretch 
                possibly be doing in the Burj Al Arab?

                        FRED (CONT'D)
           What a wonderful surprise!  How’ve 
           you been?  How’s your boss?
                        CONNOR
           Wembley’s quite well.  I’m here 
           closing a sizeable deal for him.  
           Despite your crusade, somehow the 
           company’s heart still beats.

                        FRED
                              (shrugs)
           Yeah, I’ve got no follow-through.

                        CONNOR
           What are you doing here?

                        FRED
           I work with Charlotte Field.  She 
           and Wembley have similar taste in 
           speech writers.  Go figger.

                        CONNOR
           Well congratulations on getting to 
           work with your girlfriend.

                        FRED
           What??

                        CONNOR
           She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she?  
           I recall you disliking Wembley’s 
           “ungentlemanly tone” about her.

                        FRED
           Right.  Yes.  She’s my girlfriend.  
           We just had sex an hour ago.

                        CONNOR
           You’re a sad little guy, Flarksy.

                        FRED
           First to admit it.  Well, please 
           tell the root of all human 
           suffering I said hello.

                Fred cheerfully turns on his heel and leaves.

                CNN FOOTAGE of Charlotte descending the boarding stairs 
                as she is greeted by NORTH KOREAN DIGNITARIES.

                        CNN NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
           Secretary Field touched down in 
           the North Korean capitol, where 
           American journalist, Harold Park, 
           has been detained on charges of 
           spying.  The meeting is expected 
           to be a formality, and Mr. Park’s 
           release a foregone conclusion.  
           White House and State Department 
           spokesmen stress that the visit 
           will not address other ongoing 
           disputes with North Korea, such as 
           weapons programs and shots fired 
           across the DMZ.

           shares with the western 
           hemisphere.

                LAUGHTER from the press corps.

                EXT. PYONGYANG - DAY

                The American delegation gets a formal tour of North 
                Korea’s freaky showcase capitol.  They are flanked by 
                GOVERNMENT MINDERS - creepy men with nervous expressions.   *
                The TOUR LEADER, like most visible residents of 
                Pyongyang, is a groveling, brainwashed automaton.  

                Charlotte is flanked by Fred, who, THROUGHOUT THE SCENE, 
                COMMENTS TO HER IN SUBTLE WHISPERS.
                        TOUR LEADER
           This is the Pyongyang Ice rink.  
           It is one of the most beautiful 
           buildings on earth.  I will tell 
           you who made this glorious 
           creation possible:

                        FRED
                              (to Charlotte, 
                               guessing)
           The construction workers?

                        TOUR LEADER
           The Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, the 
           greatest general in the history of 
           mankind!

                        FRED
           My second guess. 

                Charlotte, despite the URGE TO LAUGH, maintains poise.  

                The group reaches a new landmark:

                        TOUR LEADER
           This is a statue of the beloved 
           father, Kim Il Sung.  As you can 
           see, it is extremely beautiful.  I 
           will tell you who blessed the 
           world with the world this great 
           treasure:

                        FRED
           The little gay kid from “Who’s The 
           Boss?”

                        TOUR LEADER
           The Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il.  We 
           praise him!

                        FRED
           Right but he got the idea from the 
           gay kid.

                Charlotte involuntarily lets loose an ENORMOUS LAUGHTER 
                SNORT.  Everyone turns to look.  She is in shock.  Tom, 
                understanding what’s just happened, steps in:

                        TOM
                              (hands her a tissue)
           Bless you, Madame Secretary.

                Tom gives Fred a quick GLARE.  The Tour continues...
                INT. NORTH KOREAN PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

                A post-dinner RECEPTION for the State Department 
                delegation is underway.  DIGNITARIES abound.   

                PALACE STAFFERS present the CHEF to Charlotte.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s wonderful to meet you!  The 
           meal was fabulous.  The best 
           incentive yet for improved U.S.-
           DPRK relations.

                        PALACE CHEF
                              (laughs)
           You are very welcome, Madame 
           Secretary.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Where did you learn to cook like 
           that?

                        PALACE CHEF
           The people of our republic have 
           only one teacher, one man to  
           thank for all wisdom and fortune--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh dear.  Yes, well he’s quite 
           something.  
                              (ends the encounter)
           So nice to meet you.  

                Once the staffers and the chef depart, Tom and Charlotte 
                have a relatively private moment.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           How is it possible to brainwash an 
           entire country in which no one has 
           a television?

                        TOM
           What’s with you and Flarksy?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Nothing.

                        TOM
           If you say so.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I do.
                        TOM
           And you remember that you have to 
           be in control not just of yourself 
           but the public perception of 
           yourself, right?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Tom.  I’m deeply in love with my 
           husband, and what you’re 
           insinuating is offensive.

                Tom smiles - well played.  He ambles off.  

                Charlotte catches up with Fred.  Their strict restraint 
                from smiling, combined with the HIGH NOISE LEVEL OF THE 
                ROOM, allows them to say what they want, right in the 
                midst of HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           I think I might have to have tell 
           Tom about us. 

                        FRED
           About the fact that we’re having 
           sexual intercourse?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yes.  Don’t know if you glanced at 
           the itinerary, but you’ll be 
           fucking me on the rug in my suite 
           tonight.

                        FRED
           Yes, I pleasured myself to that 
           thought about 20 times this week.

                Charlotte allows the tiniest SMILE.  

                        FRED (CONT’D)
           By the way, I didn’t think it was 
           possible to hate this country 
           more, but it is.  This whole thing 
           is a goat-rape.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           How do you mean? 

                        FRED
           I mean the taxpayers spent three 
           million dollars to send us here so 
           that asshole 
                              (re: the NORTH KOREAN 
                               PRESIDENT across the 
                               room)
                        (MORE)
                        FRED (CONT'D)
           can get his picture taken with 
           you, and he doesn’t have to yield 
           an inch on nuclear weapons?  What 
           did we get for our money?

                        CHARLOTTE
           The repatriation of an American 
           citizen.

                        FRED
           So we’re a glorified FedEx.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Believe me, I would have preferred 
           actual engagement, but Chambers 
           wanted something he knew couldn’t 
           fail.  He personally gave me the 
           marching orders: a simple, pro 
           forma hostage resolution.

                        FRED
           I sometimes worry that your 
           respect for marching orders might 
           keep you from the extent of 
           greatness you were destined for.

                This stings.  Charlotte goes deep into her brain for 
                several moments.  Finally she emerges.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           You’re completely right.

                        FRED
           Maybe that was a little harsh, I--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Excuse me.

                Charlotte turns and marches toward the President.  Fred 
                watches with mixture of pride and “what did I just do?”

                INT. AMANDA’S PYONGYANG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

                Amanda is awoken by her cell phone. 

                        AMANDA
           Hello?

                        WOMAN (V.O.)
           It’s Dorothy from The President’s 
           office.
                INT. CHARLOTTE’S PYONGYANG SUITE - SAME

                Charlotte and Fred lie quietly, half-naked on a rug in 
                front of a roaring fireplace.  Fred looks contemplative.

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (re: his mind)
           What’s going on in there? 

                        FRED
           Well... there’s something we 
           haven’t discussed yet.

                        CHARLOTTE
           By any chance, would it be... 
           about the last night I babysat 
           you?

                        FRED
           Yes!

                        CHARLOTTE
           That was a bold move, kid.  I was 
           15.  Your testes hadn’t even 
           descended.

                        FRED
           It was totally inappropriate.  If 
           it’s not too late, I offer my 
           apologies. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Well, to be completely honest... 
           it turned me on a little.

                        FRED
           Seriously?  Okay, do you happen to 
           remember if... if when I put my--

                Charlotte silences him, and puts his HAND ON HER LEFT 
                BREAST:

                        CHARLOTTE
           Feel familiar?

                Fred falls back and DIES with delight.

                INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

                Tom and Amanda, approach Agent Charles in a panic.

                        TOM
           We need to speak with the 
           Secretary.  
                        AGENT CHARLES
           She’s indisposed at the moment.

                        TOM
           The White House is trying to reach 
           her.

                        AGENT CHARLES
           I’m sorry, Mr. Stimson.  

                        TOM
           Agent Charles, I’m saying that the 
           President wants to talk to her.  

                We hear CHARLOTTE’S MOANS AND GROANS.

                       TOM (CONT’D)
                                                    AMANDA
                Oh my god.  
                                           No way.

                        TOM (CONT’D)
           Okay, we’ve gotta stop this.  
           Please, just knock on the door.

                More MOANS.  LOUDER.

                        AGENT CHARLES
           My job is to protect her from 
           physical harm.  This is not within 
           my purview.

                Hard SHAKING, more MOANS and YELPS.  

                        TOM
           I respect that.  But I’m asking 
           you as a human being to consider--

                HARDER SHAKING, SCREAMS AND HOWLS.  

                        TOM (CONT’D)
           --that this situation is 
           extraordinary.

                The shaking gets FASTER, the screams get LOUDER.

                        AGENT CHARLES
           Mr. Stimson, I don’t like being in 
           this position.  It’s extremely 
           uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, I 
           have a sworn obligation.

                The shaking gets VIOLENT.  The screams PRIMAL.

                        AMANDA
           Are we sure that’s sex?  
                        TOM
           Agent Charles, they’re completely 
           out of control.  What if they have 
           an accident?  This constitutes a 
           bodily threat to The Secretary.  
           You’re looking at potential 
           dereliction.

                Furniture is KNOCKED OVER, GLASSES CRASH!!  That crossed 
                the line.  With profound regret, Agent Charles approaches 
                the door and POUNDS on it.  The sex goes INSTANTLY 
                SILENT.

                        CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
           Um... Hello?  

                Agent Charles doesn’t know what to say.  Tom steps up:

                        TOM
                              (shouts at the door)
           It’s Tom!

                        CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
           Tom, I’m not feeling well, can 
           this wait? 

                        TOM
           The President’s rather upset - you 
           approached the General on ICBM’s.

                        CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
           Shiiiiiiit.

                        TOM
           Why don’t you and Fred get dressed 
           and we can talk?

                        CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
           Fred?  Fred’s not with me.  I have 
           no idea what you’re...
                              (sighs)
           Right.  Okay...

                INT. CHARLOTTE’S PYONGYANG SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

                Fred, Amanda, Charlotte and Tom are all gathered.  
                Charlotte waits for Tom to kick things off.  Tom is so 
                UPSET that he’s taking extra time to collect himself.

                        TOM
           Okay... I... Okay...  Charlotte, 
           why did you corner the General on 
           prohibited issues?
                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s completely ridiculous that 
           we’re having this historic 
           meeting, and all we’re getting is 
           a tour of their fucking ice rink. 

                        TOM
           Lots of things are ridiculous.  
           Why did you act on it? 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Well, Fred pointed out that if I--

                        TOM
           “Fred pointed out”?  I see.  So 
           basically, you rattled the nuclear 
           saber to show off for your 
           boyfriend.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I didn’t rattle any saber.  I 
           suggested setting a date for a 
           preliminary talks.  That’s all.

                        TOM
           You told The General we haven’t 
           taken first strike off the table!

                        FRED
           You did that?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I only implied it.

                        FRED
           Oh boy.

                        TOM
           Don’t blame yourself, Fred.  
           Global security’s nice, but a 
           man’s gotta have romance!

                        CHARLOTTE
           Okay, Tom.  We get it.  

                        TOM
           If you got it, you wouldn’t be in 
           this situation.  India-Pakistan-
           Afghanistan, Israel-Gaza-Syria-
           Lebanon, Iran, North Korea.  They 
           don’t listen to the President, 
           they listen to you.  For all 
           intents and purposes, you are the 
           president.  
                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh god, please, Tom, don’t do--

                        TOM
           And if you’re undermined by a 
           tawdry hotel room romp, Jesus 
           Christ we are fucked. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s not tawdry.

                        FRED
           She’s right about that.  If you’re 
           looking for cheap sex, you don’t 
           choose a guy like me, no offense.
                              (then)
           I mean, to me.

                        TOM
           Oh good, so it’s not “tawdry.”  We 
           should be fine then!

                        CHARLOTTE
           Tom, until this, I hadn’t had sex 
           in three years.

                        TOM
           I understand the unique burden of 
           your job, but--

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, not the job.  My marriage.  
           It’s dead.

                        TOM
           I know.  And unfortunately you 
           can’t get a divorce right now.  It 
           destroys the brand.
                              (before she can 
                               speak)
           And don’t play innocent on that.  
           You are a brand.  We depend on it.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Okay.  But I’m also 38 years old.  
           I’ve got two years left in office, 
           and I can’t go a cumulative five 
           years in my sexual prime without 
           sex.  At the risk of being 
           immodest, it would be a tragedy to 
           let this body go to waste.  
                              (to Fred)
           Wouldn’t you say?

                        FRED
           She’s right.  It’s astonishing.
                        AMANDA
           Mrs. Field, just looking ahead, 
           divorce won’t actually be an 
           option when your tenure as 
           secretary ends.  The operating 
           assumption is you’ll be running 
           for president.

                        CHARLOTTE
           According to Tom I already won.

                        TOM
           Madame Secr--

                        CHARLOTTE
           So with a campaign and two terms, 
           I’d have to wait until... 2024 to 
           experience satisfaction in my 
           personal life?

                        AMANDA
           That’s a worst case scenario.

                        TOM
           Can we deal with the present?  
           Right now four people know about 
           this, not including the DS agents.  
           Already that’s too many.  We need 
           to get Fred out of here.  This 
           ends now.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Okay.  Just give us five minutes.

                        TOM
           Two minutes.

                Tom and Amanda exit.  Charlotte and Fred are alone.  Fred 
                looks shaken.

                        CHARLOTTE
           You okay?

                        FRED
           It’s never a nice feeling when you  
           escalate the risk of a nuclear 
           attack.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, no - my mistakes are mine.

                        FRED
           And..  I guess I was surprised by 
           the way you characterized our 
           relationship just now.  It sounded 
           very... sexual.  
                        CHARLOTTE
           How would you describe our 
           relationship?  “Avuncular”?

                        FRED
           I couldn’t tell if there was also, 
           you know, any emotion involved.

                        CHARLOTTE
           You and I barely know each other.  
           For all we know, there’s nothing 
           real here.  Maybe it is just 
           “tawdry.”

                Fred’s stung.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           Ugh.  I’m sorry.  Fred, of course 
           that’s not true, I... I...
                              (then)
           Can you just go easy on me?  I 
           mean, I just wanted to pay your 
           medical bills, the next thing I 
           know, the mid-life crisis I never 
           thought I’d have is in full 
           blossom.

                INT. BLACK SEDAN - NIGHT

                Fred’s being driven somewhere.  He’s on the cell with 
                Lance.

                        LANCE
           It’s good you got caught.  The 
           sooner this all gets out there, 
           the better.  She can get out of 
           that sham marriage, and the public 
           can get past it before 2016.

                        FRED
           It’s not getting “out there.”  It 
           stays quiet.  Going forward, I 
           don’t travel with them.  We’re not 
           to be seen in public together.

                        LANCE
           Oh...  
                              (changing course)
           Hey, I guess you won’t be around 
           for the petition drive next week.  
           We’re just 50,000 signatures shy.

                        FRED
           Let’s face it: I’m not the type a 
           stranger opens his door for.
                        LANCE
           Well shit.  Look what’s happened.  
           You’re in a relationship, and now 
           I don’t have you anymore.  I put 
           you in this thing, and what am I 
           left with?  A few crummy minutes 
           on a cell phone.  

                        FRED
           You deserve better.

                        LANCE
           Maybe when you and Charlotte get 
           out this way next, the four of us 
           get dinner? 

                        FRED
           You know I’d love that, but...

                        LANCE
           Yeah.  
                              (sighs)
           Probably not feasible.  
                              (then)
           I’m needy.  Tell me you love me. 

                        FRED
           Lance, you know if it wasn’t for 
           Charlotte, I’d come right over 
           there, strip you naked and have 
           you watch me make love to your 
           wife.

                        LANCE
           You better.

                EXT. FIELD COUNTRY ESTATE, DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

                Bucolic rural Virginia.  Fred’s sedan stops at a stately 
                colonial-era house.

                INT. FIELD GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

                An agent leads Fred into a room with a roaring fireplace.  

                        AGENT
           We need to restrict you to this 
           room until the Secretary arrives.  

                The agent shuts the door, and Fred’s alone...  

                He gives himself a tour - it’s the first time he’s been 
                in Charlotte’s personal space.  
                He arrives at a grouping of framed PHOTOS: Charlotte with 
                family and friends: GORBACHEV, BONO, she and KENT holding 
                hands in a meadow.  Fred stares hard at Kent, as if 
                trying to understand him.

                        FRED
                              (to Kent, sincerely)
           I hope you know it’s not personal.  
           I just really love fucking your 
           wife.  Even you deserve better 
           than that.  But what you’re going 
           to get is me fucking her more, and 
           this time, in your own bed.
                              (thinks, then)
           If this helps at all:

                Fred turns the photo away from the bed.

                INT. GUEST ROOM - LATE NIGHT

                Fred is asleep on the bed, still in his clothes.  We hear 
                distant POLICE SIREN YELPS.  Through the window, we see 
                the motorcade approaching.  Fred sleeps through it.

                INT. GUEST ROOM - LATER

                Charlotte has climbed into bed with Fred, who still 
                sleeps.  She’s in a sexy nightgown, blissfully eating 
                cherries, taking a moment of quiet for herself. 

                Deciding it’s time to rouse him, she takes a CHERRY STEM 
                and playfully strokes Fred’s face.  He does not stir.  
                She slowly inches the cherry stem UP HIS LEFT NOSTRIL.  
                No response.  A little deeper.  Nothing.  A little 
                deeper, a little deeper... 

                The stem is gone and she can’t retrieve it.  Charlotte 
                panics.  She gently shakes Fred.  He awakens peacefully 
                and starts to kiss her.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Sweetie, hold on--

                Fred just keeps kissing her.  

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           Fred, wait--

                Fred pulls away.  

                        FRED
           You can’t do this, can you?
                        CHARLOTTE
           No, no - I can.  It’s just...
                              (hands him a tissue)
           Blow your nose.

                Confused, Fred blows his nose and finds the cherry stem.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           I was being... coquettish?  

                Fred and Charlotte fall into each others arms...

                EXT. FIELD COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY

                Fred and Charlotte stroll through the verdant estate.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           My father bought this place for me 
           without asking.  

                        FRED
           That’s pretty presumptuous.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I took his choice for my husband 
           without much inquisitiveness, why 
           not real estate?  

                        FRED
           That’s why you married Kent?

                        CHARLOTTE
           You know me.  I do as I’m told.  
           The crazy thing is, in two decades 
           of unhappiness, I never gave any 
           thought to leaving him.

                        FRED
           So... how about these days?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Well, I dream about it, but in 
           practical terms, it’s impossible.

                        FRED
           You know, if we keep this up, 
           someone will find out.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Not if we’re careful.  Affairs 
           happen in Washington all the time.  

                        FRED
           Not with people as fascinating as 
           you.
                        CHARLOTTE
           Can we not talk about this and 
           just enjoy this weekend?

                They walk for a bit in silence.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           I didn’t mean to be petulant, it’s 
           just - I don’t know how to say 
           this without sounding grandiose: 
           there are five continents I’m 
           worried about.  I know that’s what 
           I signed up for, I just expected 
           more help.  I didn’t expect so 
           much to be expected of me.  If I 
           attempt a major restructuring of 
           my personal life, I’d have no room 
           left in my brain for much else.

                        FRED
           I’m not asking for anything.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I know.  I’m sorry.
                              (then)
           But Fred?

                        FRED
           Yes?

                Charlotte hooks her arm in Fred’s.

                        CHARLOTTE
           You’re my boyfriend.

                Fred beams.

                INT. CHARLOTTE’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

                Fred and Charlotte enjoy a romantic, candle-lit meal.

                        FRED
           Can I ask you something?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Anything.

                        FRED
           Why me?  There’s probably, like, a 
           dozen other guys you could have if 
           you really turned on the charm.

                Charlotte ponders for a moment.  
                        CHARLOTTE
           Because I pity you.

                        FRED
           Come on, I’m serious.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What do you think I’d want in a 
           man?

                        FRED
           Money, power, prestige, abdominal 
           taughtness?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh.  You mean like Kent?

                        FRED
           Well...

                        CHARLOTTE
           Those qualities didn’t make me 
           happy in the first half of my 
           life, you think they will in the 
           last?  

                Fred considers that.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Fred, if you want me to explain 
           why I want you, as if I could ever 
           do that as elegantly as it 
           deserves, I’ll tell you what I 
           told you on the first night we re-
           met: you’re my hero. 

                Fred smiles.  Then:

                        FRED
           Did you just speak of the “last 
           half” of your life?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m 38.  It’s about half over.  
           There’s a Latin expression: “Dum 
           vivimus, vivamus.”  

                        FRED
           While we live, let us live. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           There it is: my brilliant middle-
           aged revelation.  And pursuant to 
           that, would you remove your pants?
                        FRED
           In here?  Really?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Should I say it in Latin, smart-
           ass?

                Fred’s game.  He stoops to take off his shoes, and-- 
                CRACK!!!  The dining room door SWINGS hard into his head.  
                Fred HOWLS in pain.  The Agents burst in.

                        AGENT FORESTER
           Madam Secretary, you need to come 
           with us.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What’s going on?

                        AGENT CHARLES
           There’s been an attack; we’re 
           transferring to a secure location.

                The room floods with the sounds and lights of an 
                APPROACHING MARINE HELICOPTER.  

                        FRED
                              (from the floor)
           I think my head is open.

           Wait - Fred’s hurt!

                        AGENT FORESTER
           We’ll have an agent transport him 
           to the Loudoun ER. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, let me just--

                The agents LIFT CHARLOTTE off her feet and whisk her out.

                Fred watches this coverage as he recuperates on Lance’s 
                couch.  A large BANDAGE covers his forehead.  He’s 
                depressed.  Franci brings Fred some lunch on a tray.

                        FRED
           Franci, you’re amazing.  You guys 
           have been so good to me.

                        FRANCI
           How about you take a break from 
           the news for a while?

                        FRED
           I can’t.  They’re talking about 
           downgrading the threat level.  She 
           could come out of the bunker at 
           any moment.

                Franci crosses to the kitchen, and joins Lance.  They 
                speak in HUSHED TONES.

                        FRANCI
           He’s been watching the news for 
           two weeks straight.

           What’s he supposed to do?  He 
           hasn’t heard from her once.  She’s 
           cooped up in some hole with her 
           husband.

           Who she probably has to have sex 
           with just to maintain credibility.    
           It’s torture.

           How’s your head?  

                        FRED
           There’s brain damage - but that’s 
           from watching CNN for two weeks 
           straight.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m going to an emergency meeting 
           in Cairo on Tuesday.  I can 
           probably get away to see you for 
           about two hours.  I know it’s 
           crazy but will you come?  I really 
           need to see you.

                        FRED
           I’ll be there. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Okay, I’ve gotta run. 

                        FRED
           Wait...  Can you send me a picture 
           of yourself?  

                        CHARLOTTE
           There’s a million of them online.  

                        FRED
           I’d like a more exclusive one.

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s probably a bad idea.  
                        FRED
           Add it to our growing list.

                INT. WEMBLEY’S OFFICE - DAY

                Wembley and a half dozen EXECUTIVES conclude a meeting.

                        WEMBLEY
           Okay, gents.  That’ll do it for 
           now.

                The executives up and exit, but Connor hangs back.

                        CONNOR
           Have you got a moment?

                Wembley shuts the door, giving them privacy. 

                        CONNOR (CONT’D)
           It’s regarding my “research and 
           development” project.  

                        WEMBLEY
                              (gleeful)
           Oh yes, how’s that going?

                        CONNOR
           Possibly extraordinary.
                              (hands him a flash 
                               drive)
           Our friend picked up something 
           interesting on Flarsky’s cell 
           frequency.  

                        WEMBLEY
                              (beholds Connor)
           You’re looking very smug.  

                        CONNOR
           If you don’t mind, can I sit and 
           watch you as you listen to this?

                INT. CAIRO HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

                Fred and Charlotte are in post-coital bliss.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           I managed nearly three years 
           without this.  Now I go crazy 
           after two weeks.  It was really 
           weird to be in a bunker trying to 
           keep the tent poles of government 
           up, and feeling outrageously 
           horny.
                Fred smiles at the compliment, but looks pensive.

                        FRED
           Charlotte...

                Charlotte tenses up - something serious is coming.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh no.  

                        FRED
           We can’t do this forever.

                        CHARLOTTE
           But we’re getting so good at it.    

                        FRED
           I know.  I’m not sure how I feel 
           about that.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Do you want to stop?

                        FRED
           Just the opposite.  I want to keep 
           moving forward.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Me, too.  I just don’t know how.  

                        FRED
           Is it possible it’s less 
           complicated than you think?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred--

                        FRED
           Just as an exercise, what if you 
           did exactly what you wanted to 
           with your life?  Would the world 
           really judge you for that?  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Are you serious?  If Americans had 
           any idea what I’ve been doing for 
           the past month, they’d probably 
           try to kill me.  And you know 
           who’d be fueling that angry mob.

                        FRED
           Wembley.

                        CHARLOTTE
           A Charlotte Field divorce would be 
           like Mardis Gras for them.
                Fred ponders.

                        FRED
           When Henry the Eighth wanted out 
           of his marriage, he appointed 
           himself head of The Church of 
           England.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’d try something similar, but I 
           can’t take on more work right now.

                Charlotte climbs on top of Fred.  For now they let it go.

                EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                Charlotte’s motorcade arrives.

                INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

                Charlotte meets with President Chambers, several HIGH 
                LEVEL AIDES, and the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS.  

                With virtually every sentence the Chairman speaks, a new 
                corresponding POWERPOINT SLIDE WITH MAPS, FLOW-CHARTS AND 
                BULLET POINTS with user-friendly language appears.

                        CHAIRMAN
           The Yemeni government is failing.  
           They’re incapable of quashing 
           their insurgency, nor the Al Qaeda 
           training camps producing 
           terrorists like the ones that 
           nearly knocked our government off 
           line last month.  There could be 
           as many as 90 similar groups, 
           plotting attacks on American 
           targets as we speak.

                Charlotte looks around - she notices people seem to 
                expect a response from her.

                        CHARLOTTE
           That sounds so far like common 
           knowledge.  Middle East 101.

                        CHAIRMAN
                              (new slide)
           Now that we have stakes firmly 
           planted in Iraq, if Yemen could 
           transform to a regime more 
           sympathetic to the United States, 
           it would mean a nearly contiguous 
           belt of U.S. 
                        (MORE)
                        CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
           influence on the inside loop from 
           the Mediterranean to the Red Sea 
           to the Arabian Sea.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Transform?  You mean invasion?

                        CHAIRMAN
           Intervention. By a multi-national 
           force.

                        PRESIDENT CHAMBERS
           We’re looking at the big picture 
           right now, Charlotte.

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’m confused - Mr. President, is 
           this meeting for your benefit, or 
           mine?

                        PRESIDENT CHAMBERS
           We need you on board.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           You want me to sell this?

                        PRESIDENT CHAMBERS
           It won’t be an immediately popular 
           idea, even less so coming from me.  
           But it’s key to our survival.  
           This is where history’s been 
           headed.  We’ve got to lean into it 
           and stop endangering ourselves by 
           clinging to an outdated moral 
           scheme.

                        CHAIRMAN
           The Middle East needs to be fully 
           controlled and pacified, and last 
           month’s attack is a strong pretext 
           for intervention.  Much stronger 
           than what 9/11 gave us for Iraq. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           Are we still capable of a large 
           scale adventure at this point?

                        CHAIRMAN
           We believe we’d have massive 
           logistical and financial support 
           from the Saudis.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           The Saudis?
                        CHAIRMAN
           Yemen’s civil war has been 
           spilling over the border into 
           Saudi territory.  With coaxing, we 
           think the Saudis would be open to 
           seeing Yemeni’s government 
           reconstituted.

                        PRESIDENT CHAMBERS
           I know you’ve got a visit planned 
           there - shoring up their support 
           will top your agenda.

                        CHARLOTTE
           But Mr. President,
                              (re: slide)
           what if this is more complex than 
           the Powerpoint presentation 
           suggests?

                        CHAIRMAN
           Madame Secretary, a staff of more 
           than 20 officers put these slides 
           together.

                        CHARLOTTE
           And they look great.  But there’s 
           not that many actual words in 
           those bullet points.  I mean, how 
           much text do they actually add up 
           to?  Maybe a page?

                        SENIOR AIDE
           If I can suggest it, put this in 
           the context of a presidential bid.  
           As a woman, you’re more vulnerable 
           to accusations of weakness on 
           defense.  It’s sad, but there’s 
           still so much backward thinking 
           out there.

                INT. ADAM’S MORGAN PUB - NIGHT

                Fred drinks alone.  He gets a call on the CELL.

           Thanks, buddy.  How’s the terrible

                        FRED
           It’s destroying my life, and I’m

           Good for you, man.  I’m sorry to 
           hear it.

                        FRED
           I leave for Tajikistan Friday.  
           They’ll sneak me into her room, 
           and I’ll see her for three hours.  
           I slip out before sunrise, and 
           straight back to D.C. - since, you 
           know, I’ve got a job.

                        LANCE
           That sounds... unsustainable.

                        FRED
           We’ll find a way to make it work - 
           I mean, ultimately.  You know, 
           every time we see each other, 
           we’re more in love than the last.

                        LANCE
           You’ve become quite the romantic 
           bastard.

                        FRED
           I don’t recognize myself.

           Miss you, buddy.

           You too.

                They hang up.  Fred heads for the rest rooms.  A

                INT. MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                Fred relieves himself at the urinal.  The nondescript man 
                takes the stall next to him.  He deftly reaches into 
                FRED’S JACKET POCKET, and lifts out Fred’s BLACKBERRY.

           Okay, Fred.  You wanted a picture, 
           I’ll do you one better.  Lest you 
           ever doubt how in love with you I 
           am, I’m going beyond my comfort 
           level here, not to mention common 
           sense.  
                              (then, bashfully)
           I know you like the way my ass 
           looks in the black thong - real 
           original by the way - so here it 
           is.  Happy Flag Day.

                Charlotte turns herself over, and as she begins to reveal 
                her backside, we REVEAL that this is being watched in

                INT. WEMBLEY’S OFFICE - DAY

                Wembley and Connor have just watched this on a monitor.  

                        WEMBLEY
           This has got to be a fucking joke. 

                        CONNOR
           It does strain credulity.

                        WEMBLEY
           That nauseous little troglodyte - 
           is banging that woman?  

                        CONNOR
           It’s worse than that.  She appears 
           to be his... “sugar mamma.”  

                        WEMBLEY
           It’s easily the scandal of the 
           century.  It would destroy her, 
           and send our ratings into the 
           stratosphere. 

                        CONNOR
           Win-win.

                        WEMBLEY
           But it makes Flarsky look rather 
           good, doesn’t it?  

                        CONNOR
           Sure as fuck changes my view of 
           him.
                        WEMBLEY
           To make Fred Flarsky a sex 
           symbol... Fuck me.  I just don’t 
           think I can stomach it.

                Wembley ruminates for a moment.

                        WEMBLEY (CONT’D)
           Speaking of our ratings, what’s 
           the conventional wisdom on Yemen?  
           Have we got a war?  

                        CONNOR
           The idea of an invasion isn’t 
           polling.  

                        WEMBLEY
           Christ, Americans are such 
           hopeless little pussies. 
                              (realizing)
           No offense.  We should have done 
           this 40 years ago, and we should 
           have kept going ‘til we reached 
           Tehran.  All this idealistic self-
           delusion is a fucking waste of 
           time.  Let’s get on with it.

                        CONNOR 
           The administration’s been trying 
           to get Charlotte Field on board 
           for credibility.  She’s supposedly 
           resisting, but they haven’t given 
           up on her.

                        WEMBLEY
           Mm.

                INT. CHARLOTTE’S OFFICE STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY

                Charlotte’s at her desk.  Tom enters looking HAUNTED.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What?

                        TOM
           I just spoke with the chief of 
           WMN.  He said they’ve compiled a 
           case that shows you’ve been 
           cheating on your husband with Fred 
           Flarsky.

                Charlotte digests this for a moment.
                        CHARLOTTE
                              (meekly)
           Shit.
                              (sighs)
           Well... do we comment?

                        TOM
           They’re not asking for one.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           So it was just a courtesy warning.  
           I guess for them, that’s classy.

                        TOM
           It was an offer.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Excuse me?

                        TOM
           They’ll kill the story if you’ll 
           toe the President’s line on the 
           invasion.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Oh come on!  That’s insane!
                              (realizing)
           Right.  Wembley’s insane.  

                Charlotte takes a moment to process. 

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           What do they have?  Photos?

                        TOM
           Some kind of cell phone video.

                Charlotte racks her brain, then... oh yeah.

                        CHARLOTTE
                              (cringing)
           Oh god.  I’m that person - the one 
           I’m always reading about and 
           saying, “How could they get this 
           far in life, and be this stupid?”

                INT. HOTEL ROOM IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY - NIGHT

                Fred and Charlotte talk in the suite’s living room area.

                        FRED
           It’s my fault.  My Blackberry’s 
           been missing.  
                        (MORE)
                        FRED (CONT'D)
           I go through five or six of them a 
           year, so I didn’t think much of 
           it.  I forgot this one had 
           something sensitive.   

                        CHARLOTTE
           It doesn’t matter.  Like you said, 
           it was inevitable.

                        FRED
                              (thinking out loud)
           Okay.  So you’ll get ahead of 
           Wembley and tell your story, the 
           media will have a grand mal 
           seizure, you’ll resign a little 
           early, and your shot at the 
           presidency is probably over.  You 
           were ambivalent about it anyway.

                        CHARLOTTE
           No.  

                        FRED
           “No” what?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I’ll work with Wembley.  

                        FRED
           Are you serious?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I can support the invasion without 
           showing conviction.  I can follow 
           the McCain model from the 2000 
           election.  He “endorsed” Bush, but 
           projected nausea.

                        FRED
           This is your response?  To betray 
           your beliefs but not look very 
           convincing while you do it?  

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s the lesser of two evils. 

                Fred is struck by a realization.

                        FRED
           You want to be president.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Is that wrong?

                        FRED
           I just didn’t realize, is all.
                        CHARLOTTE
           I didn’t either until I faced 
           losing the option.  I want a lot 
           of things, Fred.  I want you too.  
           I want us to keep going.

                        FRED
           How do we continue this 
           clandestinely with Wembley 
           knowing?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I might have to do another 
           unpleasant favor for him somewhere 
           down the road.

                        FRED
           Maybe next time he’ll ask you for 
           a blowjob?  Or just to walk his 
           dogs when he’s on vacation?

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s not ideal.  But it’s like Tom 
           said: global stability depends in 
           part on the widely held perception 
           that Charlotte Field has sound 
           judgment.  

                        FRED
           But--

                        CHARLOTTE
           Yes.  I get the cosmic irony.

                        FRED
           So you’ll never leave Kent, and 
           you and I will never go public. 

                        CHARLOTTE
           No, of course all of that will 
           happen at some point.  I just 
           can’t say when right now.

                        FRED
           Until then, I can just pass my 
           time in hotel rooms.

                        CHARLOTTE
           What about that is so inconvenient 
           for you?  What else do you have 
           going on?

                Fred is stung.  He stands up.
                        CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
           I’m sorry.  That was horrible.  
           You know I don’t feel that way.

                        FRED
           I don’t want to do this anymore.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Fred, don’t torch the whole thing 
           just because you’re momentarily 
           frustrated.  You’ve done enough of 
           that in your life.  

                        FRED
           “Momentarily frustrated?”

                        CHARLOTTE
           We’re in love, and it’s been a 
           rough couple of weeks.  Have some 
           perspective.

                        FRED
           This is bad for you, bad for me, 
           and bad for the world.  The only 
           one it seems to be good for is 
           Alistair Wembley.  You might be 
           okay working for him, but I tried 
           it once, and didn’t like it.

                        CHARLOTTE
           We can figure this out.  

                        FRED
           No, it was never going to work.  
           I’m the worst at being servile.  I 
           wish I wasn’t.  Life would be so 
           much easier.  

                Fred exits.

                INT. LANCE’S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

                Lance and Franci are MAKING LOVE in bed.  

                The DOORBELL RINGS.  They both look bewildered.

                INT. LANCE’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                Lance opens the door: it’s Fred.  He looks like a zombie.

                        LANCE
           Dude?
                        FRED
           Sorry, I couldn’t seem to reach 
           you on the phone.

                        LANCE
           It’s midnight.  We were making 
           love.

                        FRED
           Oh.  Wow.  I’m sorry...
                              (then)
           Can I sleep in the bed with you 
           guys?

                Lance beholds Fred who is clearly in horrendous pain. 

                        LANCE
           Yeah.  Just stay here for a few 
           minutes, okay?

                        FRED
           Of course.

                Lance runs off.  Fred waits respectfully in the doorway 
                while Lance and Franci finish their business.

                INT. CHARLOTTE AND KENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                Kent’s in bed reading documents.  Charlotte enters, 
                having just returned from her trip.  She’s a wreck.  

                        CHARLOTTE
           Hi.

                        KENT
                              (gets up, kisses her)
           Hey, honey!  How was Uzbekistan?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Hopeless.  It’s a failed state.  

                        KENT
           I’m sorry.

                        CHARLOTTE
           It’s what I signed up for.  That’s 
           my life.  An endless tour of 
           failed states.

                        KENT
           Well, here’s some good news: I 
           just read your Riyadh talk.  It’s 
           outstanding.

                Too pained to speak, Charlotte nods.  
                        KENT (CONT’D)
           The language feels different.  And 
           that part where you come this 
           close to calling their whole 
           monarchical system into question -  
           You take it up to the line.  
           Ballsy.  I like how you’re growing 
           up.

                TEARS begin to STREAM down Charlotte’s face.

                        CHARLOTTE
           Why didn’t you read it two months 
           ago when I asked you to?!

                        KENT
           Whoa.  I think you’re tired.  How 
           about we go to bed?

                        CHARLOTTE
           I don’t want to be in a bed with 
           you anymore.  

                Charlotte grabs a bathrobe and exits, leaving Kent 
                stunned.

                EXT. LANCE’S RANCH - DAY

                Lance and Fred hike in Lance’s mountains.  

                        FRED
           And, obviously, I resigned from 
           the job with Charlotte’s office.

                        LANCE
           Fuck.
                              (then)
           I’m proud of you, buddy.  
           Charlotte’s not an easy girl to 
           get, and she sure as shit can’t be 
           easy to let go.

                        FRED
           Who exactly did I let go?  Who is 
           Charlotte?  Who does she love?  
           Me?  Her job?  Or just herself?  I 
           mean, when her back’s to the wall, 
           she’s ruthless and egocentric and 
           amoral and... really insensitive.  
           Is this just what all extremely 
           successful people are like?

                        LANCE
           I’ve done pretty well.  I don’t 
           think I’m any of those things.
                Fred looks at Lance and smiles.

                        FRED
           That’s true.

                        LANCE
           Anyway, she sure loved the shit 
           out of you.  Maybe she’s not the 
           only woman who could. 

                Fred looks genuinely peaceful. 

                        FRED
           I think you might be right. 
                              (then)
           Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you 
           for the last month: how’s your 
           life?

                        LANCE
           I retained James Phimister.  He 
           says I’m a flawless candidate.  A 
           Democrat with huge pro-business 
           credentials, and... 
                              (bashful, admitting)
           exceptionally good looks. 

                        FRED
           Jesus, he’s the top democratic 
           strategist in the country. 

                        LANCE
           And hopefully I’ll have a killer 
           speech writer.

           You read the revised Riyadh 
           speech?

                        CHARLOTTE
           Reading it now.

                        TOM
           How’s it look?

                        CHARLOTTE
           There’s not one word in here about 
           women.

                        TOM
           You know we can’t lecture the 
           Saudis on that - or anything - 
           now.  Which reminds me: we’ll also 
           have to put your address to the 
           Sudanese leadership in cold 
           storage, so no need to put a new

                Charlotte lowers her head onto her desk.

                        TOM (CONT’D)
           You feeling okay?

           I’m doing anything... that I do.

           You’re doing the things you do 
           because you were born with many 
           gifts and advantages, and you want 
           to use them to help people.

           I’m a complete fucking failure!

           Charlotte, if you’re a failure, I 
           don’t know what success means.

           I’m doing things that I... that I 
           don’t agree with.  I’m a liar.  
           And a coward.  And a bad wife.  
           I’ve completely fucked things up, 
           and you know it’s true.

                Tom searches for something positive - and genuine - to 
                say...

                        TOM
           You’re supporting your president.  
           You’re a team player, and a lot of 
           people would call that noble.  
                              (then)
           And you’re being a bit dramatic 
           because you’re 38, and this is 
           your first experience with a 
           broken heart.

                Charlotte looks at Tom as if he had just shot her.

                        TOM (CONT’D)

                        CHARLOTTE
           Good afternoon, esteemed members 
           of the Security Council.  One 
           month ago, a terrorist cell of 
           Yemeni nationals attempted to 
           decapitate the United States 
           government.  The administration is 
           steadfastly determined never to 
           let such an attack succeed.  Among 
           the actions being considered is 
           military intervention in Yemen.  
           Of course, a new conflict in the 
           Middle East will affect every 
           nation on earth.  So while we must 
           act swiftly, we must act wisely.  
           I urge us - the United States 
           government - to reflect seriously 
           on our own actions.  I urge those 
           who put us in power - the American 
           people - to reflect as well.  And 
           since I’m the one standing before 
           you, I urge you to reflect on me.  
                        (MORE)
                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Look past the simplistic media 
           narratives and ask, “Who is 
           Charlotte Field?  Can she be 
           trusted on a matter of such 
           enormous consequence?”  
                              (continuing)
           I’ll provide some relevant 
           information to factor into your 
           evaluation: I’m 38 years old, I’ve 
           never served in the military, and 
           for most of my life I’ve been an 
           academic.  On a personal note, 
           this morning I informed my husband 
           that earlier this year I had an 
           affair.

                Lance is astonished.  Fred smiles triumphantly.

                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           Our marriage had been irreparably 
           broken, but rather than make the 
           politically dangerous choice to 
           end it, I took the cowardly path 
           of pursuing happiness outside it.
                              (continuing)
           And this is who I am.  I’m 
           educated and accomplished, yet 
           there are certain aspects of life 
           I’ve only just begun to 
           understand.  I’m capable of making 
           enormous mistakes, and sometimes 
           yielding to ambition over good 
           sense.  
                              (continuing)
           Unfortunately, most people are 
           like me.  This is the problem with 
           wars of choice.  They’re devised 
           and sold by just a few individuals 
           who may or may not be thinking 
           rationally at the moment.  At this 
           time, my view is that the invasion 
           would be a blunt, unimaginative 
           response to a nimble and creative 
           enemy.  And it would deepen our 
           partnership with a country where, 
           if I admitted to them what I just 
           admitted to you about my private 
           life, they’d execute me.  It’s 
           just another bad relationship I 
           long to be free of.  Of course, my 
           views might be ill-conceived since 
           I’m a bit of a mess right now.  
           But the war I can live with is the 
           one that doesn’t need me to get up 
           here and sell it to you.  
                        (MORE)
                        CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           The right war will sell itself, 
           and when it does, it will be 
           America’s war, not Charlotte 
           Field’s or Clark Chambers’s war.  
           It’ll be a war we can all be proud 
           of.  Thank you.

                Charlotte leaves the podium to HUGE APPLAUSE.
