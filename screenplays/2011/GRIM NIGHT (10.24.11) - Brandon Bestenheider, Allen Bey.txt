                                    GRIM NIGHT

                          364 days a year, we are safe.
                          One night a year, we are not.

                          Across the world, they come with the dark.  
                          They come to your front door. 

                          Give them what they want.

                          Tonight is Grim Night.
                                                     FADE IN:

           EXT. DOWNTOWN - NEAR DUSK

           The setting sun casts a fiery haze over the city.

           Streets normally bustling with rush hour traffic are eerily 
           silent.  A few stragglers hurry along, crossing barren 
           intersections.  Store shutters rattle closed.

           There is a sense of foreboding, like things are shutting 
           down... for good.

           EXT. CITY - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

           A construction site is littered with bills depicting black, 
           shrouded figures.  Underneath is a single word: BEWARE.

           Posters at subway entrances and bus shelters portray the same 
           iconic silhouettes and a warning: FEAR THEM.

           A billboard bears a chilling fact: 37,112 DEAD. NEVER FORGET.

           EXT. CITY STREET / INT. SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           A wall-mounted LCD in a PIZZA JOINT displays local news.   
           The MAN cleaning up inside pauses to watch.

           ON TV
           A FEMALE NEWSCASTER stands on a rooftop overlooking the city.

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER
                        Tonight marks the 15th annual Grim 
                        Night, a dark "holiday" recognized 
                        the world over... a night marked by 
                        mass murder, and mystery.  Hello, 
                        I'm Gail Reyes.

           A car WHIZZES past.

           INT. / EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           PAUL GREEN, 40, speeds down an empty lane in his modest 
           sedan.  A red light forces him to suddenly STOP.

           The sedan idles at the light...

                                 PAUL
                        C'mon, c'mon.

           He taps the wheel...  The light turns green.  He accelerates.
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Paul screams past a weathered FLYER flapping on a telephone 
           pole.  STAY ALIVE, it reads.  STAY HOME.

           EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He takes a corner tight, passes an ELECTRONICS STORE in a 
           blur.  The televisions inside all display news footage.

           EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           ON A GRID OF TVS
           Pixelated home video displays a dark alley.  At the far end, 
           a tall, HOODED FIGURE hovers in a black, flowing cloak.  

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER #1 (V.O.)
                        It has become the most feared 
                        phenomenon in human history.  The 
                        Unknowns, or Grims, invade our 
                        cities each year... always on this 
                        particular date.  

           The thing quickly moves out of sight.

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER #2
                        They appear after dark... roaming 
                        our neighborhoods... knocking on 
                        doors... making strange requests...

           Another clip presents a POV of a darkened residential 
           neighborhood.  A Grim hovers at the front door of a row home 
           across the street.  It KNOCKS three times...

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER #3
                        At sunrise, they vanish.  The 
                        pattern is always the same...

           Police pile body bags before an inner city home.

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER #3 (CONT’D)
                        And after fifteen years, the 
                        question remains... why?

           A police siren BLURTS and whines.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul spots a POLICE CRUISER on his tail, gaining fast.  Its 
           lights and siren are at full-tilt.

                                 PAUL
                        Shit!
           Paul pulls over as the cruiser closes on him.  It blows by in 
           a BLUR.  He sighs with relief.

                                 RADIO PERSONALITY (V.O.)
                        No one knows what the Grims are, or 
                        where they come from...  We do know 
                        these things are killers that prowl 
                        the night.  So if any of our 
                        listeners are outdoors right now, 
                        please... get inside.

           Paul FLOORS it.

           EXT. BRIDGE / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He screeches to a halt at a bridge ramp clogged with traffic.

                                 PAUL
                        This isn't happening.

           A chorus of horns HONK.  Drivers hurl obscenities.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (shaking his head)
                        People.

           Paul changes the radio station, accepts his predicament.

                                 RADIO SHOW GUEST (V.O.)
                        ...all I'm saying is, statistically 
                        speaking, you have a better chance 
                        of being struck by lightning twice 
                        than you do encountering one of 
                        these hoods...

           A MESSAGE BOARD on the shoulder flashes instructions:

           NATIONAL CURFEW, 7PM... MARTIAL LAW IN EFFECT UNTIL DAWN...

           Paul eyes the IN-DASH CLOCK.  It's 6:03.

           He retrieves his PHONE and taps the name "Liz".  As he waits 
           for an answer, he eyes his fuel gauge.  It's on empty.

                                 PRERECORDED VOICE
                        We're sorry.  All circuits are 
                        busy.  Please try again.

           He clicks the phone off, frustrated.

                                 PAUL
                            (softly)
                        Goddammit.
           In the rear view mirror, the SUN shimmers like a band of fire 
           on the horizon.  Paul watches it burn awhile.

           EXT. SUBURB - CONTINUOUS

           A SERIES OF SHOTS 
           Vertical blinds snap closed.  Garage doors whine down.  Dogs 
           are called in for the night.  Deadbolts lock...

           EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A modest HOME sits at the foot of a cul-de-sac.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           LIZ GREEN, 36, sips a glass of wine.  She paces the kitchen, 
           snacks nervously.  A TV atop the counter keeps her company.

           ON TV 
           Clips document the aftermath of slayings from last year's 
           Grim Night.  Bodies are hoisted into ambulances.  Sidewalks 
           are stained with blood.

                                 MALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                            (during the above)
                        Will this year's Grim Night be 
                        another bloodbath?
                            (beat)
                        So far, military and local law 
                        enforcement have been unable to 
                        capture or kill one of these so-
                        called Grims.  There is little 
                        comfort as the sun begins to set.

           Liz swallows the rest of her wine in one big gulp.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           SASHA GREEN, 15, and EMILY, 15, traverse the neighborhood.  
           The red-orange glow of dusk backlights the pair.

                                 SASHA
                        How much further?

                                 EMILY
                        Not far.

           From a second story window, a WOMAN flags them.

                                 WOMAN
                        Get home kids!  It's almost dark.
                                 EMILY
                            (sassy)
                        We know.

           The woman scowls as the duo marches on.

           EXT. SIDEWALK / VACANT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls round a CORNER.  Sasha studies each house.  Emily 
           watches her phone intently, shakes it in frustration.  Sasha 
           suddenly STOPS dead in her tracks.

                                 SASHA
                            (eyes something nearby)
                        Is it too late to back out?

           The teens recognize the dark, dilapidated HOUSE.  The yard is 
           overgrown with gnarled vines and branches.  It's been 
           neglected for years.

                                 EMILY
                        Yup, too late.  You ready?

           Sasha swallows hard and nods.  She steps softly on a cracked, 
           concrete walkway up to the house.  As she reaches the porch 
           she pauses, looks back at her friend.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        That's right... all the way.

           Sasha creeps up the porch steps.  Her hand hovers above the 
           rusty handrail but she doesn't touch it.  

           Emily uses her CAMERA PHONE to capture the moment.

           INSERT - CAMERA PHONE FOOTAGE

                                 EMILY
                        Hi losers, Emily Moore here with...
                            (pans to Sasha)
                        ...the always amenable Sasha Green.  
                        We are standing at 2237 East Rebus 
                        Road, site of Springton's worst-
                        ever massacre,
                            (whispers)
                        and our town's only confirmed 
                        "ghost house".

           She pans to the horizon, now only glowing embers.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        It's Grim Night, folks... and as we 
                        near sunset, our daring diva is 
                        about to go where few have been.
           She points the phone at herself.

                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        So tomorrow, all of you who bet 
                        against our little Sasha will have 
                        to pony up.  And remember, if she 
                        gets munched... this was your idea.

           EXT. VACANT HOUSE / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha closes her eyes and places her hand on the DOORKNOB.  
           She reluctantly turns it.  To her surprise, it opens...

           Sasha stiffens as dead, stale air escapes the house.  Cold 
           creeps over her goose flesh.  Every hair stands on end as she 
           turns to Emily.

                                 EMILY
                        C'mon, Green.  Reputations are on 
                        the line here.

           Sasha inhales, closes her eyes and takes a step.

           Sasha ENTERS the house.

                                 EMILY (V.O) (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.  She's in!

           INT. VACANT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha stands just inside, barely breathing... eyes closed.  
           She opens them to find herself enveloped by darkness.

           Fragments of the room are visible due to light bleeding 
           through a window.  The house appears empty, devoid of life.

           Sasha looks down at her feet where something rests in a 
           crevice on the floor.  She bends over and cautiously plucks 
           the item from the pit in the wood.

           She raises the little object to her face for close 
           inspection.  It's a BLOODSTAINED TOOTH, the sharpened incisor 
           of a predator.  She stares at it, entranced...

           EXT. VACANT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           CAMERA PHONE VIDEO 
           The door is ajar, Sasha is out of sight.

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Sasha 
                        Green has been inside for almost a 
                        full minute now.  
                                 EMILY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There's no telling if she's alive 
                        or dead... or undead.  Just gonna 
                        to have to wait and see...

           Another quiet moment passes.  Emily watches... waits...

                                 EMILY
                            (shouts)
                        Hey, you still breathing in there?

           Emily is suddenly jolted by clamorous noise behind her - 
           SCREECHING TIRES.  An AMBULANCE guns by like a bullet from 
           hell, ablaze with orbiting lights.  It blares its siren at an 
           intersection and runs the stop sign with reckless abandon.

           Emily returns her attention to the house.

           INT. VACANT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha is still fixated on the fang.

                                 EMILY (O.S.)
                        Sa-sha!

           The spooked girl snaps her head.  She EXITS clutching the 
           sinister tooth.

           CAMERA PHONE VIDEO 
           Sasha emerges wobbly-legged and pale.

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        She lives.

           Emily greets her friend with a hug.  Sasha is shaking.

                                 EMILY
                        What's wrong?

                                 SASHA
                        You're not gonna believe what I 
                        found in there... look.

           Sasha holds up the tooth.  Except... it's just a ROCK, a 
           jagged little stone.

                                 EMILY
                        Yeah...?  So...?

           Sasha is deeply vexed.  She studies the shard of sediment, 
           then turns her attention to the vacant abode.
           The sagging structure resembles a face.  Its blank expression 
           mocks the frightened girl.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Sasha doesn't answer.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Ooooohh....
                            (cracking up)
                        You got scared, didn't you?

           Emily teases her friend down the block.  Sasha plays along.

           Behind them, the front door of the decrepit house stands 
           ajar.  Somewhere inside and unseen, a floorboard CREAKS...

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha and Emily walk side by side.

                                 EMILY
                        I have to say, I don't think I 
                        could've actually gone in there.  
                        Does that make me a total wuss?

                                 SASHA
                        By definition, yes.  It's just a 
                        house, right?

                                 EMILY
                        Right.  Just a house.  So you'll be 
                        going back then?

                                 SASHA
                        No, thanks.

           Emily laughs.  

           A streetlight buzzes and flickers as the girls pass 
           underneath.  Sasha takes one last look at the vacant house as 
           they round the bend.

           EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Emily turns down the FRONT WALK to her house.

                                 SASHA
                        What are you gonna do now?

                                 EMILY
                        We're going to my uncle's... whole 
                        fam's gonna be there.  
                                 EMILY (CONT'D)
                        They act like Grim Night is 
                        Thanksgiving or something, it's 
                        really twisted.  
                            (beat)
                        Wanna come with?

           Sasha shakes her head.

                                 SASHA
                        I gotta get home.  My mom is 
                        probably freaking out right now.

           Emily nods, Sasha playfully waves bye.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        See you tomorrow.

                                 EMILY
                            (bug-eyed)
                        If we survive.

           Sasha frowns.

                                 SASHA
                        Call me later?

                                 EMILY
                        I'll try... but it's Grim Night, 
                        you know how that goes.

                                 SASHA
                        Yeah.  Bye.

           The girls part ways.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           A howling wind blows black branches against a blood-red sky.

           Sasha continues home alone, lost in her thoughts.  Something 
           startles her - a deep, BREATHY SOUND, a creeping feeling.

           She slows her pace and spins around, half-expecting to catch 
           some stalker off guard.  She looks up and down the block, her 
           imagination running wild.  The streets are empty.

           She resumes her trek cautiously - then makes a RUN for it.

           EXT. GAS STATION / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul pulls up to a pump.  He notices the proprietor, HARUT, 
           53, outside cleaning some gunk from his store window.

           Paul eyes the in-dash clock.  It's 7:13.
                                 PAUL
                        Hey!  You still open?

           Harut turns, his face is partly DISFIGURED.  The storekeeper 
           nods solemnly.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (trying not to stare)
                        Great... I'm running on fumes.

           Paul kills the engine, gets out.

                                 HARUT
                        You smell it?

                                 PAUL
                        Excuse me?

                                 HARUT
                        Can you smell it?

                                 PAUL
                            (sniffs, mulls it over)
                        Yeah... what is that?  Somebody 
                        burning leaves?

                                 HARUT
                        Not leaves.

                                 PAUL
                        What then?

                                 HARUT
                        It's a sign.

                                 PAUL
                            (incredulous)
                        A sign?

           He indicates a Grim poster in the window.

                                 HARUT
                        They're coming.

           Paul studies Harut for a hint of sanity.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        The credit machine at the pump is 
                        broken.  Pay inside.

           The proprietor heads indoors and works the register.
           Paul heads over to the PUMP and begins fueling his car.  He 
           takes in his surroundings.  A long stretch of tree-lined 
           road.  Smoldering sky.  Everything is peaceful.  

           At once, a slow rush of wind whistles through the station.  
           Paul tilts his gaze upward, following the sound of a panicked 
           chorus in the sky...

           A SWARM OF BIRDS fly overhead in a frenzied migration.

           The gas nozzle safety-valve triggers and stops the flow.

           INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - SAME

           Harut watches the news on a TV behind the counter.

           ON TV 
           A BRAZILIAN WOMAN with severe cataracts speaks Portuguese to 
           a reporter off-camera.  The interview is subtitled.

                                 BRAZILIAN WOMAN
                        This was tall... wearing a long, 
                        black cloak.  With a hood.

                                 REPORTER
                        Did you see its face?

                                 BRAZILIAN WOMAN
                        I only saw its eyes.  It was the 
                        last thing I ever saw.

           BELLS JANGLE as Paul enters the store, wallet in hand.

                                 PAUL
                            (approaching the counter)
                        I'm pretty sure you're the only 
                        game in town.  Why haven't you 
                        closed up?

                                 HARUT
                        You see that sign?

           Harut points to the backlit 24-HOUR SIGN outside.

                                 PAUL
                        You're not worried about getting 
                        fined or anything?

                                 HARUT
                        Fines don't concern me.
                            (beat)
                        Death is coming... Someone has to 
                        bear witness.
           Paul furrows his brow.

                                 PAUL
                        Right...  
                            (beat)
                        Look, I'm just gonna grab a few 
                        things.  Can't go home empty-handed 
                        if you know what I mean...

           Harut looks on.  Paul snags a shopping basket and proceeds to 
           load up on junk food around the store.

                                 HARUT
                        You should hurry.  It won't be 
                        long, now...

           Paul ignores the warning.  The store owner travels down the 
           counter to remain in speaking distance of his patron.

                                 HARUT (CONT'D)
                        Tell me... What will you do if one 
                        comes knocking?  

           Paul takes a moment to answer.

                                 PAUL
                        Well, they've never come to 
                        Springton, so...

                                 HARUT
                        So?

                                 PAUL
                        So, why stage a terrorist attack 
                        out here?  Doesn't seem worth the 
                        effort, does it?

                                 HARUT
                        You think these are terrorists?

                                 PAUL
                        Aren't they?

           Paul peruses the chip aisle.

                                 HARUT
                        I should tell you... I'm a survivor 
                        of the Mumbai attacks.

           Paul drops a snack in his basket, heads to the counter.

                                 PAUL
                            (intrigued)
                        You're kidding.
                                 HARUT
                        No, sir.

                                 PAUL
                        You saw one of those things?

           Paul looks at blocky video footage of a Grim on the 
           television.  Harut nods, starts bagging.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        And you were attacked?

           Harut nods again.  Paul is wary.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        How did you...

                                 HARUT
                        Survive?

           The men look at each other.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        I was at a dinner party when it 
                        happened.  We had the music up, 
                        nobody heard the creature at the 
                        door.  Back then, we didn't know 
                        the rules...

           FLASH ON
           Camcorder footage of the party as told by Harut.

                                 HARUT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        When it entered the house, there 
                        was panic.  I was knocked down,  
                        trampled by my own friends...  
                            (beat)
                        Fractured my spine in two places, 
                        had my face worked over...
                            (beat)
                        When I awoke... I was pinned.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 PAUL
                        Pinned?  How?

                                 HARUT
                        Bodies.  I was... underneath.

           FLASH ON 
           Harut's bloodied face is sandwiched between fresh, human 
           remains.  He's buried beneath an ARMLESS TORSO, framed by 
           severed limbs and meat.  His eyes pop awake.  
           From Harut's BLURRY POV, we observe a GRIM down the hall 
           hovering above the hardwood.  Harut chokes on a silent 
           scream.  The fiend turns, observes him... then moves on.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Paul absorbs the gory details with a worried brow.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        Whatever it was looking for... 
                            (shrugs)
                        It wasn't me. 

                                 PAUL
                        How long were you trapped there?

                                 HARUT
                        Thirty-seven hours.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus...

           A POLICE CRUISER screams past the store.  Paul follows the 
           red and blue lights as they disappear down the road.

                                 HARUT
                        For me, the Grims have become 
                        something of an obsession.
                            (beat)
                        So, I do a lot of research.  And 
                        those "experts" on TV... they're 
                        not always right.  
                            (beat)
                        $53.26.

                                 PAUL
                        What?  Oh.

           Paul hands over his card and Harut swipes it.  The two men 
           stand in silence while they wait.  Paul signs the slip.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           He heads for the door.

                                 HARUT
                        Paul...

           Paul shoots a suspicious look.

                                 PAUL
                        How'd you...
                                 HARUT
                        It's on the receipt, sir.
                            (beat)
                        You forgot something.

           Harut pushes his bags across the counter.  Paul returns to 
           retrieve them.  Harut holds them a moment.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        Go home.  Lock your doors.  And if 
                        one comes knocking... Give it 
                        exactly what it wants.

           They share a LOOK.  Paul takes the bags.

           EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           BELLS JANGLE as Paul exits the store.  He pauses a moment and 
           scans the streets, superstitious for perhaps the first time 
           in his life.  

           He looks back at the man inside.  Harut gives the peace sign.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Liz peers through the window, watching the sun fade.  She 
           puts her hands on her hips and scowls.

           ON TV 
           An attractive REPORTER stands beside an ELDERLY MAN occupying 
           a rickety lawn chair.  He's got a portable TV in his lap.

                                 REPORTER
                        This is Paula Huntley coming to you 
                        from the South Side of Chicago, 
                        where the sun is about to set.
                            (beat)
                        I am standing with Emol Crothers, a 
                        terminally ill cancer sufferer, who 
                        has spent the last two Grim Nights 
                        on this sidewalk in front of his 
                        Newton home.
                            (beat)
                        Can you tell our viewers why you do 
                        this, Mr. Crothers?

                                 EMOL
                        Weather's good, and nuthin's gonna 
                        keep me from it.

                                 REPORTER
                        And tell us, what role does your 
                        illness play in your decision to  
                        stay out here?
                                 EMOL
                        Well, I look death in the face 
                        every single day.  So... I guess I 
                        ain't too afraid of these damn 
                        trick-or-treaters.   

           BACK TO SCENE

           Liz grabs the house phone from the counter and dials.

                                 CANNED VOICE
                        We're sorry, all circuits are busy-- 

                                 LIZ
                            (annoyed, mimicking)
                        Please try again.

           She hangs up.

           JOSH GREEN, 14, tiptoes into the room wielding a sheathed 
           KATANA sword.  He shadows an imaginary foe in a rigid attack 
           pose.  Liz turns, watches her son perform.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        Shhh.

           Josh continues stalking the room.

                                 LIZ
                        So, you're a ninja now?  When did 
                        this happen?

                                 JOSH
                        It's samurai, mom.

                                 LIZ
                        Samurai.

           He tucks into a precise forward roll and lunges, mortally 
           wounding the invisible enemy.

                                 JOSH
                        There's a difference.

                                 LIZ
                        Okay, samurai.

           She eyes the sword.
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Is that thing real?  Where'd you 
                        get that?

                                 JOSH
                        Relax, mom.  
                            (beat)
                        My blade shall remain sheathed.

           Josh continues to maneuver around the room with his weapon.  
           He tips drapes aside to view the BACKYARD.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Where's Dad?

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know.  I've been trying 
                        them both for an hour.

                                 JOSH
                        Sasha's not here either?

           Liz shakes her head as she eyes the red glow on the horizon.  
           It's dead quiet, not a soul in sight.

                                 LIZ
                            (softly)
                        This is so stupid.

           Liz goes to another window and peeks out.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Where the hell are they?  I'm gonna 
                        kill 'em.

           Josh angles his sword menacingly.

                                 JOSH
                        Can I do it?

                                 LIZ
                            (pushing the blade aside)
                        Nice.  Don't you have any homework?

           She shoos him away.

                                 JOSH
                        Homework?  This is no time for 
                        homework, Mrs. Green.

           He dashes out of the room with balletic grace.
           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha stands with hands on knees, catching her breath.  She 
           observes her long, widening shadow on the sidewalk.

           There's a fleeting disturbance, something passes behind her.

           Sasha whips around, finds nothing.  She squints into the 
           darkness of trees, between homes, around corners.  She is 
           completely alone.  Then...

           Something approaches.  Not human.  There's the sound of 
           padded PAWS on concrete.  Panting...

           Across the street, a sickly COYOTE emerges from the shadows.  
           Rail thin and wounded, the weak canine limps along the 
           sidewalk.  It's dangling a broken rib cage.

           The creature stops and looks Sasha in the eyes.  Then it 
           wobbles and collapses.

           Sasha is horrified.  Her wide eyes shift from the dead canine 
           to her house somewhere in the distance.

           She scans her surroundings, silently daring unseen enemies to 
           strike.  She plots a shortcut and darts across a nearby lawn.

           EXT. CONCRETE FENCE / BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha pulls herself up and over the wall in a huff, CRASH-
           LANDS on the other side.  She scrambles to her feet and looks 
           back over the cement barrier to check for stalkers.

           Again, something moves in the shadows.  Sasha takes off.

           She crosses the yard, up the steps to the KITCHEN DOOR...

           She fumbles with her KEY CHAIN...  

           Inserts her house KEY...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The door swings open and Sasha bursts through.  She SLAMS the 
           door shut, locks it and backs away.

                                 JOSH
                        What's with you?

                                 SASHA
                        There's something out there.

           Josh dramatically removes the sheath from his SWORD.  Liz 
           enters, puts her hands on her hips.  The boy smiles weakly.
                                 LIZ
                        Joshua, put that thing away.
                            (to Sasha)
                        Where the hell have you been?

           Her daughter is in outer space.

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, you got a death wish or what?

                                 LIZ
                        Josh.  I got it.
                            (to Sasha)
                        Well?  I can't wait to hear this.

                                 SASHA
                        Mom.  Someone was following me.

           Liz is suddenly quite concerned.

                                 LIZ
                        What?  Following you, are you sure?

           They share a look.  Sasha runs, embraces her mother.  Josh 
           rolls his eyes.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (quiet)
                        What happened out there?

                                 SASHA
                        First... I went in the Kirby house.

                                 JOSH
                        You went inside the Kirby house?

                                 LIZ
                        What does that mean?  What's the 
                        Kirby house?

                                 JOSH
                        The place they found all those kids 
                        with their heads chopped off.
                            (to his sister)
                        Are you nuts?

                                 LIZ
                            (remembering)
                        How do you kids know about that?  
                        Were you even born?

                                 SASHA
                        Everybody knows, mom.
                                 LIZ
                        What were you doing there?

                                 SASHA
                        It was a dare.

                                 LIZ
                        A dare?  Are you kidding me?

                                 SASHA
                        Also... something killed a coyote.  
                        It happened right outside.

           Sasha points toward the living room.

                                 JOSH
                        There's a dead coyote out there?

           He flies out of the room.

                                 LIZ
                        Josh.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Josh goes to the WINDOW, scrutinizes the street for evidence 
           of Sasha's claim.  Liz and Sasha enter.

                                 SASHA
                        I couldn't see who was following me 
                        but I could feel them...

                                 JOSH
                            (looking outside)
                        I don't see anything.

                                 LIZ
                            (to Sasha)
                        Honey.  I'm sorry you got a scare, 
                        but what did you expect?
                            (beat)
                        You know you shouldn't trespass on 
                        other people's property, right?

                                 JOSH
                        Actually, I don't think anybody 
                        owns the Kirby house, mom...    
                        It's like totally abandoned.

           Liz raises a stern finger to silence her son.
                                 LIZ
                            (to Sasha)
                        From now on, we're gonna stay away 
                        from creepy murder scenes.  Right?
                            (beat)
                        Please?

                                 SASHA
                        Right.

                                 LIZ
                        What am I going to do about you?

                                 SASHA
                        Don't tell dad, okay?  I'm sorry.

                                 JOSH
                        Not sorry enough.

           The boy FLASHES his blade.

                                 LIZ
                        Josh, goddammit.  Put it away.

           He poses with his weapon.

                                 JOSH
                            (husky, samurai voice)
                        Calm your mind... Be still...   
                        Like a pool of water reflecting  
                        the brilliance of the moon...    
                        Empty yourself completely...

           Liz cocks her head, she's had enough.  Josh turns and 
           retreats up the stairs... stealthily, in character.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Josh slides the sword under his bed.  In this moment, he 
           glimpses the window.  

           Outside, the evening sky is alien - RED like he's never seen, 
           truly surreal.

                                 JOSH
                        Cool...

           He goes to the window, lifts it and studies the neighborhood.  
           He inhales and furrows his brow...

           He trains his eyes on something in the distance, the CARCASS 
           of an animal on the sidewalk.  A coyote.
           EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul’s sedan hurtles down an empty two lane road.  He streaks 
           by dimmed strip malls, supermarkets, deserted car lots. 

                                 RADIO PERSONALITY (V.O.)
                        Good evening, wherever you may be. 
                        We're still taking calls here at 
                        89.9 and we want to hear from you. 
                        How do you spend Grim Night...?

           Paul turns into a neighborhood and observes:

           A FATHER AND SON hammer nails into a boarded window, securing 
           the final plank.

           A YOUNG WOMAN watches Paul from her bedroom window behind 
           drapes, wearing a worried brow.

           In a DRIVEWAY, an ornery WIFE scolds her HUSBAND as they 
           emerge from a minivan.  They argue on their way indoors. 

           Through a living room window, we see a FAMILY kneeling in 
           prayer.  Amid clusters of candles, the patriarch recites 
           passages from a book.  A sad LITTLE GIRL draws the blinds. 

           A frayed AMERICAN FLAG hangs limp above a porch.  Below, gas 
           cans with cloth wicks sit beside a BEARDED MAN in a rocking 
           chair.  The would-be vigilante rocks slowly with a shotgun 
           across his lap, his eyes trained on the passing car.

           Paul meets his stare, warily... and presses on.

           Ahead, the road grows darker... There's not a soul in sight 
           now.  The few remaining house lights switch off as Paul nears 
           the end of the block.  

                                 RADIO CALL-IN (V.O.)
                        They take some of us out, weaken 
                        our resolve, and return later in 
                        larger numbers.  I'm telling you, 
                        Tom.  They're chipping away at 
                        us... and it scares me.

           HIGH ABOVE the car, a POV descends rapidly... A second later, 
           it IMPACTS the windshield.  Paul stops abruptly.

           The sedan sits in the road, chugging exhaust.

           Staring him in the face is a dead BLUE JAY.  Black fluid 
           gurgles from the bird's open beak.  In shock, Paul turns on 
           his wipers and the bird is thrown to the street.  He observes 
           the winged corpse on the asphalt.
           Paul gets his bearings and hits the gas...

           EXT. GREEN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           He pulls into his driveway...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           ...headlights bleed through the window.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh, thank god.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Paul pops the trunk.  His neighbor PITNEY, 71, slides her 
           window up.  With bony fingers, she sets an ashtray on the 
           sill and lifts a slim cigarette to a wrinkled purse of lips.

                                 PITNEY
                        Well, you made it.  I was beginning 
                        to wonder if you'd been, you 
                        know... eaten or whatever.

           Pitney exhales smoke.

                                 PAUL
                        Nope, not me.

           Pitney chuckles, coughs.

                                 PITNEY
                        Just wait'll your wife gets her 
                        teeth into you.

           She indicates Liz standing at the window.  Paul sees what 
           he's in for, no escaping it.  He cradles grocery bags and 
           elbows the trunk closed.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey, Pitney... you wanna spend the 
                        night?  We have the extra room.

           Pitney exhales.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I've got a sixer in the fridge...?

                                 PITNEY
                        Beer is for lightweights.

           Paul smiles.  She takes a drag.
                                 PITNEY (CONT'D)
                        You know, you invite me over every 
                        year.  Aren't you tired of getting 
                        turned down?

                                 PAUL
                        By you?  Never gets old.

           Pitney smiles affectionately as Paul starts walking around 
           the car.  He spies a small, black smear on his windshield.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (still eying the stain)
                        If you need anything, you know 
                        where we are.

                                 PITNEY
                        Don't need anything I don't already 
                        got, young man...

           Paul turns to face her.  Pitney winks.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul enters with an armful of groceries.  Sasha rushes him.

                                 SASHA
                        Daddy!

           He hugs her one-armed.  She squeezes hard.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay, okay... Sorry, I'm late guys.  
                        I got stuck in traffic, nearly ran 
                        out of gas --

                                 LIZ
                            (crossing her arms)
                        Had time to make a stop, I see...

           Paul puts the grocery bags down.

                                 PAUL
                        I just picked some stuff up at the 
                        gas station.

           Liz is unmoved.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Why are all the lights still on?

                                 LIZ
                        We were waiting for you.
                                 JOSH
                        Dad, whaddya get --

                                 LIZ
                            (interrupting)
                        Didn't we agree that no matter 
                        what, we're all home before curfew?

           The room goes silent.

                                 JOSH
                        I came home right after school.

           Sasha shoots him a look.

                                 PAUL
                            (to Liz)
                        Honey.

                                 LIZ
                        Don't honey me...

                                 PAUL
                        Look, I goofed, okay?  Things have 
                        been crazy at work, what can I say?  
                        I'm sorry...
                            (beat)
                        We're all here now and that's all 
                        that really matters... right?

                                 LIZ
                        No.

                                 PAUL
                        No?

           Liz fights off a laugh, manages a smile.

                                 JOSH
                        Holy crap, these bags are full of 
                        junk... nice!

           Josh and Sasha PICK THROUGH the brown sacks.

                                 PAUL
                            (playful)
                        I'm sure there's something with 
                        nutritional value in there.

                                 SASHA
                        Awesome, cheese puffs!

                                 PAUL
                        See?  Cheese.
           Liz smiles at her husband half-amused, half not.  She beckons 
           him with a finger.

                                 LIZ
                        A word, please?

                                 PAUL
                        Of course, dear.
                            (to the kids)
                        Guys, you think you can handle the 
                        lights?  Get some candles going?

                                 SASHA
                        Sure, Dad.

                                 JOSH
                        We know the drill.

           Both parents exit.  A moment passes.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        You think they're gonna do it?

                                 SASHA
                        Gross.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz crosses the room, plucks a bra from a basket of clean 
           laundry and places it on the bed.  Paul straddles the 
           doorway, unwilling to commit to the room.

                                 LIZ
                            (folding clothes)
                        We had a deal.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, but if I don't put in the 
                        hours down there, someone else 
                        will.  You know how it goes...

                                 LIZ
                        That's beside the point.

                                 PAUL
                        Beside the point?  Babe, we are 
                        barely surviving right now.

           Liz rolls a pair of socks and stacks them neatly.

                                 LIZ
                        We'll figure it out.
                                 PAUL
                        Figure it out?

           Paul begins to pace, his mind swirling.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul... I was scared.

           Paul stops. 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I had this feeling like something 
                        really bad was going to happen...  
                        I couldn't shake it.

                                 PAUL
                        Babe...

           Paul approaches and pulls his wife close.

                                 LIZ
                            (against his chest)
                        I dunno, it's just this night...  
                        it's awful.

                                 PAUL
                            (cradling her)
                        I know... I'm sorry.  I'm just...

           He sighs.

                                 LIZ
                        I know.

           She savors a moment of comfort in Paul's arms.  But it's 
           short-lived.  Harsh THRASHING sounds invade the room.

           Outside, a snarling wind whips power lines against a 
           darkening sky.  Jagged branches claw wildly at the house.

           The WINDOW PANES bow and flex with each gust, as if resisting 
           some malevolent force.  Paul and Liz watch in awe.  Until...

           The assault suddenly stops, all is still.  NIGHT has fallen.

           EXT. NIGHT SKY / GREEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A full moon casts pale luminance upon the house.  An upstairs 
           light switches off.
           INT. GREEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A SERIES OF SHOTS 
           Josh and Sasha turn off various LIGHTS in the house and dim 
           others.  They burn CANDLES in the kitchen, dining room and 
           living room.  Sasha latches a couple WINDOWS.

           Inside the fireplace, Josh reaches up and pulls the flue 
           closed with a loud CLANG.

           INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A SERIES OF SHOTS 
           Josh and Sasha fold out an enormous WORLD MAP and tack it to 
           the wall.  It's riddled with dozens of red sticker dots 
           scattered across the continents.

           Josh holds a handful of push pins as he watches a video on 
           his sister's computer.

           ON THE SCREEN 
           Two teens pull up to a drive-through window at night.  The 
           kid in the passenger seat is filming with his camera phone.  
           A hooded figure unexpectedly appears in the window.  The 
           teens quickly peel away, shouting obscenities.

                                 JOSH
                        That one never gets old.

           Josh loads another clip, low-res POV footage.  

                                 SASHA
                        C'mon, quit stalling.

                                 JOSH
                        Wait, check this out...

           ON THE SCREEN                                                
           A large Grim hovers atop the roof of a suburban house.  The 
           silhouetted figure is gripping a tall rod.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        It's holding something.  Never seen 
                        that before.

                                 SASHA
                            (scrutinizing the screen)
                        I have.  They were saying it's a 
                        scythe, like the Grim Reaper 
                        carries.  But I don't think so...

           The image freezes and breaks up.  Josh clicks repeatedly.
                                 JOSH
                        Internet is crapping out...

                                 SASHA
                        All right, c'mon, man...

           Josh returns his attention to the large map on the wall.  He 
           thinks a moment before confidently pressing a pin into 
           Philadelphia, PA.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        You always guess the same places.

                                 JOSH
                        You know I can't stand the Flyers.

                                 SASHA
                        I seriously doubt these things 
                        follow professional hockey.

           Sasha takes a pin from her brother's hand and thinks...

                                 JOSH
                        How do they decide where to go?

                                 SASHA
                        Maybe it's like a game...

           Sasha drifts away a moment... then slowly begins to press her 
           pin into SPRINGTON.  Their burg doesn't actually appear on 
           the map - it's been added in marker.

                                 JOSH
                        Why would you do that?  How am I 
                        supposed to sleep now?

                                 SASHA
                        Well, not supposed to sleep on Grim 
                        Night anyway...

           EXT. GREEN HOME - LATER

           We watch the house from multiple angles.  The neighborhood is 
           dark and eerily quiet.  Only crickets chirp.

           Through a window, we observe the Greens at the dinner table.  
           Utensils CLANK on plates.

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dinner is New York strip steak, mixed green salad and a side 
           of bright orange CHEESE PUFFS.  Sasha takes a crunchy BITE.
                                 JOSH
                        I heard a Grim once asked a guy for 
                        his finger.

                                 SASHA
                        Shut up.

           Josh swears a silent oath.

                                 SASHA (CONT'D)
                        What happened?

                                 JOSH
                            (pantomiming)
                        The guy... cut it off.

                                 SASHA
                        Ewwww.... nu-uh.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh, stop teasing your sister.

                                 JOSH
                        What?  That's what I heard.

                                 PAUL
                        Mm-hm.

                                 LIZ
                        Nobody is coming, guys.
                            (beat)
                        We take precautions... that's all.

           Paul doesn't voice an opinion.  An uneasy silence follows.

                                 PAUL
                        You know, when my parents were 
                        growing up, they lived in constant 
                        fear of nuclear annihilation.

                                 JOSH
                        By the Ruskies.

           Josh pantomimes mushroom cloud explosions.  Paul nods.

                                 PAUL
                        In school, there were routine bomb 
                        drills where they'd have the kids 
                        hide under their desks.

                                 JOSH
                        Cuz that'll stop a nuke.

           Sasha laughs.  Paul smiles.  Sasha bites another puff.
                                 PAUL
                        And when I was a kid, we actually 
                        did have a fallout shelter in the 
                        backyard.  Grandpa would schedule 
                        these sleep-overs where we'd spend 
                        the night down there.  You know... 
                        to get acclimated.

                                 JOSH
                        Cool.

                                 LIZ
                            (to Paul)
                        You never told me that.

                                 PAUL
                        It's true.

                                 LIZ
                        Your dad's a real piece of work.

                                 JOSH
                            (suddenly distracted)
                        Whoa....

           The boy squints across the room.  He swiftly flies out of his 
           chair, bound for the kitchen.

                                 LIZ
                        Josh.

           Sasha drops her fork and follows.

                                 PAUL
                        Sasha!  Guys, c'mon...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Josh slides to a stop at the TV on the counter.

           ON TV 
           A GRAPHIC READS: "GRIM NIGHT - FIRST FATALITIES"

           Sasha appears at her brother's side.

                                 SASHA
                            (shouts)
                        First attack!

           She tears out of the room.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha races across the room, quickly turns on the TV and 
           plants herself down.  Paul and Liz enter seconds later, still 
           chewing their food.  They fix their eyes on the SCREEN.

           ON TV 
           A local news affiliate presents aerial footage of a 
           Scandinavian city.  Several homes are on fire.

                                 PAUL
                        Where?

                                 SASHA
                        Bergen.

                                 LIZ
                        Where's that?

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Norway.

           Josh joins the gathering, giddy with morbid curiosity.  He 
           grabs the remote and turns it up.

           ON TV 
           The camera zooms in on a body spilling from an open doorway.

           Paul looks at his family, notes their worried expressions.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay you guys... here's the deal.  
                        If one of these things comes to the 
                        door, all we have to do is give it 
                        what it wants... and that'll be the 
                        end of it.  Right?

                                 SASHA
                        What if it wants a finger?

                                 PAUL
                        No fingers.

           Just then, there's a KNOCK at the front door.  

                                 LIZ
                        What was that?

                                 JOSH
                        No way.

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           Liz throws her arms around her kids.  Sasha squeals.
                                 SASHA
                        Mommmmm...

                                 PAUL
                        Whoa.  Whoa.  Everybody calm down, 
                        calm down.  Stay here...

           Paul grabs a fire poker and slowly heads for the entryway.

           At the door, another knock.  Paul cranes up to the peephole.  
           Liz and the kids are suddenly right behind him.

                                 LIZ
                            (whispers)
                        Is someone there?  Can you tell?

                                 PAUL
                            (hushed)
                        It's blocked.  Guys, you gotta get 
                        back.  Seriously.

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           Everyone shudders and backs away.  Paul creeps toward a FRONT 
           WINDOW and peers out.

                                 LIZ
                        Is something out there?

           PAUL'S POV of the front steps is obstructed by shrubs.  He 
           approaches the door again, waving everyone back.

                                 PAUL
                            (weakly, against the door)
                        Hello?

           A moment passes.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Is somebody there?

           Something SHIFTS on the concrete outside.

                                 DEEP VOICE
                        Women.

           The Greens freeze.  An eternity passes as they each consider 
           the implications of the word.

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 DEEP VOICE
                        Bring me all your women.
           The voice breaks up, turns to laughter.  Josh raises an 
           eyebrow, moves over to the door.

                                 JOSH
                        Cooper?

                                 PAUL
                        Cooper?  Who the hell is Cooper?

           Josh eyes the peephole, goes for the doorknob.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Josh, don't --

           Josh yanks the door open.  COOPER, 15, stands outside.

                                 COOPER
                        Gotcha!

                                 JOSH
                        Coop.

           The "stranger" enters.  Paul is seething.

                                 LIZ
                        Close the door!

           Paul swiftly shuts the door and secures the chain.  He turns 
           to his son, furious.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh, who the hell is this?

                                 JOSH
                        Chill, Dad.  It's just Cooper...

                                 PAUL
                        Well, Cooper, pleased to make your 
                        acquaintance.  You scared the hell 
                        out of us.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, I wasn't scared.

                                 LIZ
                            (to Cooper)
                        What are you doing out after dark?

           Cooper shrugs.

                                 COOPER
                        I was bored.

           Cooper looks Sasha up and down.  Paul tenses.
                                 PAUL
                        Your parents know where you are?

                                 COOPER
                        Nah.  My folks split up to the 
                        mountains like they do every year.  
                        It's not my bag.

                                 PAUL
                        Not your bag?  Josh, where'd you 
                        meet this guy... a Jefferson 
                        Airplane concert?

                                 LIZ
                        Cooper, you really should be with 
                        your family.  Don't you think?

                                 COOPER
                        No, I don't.

           Liz is taken aback.

                                 JOSH
                        All right then... we're going 
                        upstairs now.

           The boys race up the steps.  Paul shakes his head.

                                 LIZ
                            (calling after them)
                        Josh, I want a word with you 
                        later... Okay, darling son?

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Okay, mom...

           Liz is not pleased.

           INT. ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER

           Josh and Cooper climb out a window.  A set of binoculars 
           reside on the sill.  Josh grabs them.

           EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           The boys are perched on an eave overlooking the neighborhood.  
           Cooper produces a joint and takes a hit.  Josh turns it down.  
           He proceeds to scan the neighborhood with his field glasses.

                                 COOPER
                        So, you guys take this night pretty 
                        seriously, I see?
                                 JOSH
                            (while peeping)
                        Of course.  Everybody does.

                                 COOPER
                        Not everybody...

           He takes another hit.

                                 COOPER (CONT'D)
                        There's probably a room full of 
                        spin doctors somewhere making this 
                        shit up... conjuring all this 
                        footage and crap.

                                 JOSH
                        Sure, I suppose the moon landing 
                        was fake, too.

                                 COOPER
                        Dude, I read about that.

                                 JOSH
                            (mockingly)
                        Dude.

           Cooper cocks his fist, Josh cowers.

                                 COOPER
                        Okay, you flinched.  Take a hit.

           He extends the joint.  Josh reluctantly accepts.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                        This is how the fascist leadership 
                        keeps its death grip on us.  They 
                        show us scary pictures, tell us 
                        we're under attack... then they can 
                        get away with whatever they want.  
                        We live in a culture of fear, man.

                                 JOSH
                        But people are dying, that's real.

           Cooper rolls his eyes.

                                 COOPER
                        All these years and nobody has seen 
                        what's underneath those weird 
                        robes?  C'mon...

                                 JOSH
                        I'm sure the people who died got a 
                        pretty good look.
                                 COOPER
                        Convenient, isn't it?

           Josh shakes his head.  Cooper turns his attention elsewhere.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                        What's that?

                                 JOSH
                        What?

           Cooper points at a house down the block.

                                 COOPER
                        That.

           Josh raises the binoculars.

           MAGNIFIED VIEW 
           Lights FLICKER on and off in a house at the end of the 
           street.  Curtains in a second story window flap violently.

                                 JOSH
                        Holy shit.  I think the front door 
                        is open...

                                 COOPER
                        Let me see.

           Josh passes the binoculars.

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                            (at the top of her lungs)
                        Mom!  Dad!

           The boys turn to one another.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha and her parents are fixated on the television.

           ON TV 
           A news outlet presents chilling video - a dark shape stalks 
           the city from the POV of a traffic camera... in real time.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        Again, you are looking at live 
                        footage from New Brunswick... a 
                        traffic camera at the intersection 
                        of Maryland and East 98th.

                                 PAUL
                        New Brunswick... that's close...
           ON TV 
           The cloaked thing moves toward camera, down the center of a 
           deserted street.  Overhead lamps dim as it passes beneath 
           them.  Its gait is even and unwavering, as if it were not 
           walking at all... but levitating.

                                 LIZ
                            (terrified)
                        That isn't human.

           ON TV 
           As the billowing silhouette passes underneath the camera, the 
           image distorts... then turns to STATIC.

           Josh and Cooper come bounding down the stairs.

                                 JOSH
                        What's up?

                                 SASHA
                        Grims are in New Brunswick.

                                 COOPER
                        Really?  How many miles is that?

                                 JOSH
                        Not many.

           ON TV 
           The newscaster touches her earpiece.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        I'm being told we have tape of 
                        another incident... happened just 
                        moments ago.  What you're about to 
                        see contains graphic content.  
                        Viewer discretion is advised.

           Josh and Sasha look to their mom for approval but Liz is too 
           engrossed in the broadcast to care.

           ON TV 
           The incident is presented from a POLICE CRUISER DASH CAM:

           POV DASH-CAM 
           The cruiser stops before an overturned truck blocking the 
           road.  Two officers exit their vehicle.  Suddenly, a shape 
           appears from out of the shadows.

           The cops draw their guns and shout demands.  The creature 
           turns its head sickly and studies the officers.  It begins to 
           drift towards them.  The cops open fire, but the Grim is 
           completely unfazed.  It lunges at one of the officers, taking 
           him down... and out of sight.
           The second officer continues to fire when he's suddenly 
           yanked violently out frame.  A horrible RIPPING sound 
           follows... and a harrowing scream.  A copious amount of blood 
           sprays across the windshield of the police cruiser.  The cam 
           cuts out...

           Cooper and The Greens reel back in horror... but Sasha 
           doesn't budge.

                                 JOSH
                        Holy fuck!

           Liz shoots her son a look.  A sudden, loud BOOM outside 
           startles everyone...

                                 COOPER
                        What was that?

           The SKY rumbles again.  At the window, Josh observes.

                                 JOSH
                        Dad?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                 JOSH
                        Is it normal to have thunder 
                        without rain or lightning?

                                 PAUL
                        I dunno.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, just so you know, that's 
                        what's happening.

           Suddenly, the TV goes dark, then cuts to bars and tone.  Paul 
           grabs the remote, switches channels.  They're all the same.

           ON TV 
           A graphic suddenly appears, accompanied by a staccato warning 
           tone.  Text scrolls beneath an official emblem:

           THIS IS THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM...

           RESIDENTS OF BROWER COUNTY...

           PLEASE TUNE RADIOS TO 1060 AM IMMEDIATELY...

           LISTEN FOR DISTURBANCES...

           IF VISITED, OBEY ALL REQUESTS... AVOID EYE CONTACT...
           FAILURE TO COMPLY MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH...

           THIS IS NOT A TEST.

           Everyone absorbs the gravity of the moment.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my god.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh - radios still in the garage?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay, everybody come with me.

           INT. ATTACHED GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Greens retrieve old-school boom boxes and hand radios 
           stacked on utility shelves.  They check the on/off switches 
           and swap dead batteries for fresh ones.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Liz places a RADIO on the counter.

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Paul places a BOOM BOX on his desk and extends the antenna.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha puts a POCKET RADIO on her nightstand.  It's pink, 
           shaped like a bunny.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Josh sets a PORTABLE STEREO on his windowsill.  He dials 
           through several stations before arriving at 1060.  There's 
           faint static.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Paul, Liz and Sasha huddle together on the sofa.  Cooper sits 
           on the floor.

           Josh creeps over to the stereo cabinet.  He crouches and 
           watches the equalizer for any sudden moves.  The digital bars 
           dance calmly in a tight range, mimicking the dull hiss.

           They all wait and listen.  An eternity seems to pass...
                                 LIZ
                        Hey... why don't we play a game?

                                 SASHA
                        A game?

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah... a driving game... like 
                        twenty questions.

                                 COOPER
                        I'm in.

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A wine glass begins to vibrate on the credenza where Liz left 
           it.  The liquid inside ripples... the glass oscillates like a 
           tiny bell ringing at a high frequency.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 SASHA
                            (to Cooper)
                        Are you a potato?

                                 COOPER
                        Nope.  Not a potato.

           Liz suddenly jerks her head.

                                 LIZ
                        Do you hear that?

           Everyone listens.  The ringing gets louder and louder.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The radio on the counter suddenly BLARES...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha clings to Liz.  Paul gets up, steps carefully towards 
           the kitchen.

                                 LIZ
                            (breathless)
                        Paul...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Paul skulks into the room...

           A BLENDER suddenly pulses erratically.  Its center blade 
           spins and stops, spins and stops.
           In the sink, drifting towards the drain, into the blackness 
           of the disposal... the ROTARY BLADE whirs intermittently.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The lights flicker and dim.  Sasha whines.  Cooper looks 
           dismayed.  Josh is on the move, heading for the stairs.

                                 LIZ
                        Where are you going?

                                 JOSH
                        I'll be right back.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The disturbance on the radio grows unbearably loud and PEAKS.   
           Paul holds his ears.

           Without warning, the cacophony ceases.  Just static now.

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Paul!

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        Daddy!

                                 PAUL
                            (calling to them)
                        It's okay!

           Josh barges in, gripping his unsheathed Katana.

                                 JOSH
                        What's happening?

           Paul eyes Josh's sword, not sure what to make of it.  Liz and 
           Sasha soon enter.

                                 SASHA
                        Dad?

           Liz keeps her close.

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know, honey.

           Cooper suddenly appears, sidling up next to Liz.  She shoots 
           him a strange look.

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The radio comes alive with GRIM DISTURBANCE.
           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           They all hear the noise.  Paul runs toward it, Josh follows.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh, make sure you don't stab me 
                        with that thing.

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Paul and Josh enter the room, train their eyes on the radio.  
           The LED LIGHTS dip as the disturbance dwindles.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           One room over, a CLOCK RADIO begins to roar with the now-
           familiar sound.

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOSH
                        Guest room...

           INT. HALL / GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The two rush down the hall and check the guest room.  The 
           radio call peaks and fades, as before.

           They now hear the disturbance travel around the house, from 
           one radio to the next.

                                 JOSH
                        It's heading for the living room...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul and Josh enter.  Liz and the others soon follow.  For 
           now, all is quiet.

                                 PAUL
                        Liz, honey, take the kids upstairs.  
                        Hide in the closet.

                                 LIZ
                        Only if you're coming too.

                                 PAUL
                        Please, honey... Someone has to 
                        stay down here to answer the door.

           She shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 JOSH
                        I wanna stay and help, dad.
           Josh's eyes are wild.  Paul squeezes his shoulder.

                                 COOPER
                        Me too.

           At that precise moment, a deep, OMINOUS TONE swells and 
           shakes the room.  Speakers buzz and rattle with Grim 
           disturbance.  Everyone covers their ears.  

           A SHADOW passes the window...

                                 PAUL
                            (shouting)
                        Liz... Go!

           Liz grabs Sasha by the hand and hurries upstairs.

           The living room stereo is pushed to its limit.  In a final 
           scream of static, the SPEAKERS BLOW, the room falls silent.

           A moment passes...

           Paul grips the fire poker, Josh his Katana.  Cooper nervously 
           twirls his lighter.  All eyes are on the door.  Then...

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           Two measured HITS resound.  They jump back.

           Paul gives Josh and Coop a hard look and creeps toward the 
           door.  His heart POUNDS...

           At the door, Paul puts his ear to the wood.  He can hear 
           BREATHING on the other side... labored and menacing...     
           the malignant rasps of some unknown thing.

           Paul cautiously presses his eye against the peephole - it 
           fractures.  He jerks his head and steps back.  Something 
           below catches his eye.

           A small piece of PARCHMENT has been slipped under the door.  
           Paul stares a bit before daring to touch it.  He finally 
           picks up the note.

           ON THE PARCHMENT 
           Scrawled in black ink are the words: SIX FOUR COIN

           Paul studies the note, puzzled...

                                 JOSH
                            (whispers)
                        What is it?

           Paul looks up at the boys.
                                 PAUL
                        Search your pockets.

                                 COOPER
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        We need change... coins, whatever 
                        you can find.

           Everyone checks their pockets.  Paul comes up empty, Cooper 
           too.  Josh turns over couch cushions and hits a small 
           jackpot.  He shows his dad a handful of change.

                                 JOSH
                            (weakly)
                        Thirty-seven cents.  Is it enough?

           Paul plucks a dime from his son's palm.

                                 PAUL
                        Six plus four... is ten.          
                        This is it.

           Paul hands Josh the note and starts for the door.  Josh and 
           Cooper study the cryptic message.

                                 COOPER
                            (mouthing the words)
                        Six... four... coin?

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           The teens reel back.

           Paul is at the door with the dime.

                                 JOSH
                            (whispering)
                        Dad, what happens if you're wrong?

           Paul thinks a moment.

                                 PAUL
                        I want you guys upstairs now.
                                 JOSH
                        Dad...

           His father looks him in the eye.

                                 PAUL
                        Go.

           The boys start up the stairs.  Paul clutches the dime, 
           practically crushing it in his fist.  He kneels, presses the 
           coin to the floor... starts to inch it under the door.

                                 COOPER
                        Wait!

           Paul freezes.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                        What if it's a date?  Six-four...
                        sixty-four!

           Paul considers this, quickly withdraws the dime and retreats 
           from the room.

                                 JOSH
                        Dad?

           INT. OFFICE - SECONDS LATER

           Paul desperately rummages through his desk.  He pulls the 
           drawers open, empties them.  Josh and Cooper appear in the 
           doorway behind him.

                                 JOSH
                        What are you looking for?

                                 PAUL
                        Something your grandfather gave me 
                        a long time ago.

           He finds a cracked, leather case and snaps it open.  Inside 
           is a shimmering SILVER COIN.

                                 JOSH
                        What is it?

                                 PAUL
                        The 1964 Peace Silver Dollar.  Dad 
                        said it was about the rarest coin 
                        there is.

                                 JOSH
                        How can that thing know we have it?
           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           KNOCK.  KNOCK.

           Shock waves reverberate through the house...

           INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           These additional hits terrify Liz.  She holds onto her 
           daughter for dear life.

                                 LIZ
                            (under her breath)
                        Paul...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           At the door, white light shines through the keyhole...    
           then disappears.

           Paul stalks in and kneels down.  Josh and Cooper tail behind.   
           A floorboard creak gives them away.

                                 PAUL
                            (turns, whispers)
                        I told you guys to stay back.  Now, 
                        get back!  Way back.

           Paul places the coin flat on the floor and pushes it under 
           the door.  On the other side, a subtle scraping sound 
           indicates retrieval.

           Paul stands up.  Another quiet moment passes... He looks over 
           at Cooper and nods, silently thanking him for his help.

           The quiet continues.  Paul nervously eyes the peephole again.

           Through the fractured lens, a SHROUDED FIGURE is fragmented 
           and multiplied... as if being viewed through a kaleidoscope.  
           It STRIKES the door once and Paul jumps back.

           He looks down.  There's another NOTE.  Paul reads it to 
           himself, lets the words sink in.

                                 JOSH
                        What's it say?

           INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul OPENS the door on his wife and daughter.  They haven't 
           budged an inch from their hiding spot.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul, what...
                                 PAUL
                        It wants something else.

                                 LIZ
                        Something else?

                                 SASHA
                        Dad... are we gonna die?

                                 PAUL
                        No.  Everything's fine.  I think we 
                        just need to give it what it wants 
                        and we'll be fine.

                                 LIZ
                        What does it want?

           Paul presents the note.  Liz reads it several times, stunned.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        What...?  What does...

           THE PARCHMENT reads: HER RING

                                 PAUL
                        It must mean your wedding band...

                                 LIZ
                        But... why?

           She tears up.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Why would it want my ring?

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know, honey.  Just...

           Paul stifles his emotions.  Liz looks at the ring and 
           contemplates its meaning.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Please, just...

           Through tears, she tugs at her wedding band but to no avail.

                                 LIZ
                        It's stuck.

           She starts to panic.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I can't get it off.
                                 PAUL
                        Ok, calm down.  We'll get some soap 
                        on it and it'll come right off.

           Josh and Cooper enter.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Josh, stay with your sister.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul and Liz creep past the front door.  RASPY BREATH is 
           heard on the other side.

           Liz reacts to what sounds like some animal sucking wind, 
           perhaps inhaling her scent as they pass.

           THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.

           A BARRAGE OF HITS pound the door.  Liz shrieks in terror as 
           they race for the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Liz bangs into a table.

                                 LIZ
                        Ow...

           She hobbles over to the sink, rubs her knee.

                                 PAUL
                        We've gotta hurry, honey.

                                 LIZ
                        I am...

           She squirts liquid dish soap onto her hand.  Again, a loud, 
           impatient fist POUNDS their door.

                                 PAUL
                        Hurry...

                                 LIZ
                        I am...

           Liz rotates her ring freely on the soapy, lubricated finger.  
           It SLIPS OFF and falls, ricochets around the sink.  She grabs 
           at it desperately, but it ends up in the disposal.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Shit... Shit!

           Paul eases his wife aside and rolls up a sleeve.
           The front door is pounded again.  The overhead light in the 
           kitchen flashes and dims... The blender on the counter jerks 
           and whirs... Paul eyes the DISPOSAL, expecting it to follow.

                                 PAUL
                        Holy shit.

           Paul huffs a few breaths to psych himself up.  He plunges his 
           hand down the drain.

           Inside the disposal, Paul's fingers feel their way around the 
           cylinder, nudging the edges of the rotary blade.  His digits 
           find the ring and retreat as the motor RIPS into action.

           Paul jumps away from the sink.  He inspects his unharmed hand 
           in disbelief.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul and Liz approach the front door.  The knob is slowly 
           turning back and forth.

           Paul crouches down at the door and immediately attempts to 
           slide the ring underneath... but it doesn't fit.  He tries 
           every possible crevice.  No use.

                                 PAUL
                        Honey, you've got to get out of 
                        here.  Now.

                                 LIZ
                        What...?
                            (realizing)
                        No.

           She tugs at him weakly.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Please... don't...

                                 PAUL
                        If I don't open this door, we're 
                        all going to die.

                                 LIZ
                        Please...

                                 PAUL
                        You have to trust me... Do you 
                        trust me?

           Liz nods through tears.
                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        The kids need you...

           He squeezes her hand and lets it go.  Liz reluctantly backs 
           away and starts to sob.  She heads up the stairs.

           INT. UPSTAIRS / ATTIC DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Liz finds Josh, Cooper and Sasha standing at the top of the 
           steps, beneath the lowered entrance to the attic.  Josh has 
           his sword, Coop a baseball bat.

                                 JOSH
                        Everybody up, we'll guard the door.  

                                 LIZ
                        Not a chance, you get up there with 
                        your sister.  
                            (eyes Cooper)
                        Both of you.

           She points a shaking finger at the attic steps. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I mean it.

                                 COOPER
                        Can't do it, lady.

           Liz stands in awe.  Both boys hold fast.  Liz squeezes Sasha.

                                 LIZ
                        Go on, honey.

           Sasha climbs up into the attic.  Her mother doesn't follow.  
           Liz proceeds to raise the folding steps and shut the door.

                                 SASHA
                        Mom!

                                 LIZ
                        Don't worry baby, you'll be safe up 
                        there.  This'll all be over soon.

           Liz closes the door and confronts the boys.  She locks eyes 
           with Cooper, then her son.  Both remain vigilant.  She puts a 
           hand on each of their shoulders.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           INT. LIVING ROOM / STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Paul stands at the front door, shaking.
                                 PAUL
                            (shouts toward the stairs)
                        All right, this is it now!  Don't 
                        anybody dare come down here!

           Upstairs, Liz and the boys watch with bated breath as...

           THE DEADBOLT slowly withdraws from its socket...

           THE DOORKNOB turns ever so slowly...

           THE DOOR creaks open... stops at the CHAIN'S LENGTH.

           Cold, dead air rushes in.  Paul eyes his visitor with a 
           sideways glance.

           INT. ATTIC - SAME

           Sasha creeps toward a small, DORMER WINDOW.

           INT. FRONT DOOR / EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           The GRIM towers on the step.  Its ancient robes are tattered 
           and soiled.  Mist leaks from the folds of the copious cloak.  
           Within its hood is a black void, like the vacuum of space.  
           Each breath is a DEATH RATTLE...  

           Using the door as a shield, Paul blindly extends the ring 
           through the small opening.  The dark figure doesn't move.

           INT. ATTIC / EXT. ROOF / PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha pokes her head out the window.  She has a bird's eye 
           view of the front porch.

           With wide eyes, Sasha spots their visitor hovering below.  
           She slowly raises Josh's binoculars to get a closer look...

           But the lenses buckle and shatter.  With a jolt, Sasha moves 
           away from the window and drops the specs on the floor.

           INT. FRONT DOOR / EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Paul continues to extend the ring.  His hand trembles.
           He won't look directly at the hooded thing.

                                 PAUL
                        Please... take it.

           The Grim thrusts out a raven, rotted claw.  Its long finger 
           bones crack sickly as it opens.
           Paul drops the ring into the Grim's waiting hand.  A tense 
           moment ensues.  The Grim finally closes its rotten fist 
           around the offering.

           The creature turns and slowly drifts off... disappearing into 
           the night.  Paul finally shuts the door.  He leans his back 
           to it and slides down.  

           He exhales as if he's just been held underwater.

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Dad... is it gone?

           Josh appears on the stairs.  Paul nods, exhausted.  

           EXT. GREEN HOUSE - SAME

           We drift away from the front door, leaving the home far 
           behind, in peace...

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Ice cream containers frost and drip on the kitchen table.  
           They've been sitting awhile.  Josh and Coop eye their melting 
           dessert with complete disinterest.

           Paul plucks a bottle of his best scotch from a high cupboard 
           and lines up a glass on the counter below.  He can feel Josh 
           and Coop's eyes on him.

           Without thinking twice, Paul grabs two additional tumblers 
           and returns to the table.  He proceeds to pour three drinks - 
           a double for himself and smaller shots for the boys. 

           He pushes the glasses toward the teens.  They look to him.  
           Paul nods approvingly and the men take a drink.  

           Coop's eyes water, Josh suppresses a cough.  Paul once again 
           nods in approval, then takes their glasses away.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM / HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha stands at the mirror, lost in thought.  She itches a 
           spot on her neck - a BIRTHMARK.  The brown pigmentation is   
           an odd spiral shape.  

           Liz appears in the doorway.

                                 LIZ
                        Sash?

           Sasha remains entranced.
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        C'mon pretty girl, we're doin' ice 
                        cream now...

                                 SASHA
                        I want a bath.
                            (beat)
                        I'll have ice cream after.

           Liz strokes her daughter's hair sympathetically and smiles.

                                 LIZ
                        Everything okay?

                                 SASHA
                        Yeah.  I'm just cold.

                                 LIZ
                        You're taking a bath because you're 
                        cold?  You sure you're okay?

           Sasha shoots her mom a back-off look.  Liz relents.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        All right... Okay...

           Liz shrugs off her daughter's mood and exits down the hall.  
           Behind her, the bathroom door closes firmly.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Josh and Coop spoon ice cream in silence - the mood remains 
           muted.  Liz enters and Paul looks up at her.

                                 LIZ
                        She's taking a bath.

           Liz pours herself a glass of wine, plops down at the table.

                                 PAUL
                        Well...
                            (raising his glass)
                        We survived Grim Night.  May we 
                        never have another like it.

           Liz and Paul clink glasses.  The boys raise ice cream bowls 
           and smile knowingly.

                                 LIZ
                            (to Cooper)
                        So what were you before?

                                 COOPER
                        What?
                                 LIZ
                        Twenty questions.

                                 COOPER
                        Oh... I was a kiwi fruit.

           Liz nods and smiles.

                                 COOPER (CONT’D)
                        You know Mrs. Green, my mom makes 
                        jewelry.  I could probably get you 
                        a new ring, no charge.

           Liz is genuinely touched.

                                 LIZ
                        That's very sweet.

           She smiles, eyes her husband.

                                 PAUL
                        Cooper, I've changed my mind.  I'm 
                        not going to kill you anymore.

           The group shares a cathartic laugh.  Liz lifts her glass to 
           her lips and nearly sips... but stops short.

           A DROP OF WATER falling from above ripples the surface of her 
           drink.  Another drop... then another...

           She reluctantly looks UP... everyone follows her gaze.  A 
           wet, SAGGING PATCH of drywall is leaking over the table.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh, God...

           Paul and Liz react in tandem.  They abandon the table,  
           racing from the room at top speed...

           INT. STAIRS - SECONDS LATER

           ...they hurry up the steps.

                                 LIZ
                        Sasha!

                                 PAUL
                        We're coming!

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM / HALL - CONTINUOUS

           At the bathroom door, water spills out underneath.  Paul and 
           Liz approach, fling the door open...
           Inside, the tub is overflowing... but Sasha is gone.  

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my god... Sasha!

           Paul quickly switches off the faucet and yanks towels onto 
           the floor.  Liz looks up and down the hall.  No sign of her.

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Mom!  Dad!

           Paul and Liz share a terrified look.

           INT. LIVING ROOM / EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Josh and Cooper are staring out the front window.  Paul and 
           Liz quickly join them and see...

           ...Sasha standing on the FRONT LAWN with her back to them.  
           She's fully dressed.

                                 LIZ
                        Sasha!

           Paul and Liz RUSH out the front door to meet her.  

           EXT. FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

                                 PAUL
                        Sasha?

                                 LIZ
                        Baby, what are you doing?

           Liz hugs her daughter, then holds her at arms length.  The 
           girl's eyes are open but she's clearly somewhere else.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (to Paul)
                        She's sleepwalking.
                            (to Sasha)
                        Honey, wake up.

           A noise in the trees snaps Paul's head around.  A BLACKBIRD 
           gilded by moonlight sits on a bobbing branch.  It tauntingly 
           flits its shiny wings.  Paul turns back to his daughter.

                                 PAUL
                            (loud)
                        Sasha!

           He shakes her gently, she comes to.
                                 SASHA
                        Daddy?

                                 PAUL
                        Let's go.

           They hurry back inside and slam the door.  Behind them, the 
           night is dead silent.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           ON TV 
           The EBS alert repeats in silence.  "MUTE" appears on-screen.

           Sasha lay in a bean bag chair under blankets.  Cooper's 
           crashed on the couch.  Josh is next to him, nodding off.  
           Paul and Liz cuddle in an armchair.

                                 LIZ
                        Think it's safe to put 'em to bed?

                                 PAUL
                        Sure... But I think I'm going to 
                        stay up a little longer.

           Liz gives her "protector" a kiss and heads for the kids...

                                 LIZ
                            (hushed)
                        C'mon, guys.  Up to bed...

           Suddenly, the mute overlay on the TV disappears.  The set 
           BLARES miserably loud.  Everyone snaps to attention.

           Then, The TV shuts off completely, goes black.  Silence...

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

                                 LIZ
                            (weakly)
                        No, no, no...

           Paul eyes the door.  There's a NOTE on the floor.  Not 
           wanting his orders disobeyed, Paul becomes extremely stern.

                                 PAUL
                        Everybody out, now!  Hide.

           Liz quickly leads Sasha out of the room.  Josh and Coop duck 
           behind the couch in the darkness.
           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Liz and Sasha enter the bathroom.  The floor is littered with 
           wet towels.  They climb in the tub, pull the curtain closed.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOSH
                            (whispering to Cooper)
                        They're not supposed to          
                        come back...

           Paul studies the latest demand.  His face is a mask of dread.

           The parchment reads: HAIR OF GIRL

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul OPENS the door.

                                 PAUL
                        Liz?

           Liz eases the shower curtain back.  Sasha is curled in her 
           lap, clearly ill.

                                 LIZ
                        She's not doing well.
                            (beat)
                        What is it?

           Paul holds the piece of parchment in his hand.

                                 PAUL
                        Can you come out here a second?

           Liz squeaks out of the tub, minding her listless daughter.

                                 LIZ
                        I think she has a temperature.

                                 PAUL
                            (to Sasha)
                        We'll be right back, okay?

           Both parents exit, the door clicks shut.

           INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Paul shows Liz the note.  Liz snatches it from him and covers 
           her mouth in horror.

                                 LIZ
                        Her hair?  Why?
           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha lies still, curled in the tub, eyes wide, listening.

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        How does it even know she's here?

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        How does it know to ask for any of 
                        this stuff... it's madness.  But we 
                        have to do this.

           INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

                                 LIZ
                        I can't, I can't...

                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        I'll do it.

           Paul and Liz eye their son down the hall, then each other.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens slowly.

                                 JOSH
                            (whispers)
                        Sis?

           Josh enters carrying scissors, stoops over the tub.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                            (whispers)
                        Sis, it's me.

           Sasha is out of it.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        I'm just going to give you a little 
                        trim, okay?

           He leans in and stretches her brown locks between the blades.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about this.

           Snik, snik.  Josh clutches the trimmings and turns to his dad 
           in the doorway.  Sasha's severed locks float and land in 
           Paul's cupped palms.

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.
           INT. FRONT DOOR / LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul immediately slides the hair under the door, folded in 
           the same parchment he was given.  Paul moves back several 
           paces.  He waits and listens.  A silent eternity passes.

           Startlingly, ANOTHER NOTE appears.  The paper seems to move 
           on its own, sliding across the floor, right up to Paul's 
           foot.  He boldly snatches the note.

           It simply says: GIRL

           Paul's breathing changes.  He starts to shake.  

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

           Paul looks up at the door.  When he returns to the note, the 
           ink begins to bleed.  The letters shift and twist.  They form 
           a familiar symbol, a spiral shape - SASHA'S BIRTHMARK.  

           Josh and Cooper peer out from the railing.

                                 JOSH
                        What's happening, dad?

           The Grim BANGS on the front door with a force that threatens 
           to bust it off its hinges.

           INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul enters the bathroom where Liz is cradling Sasha.  Liz 
           eyes the note in Paul's hand.

                                 LIZ
                        What is it?  What does it want now?

           Paul looks her deep in the eyes, looks at Sasha.  He tears 
           up.  Liz instantly understands.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Paul, no...

           She grabs the note and studies it, momentarily vexed.  But it 
           quickly sinks in.  She gently pulls her daughter's hair aside 
           to confirm what she already knows -- the symbol on her neck 
           matches the note.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Her birthmark...?  How --

                                 PAUL
                        The attic.  Let's go.
           INT. UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

           The ATTIC STEPS come down.  Liz follows Sasha up, placing her 
           hand on the girl's back.

                                 PAUL
                            (to Liz)
                        Block the entrance.

           Liz turns back to her husband.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul...

           Liz stares at Paul longingly.  She places her hands firmly on 
           his cheeks and KISSES him hard, then ascends into the attic.

           Paul turns to Josh and Coop.

                                 PAUL
                        Boys, come with me.  Stay close.

           INT. STAIRS / LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Josh brandishes his katana.  Cooper wields the bat.  Paul 
           grips the fire poker.

           From the railing, we watch the three men descend into the 
           living room.  The house seems darker than ever.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The RADIO on the counter blares with disturbance.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOSH
                        Kitchen.

           Josh starts toward the kitchen but his father stops him.

                                 PAUL
                        Wait.

           At the other end of the house, another radio sounds....   
           then another... and another...  

           Horrible noises emanate from every room.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (softly)
                        They're all around us.

           BANG, BANG!
           The front door is struck so hard, the wood CRACKS.  Startled 
           into action, the men make for the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOSH
                        What are we gonna do?

           From down the hall, they hear a thunderous CRASH against the 
           side of the house...

                                 COOPER
                        They're coming...

           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           Liz finishes sliding some boxes over the door on the floor.  
           Sasha stands silent, looking lost.

                                 LIZ
                        Baby, do you have your phone?

           Silence.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Sasha!

           The girl slowly retrieves a PINK CELLPHONE from her pocket.  
           Liz takes the little handset and quickly dials 911.

                                 PRERECORDED VOICE
                        We're sorry.  All circuits are
                        busy.  Please try...

           Liz curses under her breath.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Paul, Josh and Coop are in the eye of the storm - surrounded 
           by harsh, whirling noise.  Small appliances operate in fits.

           During a brief lull, a grating sound emanates from a window 
           along the wall...

           The men turn at the sound.  They watch in horror as the latch 
           flips over on its own.  The window slowly RISES.

           A BLACK HAND reaches through... Josh instinctively lunges 
           forward and strikes with his Katana sword.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh!!
           The blade shatters on impact, as if the Grim were stone, and 
           the sword made of glass.

           With supernatural speed, the Grim grabs Josh on his bare arm.  
           The boy screams.

           Paul leaps to Josh's aid and swings his fire poker.  In a 
           flash, the Grim releases Josh and intercepts the iron rod.

           Paul and his son scramble away from the window as the Grim 
           disappears with the old tool.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (to Josh)
                        Let me see it...

           Paul inspects his son's arm.  The impression in his flesh is 
           red and deep.

                                 JOSH
                        I'm okay...
                            (abruptly)
                        Dad!

           The Grim has returned.  It watches from the window, spies 
           Cooper standing helpless in a corner...

           Two LUMINOUS ORBS twinkle within the Grim's black hood.  
           Cooper is transfixed by the white lights...

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Coop, no!!

           Cooper loses his grip on the bat and it falls to the floor.  
           The boy's eyes become clouded by cataracts.  He SCREAMS in 
           agony... he's gone blind.

           The Grim drops out of sight.  Paul races to the window and 
           LOCKS it shut.  Cooper stumbles about, covering his burning 
           eyes with trembling hands.

                                 COOPER
                            (in pain)
                        I can't see, man... I can't see.

           Paul gently takes him by the shoulders.

                                 PAUL
                            (voice cracking)
                        It's gonna be okay...

           The boy is inconsolable.  He wrestles free of Paul and 
           staggers toward the window.  Josh approaches his friend. 
                                 JOSH
                        Coop...

           Suddenly, the window SHATTERS... Two raven hands reach 
           through the explosion of glass and grab Cooper by the face.  

           The Grim begins to pull the boy through the window...

           Josh grabs Cooper's hand but loses his grip as the teen is 
           yanked outside.  Josh sticks his arm out the window, probing 
           for his friend.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        No!!

           Paul rushes over and quickly restrains his son.  He yanks him 
           away from the broken window and pushes a free-standing 
           cabinet in front of the gaping hole.

           EXT. BACKYARD / INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, Cooper has been thrown to the ground.  He scrambles 
           to his feet.  There are no Grims in sight.

           Blind and disoriented, Cooper stumbles further into the yard.  

           Inside, Josh moves toward the back door but Paul stops him.  
           The teen struggles in his father's arms.

                                 JOSH
                            (tearing up)
                        Let me go!  

           Cooper ambles helplessly across the grass....

           Paul and Josh watch from the window above the sink as the boy 
           enters a clearing in the backyard.  Paul holds his son tight, 
           they tremble together...

           In the yard, FOUR GRIMS converge on Cooper in a flurry of 
           frenzied activity.  Rips.  Screams.  Moist, smacking sounds.

           Josh cries out.  He STRIKES the window with his FIST.  Paul 
           averts his eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        Don't look...

           In the yard, a cluster of BLACK SHAPES pull away from their 
           prey, disappearing once more into the darkness.  They leave 
           behind only a BLOODY SMEAR in the grass.
           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           LIZ watches the floor with a hand cupped over her mouth. 
           Sasha idles a few paces behind her.

                                 SASHA
                        Mom...?

           Liz doesn't respond.  Instead, she tries the phone again.  It 
           rings several times.

                                 LIZ
                        C'mon... c'mon...

                                 OPERATOR
                        911.  What is your emergency?

                                 LIZ
                            (talking fast)
                        Oh thank god, my name is Liz Green. 
                        You have to help me, my family is 
                        under attack...

                                 OPERATOR
                        Okay, okay, slow down, Miss.  What 
                        is your location?

                                 LIZ
                        Yes, the address is --

           The conversation is suddenly interrupted by harsh static.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Hello?

           Behind Sasha, a shadow stirs.  A familiar FORM silently 
           emerges from the dark.  The child senses something but turns 
           too late... Sasha is promptly enveloped in black robes.

           Liz whips around, sees nothing.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (faintly)
                        Sasha... ?

           She panics, scans the attic.  The MAIN ATTIC WINDOW is wide 
           open and vibrating.  Wind-kicked curtains float back into 
           position.  She's gone.
           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Paul and Josh are still reeling from Cooper's murder.  They 
           stand in the middle of the room - shards of glass and metal 
           at their feet.  They're locked in an embrace, the boy sobbing 
           into his father's chest. 

                                 JOSH
                        I wanted to save him...

           Paul strokes his son's hair with a trembling hand.

                                 PAUL
                        I know you did, son.  I'm sorry... 

           Paul tightens his grip on Josh as the churning clamor on the 
           RADIO begins to taper off...

           INT. ATTIC / EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           AT THE WINDOW, Liz scans the street below.  A PACK OF GRIMS
           are on the move, racing away from the house.  They disappear 
           into the night.

                                 LIZ
                        No...

           A moment of complete STILLNESS follows.  A terrible peace.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (barely audible)
                        Paul...

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Paul and Josh are suddenly jolted by a hoarse CRY...

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        PAUL!!!

           Father and son lock eyes and immediately bolt from the room.

           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           Liz clears the door in the floor.  Paul scrambles up with 
           Josh in tow.

                                 LIZ
                            (in total panic mode)
                        Oh my god Paul, they took her, they 
                        took her...

                                 PAUL
                        What?  How?
                                 LIZ
                        I don't know how they got in here.  
                        I don't know, I mean I was here...  
                        I was right here!

           Paul tries to keep it together.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay, what did you see?

                                 LIZ
                        I saw them through the window, they 
                        carried her away... she's gone.

                                 PAUL
                        They carried her away...

           Paul goes to the window and looks out.

                                 JOSH
                            (realizing)
                        All they wanted was her.  They 
                        didn't care what happened to us.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul, she's alive.  I know it...

           A terrible moment passes, no one knows what to do...

           Paul GLOWERS, his gaze intensifies.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay.  I'm going.

                                 JOSH
                        What?

           Josh is beside himself.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Out there?  Dad, don't...

           The boy clings to his father.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                            (whimpering)
                        ...they'll get you like they got 
                        him.  Please, don't...

           Liz meets her husband's eyes.  In that moment, she knows 
           Cooper is dead.

                                 PAUL
                        Son, please.
                                 LIZ
                            (with finality)
                        No.

           Paul and Josh turn to face the woman of the house.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        We all go.

           INT. STAIRS / LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul, Josh and Liz race downstairs and split up.  Liz rushes 
           to the front window and peers outside.

           Through the window, all is quiet... peaceful.

           INT. ATTACHED GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Paul bursts through the door and rushes toward a shelf on the 
           far wall, stumbling over bins and boxes to get there.

           At the shelf, he eyes a RIFLE CASE and shoots it a look of 
           disdain.  Guns won't help.  Nothing will.

           Paul grabs the FLASHLIGHTS he came for.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Josh stares out the window blankly.  He's cradling the hilt 
           of his broken KATANA.  Suddenly, the boy's HAND starts to 
           twitch and tremble.  Josh looks at it, furrows his brow.  A 
           single bead of sweat rolls from his cheek.  The trembling 
           stops as...   

           ...Liz approaches.

                                 LIZ
                        Josh, honey?

           Josh doesn't answer.  Liz casts her eyes downward, comforts 
           her son with a hand on the shoulder.

                                 JOSH
                        Mom?

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah.

                                 JOSH
                        What are they doing with her?

           Liz goes blank, suddenly disarmed.  It's a question she 
           doesn't want answered.
                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Guys...

           Paul enters and hands out flashlights.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Careful how you use these, okay?   
                        We don't want to attract attention.

           At the backdoor, Paul puts his face against the window.     
           He studies the backyard for predators but instead finds      
           a single, BLOODY SNEAKER catching moonlight in the grass.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I'm gonna make a run for the car.  
                        Don't come out until I give the 
                        signal, okay?

           No response.  Paul turns to find his wife and son holding one 
           another for dear life.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (pleading)
                        Okay?

           They both nod somberly.

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        We're going to get through this...

                                 JOSH
                        Dad?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                 JOSH
                        What's the signal?

           Paul raises his arm and gives a THUMBS UP.  They lock eyes 
           one last time.  Paul takes a breath and twists the knob.

                                 PAUL
                        Lock this behind me.

           He exits the house.  The door clicks shut.

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Paul navigates the steps and proceeds cautiously on a paved 
           path to the driveway.
           At once, a chorus of CRICKET CHATTER explodes around him, 
           perhaps a million strong.  But Paul sees nothing.  He hastens 
           toward his vehicle.

           INT. KITCHEN WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           Liz stands cross-armed, her back to the action.  She can't 
           watch.  Josh is glued to the window.

                                 JOSH
                        He's almost there.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY / CAR - CONTINUOUS

           But Paul fumbles keys as he approaches the driver's side.  
           They slip from his fingers and hit the pavement with a CRASH.  
           Startled and exposed, he ducks down.

           INT. KITCHEN WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           Liz now hovers over Josh's shoulder.

                                 JOSH
                        He dropped the keys.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul picks up the jangling ring, keeping a watchful eye on 
           the surrounding darkness.

           He quickly unlocks the car door and opens it.  Once in the 
           driver's seat, Paul gives the THUMBS UP.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 JOSH
                        Mom...

                                 LIZ
                        Okay.  Let's go.

           They OPEN the backdoor...

           INT. CAR / EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Paul watches his wife and son stalk toward him.  He waves 
           them on.  They quicken their pace.

           Car doors creep open in silence.  Mother and son enter 
           carefully - Liz getting in the front seat, Josh the back.  
           They pull the doors shut as quietly as possible.

                                 PAUL
                        Seat belts.
           His wife and son oblige.  Click, click. 

           Paul starts the ENGINE and immediately tunes the radio to 
           1060.  For the time being, the station produces only static.

           He shifts into reverse with a white-knuckled grip and glances 
           up at Pitney's house.  It's dark, nothing stirs.

           The car backs out slowly...

           EXT. CUL-DE-SAC / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Rolling away, the sedan proceeds with its headlights off.  
           Only street lamps light their path.  All residences are 
           blacked out.  Not a soul in sight...

                                 PAUL
                        Everybody keep your eyes open.  She 
                        could be anywhere.

           FLASH ON

           Sasha's sleeping face is revealed by flashes of moonlight.  
           Her cascading hair drifts over swaths of concrete, grass and 
           dirt.  She's being carried aloft, taken somewhere.

           At once, BLACK FLUID leaks from the girl’s hairline.  Two 
           thin streams trickle down Sasha’s forehead, past her eyelids 
           and over her cheeks.  It gives the impression of black tears.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Liz and Josh study their surroundings with furrowed brows.

           From the rooftops, we observe the sedan navigate the darkened 
           road.  Its whining engine is the only sound in the dead calm.

           Behind them, their home sits wounded, lonely.  Josh watches 
           it shrink on the horizon as they sail into darkness...

           EXT. DARK ROAD / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul clicks a FLASHLIGHT on and holds it out the window, 
           scanning darkened homes and driveways for clues...

           He glimpses an open doorway with a pair of STIFF LEGS 
           sticking out.  The man is missing one shoe.  Inside, lights 
           flicker and strobe.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus...
           From afar, we see Paul's narrow BEAM projecting out the car.  
           A SECOND LIGHT appears from the passenger seat and probes 
           wildly, illuminating flashes of grass and trees.

           Paul quickly kills his flashlight, then snatches the one Liz 
           is wielding.  He switches it off.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        That's it.  We're gonna give 
                        ourselves away.

                                 LIZ
                        But how are we supposed to --

                                 PAUL
                        We're a moving target with these 
                        things on, it's not gonna work.

                                 LIZ
                            (frustrated)
                        Let's just keep looking...

           Josh squirms in the backseat.  The boy grimaces and grabs his 
           ARM.  Then...

           A MILD DISTURBANCE is suddenly heard over the radio.  Josh 
           sits up straight.  Liz and Paul lock eyes.

           The sound is getting louder...

           Far ahead, a lone, SHROUDED FIGURE drifts down the street.  
           Paul hits the brakes.

           The Greens watch in horror as the dark thing floats above the 
           asphalt, heading away from them.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (breathless)
                        Oh god...

           The car begins to crawl forward... Liz shoots her husband a 
           look.  Paul paces the Grim, keeping a safe distance...

                                 JOSH
                        Dad...

           The Grim STOPS in its tracks.  Paul brakes again.

                                 LIZ
                            (mouth agape)
                        Can it hear us?

           They wait.  Josh SHIVERS.
           Ahead, the Grim suddenly rotates as if on a swivel.  Its gaze 
           passes over their car and lands on a house nearby...

           The creature advances toward it, passing an abandoned ROCKING 
           CHAIR on the porch as it glides up to the front door...

           A haunting and familiar sound echoes through the night... 
           KNOCK.  KNOCK.  KNOCK.

           The Greens watch with morbid fascination.  Liz swallows hard.  

           Suddenly, a bloody HAND slaps the window next to Liz.  She 
           jumps in her seat.  Outside the car is a frantic WOMAN 
           wearing only a housecoat.  Her cheeks are hot with tears, her 
           forehead gashed and bleeding.

                                 WOMAN
                        Please... help!  Would you...?

           In a split second, the desperate woman is wrenched away into 
           the dark - TAKEN by unseen hands.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul!  Go!

           Paul snaps to and cuts the wheel.  They promptly U-TURN and 
           drive away.  They're in the clear, until...

           A POWERFUL EXPLOSION rocks the neighborhood behind them.  A 
           ball of fire roils upward, momentarily turning night to day.

           INTENSE LIGHT flashes through the car windows.  Liz screams.

                                 PAUL
                        What the hell was that?

           Beads of sweat cover Josh's forehead.  The boy seems to have 
           slipped into shock.  With glazed eyes, he observes the 
           fireball reflecting on the window...  

           He then shifts his gaze down the road only to spy ANOTHER 
           CLOAKED FIGURE... The Grim drifts toward an alley...  

           It has SASHA.

                                 JOSH
                        Dad, stop!  Stop the car!

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        It's Sasha.  I just saw Sasha! 
                        Stop now!
           Paul hits the brakes.  Before he or Liz can react, Josh pops 
           open his door and bolts from the car.

                                 LIZ
                            (grabbing after him)
                        Joshua!

                                 PAUL
                        What the hell?  
                            (shouts) 
                        Son!

           Paul and Liz quickly exit the car.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Josh dashes off in pursuit of his Grim.  The boy's face 
           sweats profusely - he's delirious.  He turns down an alley.

           Paul and Liz chase after him on foot.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh!

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Josh stumbles into trashcans with a loud CRASH.  He falls...

           Liz and Paul key on the sound.  They race further into the 
           dark and find their son lying amid overturned refuse.

                                 LIZ
                        Josh!

           Josh rises to his feet, trying to catch his breath...      
           Paul grabs him by the shoulders, looks him in the eye.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you okay?

                                 JOSH
                            (unsure)
                        Dad, I thought I saw her...

           Josh cranes his neck, looks toward the end of the alley.  
           Paul follows his son's cue... and in total desperation TAKES 
           OFF down the backstreet.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul!

           Liz and Josh race to catch up with him.
           EXT. ALLEY / EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens emerge from the alley to face an empty street.    
           The road disappears into dark horizons on either side.

                                 PAUL
                            (hushed)
                        Which way?

                                 JOSH
                            (scanning the streets)
                        I dunno, dad... I --

           Suddenly, there's a FLUTTERING SOUND overhead... 

           All at once...

           Thousands of SPARROW CORPSES fall from the open sky in a 
           torrent of gore.  The Greens backpedal as a glut of rotted 
           meat and feathers SPLASH DOWN before them.

           They observe the dead heap, mouths agape... 

                                 PAUL
                            (gravely)
                        Okay... back to the car, now.

           He grabs his wife and son and hustles them back toward the 
           abandoned sedan...  We follow on their heels.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Behind them, street lamps begin to BLOW OUT...

           One by one, the fluorescent bulbs explode, from farthest to 
           nearest, catching up with them...

                                 PAUL
                        Move!

           EXT. STREETS / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Car doors swing open.  The Greens quickly take their 
           positions inside the vehicle.  Paul starts it up and they 
           SPEED away.

           At the end of the street, they halt at an intersection, a T 
           in the road.  

                                 LIZ
                        Honey?

                                 PAUL
                        I don't know....
           He continues to idle.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul, pick a direction, we have to 
                        keep moving...

           Paul grips the wheel in hopeless frustration... then 
           something comes over him.  He looks up at Liz.

                                 PAUL
                        I might know someone who can help.

           He makes a quick LEFT.  Josh slumps in the backseat.  The boy 
           uses his shirtsleeve to wipe his brow...

           EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

           The full moon hangs enormous and bright above Harut's shop.

           INT. HARUT'S STORE - CONTINUOUS

           The store is illuminated by the soft glow of refrigerated 
           grocery cases.  Harut sits behind the counter and handles a 
           clunky cassette RECORDER.

           Harut pops in a homemade tape.  He presses PLAY and soaks up 
           the soothing sounds of Andy Williams:

           "Moon river... wider than a mile... I'm crossing you in 
           style... someday..."

           By the register rests a framed photograph of a lovely Indian 
           woman.  A solitary flower leans against it.

           Harut gets up and looks out the glass doors of his store, 
           scans the empty street.  He then proceeds to collect various 
           items from the shelves and cases: BREAD, MEAT, CHEESE.

           The storekeeper builds an unusual sandwich, thickly buttering 
           his bread and mashing a pile of potato chips into the ham and 
           cheese between.

           As he takes an enormous bite, Harut stops the cassette player 
           and reaches for another tape.  He pops it in, picks up a 
           small mic attached via cable and hits RECORD.

                                 HARUT
                            (in Hindi)
                        Question...  
                            (beat)
                        What if all of this is our fault?  
                        Human beings have a strange need to 
                        believe in monsters...
           Harut takes another bite, pleased with his latest insight.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                            (in Hindi)
                        Is it possible that we --

           Harut is interrupted by a KNOCK at the door.  Startled, he 
           looks up and sees THREE FIGURES silhouetted behind the glass.

           Harut picks up a FLASHLIGHT and cautiously approaches the 
           storefront.  He pans the light across the faces of his three 
           visitors: Josh, Liz, then Paul.

           When he reaches Paul, a look of recognition comes over Harut.  
           He swiftly unlocks the door and pulls it open.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        Come in, come in.  It's not safe to 
                        be out on the street. 

           The family enters.  Harut locks the door again and looks 
           outside, sees nothing.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 PAUL
                        It's our daughter, Sasha...

                                 LIZ
                            (blurts out)
                        They took her.

                                 HARUT
                        What?

                                 LIZ
                            (emotional)
                        One of them came to the door and 
                        asked for her.  We couldn't...
                            (beat)
                        We tried to hide her but those 
                        things, they kept coming... 

           The storekeeper is mortified.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        ...and they took her.

           Harut looks at them sharply, first Liz then Paul.  
                                 HARUT
                        I've never heard of such a thing... 
                            (beat)
                        How old is your daughter?

                                 LIZ
                        She's... fifteen.  Why?

           Harut turns away, uncertain.  He gazes upon the night with 
           sad, reflective eyes.

                                 PAUL
                        When we spoke earlier, you seemed 
                        to know a lot... about them. 

           Harut turns, locks eyes with Paul.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Please...
                            (beat)
                        What can we do to get her back?

           Liz grabs Paul's hand.

                                 HARUT
                            (with grave certainty)
                        If they took her... 

           FLASH ON / INTERCUT

           A GIRL'S BODY is dragged across a dark surface.  We glimpse a 
           mess of tangled hair - flashes of filth on pale, naked flesh. 

                                 HARUT (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
                        ...she's lost.

           The girl's head flops over sickly - it's Sasha.  Her eyes are 
           distant, mouth agape.  She's listless...

           Sasha is dragged out of frame.  Into a dark void.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                        The Grims bring only death. 

                                 LIZ
                            (weeping)
                        No... she's alive... and we have to 
                        find her.

           Harut eyes her with deep empathy.  He shakes his head, no.
                                 HARUT
                        I'm sorry...

                                 PAUL
                        We have to try, dammit.  We have to 
                        try something.  If we give up on 
                        her... I don't... Please.

           Harut thinks long and hard, wrestles with unwanted memories.  
           He sighs deeply.

                                 HARUT
                        I've always questioned the notion 
                        that these attacks are random. 
                            (beat)
                        There must be some purpose... 
                        Something we don't understand.  

                                 JOSH
                        They collect things.

           Harut stops and looks at the boy.  His gaze lingers a moment 
           on Josh's pale, perspiring face.

                                 HARUT
                        That's right.  
                            (to Paul and Liz)
                        They took your child - this cannot 
                        be chalked up to chance.  So if the 
                        Grims are still here, she is too.
                            (beat)
                        Perhaps... perhaps they’re keeping 
                        her somewhere...    

                                 LIZ
                        But where?  Where do we look?

           Paul eyes Harut's portable player on the counter.

                                 PAUL
                        The radio... it goes crazy anytime 
                        one gets close, right?  So what if 
                        instead of driving away...

                                 LIZ
                        We drive towards the signal.

           Paul and Liz lock eyes, perhaps onto something.

           Harut lowers his gaze and shakes his head.

                                 HARUT
                        I can't say I like your chances...  
                                 LIZ
                        We are going after her.

                                 HARUT
                        Then you must hurry.  Only a few 
                        hours until sunrise...

           Suddenly, a chill jolts through Josh's body.  In a feverish 
           haze, he CRASHES into a magazine rack.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh!

           The sick teen clutches his arm, Paul and Liz rush to his aid.

                                 JOSH
                        My arm...

           Paul quickly examines the boy's appendage...

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my god!  What is it?!

           On Josh's arm, the flesh has turned BLACK and infected from 
           the Grim's touch.  The dark marks look like a cancer beneath 
           the skin.

                                 PAUL
                        He... he was touched.

                                 LIZ
                        What?!

                                 PAUL
                        Before... in the kitchen.  
                            (beat)
                        I thought...

                                 HARUT
                            (eyeballing the wound)
                        My god... he needs immediate
                        medical attention.

           Harut grabs a TOWEL from a nearby shelf.  He creates a 
           makeshift tourniquet and ties it around the boy's bicep.    
           Liz and Paul watch, dumbfounded.

                                 PAUL
                        St.  Mary's isn't far from here...

                                 LIZ
                        The hospital?  But Sasha...
                                 HARUT
                        This infection must be kept from 
                        spreading... it's his only chance.

           Harut's words hit them hard.  Liz caresses her son.

                                 LIZ
                        Sweetie...

                                 JOSH
                        Mom, I think I can--

           KNOCK.  KNOCK.  KNOCK.

           They all turn and see a visitor whose shape is 
           unmistakable... It's a GRIM.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh, God...

           The family huddles close together and backs away, taking 
           refuge behind a food display.  

           Harut slowly approaches the door until he's within inches of 
           the creature - only a plate of glass divides them.

           Harut quickly looks down and spots a slip of PARCHMENT at his 
           feet.  He picks it up and studies it a long while, not saying 
           a word.  He appears deeply disturbed.

           Harut looks back at the family, then returns to the note.

                                 PAUL
                            (whispers)
                        What does it say?

           Harut shakes his head and crumples the paper in his fist.   
           He approaches the family.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 HARUT
                            (speaking softly)
                        Leave.  Go out the back.

                                 PAUL
                        What?

           Harut hands over his car keys.

                                 HARUT
                        Take my car.  It's parked outside.
           The family hesitates, studies Harut.

                                 HARUT (CONT’D)
                         Go now.

           Paul nods, gives Harut an intense farewell look.  The family 
           retreats through the back of the store.

           The Grim impatiently POUNDS the glass doors.  Harut closes 
           his eyes and takes a deep breath.

           EXT. BACK OF HARUT'S STORE - CONTINUOUS

           As the family cautiously approaches Harut's vintage TOWN CAR, 
           they suddenly stop. 

           Five BIG BLACKBIRDS are perched atop the vehicle.  The 
           creatures turn and study the family with evil eyes.

           Josh picks up a crumpled soda can discarded on the ground.  
           He pitches it at the birds and they disperse into the air.  
           But the effort further weakens the boy... he doubles over.

                                 LIZ
                            (to Josh)
                        Honey...

                                 PAUL
                        C'mon, quick!

           INT. TOWN CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The family piles into Harut's car.  Paul takes the wheel as 
           Liz climbs in the backseat with Josh.  The teen shivers in 
           his mother's arms.

           Paul twists the ignition.  The engine turns over instantly 
           and roars to life.  Paul shifts into reverse and gives the 
           store a last look as they slip away.

           INT. HARUT'S STORE - CONTINUOUS

           At the glass doors, the SILVER LOCK twists and opens on its 
           own.  The Grim sweeps inside - vapors curl in its wake.

           The PHOTOGRAPH of Harut's lost love looks on as...

           Harut turns to face death.  Filled with terror, he looks upon 
           the evil entity.  The Grim grabs Harut by the lapels and 
           pulls him close.

           Two LUMINOUS ORBS appear within the Grim's hood.  The glow 
           from these orbs hits Harut dead in the eyes, like spotlights.
           Harut starts to IMPLODE, literally collapsing upon himself.  
           Soon, there is nothing left but a small clump of carbon.  It 
           falls to the floor...  

           The GRAY CLOD then rises off the ground and settles into the 
           Grim's waiting hand...  

           It CRUSHES Harut's charred remains to DUST...

           On the floor, we see Harut's hated note beneath falling ash. 
           It reads: PHOTOGRAPH.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens hurtle down the road.  Paul turns up the radio.  
           The speakers hiss static...

                                 LIZ
                            (cradling Josh)
                        That man... is dead now.

                                 PAUL
                        We don't know that.

                                 JOSH
                        Yes, we do...

           At Josh's feet, SCALES glisten in the darkness.

           Josh looks down with glazed eyes to see a BLACK SNAKE coiling 
           around his leg.  Serpents slither on the floor... crawl all 
           over the seat... flick forked tongues...

           Josh cries out in horror.  The hallucination fades.  Liz 
           tries to comfort her son.

                                 LIZ
                        Shhhhhhh...  
                            (beat)
                        Paul...

           He presses the pedal to the floor.

           EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens race past car dealerships, fast food joints, strip 
           malls... An ILLUMINATED SIGN on the horizon reads: 

           ST.  MARY'S HOSPITAL

           As they approach the hospital, there's trouble - the main 
           entrance is jammed with abandoned vehicles.  It's impassable.
                                 LIZ
                        What...

                                 PAUL
                        I'll get as close as I can.

           EXT. HOSPITAL / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul pulls along the sidewalk and kills the engine.  They 
           survey their surroundings.  All is quiet.  They'll have to 
           hoof it across a long stretch of manicured lawn.

                                 LIZ
                        What if it's closed up?

           Paul ignores the question.

                                 PAUL
                        C'mon...

           Liz emerges from the car holding Josh.  But her son's legs 
           give out and they TUMBLE to the ground.

           Paul rushes to their aid and the family scrambles across the 
           hospital lawn.  It may as well be a thousand miles wide...

           A HOVERING POV drifts toward them from a treeline.  The 
           Greens press on, unaware.

           The POV closes in.  Something large drifts overhead.  The 
           Greens sense it and look up... but the black SHAPE is 
           inscrutable against the night sky.

                                 LIZ
                        What is it?!

                                 PAUL
                        Keep moving!

           EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The hovering POV descends ever closer as they reach the 
           EMERGENCY ROOM entrance...

           Automatic doors whoosh open and the Greens hasten inside.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Josh is dazed, practically sleepwalking.  Paul watches their 
           back, makes sure no one follows.  Then...

           The family finds itself inside a large RECEPTION AREA.  All 
           is dead quiet, nothing moves.  Overhead lights flicker.
           It takes a minute for the family to absorb the horrors that 
           lay before them...

           The floor and walls are smeared with copious amounts of 
           blood.  A silver wastebasket overflows with shredded meat and 
           steaming entrails.

           On the reception counter, a SEVERED HAND sits abandoned.  
           Paul notices a slip of PARCHMENT resting in its palm.  

           The note is inscribed with a single, cryptic word: FAITH.

                                 PAUL
                        I think we have to leave.

           Paul looks over at his wife.  She holds her mouth, her eyes 
           are big and tearful.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh no...

           Paul follows his wife's gaze and soon sees the source of her 
           terror.  A BODY sits upright against the tiled wall, perhaps 
           twenty feet away.  A trail of blood leads to the spot, as if 
           the carcass were dragged and discarded there...

           The face and torso are covered with a bloody sheet.  The 
           victim appears to be a young girl.  Her hair, her body 
           type... it could be Sasha.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        No...

           Paul and Liz approach the mystery girl with trepidation.  
           Josh idles behind, leaning against a pillar.

           At the body, Paul clutches the bloody sheet.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Wait...

           She's not ready for this.  Paul hesitates a moment, then 
           reveals the face...

           The dead girl is not Sasha.  Paul allows himself to breathe 
           once more.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (whispers)
                        Thank god.

           Paul tears away the rest of her covering.  The murdered girl 
           has been cruelly defiled.  Her torso is CORED OUT, a 
           monstrous wound.  Liz looks away.
           Paul eyes a black MOSQUITO feasting at the gore.  He replaces 
           the sheet.  Liz suddenly remembers her son and looks around.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Josh...

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The boy has strayed into the adjacent HALLWAY.  He stares 
           straight ahead, as if in a trance.  Inky fluid trickles from 
           his nose and pee-soaked jeans.

           Paul and Liz join their son.  They see what captivates him.  
           Up ahead, beneath a pulsing light, are... 

           ...TWO GRIMS.  They hover with their backs to the family.  
           The creatures are inexplicably vibrating - their evil forms 
           coursing with some dark power.  

           The cloaked figures then start to swivel, turning toward the 
           Greens.  Paul grabs his wife and son, whisks them into an 
           adjoining corridor. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           They hustle... then stop.  Down the hall, a GRIM hovers in 
           profile, silently observing a gore-spattered wall.

           The Greens quickly spin around, opting to go back the way 
           they came.  But POINTED SHADOWS are creeping into the 
           corridor, angling towards them...

           In a panic, Paul tries a door nearby... it’s locked.  Liz 
           tugs at her husband.  Behind them, a DARK ROOM is wide 
           open... waiting.  They hasten inside.

           INT. DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul seeks to close the door but its hinges are twisted and 
           broken.  Sounds approach... breathing.

           The Greens retreat further into the room and huddle in the 
           darkness.  They WATCH the open doorway with bated breath.

           Josh shakes violently.  He looks as though he might cry out.  
           Paul hugs the boy and covers his mouth.

           TWO GRIMS soon come into view.  The pair’s gait is slow and 
           deliberate.  They stop at the doorway, standing in profile.

           One is carrying a man’s SEVERED HEAD.  Drops of blood hit the 
           FLOOR.  A moment of tense uncertainty follows.
           The Grim TIGHTENS its grip on the cranium’s curly mop and the 
           hooded monsters continue on...

           INT. ROOM / CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           After a few quiet moments, Paul cautiously peeks out into the 
           hallway.  The Grims are nowhere to be seen.  Paul hears the 
           faint sound of automatic doors swishing open and close...

                                 PAUL
                            (whispering)
                        I think they’re gone...

           Josh suddenly CRIES OUT in pain.  Paul spins around and 
           flicks a switch by the door.  The room fills with soft light.

           Paul sees Josh writhing on the floor as Liz hovers over him.  
           She looks up at her husband pleadingly.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul...

           Paul quickly eyes a NURSE'S CART nearby.

           ON TOP is a set of surgical tools.  Paul eyes a SCALPEL, 
           looks back at Josh's diseased arm.

           BELOW is a tray loaded with PHARMACEUTICALS.  Paul starts 
           rifling through bottles and vials, scanning the labels.  One 
           is labeled ANTI-VENOM.  

           Paul furrows his brow and sets it aside.  He picks up a 
           second bottle that also reads ANTI-VENOM.  Again, Paul 
           discards it.

                                 PAUL
                            (to himself)
                        What the hell...

           Meanwhile, Josh is beyond rational thought.  He's convulsing 
           in a pool of his own sweat.  His eyelids flutter.  Liz wipes 
           her son's FOREHEAD and tries to hold him still.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul, we're losing him!

           Paul returns to his wife and son.  The infected area on 
           Josh's arm is quite large now - a BLACK MASS beneath the 
           skin.  It's growing before their very eyes.

           In a panic, Paul heads for the SURGICAL TOOLS atop the 
           nurse's cart.  As Josh WAILS behind him, Paul grabs a 
           SERRATED KNIFE.  He returns to his son and KNEELS beside him.
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                            (to Paul)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 PAUL
                        It's gonna kill him.  We have to do 
                        it, Liz.  We have to do it...

           Liz goes slack, unable to speak, unable to breathe.

           Paul hovers with the knife, his face twisted with agony.    
           He pretends he has the courage to do the deed.

           About to act, Paul studies the infection up close.  He 
           notices something strange - a texture resembling SCALES, like 
           the flesh of some pernicious reptile.  

           Paul looks at his blade a moment, then back at the nurse's 
           cart.  He jumps up and beelines for it.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul!!

           Paul grabs a syringe wrapped in plastic.  He frantically 
           tears it open and stabs a vial of ANTI-VENOM.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 PAUL
                            (filling the needle)
                        Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.  
                        I think I know what I'm doing...

           He returns to Josh's side, brandishing the syringe.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Hold him...

           But as Paul closes in with his needle, the cancerous shape 
           starts to move...  It actually forces its way up Josh's arm - 
           as if trying to escape.  The makeshift tourniquet comes 
           undone and falls away.

                                 LIZ
                        What's happening?!

           The dark mass travels all the way to Josh's throat where it 
           stops and tightens.  The boy is being choked.

           Josh's eyes roll over white.  He drools BLACK FLUID.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Do something!!
           Paul finally PLUNGES his needle into the evil infection.  
           Josh's limbs flail wildly.  His parents are pushed back... 
           but the boy soon settles.

           The disease on his throat quickly shrinks, folds like a dying 
           spider.  Paul and Liz watch in amazement as the dark mark 
           dissipates completely.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Josh, are you okay?

           He's out cold.

                                 PAUL
                            (pleading)
                        Josh, buddy.  Wake up.

           He JOSTLES his son lightly.  Josh comes to.  He wipes his 
           chin, massages his throat.  The boy is returning to normal.

                                 JOSH
                        Hey dad...

                                 PAUL
                        Hey, kiddo.

           Paul smiles faintly and sighs with relief.  Liz kisses her 
           son's forehead.

           INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens stalk through the white-walled labyrinth, working 
           their way back toward reception, cautious at every turn.  
           They round a corner and see... 

           A wall-mounted emergency kit has been busted open.  Below...

           A NURSE lay slain.  Crimson sludge leaks from her ears as she 
           cradles a FIRE AXE with lacerated hands.  The Greens creep 
           past the body when...  

           The nurse springs to life.  She jumps up, wailing and 
           flailing with her axe.  The poor woman's eyes are cloudy and 
           sightless, her face contorted and anguished.

           The Greens jump back.  Paul raises his hands.

                                 PAUL
                        Lady, don't --

           The nurse lashes out in a final fit of crazed desperation.  
           The axe FLIES from her hands and impacts drywall, inches from 
           Josh and Liz.  They observe the thick blade with wide eyes.
           The nurse gasps a final, pained breath and collapses on the 
           tile.  The Greens can only watch as she dies before them...

           Paul pulls the fire axe from the wall and grips it tightly.  
           They continue on... 

           INT. HALL / HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

           The family stalks toward the dining area where SEVERED LIMBS 
           are piled high on tables.  Peeled skins hang from the lights.   

           The Greens try to keep it together as they move past the 
           carnage.  They don't dare pause.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           The family passes the hospital CHAPEL, its door wide open.  
           They round a bend and stop dead in their tracks.

           At the end of the hall lies a DECAPITATED PRIEST with a 
           rosary spilling from his hand.  The headless corpse is 
           sprawled against white tile, in a sticky crimson pool...

           Scrawled in blood on the wall above are these chilling words:

           NO GOD  

           NO DEVIL

           ONLY US

           As the Greens absorb this dark message, they seem stricken, 
           bereft of hope.  Suddenly, a heavy shadow eclipses the evil 
           inscription.  The family turns...  

           A GRIM is observing them.

                                 LIZ
                        No!

           They flee for the exit.  The Grim follows.  They run like 
           mad.  They blow past gurneys, gear and GORE.  The Grim keeps 
           coming.  Up ahead... glass doors, freedom.       

                                 PAUL
                        Faster!

           They reach the exit, come within inches of the glass.  But 
           the automatic doors are unresponsive... they won’t open.  
           Paul and Josh try to pry them apart - it’s futile.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s coming!!
           The Grim is closing in.  Paul takes hold of his axe.  He 
           swings it hard against the glass - but it only creates a 
           hairline fracture.  The Grim’s eyes ignite. 

           Paul STRIKES a second time and the transparent door SHATTERS.

                                 PAUL
                        Go!  Go!

           EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens flee the hospital and don’t look back.  The night 
           is a blur of black bushes and pregnant shadows.  They descend 
           upon Harut’s car... 

           INT. CAR / EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           ...and pile in.  Paul sets the axe on the floor.  He turns 
           the ignition and instantly peels out.  He clips an abandoned 
           vehicle, breaking off its rearview mirror.  The Greens race 
           away into the darkness...

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul catches his breath, finds Josh in the rearview mirror.

                                 PAUL
                        You okay back there?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah dad, I'm OK.

           A quiet moment passes.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        Dad?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                 JOSH
                        Are we gonna find her?

           Paul looks at his wife.  He then eyes the in-dash clock: 
           5:17.  Time is running out.  Just then, a CELLPHONE goes off.  
           The ring tone is unique... familiar.

                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        That's Sasha's phone...

           Liz reaches into her pocket and removes Sasha's pink phone.  
           She looks at it with a mixture of hope and dread.

           The ringing continues.  Liz answers on speaker.
                                 LIZ
                        Hello?

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                            (speaking softly)
                        Sasha?

                                 LIZ
                        No... this is Liz, Sasha's mother.

           Silence.

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        Mrs. Green... it's Emily... I'm in 
                        trouble... it's in the house.
                            (beat)
                        I... I think everyone is dead.

                                 LIZ
                        Where are you, sweetie?

                                 EMILY (V.O.)
                        I'm upstairs.  
                            (abruptly)
                        Oh God... it's coming...

                                 LIZ
                        Baby, tell us where you're at...

           Through the phone, the Greens hear a door being struck 
           violently.  Emily SCREAMS.  Her phone hits the floor.  More 
           banging.  The sound of splintering wood.  Panicked breaths.

                                 PAUL
                        Liz...

                                 LIZ
                        No...

           Crashing sounds.  Crying.

                                 PAUL
                        Hang up the phone, Liz.

           A final SCREAM.  Sounds of ripping meat.  Spilled blood.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Hang it up!

           Silence... Then breathing... Something is breathing into 
           Emily's phone.

           Paul snatches the cell from his wife and hangs it up.
                                 JOSH
                        Dad!!

           Paul looks up from the phone to see THREE GRIMS hovering in 
           his path.  He panics and SWERVES off the road.

           EXT. STREET / INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The car COLLIDES with a tree in a crunch of metal and glass.  
           One headlight is smashed, a front tire blown.  The engine is 
           still chugging.  The radio CRACKLES...

                                 PAUL
                        Christ! Are you guys okay?!

                                 LIZ
                            (shaken)
                        Yeah...

           There's no response from Josh.  He's facing the back window.

                                 PAUL
                        Josh!

                                 JOSH
                            (softly)
                        Shit...

           Paul looks in the rearview mirror.  The Grims still loiter in 
           the road behind.  They stand motionless like statues, like 
           some dark monument to evil itself.  Their cowls are angled 
           towards the car...

                                 LIZ
                            (to Paul, whispering)
                        Get us out of here.

           Paul SLAMS into reverse and hits the gas.  The vehicle 
           lurches but goes nowhere as metal GRINDS against fibrous 
           wood.  They're fixed to the tree.

           The Grims wait.  Paul REVS the engine over and over to no 
           avail.  The Grims begin to move...

                                 JOSH
                        Dad!

           The position of their bodies doesn't change, the creatures 
           simply drift towards the car in a sick, unholy unison.

                                 PAUL
                        Lock the doors... lock the doors!
           Liz and Josh frantically secure the old car's manual door 
           locks.  The Grims keep coming.... Josh tries to scramble into 
           the front seat with his parents.

           Suddenly, there's a crack of inexplicable THUNDER in the 
           distance.  All three Grims stop abruptly and turn at the 
           sound.  The Greens watch, wide-eyed...

           Finally, the cloaked things start to DRIFT AWAY... as if 
           being beckoned somewhere.  They soon pass out of sight.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul... we have to go that way...  
                        go wherever they're going.

           Paul gives her a look.  He hits the gas again.  With a sound 
           like the snapping of meaty bones, the car breaks free of the 
           tree and reverses out onto asphalt.

           They turn around and sputter off in the direction of the 
           summoned Grims.  The blown front tire makes a horrible KA-
           CHUNK-KA-CHUNK noise as they go.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Five big BLACKBIRDS feed on a dead coyote.  It's the same 
           animal Sasha saw earlier.  The scene is bathed in moonlight.

           INT. CAR / EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul checks the radio, makes sure it's tuned properly.  Only 
           white noise hisses from the speakers.

           Liz stares out the window, up at the moon.  It appears to be 
           tailing them.

                                 PAUL
                            (hushed)
                        C'mon, girl... where are you...?

           As if in response, the radio suddenly comes alive with GRIM 
           DISTURBANCE - loud and harsh.  Paul slams on the brakes, 
           sending sparks from their damaged wheel.

           The family scans their surroundings.  The ominous tone rages 
           inside the car, leaks out into the night.

           Paul begins to idle slowly through the suburban neighborhood.  
           The Greens' senses are on high alert.

           A DISTORTED VOICE cuts through the din.

                                 DISTORTED VOICE
                        Who's there?
           Liz and Paul eye the radio in disbelief.  Josh sits forward.

                                 DISTORTED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 PAUL
                        Oh my god -

                                 JOSH
                        It's Sasha.

                                 LIZ
                        Sasha?  Baby, where are you?

           We drift towards the in-dash SPEAKER, into the darkness of 
           its rumbling woofer...

           SCREEN BLACK

           Static swells as we travel into nothingness... we're 
           somewhere else...

           The black screen ripples, is displaced... SASHA'S FACE 
           emerges from thick, oily liquid...

           The girl gasps for air, chokes on clotted fluid.  She's 
           fighting for her life... 

                                 SASHA
                            (sheer terror)
                        Mommmmmm!

           Sasha disappears again beneath the surface, violently sucked 
           down by some nefarious undertow.

           The pool bubbles and calms... back to BLACK and nothing more.

           INT. CAR - SAME

           Sasha's shrill cry lingers in the car.  

                                 LIZ
                        Sasha!

                                 JOSH
                        Mom... where is she??

           Dash lights and radio DROP OUT.  The car DIES completely.  
           The suddenness of it seems unnatural.

           Paul frantically tries to restart the car but it's stone cold 
           - a lifeless heap in the middle of the street.
                                 PAUL
                        No! We're close.  We have to be.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Paul EXITS the car, throwing caution to the wind.  He walks 
           down the center of the road, carrying his axe.  Liz and Josh 
           follow.  They are flanked by darkened homes.

           Paul stops and stares straight ahead.  A faint glow appears 
           on the horizon.

                                 JOSH
                        Sun's coming up...

                                 PAUL
                        They'll be gone soon... c'mon...

           They begin to stalk down the road, scanning the rows of 
           houses for any kind of sign.

                                 LIZ
                        Which one?

           A hopeless moment passes.  Then...

           A low, rushing tumult creeps into the sound scape.  Sloshing, 
           wet... subterranean... Josh spies a STORM DRAIN.  Somewhere 
           below, behind that mouth of vertical bars is a flood.

           The trajectory points toward a dilapidated house at the end 
           of the street.  Josh tugs at his mother's sleeve. 

                                 JOSH
                        Mom... that's the Kirby house.

           Liz looks at her son, then the flagging STRUCTURE.  

                                 LIZ
                        She's there.

                                 PAUL
                        Let's find out...

           Huddled close, the family approaches the spooky house.       
           A sliver of SUNLIGHT shimmers on the horizon.  They're 
           running out of time...

           EXT. PORCH / INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The front door is slightly ajar.  Paul slowly opens it and 
           makes an unfortunate creaking sound.
           The Greens peer into the front room.  Moonlight streaming 
           through the windows provides some visibility.  The dwelling 
           is devoid of furniture, deathly quiet.

           The desperate trio ENTER the house, Paul brandishing the axe.  
           Josh eyes the weapon without hope.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul eyes a heap of brittle leaves beneath an open window.  
           The debris is shaped like a burial mound.

           Paul traverses the hardwood and tests the spot with his foot.  
           It's just a pile of leaves and dirt, after all.

           Across the room, Liz and Josh stand before a large MIRROR 
           fixed to the wall.  They're mesmerized, in awe.

           Liz feels her own face as if to confirm its existence.  Josh 
           studies his hands.  Paul soon joins them.

                                 PAUL
                            (whispers)
                        What the hell?

           He sees what vexes them... the Greens cast no reflection 
           whatsoever.  The mirror is a portrait of an empty room.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (softly)
                        We're definitely in the right 
                        place.  C'mon...

           They move on through the house.

           INT. HALLWAY / BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Paul, Liz and Josh creep down a long hallway.  They come to a 
           BEDROOM DOOR that's shut.  Liz leans close to it...

                                 LIZ
                            (whispering)
                        Sasha?

           Silence.  Paul nudges his wife aside and reaches for the 
           knob.  With a trembling hand, he cautiously OPENS the door.

           From the GREENS' POV, we survey the room and find it 
           completely empty.  Then...

           A faint rumbling swells beneath the bedroom's floorboards.  
           BLACK SLUDGE proceeds to seep up through the cracks.  The 
           flow increases until...
           A TIDE of dark crud rushes toward the doorway.

                                 JOSH
                        Dad...

           Paul quickly shuts the door and they all back away.  Sludge 
           leaks out into the hall - black tendrils lick the floor... 
           then recede back into the room.

           Paul looks at his wife and son.

                                 PAUL
                        Be ready for anything.

           The Greens hold hands as they continue on.

           INT. HALLWAY / BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They creep toward an OPEN DOOR.

                                 PAUL
                        Stay behind me now...

           The family stops to peer inside ANOTHER ROOM.  What they see 
           freezes their hearts...

           A child's bedroom is decked out in early 80's decor.  But the 
           toys, furniture and books are rotting and covered in crud.

           THE SKELETAL CORPSE of a young girl sits on the edge of the 
           bed.  Her dusty skull rests in her lap, wisps of blond hair 
           still clinging to it.

           Liz covers her mouth as Josh eyes the HEADLESS BOY lying on 
           the floor.  The skeleton's weathered cub scout uniform has a 
           name sewn into it: Pat Kirby.

           Other HEADLESS REMAINS litter the floor amidst the rot.

                                 JOSH
                        This isn't real...

                                 PAUL
                            (gravely)
                        We have to keep moving.

           Paul ushers his family away from the door.  As they push on, 
           Liz looks back again, her eyes filled with tears.

           INT. HALLWAY / BASEMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens come to a large, solitary DOOR at the very end of 
           the hall.  They eye each other... this must be it.
           The door has no knob or handle, no hole in which one might be 
           set.  Careful to remain quiet, Paul and Josh PUSH the heavy 
           plank.  It won't budge. 

           They try to PRY the door open with their fingers.  No use.

                                 LIZ
                            (whispers)
                        Paul...

           Something above has her attention.  Fixed to the ceiling is 
           an ornate DOORKNOB, revealed by a shaft of moonlight.  It's 
           too high for anyone to reach.

           On the handle are engravings - strange cuneiforms from 
           another age.  A snarl of black disease poisons the plaster 
           where the spindle meets the ceiling.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Lift me up.

           Paul and Josh lift Liz and she turns the peculiar knob.

           The strange door slowly swings open to reveal a wooden 
           staircase.  It descends into a shadowy BASEMENT.

           Stale, dead air rushes up from below.  The Greens know they 
           must go in.  Dread descends upon them.

           Paul lovingly studies his wife and son... perhaps a last 
           look.  He strokes Josh's hair.  Paul turns to Liz and KISSES 
           her tenderly.  He speaks to them in a low voice.  

                                 PAUL
                        If anything happens down there... 
                        you turn around and run... 
                            (stifling tears)
                        You run and get the hell out of 
                        this place.  Understand?

           Liz and Josh nod solemnly.  The Greens hold hands - and their 
           breath - as they creep down into the dark.

           INT. CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

           The family treads softly down the STEPS...

           At the bottom, they set their feet on the DIRT FLOOR and take 
           stock of their surroundings...  

           The dank CELLAR is vast and black.  Several small WINDOWS 
           provide patches of moonlight in the cavernous space.  Liz 
           spies something and tugs at Paul...
           Ahead, they encounter heaping piles of junk: coins, rings, 
           timepieces, keys... There's a pair of BIFOCALS.  Paul eyes a 
           SEVERED FINGER protruding from one pile... then eyes his son.

           LIZ stoops down and pinches an object between her fingers - a 
           SILVER BROOCH, some antique heirloom.

                                 PAUL
                            (hushed)
                        C'mon.

           Their search continues past the mounds of junk, through dimly 
           lit dilapidation.

           In a CLEARED AREA they discover something unexpected.  Five 
           discarded GRIM ROBES are crumpled on the floor.  The Greens 
           don't know what to make of it.

           Josh notices something else amongst the crumpled cloaks.  
           It's a kind of thick rod, partially buried in the dirt.

           A beam of moonlight shimmers upon the object's black, 
           textured surface.  Josh bends and frees it from the soil.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (hissing)
                        Careful.

           Josh examines this four-foot STAVE.  The weapon was perhaps 
           forged from some gnarled chunk of ancient obsidian.  It reeks 
           of power and prestige.  Father and son share a look.

           Liz then turns, hears something... Faint HISSING, 
           undulating... she follows the sound into darkness...

                                 LIZ
                            (whispers)
                        Sasha?

           The sound continues... hollow RUSHES of wind.  No... breath.

           Liz stumbles upon a pair of girls' SNEAKERS.  She finds 
           discarded striped socks... jeans... panties... a t-shirt...   

           A look of grave realization washes over Liz.  She gasps...

           Paul reacts instantly, rushes to his wife's side.  Liz is 
           gathering up the articles of clothing, frantic and tearful.  
           Josh tightens his grip on the stave and joins his parents.

           EXT. SKY - SAME

           A hint of amber HAZE appears in the night sky.  Dawn nears...
           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The family steps further into shadow, wandering in near 
           blindness.  They listen for breathing...

                                 PAUL
                            (whispers)
                        Sasha...

           The trio continue on in the dark.

                                 JOSH
                            (whispering)
                        Where does it end...

           Paul examines their surroundings, perceives dirt on both the 
           floor and ceiling.

                                 PAUL
                            (hushed)
                        What the --

           They soon come to the edge of a body of water.  No, not 
           water... BLACK FLUID.  In the darkness, it's impossible to 
           tell how far it extends.

                                 JOSH
                        This is insane...

           Liz looks on in utter despair.  She scrutinizes the darkness 
           for any sign of her daughter.  Then, further down the macabre 
           shoreline, something catches her eye...

                                 LIZ
                        Paul...

           He follows her cue, drops the axe he's been carrying. 

           A girl's UNCLOTHED BODY protrudes from the cruddy lagoon.  
           She's submerged up to her shoulders in its dingy liquid.  
           Half her face is mashed into the dirt.  It's Sasha...

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        My baby...

           Josh looks on in horror as Liz and Paul rush to her aid.  
           They pull Sasha from the black pool.  She's unconscious, 
           perhaps drowned - her flesh a deathly pallor.  Dark rivulets 
           drip from her pale body...

           Paul and Liz cradle their soaked, naked child.  Racked with 
           worry, they check her vitals.
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        I can't tell...

           Paul and Liz lay Sasha on the ground.  They struggle to 
           redress their baby girl.  They rub her arms and chest, urging 
           her body to life.  Josh approaches, looking helpless, unsure 
           of his sister's condition...

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        C'mon, baby.

                                 LIZ
                        Please...

           A quiet moment passes as they watch and wait...

           From the shadows, we observe The Greens mourn their loss...

           Paul bends down and scoops up his daughter.

                                 PAUL
                        We have to get her out of here.

                                 LIZ
                            (voice shaking)
                        She can't be, she can't be...

           Paul carries Sasha back toward the stairs as Liz hovers close 
           by.  Josh follows, still gripping the stave.

                                 PAUL
                        Hurry now...

           Behind the Greens, four GRIM ROBES start to stir.  They soon 
           rise up off the floor and fill out, becoming full-bodied.

           Sensing a presence behind them, the Greens TURN and look.  
           They nearly collapse at the sight of the evil figures lurking 
           nearby.  Paul steels himself.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Back away, slowly.

           The Greens each take one step backwards.  Then another.  The 
           Grims advance, keeping pace.

           Paul eyes the STAIRS as the Grims prepare to strike.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Run!
           Paul and Liz move as fast as they can...

           But Josh stands his ground, channeling the courage of great 
           warriors from some distant age.  He raises his black stave 
           and wields it like a Katana sword.

           The Grims stop and pull back, clearly afraid of the object.

           Liz and Paul are amazed.  They continue up the stairs, Liz 
           helping her husband support Sasha.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Josh!!  C'mon!!

           Josh protects the rear, ascending the stairs backwards.  He 
           grips the railing with one hand and frantically waves his 
           weapon with the other.  

           He keeps the Grims at bay, but they do not give up pursuit.

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Greens escape the basement and RACE through the house.  
           The four Grims give chase.  They move as one, a pack of 
           shrouded devils.

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           On the floor, one remaining Grim robe rises from the dirt and 
           fills out.  This one is different from the others... larger, 
           more menacing.

           The PRIME GRIM has taken form.

           INT. LIVING ROOM / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Paul holds Sasha while Liz struggles to open the FRONT DOOR.

                                 LIZ
                        It's locked!

                                 PAUL
                        From the outside?

           The Grims are advancing.  One of them boldly rushes the 
           family, its eyes alight...

           In a split second, Josh switches to the offensive.  His eyes 
           are ferocious, VENGEFUL.  He raises his weapon and STRIKES 
           the oncoming ghoul - this time the stave makes it count.

           On impact, the enemy's robe loses form, collapses to the 
           floor.  The remaining Grims slow their approach, fall back.
           Josh can't believe it.  Paul eyes Josh's mysterious artifact 
           and has a flash of insight.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Josh, try the door!  Do it now!

           Holding the stave, Josh tries the door with his free hand - 
           it miraculously OPENS.

           Outside, the neighborhood is bathed in a predawn glow.  They 
           all flee the house, Paul cradling Sasha.

           The three Grims follow...

           INT. BASEMENT DOOR / HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The Prime Grim emerges from the basement and sweeps through 
           the house...

           INT. FRONT DOOR / EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Arriving at the front exit, the Prime Grim's hulking form 
           fills the doorway.  The hooded thing silently observes its 
           minions chase the Greens down the street.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The family races toward the rising sun with the Grims on 
           their heels.  Paul's legs are wobbling - he can't support his 
           daughter much longer...

           The hooded fiends are very close now.

           Suddenly, the Greens stop dead in their tracks.  FOUR MORE 
           GRIMS have appeared not thirty feet in front of them.  The 
           other three continue to approach from behind.

           Still more cloaked figures EMERGE from the shadows - to their 
           left and right.  The family is surrounded.

                                 LIZ
                        Paul, what do we do?

                                 JOSH
                        Dad!

           Paul has no words.  They almost made it...

           The Greens huddle close together in the street.  Josh readies 
           his stave, knowing full well he can't take them all.

           The dark horde closes in, reaching out with raven claws.  The 
           Greens brace themselves for the end.  Then...
           EXT. SKY / STREET - CONTINUOUS

           At last, the SUN ascends above the horizon.  Golden light 
           washes over the land... painting long, angling shadows...  
           obliterating all vestiges of night.

           Bathed in sunlight, The Grims begin to VANISH.  One by one, 
           they turn to nothing, they become rumors carried on a breeze.  

           Josh watches as the black stave DISSIPATES before his eyes.  
           The Greens look on in awe, speechless, when suddenly...  

           Sasha's eyelids flutter.  She's conscious - alive.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my god...

                                 JOSH
                        Sis...

                                 PAUL
                        Sasha... you okay, baby?

           Sasha is fully sober now - her terrible nightmare ended.

                                 SASHA
                        Daddy...

           She buries her face in her father's chest.

           Overcome with exhaustion and relief, the family plops down on 
           the asphalt.  They sit stunned, exasperated.  Paul pulls 
           everyone close and holds on for dear life, thankful.

           The Greens hear someone emerge from a neighboring house.  An 
           OLD MAN saunters into his yard.  He eyes the shell-shocked 
           family sitting conspicuously in the road.

           Without saying a word, the old man proceeds to work his 
           garden hose and water the lawn.  He regards the Greens with 
           complete indifference.  Paul almost laughs.

           EXT. THE GREEN HOUSE - LATER

           The new light of day embraces the family home.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           In the bathtub, hot water cascades from the faucet.  Sasha is 
           up to her neck in soapy bubbles.  She turns the faucet off 
           with her foot.

           Liz sits nearby on the cushioned toilet lid.  She's handling 
           their house phone.  She hangs it up, frustrated.
                                 LIZ
                        Still not working... can you 
                        believe that?

           INT. JOSH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wearing wet hair and a towel, Josh enters and slips on pajama 
           pants.  He picks his dirty jeans up off the floor, quickly 
           sniffs them and makes a disgusted face.

           He wads up the jeans and stuffs them into a wastebasket.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - SAME

                                 SASHA
                        Mom, can we order pizza?

                                 LIZ
                        It's eight o'clock in the morning.

                                 SASHA
                        But it's lunchtime in Argentina.

                                 LIZ
                        That's true...

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Phone working?

           Paul stands in the doorway.  Liz shakes her head.  Sasha 
           sinks lower in the tub.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I'm gonna go check on Pitney.

                                 LIZ
                        Okay.

           Paul eyes Sasha.

                                 PAUL
                        How you doin', munchkin?

                                 SASHA
                        Um, I'm in the tub, dad.

                                 PAUL
                        Okay, I'm going.  I'm going.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           As Paul exits the house, he takes notice of the damage on the 
           front door.  There's a crack.  CLAW MARKS mar the entrance.
           The door locks, clicks shut.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Liz sits down on the edge of the tub.

                                 LIZ
                        Sasha... are you sure you don't 
                        remember anything from last night?

           Sasha is quiet for a moment.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        You want to talk about it?

           Sasha shakes her head.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        That's okay, honey.

           Liz leans over and kisses her daughter's forehead.  She gets 
           up to leave.

                                 SASHA
                        It was like a dream...

           Liz freezes and turns.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I was running through tunnels...  
                        or caves...
                            (beat)
                        They kept grabbing at me... their 
                        hands were so cold.

           Liz is haunted by her daughter's words.

           EXT. PITNEY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Through a window, we see Paul and Pitney at the kitchen 
           table.  The old woman smokes, Paul sips a cup of coffee.

           INT. PITNEY'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 PAUL
                        Mmm... this is serious Joe.

                                 PITNEY
                        Well, it's too early for Scotch.

           Paul smiles.
                                 PITNEY (CONT’D)
                        All bull aside, I thank god that 
                        little girl of yours is all right.
                            (beat)
                        If anyone is gonna have their check 
                        cashed, it oughta be an old dog 
                        like me.

                                 PAUL
                        I'm pretty sure you're 
                        indestructible, Pitney.

           The old woman smiles, takes a drag off her cigarette.

                                 PITNEY
                        Nah... just a mean old lady.

           Paul cracks up.  Pitney joins him.

                                 PAUL
                        So what about you?  Did our friends 
                        pay you a visit last night?

                                 PITNEY
                        Yeah, one of those things showed up 
                        all right.  I'd already gone to 
                        bed, too.  The bastard woke me up.

           Paul smiles curiously.

                                 PAUL
                        What happened?

                                 PITNEY
                        I had to give up my husband's 
                        reading glasses - and pocket watch.
                            (beat)
                        Hard to believe they'd be valuable 
                        to anyone but me...

           Paul takes another sip of coffee.

                                 PITNEY (CONT'D)
                        I can't hardly think of Stan 
                        without seeing those glasses 
                        dangling around his neck... or him 
                        checking that cheap watch...
                            (beat)
                        ...a lot of memories attached to 
                        those silly old things.
           INT. JOSH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Josh lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, his mind 
           racing.  He grabs his cell and brings up a photo.  

           ON THE PHONE
           A shot of Cooper is displayed. 

           Josh's friend is laughing, dressed in a t-shirt that reads: 
           BURGERS R MURDER.  Josh sighs and sets the phone aside. 

           He closes his eyes a moment, picks up a remote and turns on 
           the TV at the foot of his bed.

           ON TV
           News footage flashes from one shocking clip to another.

                        I don't think we've seen this kind 
                        of devastation since the very first 
                        Grim Night... fifteen years ago.

           Paul crosses the lawn up to his house.

                        Indeed, a complete account of what

                        year's event was the worst yet.

           Paul grabs the doorknob - it's locked.  He checks his

                        Okay, mom.

                                 LIZ
                            (teasing)
                        Okay, mom.

           Sasha smiles.  Liz looks relieved.  Things are beginning to 
           return to normal.

           INT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Knock.  Knock.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Liz SNAPS her head at the sound and touches her chest.   
           Sasha shoots her a look, her grin now gone.

                                 LIZ
                        Your father must've locked himself 
                        out... I'll get it.

           Liz turns to leave.

                                 SASHA
                        Come right back, okay?

                                 LIZ
                        I will, sweetie.

           INT. LIVING ROOM / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Knock.  Knock.  Knock.

           Liz approaches the door without caution.

                                 LIZ
                        Honey?  That you?

           At the door, Liz twists the lock and turns the knob.
           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sasha stares at the tub's faucet.  It starts to drip.      
           The droplets are BLACK...

           INT. LIVING ROOM / FRONT DOOR / EXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Liz opens the front door... mist rushes in.  Looming before 
           her in broad daylight is the PRIME GRIM.  

           At least nine feet tall, the evil thing towers above.  Liz is 
           frozen.  The hulking creature waves its hand and Liz is sent 
           flying backward into the wall.  The impact jars the house.

           INT. JOSH'S BEDROOM - SAME

           Josh sits up in bed...

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM - SAME

           Sasha continues to gaze at the BLACK TRICKLE swirling into 
           her bath water...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On the floor, Liz struggles to regain her bearings as the 
           Prime Grim sweeps into the living room.  Floorboards rot and 
           blacken in the creature's wake.

           Sensing the dark presence through her blurred vision, Liz 
           crab-walks backward into a corner.

           The TV suddenly crackles to life.  It begins to FLASH CLIPS 
           from random movies and television shows.

           ON TV 
           A desperate man holds a gun to someone's head...

                                 MAN
                        Where is she?!

           An old man on his death bed utters his final words...

                                 OLD MAN
                        The girl...

           A little boy tugs at his mother's skirt...

                                 BOY
                        Where is she, mommy?

           In the corner, Liz looks upon the television with bleary 
           eyes.  She struggles to comprehend what is happening.
           The TV repeats its message over and over.  The Prime Grim 
           waits patiently, its cowl angling sickly between the set and 
           Liz, as if beckoning her to speak...

           At the stairs, Josh comes running down but freezes at the 
           sight of the intruder.

           INT. HALL / LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We follow SASHA as she takes slow, measured steps toward the 
           living room... as if being pulled there.  She appears in the 
           entryway wearing a bathrobe.  She's in a fog.

           The Grim turns its head and moves toward her.

                                 LIZ
                        No!

           Sasha snaps to and sees her nemesis.  She runs for the 
           kitchen.  The Prime Grim follows.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Sasha!

           The girl races through the kitchen.  She heads out the 
           backdoor into the yard.

           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           SASHA flees across the grass with bare feet.  She heads for 
           the fence but suddenly crashes to the ground - she's stepped 
           on something sharp.

                                 SASHA
                        Owww!!

           On the ground, Sasha removes something embedded in her foot.  
           It's a WHITE INCISOR identical to the one she found earlier,  
           the serrated tooth now speckled with her own blood.

           In a flash, the Prime Grim is upon her.  It towers over the 
           helpless girl, HOLDING HER DOWN by sheer will.

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Sasha!

           At the house, a panicked Liz dashes out into the yard.  Josh 
           comes after her.

                                 JOSH
                        Mom!
           But as mother and son set foot ON THE GRASS...

           Their legs SINK DOWN into the turf as if it were quicksand.  
           Their bodies become stuck in the ground.

                                 LIZ
                        Josh!

           They're soon submerged to their necks in worm-infested soil.

           Meanwhile, the Prime Grim reaches down at Sasha with its 
           black claw.  Sasha turns her head and shuts her eyes...

           A GUNSHOT rings out.  Liz and Josh whip their heads.  Paul 
           has emerged from the house wielding the RIFLE he neglected 
           earlier.  He quickly jerks the bolt up and back to reload.

                                 PAUL
                        Get away from her!

           The Prime Grim cocks its evil cowl.  Paul takes aim but his 
           rifle hits the ground.  He's pushed backward, pinned to the 
           wall of the house by some unseen force.  The impression of a 
           HAND appears on Paul's chest. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Liz!
                            (struggling)
                        I can't move!  I can't help her...

           In the soil, Liz is being swallowed alive, her head barely 
           above ground.  

                                 LIZ
                            (pleading)
                        Paul, I'm sinking...

                                 JOSH
                        Mom!  Hang on...

           Josh fights to break free of his earthen prison.  A BLACK 
           CENTIPEDE crawls across his face.  Liz struggles for air as 
           the soil creeps around her jaw.  She spits dirt.

                                 LIZ
                        Paulll....

           The Grim remains focused on the girl.  It hovers over her, 
           leans closer... draws her near with an outstretched hand.

           In the center of its palm we see a large, RAISED SCAR.  A 
           spiral shape, like a coiled snake... like Sasha's birthmark.
           Sasha suddenly opens her eyes and stares directly into the 
           Grim's black hood.  Her gaze is intense.

                                 PAUL
                        Sasha, don't look at its eyes!  
                        Look away!  Look away!

           But the girl doesn't obey...  

           The Grim's silver orbs begin to LIGHT UP within its cowl.  
           Sasha holds her gaze - the two lock eyes.

                                 LIZ
                            (sheer terror)
                        Sasha!  No.....

           Sasha's eye sockets fill with white light, her jaw hangs 
           slack.  She appears lost...

           But -- in a shocking reversal, it is the Prime Grim that 
           starts to IMPLODE.  Its wretched form cracks and crumples.  
           The creature is soon reduced to a small, sooty CLUMP.  

           Liz and Josh look on in shock, mired but no longer sinking.  
           The earth loosens around them.  Paul is kneeling on the 
           ground, feeling about his chest.

           Sasha eyes the charred remains of her adversary.  She picks 
           up the hunk of black crud and CRUSHES it to dust.  Tears 
           stream down her cheeks.

           Paul rushes toward his little girl as Liz and Josh crawl from 
           their wormy graves.  Paul soon EMBRACES his daughter, then 
           holds her at arms length - looks into her eyes.

                                 PAUL
                            (tearful)
                        You're okay...

           Sasha nods solemnly as Liz and Josh quickly join them.  The 
           Green family is whole again, safe.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                            (reassuringly)
                        It's done now, it's done.

           Still reeling from her encounter, Sasha stares back at the 
           house with vacant eyes...

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           We slowly creep in on the WORLD MAP tacked to Sasha's wall, 
           pushing toward Springton...
           We drift down a SUBURBAN STREET past homes with doors ajar 
           and blood-stained steps...

           We hover down the aisle of HARUT'S MARKET as a gust of wind 
           kicks sooty remains up off the floor...

           We glide through a HOSPITAL WING slaughterhouse towards the 
           body of a decapitated priest...

           We exit the KIRBY HOUSE, drifting backwards to reveal the 
           home's full facade... that evil, mocking face...

           BACK TO SCENE

           Sasha continues to stare blankly.

                                 SASHA
                        Dad?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes, honey?

           The harrowed girl looks up at her father.

                                 SASHA
                        Next year, can we skip Grim Night?

                                 PAUL
                        You bet, sweetheart.

           They share a brief smile as Sasha reaches over her shoulder 
           to scratch an itch...

           ON THE BACK OF HER NECK                                     
           We see Sasha's coiled birthmark - it TURNS BLACK before our 
           eyes.  She scratches at it, turns her head.

           ON SASHA'S PROFILE                                          
           We behold her face and blackened mark together.  She appears 
           empowered, triumphant.  As the girl gazes off, a gentle wind 
           lifts her hair... her eyes intensify...  

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

                                 *THE END*
