                                  January 25, 2011
           OVER BLACK

           We hear intense, passionate CLASSICAL PIANO.  And, in voice-
           over, a 13 year old boy (whose voice has only just begun to 
           change).  

           But this is not any thirteen year old boy.

           There is a strange, almost syncopated rhythm to his voice - and 
           an odd lilt.  As if this boy, whoever he is, speaks - and thinks 
           - in a way far different from other children.  

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Don’t ask me why, but for some reason our 
                        teacher is making us all write operas.  As 
                        punishment, I am going to do mine in German, 
                        which I intend to learn over summer break.

           Music continues as THUNDER and LIGHTNING illuminate:

           ADAM

           With large bamboo-and-cloth WINGS on a harness around his waist.  
           Arms out, walking, he is precariously balancing on something. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The assignment bears with it the cliche that 
                        we must ‘write what we know.’  Therefore, mine 
                        will be about a boy who has a monster growing 
                        out of his hands.  The only way to kill the 
                        monster, of course, is to kill the boy. 

           REVEAL that Adam is balancing on a second story balcony railing 
           in the middle of the city.  

                                 ADAM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        In the opera, the monster lives by devouring 
                        dreams.  In real life.. well..

           HARD CUTS:

           Wings descending.. the ground rising.  And SMASH --

           QUICK SHOTS: A MOTHER AND FATHER SIT UP IN BED.  Race out. 

           AMBULANCE.  LIGHTS.  

                                 DEBBIE/TOM
                        ADAM!?  ADAM!?

           PUSH IN on TOM AND DEBBIE DAVIS - closer than we think possible.  
           So close we lose track of all shape.. and DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
           EXT. OPEN MEADOW - MASSACHUSETTS - DAY (7 YEARS AGO)

           As ADAM - now 5 - wearing the same strapped-on WINGS - runs, 
           grinning, enthralled, full of joy, as he lopes over a rise and..

           ..toward HIS GRANDFATHER, HOYT, who waits at the bottom.  

           Part of the wing slips from its anchor point.

                                 HOYT (V.O.)(PRE-LAP)
                        Why shouldn’t it lift?  Even for a second?

           EXT. HOYT’S GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           We’re on Hoyt’s rural property on the outskirts of Boston.  Hoyt 
           and Adam work on the wings on sawhorses just outside the garage.  

                                 ADAM
                        Well..

                                 HOYT
                        “Well” says the five year old..  Hold the 
                        spandrel.  Well what?  

                                 ADAM
                        Well no mammal has ever been able to have self-
                        powered flight, ever, except bats.  People 
                        have been making the same mistake since before 
                        you were born.

                                 HOYT
                        Hey - smart ass - I can’t even remember 98 
                        percent of what happened after I was born.  Grab 
                        this.  And we’re not talking about flying.  Just 
                        gliding for a bit.  At least, to start..
                             (looks at watch; not the best ‘actor’)
                        Oh - my gosh!  Will ya look at the time?  I 
                        forgot I gotta run you home for a.. thing.. 

                                 ADAM
                        My surprise party?

                                 HOYT
                             (a pause; looks at Adam)
                        Okay.  Listen - you gotta do me a favor -

                                 ADAM
                        I know.  Act surprised, or it’ll ruin their 
                        entire day.
           INT. MIDDLE CLASS APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATER

           An apartment door opens: TOM and DEBBIE - also ‘acting.’

                                 TOM
                        Oh!  Gosh - what are you guys doing here?!

                                 DEBBIE
                        Come on in.  We’re just.. hangin’.

           As they step aside, suddenly ADULTS AND KIDS leap up --

                                 ADULTS AND KIDS
                        Surprise!

           Adam beams - genuinely.  Surprise or not, it’s great to have a 
           party.  He shares a secret smile with Hoyt as they enter..

           LATER

           Kindergartners run around, oblivious to the STRING QUARTET, 
           which plays for the adults.  (The CELLIST is DEBBIE.)  

           Only one kid listens:  Adam, who is transfixed by his mother’s 
           playing.  She is engrossed, fluid; in her element.  But then 
           something in the piece pulls Adam from his trance:

           Adam crinkles his face at the VIOLIST, as if what (or how) he’s 
           playing actually smells bad.  The violist glares.  Adam gives 
           him the “thumbs down,” exits.  The man just gapes.

           INT. DEN - A MOMENT LATER

           The den is TOM’S WORKSHOP, and it’s full of electronics.  Adam 
           fingers through stuff as Tom enters with a few GUESTS.

                                 TOM
                        ..and - if the suits who control my destiny 
                        actually put the money in, everything in here - 
                        everything on this board - can be shrunk into 
                        a tiny chip the size of a grain of rice.  And 
                        voila -- 
                             (rubs Adam’s head)
                        -- hey buddy --
                             (lifts what looks like a large 
                              HEADPHONE with extruding mics)
                        --the in-ear computer that lets you hear four 
                        times better than the average human.  Like a cat.

                                 ADAM
                        Bats hear ten times better.
                                 TOM
                        My son, ladies and gentlemen, who never 
                        resists a chance to let the world know he’s 
                        smarter than his old man.

           Tom smiles, winks at Adam, who also smiles - as do the others.

                                 FRIEND OF TOM’S
                        What’s it’s called?

                                 TOM
                        This tiny little computer.. is called “Adam.”  
                        Oh!  You mean this?  This.. is the Cat-Ear..

                                 ADAM
                        Bat-Ear would be better.

                                 TOM
                             (as if completing his own sentence)
                        ..but Bat-Ear would be better, apparently.  

                                 DEBBIE
                             (enters; herds Adam out)
                        There you are..

                                 TOM
                        I was just showing them my Nobel Prize - I 
                        mean prototype.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Ah, yes.. The reason my husband believes we 
                        will never have to work again.  But alas.. the 
                        thing.. is ready.

           She indicates for Tom to get his ass out there.

           A MOMENT LATER - IN THE LIVING ROOM

           The “thing” is a cake with 5 candles, which comes toward a 
           beaming Adam as people sing - accompanied by the quartet:

                                 VOICES
                        HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR ADAM..
                        HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!

           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           A pile of gifts (finger paints, kids’ books, etc).  

                                 TOM
                        And.. finally.. from Mom and me.  
           Adam now unwraps a tiny CASIO PLASTIC “PIANO.” 

                                 DEBBIE
                        We know how much you like making noise.  And 
                        we saw the way you were listening to the one 
                        at Dashiell’s house.

                                 TOM
                        You can make all different sounds with it.  

           Tom hits a few keys:  a choo-choo, an a-ooga, a dog barking.  

           Adam does the same.  Then adjusts it to “piano” and - slowly and 
           deliberately - presses each note, chromatically, up the scale.  
           Just staring at the keys - as if ‘imprinting.’  And then..

           He plucks out the first six notes of “Happy Birthday.”  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Did Dash teach you that?

           Adam shakes his head.  Then he puts both hands on the keyboard.. 
           and plays the song FULLY - with FULL CHORDS.

           And the entire room goes silent.  

           Debbie looks at Tom.  They are shocked.

           Now we hear Beethoven’s Opus 10 #1 on a real piano and CUT TO:

           INT. ROOM - SOMEWHERE - ABOUT A YEAR LATER

           Adam, in a tux, plays with passion and finesse - amazing not 
           just because he’s six, but because it’s actually amazing.  

           He finishes to THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.  And we realize we’re in:

           A packed AUDITORIUM.  He bows, sees his PARENTS - and smiles.  
           We PUSH IN ON THEM, so proud.  Tom takes Debbie’s hand as:

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Wow.. That was six year old Thomas Adam Davis.  
                        Wow.  Okay.  Our final entrant, eleven year old 
                        Jay Lee playing Chopin’s Fantasie Impromptu..

           INT. TOM AND DEBBIE’S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

           CHAMPAGNE POPS as a few DOZEN PEOPLE fill the apartment.  
                                 A FRIEND OF TOM’S
                        To the youngest winner - ever - of the 
                        Steinway Society of Massachusetts piano 
                        competition!  

           Adam, still in his tux, beams as his father rubs his hair.

                                 TOM
                        I know.. Here I am surrounded by musicians, 
                        and yet I couldn’t carry a tune if it was 
                        stapled to my forehead.

           Someone whispers to Debbie, who then crosses and kneels by Adam.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Hey.  Auntie Ruth wants to know if our ‘little 
                        genius’ can do that ‘thing’ he does..

           INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Adam now sits at the piano as Tom pulls a piece of paper from a 
           bowl and hands it to Debbie:

                                 DEBBIE
                        The Itsy Bitsy Spider.. And..
                             (as Tom hands another)
                        Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
                             (off Adam’s look)
                        He’s rolling his eyes, which means..

                                 TOM
                        Whattya say, Ads?  Too easy?

                                 ANOTHER GUEST
                        How about Beethoven’s Fifth?

                                 BRIAN
                        And Hey Jude.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        You know that one, Adam?  
                             (off Adam’s blank look)
                        HEY JUDE.. NA NA NA NAA...

           Adam quickly nods - yeah yeah, he knows it.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.. Drum roll..

           Adam looks at the keys.. Then, with his left hand, he plays the 
           first few notes of Beethoven’s Fifth:  da da da dahhhh..
           Then, while continuing Beethoven’s Fifth with his left hand, 
           with his right he plays “Hey Jude, don’t make it bad..” etc.

           And they go together perfectly.  People are amazed.  CUT TO:

           LATER STILL

           Adam hides on the stairs wearing the BAT-EARS - which exaggerate 
           the features around his ears.  He also has binoculars.  

           ADAM’S POV - EXTREME CLOSE UPS (WITH SOUND VERY MAGNIFIED)

           As Adam swings his view from pocket to pocket of guests.

                                 DEBBIE
                        ..told us his IQ’s so high it’s incalculable..

           SWING TO TOM, IN A GROUP:

                                 TOM
                        ..years of college - and engineering school - 
                        to have a 6 year old tell me I’m a moron?!

           Tom laughs - proud - ironic - as if both cutting himself down 
           and bragging at the same time.. SWING TO:

                                 DEBBIE
                        ..asked why Van Gogh gave his ear to a woman, 
                        and I said why do you think, Adam?  He said 
                        “Maybe he wanted her to hear him?”  He was 3. 

           SWING BACK TO:

                                 TOM
                        I’m like the vessel through which all the good 
                        genes flow.. Maybe they stop - you know, to 
                        pee, get gas.. check a map.. 
                             (as the “gene”)
                        “Oh - here we go - we want this brain, over 
                        here - in the next generation..”
                             (mimes “speeding away”)
                        Rrrch!  Road sign: “Next brain: 30 years.”

           People laugh - again - at Tom’s good-natured self-effacing.  ECU 
           follows Tom as he joins Debbie in the other group:

                                 ANOTHER GUEST
                        ..but as a mother - and a musician - you know 
                        this:  it’s a huge responsibility.  Huge.  
                        Seriously.  You don’t just owe this to your 
                        son, you owe it to Music Itself. 

           Debbie looks at Tom, then turns toward camera as --
           Adam quickly retreats into his room, where he closes his door.

           On his wall, mixed with (but in fact actually dominating) the 
           ‘typical’ kid stuff, are POSTERS OF GREAT COMPOSERS: BACH, 
           BEETHOVEN, RACHMANINOFF, MOZART, SCHUMANN, SCHUBERT.  All 
           staring, impassive, expressionless:  a lot of pressure.

                                 6 YEAR OLD ADAM (V.O.)
                        In 1873 Johann Strauss wrote an operetta 
                        called “Die Fledermaus,” which is the German 
                        word for bat.  However, its literal 
                        translation is “The Flying Mouse.”   

           INT. FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY

           The board says “ANIMAL REPORTS TODAY!”  Adam, in front, reads:

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Yet, interestingly, a bat is actually far more 
                        closely resembled to a human being than to a 
                        mouse or a rat.  Just look at the bone 
                        structure and it would be obvious. 

           Other 6 year olds are mostly bored.  Adam keeps reading.

                                 ADAM
                        Another reason bats are better than humans is 
                        echolocation.  By emitting a sound and hearing 
                        how it bounces back, a bat knows exactly how 
                        big everything is, where it’s located, and how 
                        it’s moving.  Also:  unlike humans, bats are 
                        capable of great acts of altruism to support 
                        their colony.  For instance, when a bat is ill 
                        and cannot hunt for food, other bats from the 
                        colony will bring food back to it.  There are 
                        over 1000 species of bats, which means that of 
                        all the species of mammals on the planet, one 
                        quarter are species of bats.  When I grow up, 
                        I want to be the Dr. Jane Goodall of bats. 

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - RECESS - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam moves through the school playground, on the periphery.

           Near him, some kids pretend to collide on little rideable 
           ‘cars.’  As they play act a ‘rescue’.. we find Adam, on the 
           sidelines, looking for an opportunity to join in.

                                 ADAM
                        I read a surprising statistic about vehicular 
                        deaths.
                             (as things sort of grind to a halt)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADAM (CONT'D)
                        Did you know that males are twice as likely to 
                        die in motor vehicle accidents than females?  
                        Yet if you’re a female you’re thirty percent 
                        more likely to be injured.

           Adam’s losing people, but rather than back off, he moves closer.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  You’re only 20% as likely to 
                        suffer a fatality here in Massachusetts as you 
                        would be in, like, Mississippi. 

           Someone comes up and pantses him.  Kids laugh; Adam’s mortified.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Debbie sits with Adam, who’s got a bloody nose.  The kid who 
           pantsed him sits with his mom.  

                                 KID
                        Frog-o-dite.

                                 ADAM
                        The word is troglodyte.  And if you don’t know 
                        what it IS, why’d you get so upset?

                                 KID’S MOM
                             (a genuine question)
                        Is it an insult?  I don’t know..

                                 ADAM
                        It means a member of a primitive race or a 
                        cave-dweller.  But for your son it’s not an 
                        insult, it’s actually a compliment. 

           INT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS - THAT NIGHT

           Adam slams the bathroom door, really really upset.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        No!  NO NO NO NO NO.

                                 TOM
                        But you hate school.  And now they’re saying 
                        you don’t have to go!  Open the door!

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        They said I can’t go. 
                                 DEBBIE
                             (passing as DOORBELL RINGS)
                        They said you shouldn’t go if you’re not 
                        challenged.  And you can’t go if you bully the 
                        other kids.  Or their parents.

                                 TOM
                        Open the door now!  The downstairs bathroom’s 
                        clogged and we have to go and I have to pee so 
                        open the door NOW!

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        You’re not the boss of me!

                                 TOM
                        I am too the boss of you!

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        You’re not even the boss of yourself!

           Tom balls his fists to punch the door; then stops himself.

                                 TOM
                        Fine.  I’m gonna pee at a gas station.  You 
                        happy?  I’m pissing at the gas station, Adam, 
                        I hope you’re happy.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        I’m very happy.

           DOWNSTAIRS - SAME

           Debbie is showing JEANNIE (14) around. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        He can practice as late as ten.  But no later.  
                        And be firm.  The number’s on the fridge; 
                        we’ll be at Tom’s boss’s.

                                 TOM
                             (bounds downstairs)
                        Getting shit-faced and kissing ass.  
                             (quickly; off Debbie’s look)
                        Sorry.  Hi Jeannie.  If we’re not back in ten 
                        years, send him to college.  In Shanghai.

           And Tom’s grabbed his keys and has whooshed out the door.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Sorry.  It’s been.. He can sometimes be..
                             (stops herself)
                        Good luck.
           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

           Jeannie watches TV.  Then rises, crosses to the other room, 
           where Adam practices piano.

                                 ADAM
                        Please stop looking at me.

                                 JEANNIE
                        My job is to watch you.

                                 ADAM
                        Watch does not equal look.

           He stops, rises, goes into his room, and shuts the door. 

           INT. ADAM’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           Adam lies on his bed, reading.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        I’m bored.  

                                 ADAM
                        I’m reading.

           She walks in anyway, sits on his bed.  He continues reading.  

           She looks around - sees the GREAT COMPOSERS, staring.  Then sees 
           two other things on his wall:  Hoyt’s huge bat wings, and a 
           small, crudely-stitched stuffed BAT.  She grabs the little one.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        Did you know it was me who made the bat?  I 
                        gave it to you for your first birthday.

           Jeannie sits next to him.  He takes it.  Holds it to his chest.  

           INT. NICE HOUSE - NEWTON, MASS - SAME

           Work-party vibe.  Catered.  Tom and Debbie with Tom’s boss - 
           GENE - and his son:  a competitive guy around Tom’s age (NICK). 

                                 GENE
                        ..go public, or not go public.  Of course, if 
                        you’d’ve asked me three years ago..

           Gene’s voice fades as Debbie’s eyes drift all the things they’ll 
           never afford:  The tasteful details.. The grand piano (unused).. 

                                 GENE’S WIFE (LYNN)
                        And what is it that you do, Debbie?
           Debbie is brought back.  She prepares for what, historically, 
           has been a proven conversation-stopper.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh.. I.. am a part-time office manager in an 
                        accounting firm.

                                 TOM
                        And she’s a cellist.  In a quartet.

                                 DEBBIE
                        No.  Tom.  Not professionally. 

                                 TOM
                        Not true.  Wellesley Art and Wine Festival.. 
                        That thing at Barbara’s party..
                             (to the others)
                        They met at Julliard.  Hello. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        We’re not.. It’s an occasional thing.
                             (to clarify)
                        Time.  We’re gonna really make a run for it 
                        this year - you know, give it a.. 
                             (off Tom’s look)
                        Yes.  I am a cellist, first.

                                 GENE
                        Well hopefully - knock wood - Tom’s “Bat-Ear” 
                        will give you that time.. 

                                 NICK
                        Yeah, your husband is either our savior - or 
                        our ruin.
                             (follows an hor d’ouevres tray)
                        Excuse me a minute..

           The group breaks up as Nick heads away.  Tom leans to Debbie.  

                                 TOM
                        No pressure there.  Why does he hate me?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Because your wife is so astonishingly 
                        beautiful and talented?

                                 TOM
                        Ah.  Yes.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        He’ll change his mind when you save his 
                        father’s company.
                                 TOM
                        Or it’ll get worse.  When I take it over.

           He smiles, does a private Snidely Whiplash ‘moustachio twist’ - 
           as if he has a big Machiavellian plan up his sleeve.

           INT. DAVIS APARTMENT - IN ADAM’S ROOM - SAME 

           Jeannie and Adam on his bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                 JEANNIE
                        How?  And - wait - what are they called?

                                 ADAM
                        Cilia.  Do you want to know how they 
                        reproduce?

                                 JEANNIE
                        No!  Not from you, at least.  And maybe not 
                        from anyone, ever.  

                                 ADAM
                        When I grow up I’m going to be a vet for bats.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Well that is definitely a niche.  I’m gonna be 
                        a singer.

           Adam looks at her.  We HEAR the “BLACK EYED PEAS” on piano..

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER (8:30 PM)

           Jeannie holds a broom as a “mic” while Adam plays piano.

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Laaadies annnd gentlemennnn!  Welcome to 
                        Bonnaroo!  On piano, the great Adam Davis! 
                             (as Adam nods to the “crowd”)
                        I GOT A FEELING, THAT TONIGHT’S GONNA BE A 
                        GOOD NIGHT.. THAT TONIGHT’S GONNA BE A GOOD 
                        GOOD NIGHT... 

           INT. APARTMENT - 9:45 PM

           Jeannie and Adam - dressed in Tom and Debbie’s clothes, 
           sunglasses, hats, jewelry - moving like rappers.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        SOULJA BOY OFF IN THIS--
                                 ADAM

                                 ADAM
                        ROLL!

           INT. APARTMENT - 10:15 PM

           Now Jeannie has a shaving cream ‘beard,’ and Adam wears Debbie’s 
           dress and heels.  Adam rides the piano bench a la Lady Gaga:

                                 ADAM
                        MMM MM MM MM MM MM MM MY --

                        POKER FACE! 

           INT. APARTMENT - 11:30 PM

           Both are sound asleep on the couch, like dogs who ran too much 
           at the park.  The room’s a disaster zone.  Tom and Debbie enter.

                                 DEBBIE
                        ..such a shame to have a Steinway Elora just 
                        gathering dust..

                                 TOM
                        You never know.  Maybe somebody uses it.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Trust me - it was gathering dust.  I checked.  
                        Hey - they left the light on.
                             (suddenly stops)
                        Oh my god..

           They see an empty bottle of CHAMPAGNE - and two glasses.  

           INT. STUDY - A MOMENT LATER

           Tom takes what looks like a digital clock from a shelf.  It’s 
           actually a NANNY CAM. 

           A MOMENT LATER, it’s hooked to the computer.  ON THE SCREEN:  
           Jeannie and Adam rocking out, singing Lady Gaga.  Adam now lying 
           on the TOP of the piano, hammering the keys below him.

                                 TOM
                        You gotta admit, she’s a good dancer.
           BEHIND THEM - HIDDEN IN THE DOORWAY - SAME

           Is Adam, unseen by Tom and Debbie, watching it all.

           Tom skips it forward - randomly - then hits play.  Now:

           ON SCREEN, Adam and Jeannie loll about on the floor, inebriated.  

                                 JEANNIE (ON SCREEN)
                        No matter what happens.. No matter who in our 
                        life can’t possibly understand us.. lets 
                        promise - no swear - to always --

           Tom, sensing someone behind him, quickly stops the video, turns - 
           as the door closes and Adam ducks back into hiding.

           EXT. HOYT’S PROPERTY - DAY

           Debbie impatiently waves out her Prius window.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Sorry - thanks - gotta..

           Hoyt, on his side stoop, ‘salutes’ as Debbie drives off in a 
           rush, leaving Adam way down at the other end of the driveway.  

                                 HOYT
                        Welcome to what happens when everyone else has 
                        someplace to be.

           INT. HOYT’S KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

           Adam and Hoyt at the table, playing chess.  

                                 HOYT
                        You’re kidding.  
                             (as Adam shakes his head)
                        You’re not kidding.  Did you set a date?

                                 ADAM
                        We’re gonna see how our lives pan out in the 
                        next few years.  But I’ll certainly give you 
                        plenty of heads up.
                             (moves his bishop)
                        Check.

                                 HOYT
                        Already?  Damn.  
                             (moves a rook)
                        You better give me heads up.  I’m gonna need 
                        to get a suit.
                                 ADAM
                        A tux.  Cause you’re gonna be the best man.
                             (another move)
                        Mate.  --It’s quite a responsibility.  Are you 
                        prepared for the responsibility? 

                                 HOYT
                        Adam, I give you my word:  I am up for the 
                        task.  
                             (re chessboard)
                        Two out of three?

           Adam nods.  They turn the board, start to re-set the pieces.

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        Now listen.. About your bachelor party--

                                 ADAM
                        Legoland.

                                 HOYT
                        Legoland it is, then..

           They continue setting the board as we cut to:

           INT. HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

           Debbie cleans up from breakfast as Adam enters.

                                 ADAM
                        When is Jeannie coming?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Adam, I have a surprise for you.  You have a 
                        new baby-sitter.. Me!

                                 ADAM
                        But you have rehearsal - and Jeannie is my 
                        girlfriend.

                                 TOM
                             (passes, grabbing keys)
                        Well your girlfriend is too young for certain 
                        responsibilities.  And you’re gonna practice 
                        piano with your mom today.  
                             (stops at door)
                        Back by seven.  Unless the VC guys wanna have 
                        a drink or something.  I’ll call.

           And he’s out.  

                                 ADAM
                        Can she still come over?
                                 DEBBIE
                        Her parents aren’t allowing it, Adam.  And 
                        your father and I agree.  No more.  
                             (as Adam freezes)
                        Come on - this’ll be fun.

           Adam runs to the wall - starts pulling stuff off the shelves.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THEIR APARTMENT - SAME

           Tom is at the elevator as Debbie comes out.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Tom --

           The door slams behind her.

                                 TOM
                        God-damnit.
                             (rushes over)
                        Open the door, Adam!  NOW.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Thomas Adam Davis you open this door this 
                        instant!  

           We hear PIANO start from inside.  Tom BANGS.

                                 TOM
                        Adam - stop that NOW.  NOW.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Sweetheart - will you open up please?

                                 TOM
                        Damnit!  I’m counting to ten, then I’m getting 
                        Mr. Langheier with his crowbar.  Okay - I’m 
                        counting!  1, 2, 3..

           Adam just continues to play.  

           We now HEAR a more complicated piece of music.. and we see it 
           played by older hands.. and PULL BACK to reveal we are:

           INT. APARTMENT - PRESENT DAY

           And ADAM IS TWELVE NOW.  But he’s playing the same little 
           upright piano.  In the same little apartment.

           We notice he now has a way of moving when he plays - a kind of 
           rocking, as though he’s so absorbed he has lost track of his 
           body.  And he hums - like Glenn Gould, or Sviatoslav Richter.  
           But we hear another sound.  And Adam hears it, too.  It’s..

           VOICES OFFSCREEN.  Arguing.  His playing slows as listens to:

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Tom and Debbie, fighting.  Pretty intensively.  And we notice:

           Though it’s only 7 years on, Tom’s aged by twice that.  He’s got 
           easily another 25 pounds - and a considerable amount of grey.   

           Debbie is thinner - more taut.  And is dressed more formally. 

                                 TOM
                        No.  No.  Don’t tell me I don’t ‘get’ it.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You don’t.  There are requirements-

                                 TOM
                        Don’t patronize me - I know the ‘requirements’ - 
                        he’s my goddamn son, too.  And by the way?  I 
                        get enough shit from Nick and Gene during the 
                        work day - I don’t need it here.

                                 DEBBIE
                        “Work” day, Tom?  Like this isn’t--

                                 TOM
                             (aware of the other room)
                        SHHHHH.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Like this isn’t a full-time job?  I’m like a 
                        concierge-slash-manager-slash-babysitter-
                             (eyes clock, calls offscreen)
                        Adam!

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Tom, Debbie, with Adam in back.  Utter silence.  Ice.  We PRE-
           LAP PIANO (what Adam was practicing a moment ago at home) and -

           INT. SOMEWHERE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam - in a SUIT AND TIE - plays grand piano with focus and 
           passion.  He hums along, oblivious, and ends to HUGE APPLAUSE.

           Adam hesitantly rises, bows.  Then looks around - quite awkward.  
           He has a very individualized, almost syncopated way about him - 
           like someone who has to remind himself how “normal people” move.  

           He’s motioned over by A CHEERY MAN AND WOMAN. 

           People are still clapping as he walks - which makes him even 
           more self-conscious.  And he’s not good at making eye contact - 
           so it almost looks like his eyes are darting furtively.  

           We now realize we’re on the set of “GOOD AFTERNOON BOSTON.”  

                                 MALE HOST
                        Unbelievable.. That was amazing.  And you’re - 
                        how old?  35?

           Laughter from the studio audience.  An awkward beat..

                                 ADAM
                        Did you want me to answer?

                                 MALE HOST
                        I’ll answer for you:  12 years old, folks!
                             (as people applaud)
                        Your parents must be doing something right!  
                        Speaking of.. Your mom told us.. 
                             (to audience)
                        You’re gonna get a kick out of this.
                             (to Adam)
                        Your parents said when you were little you 
                        used to do this thing with your left hand and 
                        your right hand.  Well, before we went on air 
                        we had everyone in the audience write down 
                        their favorite songs.
                             (to the audience)
                        This is the reason, folks..
                             (back to Adam)
                        And we’re gonna randomly pick two.. 

           Adam looks around - a bit trapped.  Offstage, his parents smile.

                                 MALE HOST (CONT’D)
                        Can we put you back at the piano for a moment?

                                 FEMALE HOST
                        Adam Davis, once again!

           Applause as Adam dutifully rises and trots back to the piano.  

                                 MALE HOST
                        Okay - the two songs are..
                             (reading from clips of paper)
                        Left hand.. “Another One Bites the Dust.”  The 
                        Queen song?  I think it is the Queen song.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MALE HOST (CONT'D)
                        And for the right hand.. “Candle in the Wind,” 
                        by Elton John!

           With his left hand, Adam starts “Another One Bites the Dust,”  
           then adds the chorus to “Candle in the Wind” with the right 
           (”And it seems to me, you lived your life..”).  CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - A HALF HOUR LATER

           Adam is LIVID.  Debbie is chastened.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Look - I said I’m sorry.

                                 ADAM
                             (like a bird)
                        Cheeep.  Cheep-cheeep.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I said please stop that.

                                 ADAM
                        Cheep cheep.  Cheep cheep cheep.

           The car comes to a halt.  Adam throws open the door.

           EXT. CAMPUS OF HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Adam slams the door - leans into the window.

                                 ADAM
                        If you wanted a trained parakeet, you should 
                        have gotten an actual one.  

           And he brusquely turns and moves away.

           INT. CAR - CLOSE ON DEBBIE

           Thrown, Debbie re-starts the (already-started) car - which 
           GRINDS.. as..

           EXT. CAMPUS - ON THE LAWN - SAME

           Adam walks, then slows, his expression changing - and he 
           instantly goes from looking like an adult in a child’s body to a 
           child in an adult’s suit.  He picks up his cell phone.

                                 ADAM
                        Mommy?
           HARD CUT TO:  EXT. CAMPUS - A MOMENT LATER

           Debbie and Adam on a BENCH; his head in her lap, rocking.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I said that.

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s okay.  I’m sorry.  I thought you’d get a 
                        kick out of it.  And I was wrong.  

                                 ADAM
                        It’s okay.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Do you want me to cancel your lesson today?  

                                 ADAM
                        No.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Thursday you were doing that thing - for those 
                        inner city kids.  We can cancel that--

                                 ADAM
                        That’s okay.  
                             (sits up, wipes his face)
                        I have to go.  I have a test.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Um.. Okay..  Oh, Adam?
                             (as he turns)
                        I’m coming to get you right after school.  We 
                        need to fit you again for a new tux.  You are 
                        growing so fast right now..

           He nods.  Turns.  She watches him walk off.

           WITH ADAM, AS HE WALKS THROUGH THE GREEN.  Out of place among 
           the 17 and 18 year olds, he can feel he’s being looked at.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Adam’s the first to finish the test.  As he drops it off, the 
           teacher eyes the time, then the hand-written “100%” on the page.

                                 TEACHER
                        Adam - what’s this?

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, I graded it for you.
                                 TEACHER
                        Then what’s this?

           There’s also a “MINUS 4” written on it and some red circles.

                                 ADAM
                        Mistakes on your questions.  Mostly minor.

           The teacher looks down - then up - but Adam’s already gone.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - A BIT LATER

           A PEP RALLY - in EXTREME CLOSE UP.  Football players.  Kids.  
           Adam watches from the back of the bleachers - focussing on the 
           cheerleaders - with the binoculars and bat-ears.  A ‘wave’ moves 
           through.  Adam stays seated as it engulfs - then passes - him.

           INT. MALL - TUX SHOP - LATER

           Adam stands with his arms outstretched - like a scarecrow in an 
           oversized tuxedo - as one adult runs a tape measure along his 
           arms while another pinches in the material.

           Debbie sits to the side, checking email on her BlackBerry as 
           Adam looks through the glass, into the mall, where a small 
           gaggle of twelve and thirteen year olds passes by. 

           CLOSE ON ADAM’S HANDS

           Playing furiously - amazingly.  He’s in--

           INT. MARWOOD CONSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS

           In a practice room, Adam finishes with a flourish.  His 
           instructor, the distinguished JOHN SYDNEY, sits by him.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Good.  Very good.  But the left hand has to 
                        hold back a bit, not rush through it.  The 
                        chord is unresolved - and there’s power in 
                        that.  You need to let yourself experience the 
                        lack of resolution, the “not knowing.”  Not 
                        everything has to be answered.  Let the 
                        yearning to resolve it be the end in and of 
                        itself.
                             (plays a run)
                        Syncopation:  tenuto!
                                 ADAM
                        I don’t have to sit here for five minutes to 
                        understand where Brahams was going with that.  
                        I get the point - and whoever doesn’t isn’t 
                        worth playing for.  That was boring.  And 
                        obvious.  And this piece is a bunch of treacle 
                        anyway.

                                 SYDNEY 
                        What I’m trying to show you is --

                                 ADAM
                        -- why you teach instead of play?

                                 SYDNEY
                             (measured)
                        There is a reason students have teachers. 

                                 ADAM
                        Do you know who invented the cotton gin?

                                 SYDNEY
                        Eli Whitney.

                                 ADAM
                        Do you think he ever had a teacher?

                                 SYDNEY
                        I’m certain of it.

                                 ADAM
                        Well if his teacher was so great, why didn’t 
                        he invent the cotton gin?

           Adam stares at Sydney - will this adult do anything?  Sydney 
           just sucks it up, continues.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Left hand.  Again.

                                 ADAM
                        No.  I’m done for the day.

           Adam gets up, walks out.

           EXT. MARWOOD CONSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS

           Adam heads down the imposing steps into the steel and cement of 
           the city.  Below him, Boston is loud, cacophonous; forbidding.
           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom and Debbie - angry - across from Adam.  

                                 TOM
                        Because it’s rude.  You’re rude.  And 
                        ungrateful.  And I don’t like getting the 
                        constant calls.  The school, the academy..

                                 DEBBIE
                        He’s the best teacher in Boston, Adam.  And 
                        he’s expensive.

                                 ADAM
                        Then tell him we quit.  He’ll offer to teach 
                        me for free.

                                 TOM
                        Rude.  

                                 ADAM
                        But true.  Did you see the fall catalogue? 

           Tom - unsure - looks at Debbie for clarification.

                                 DEBBIE
                        The, uh.. The academy catalogue mentions 
                        Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        I apparently am an attraction, like the state-
                        of-the-art mixing board, or the new 
                        underground parking facility.  Tom, I believe 
                        this conversation has saturated itself.

           He starts out.

                                 TOM
                        No!  The conversation has not ‘saturated 
                        itself’ until I say it has!  AND MY NAME IS 
                        NOT TOM - or, well, to YOU IT ISN’T! 

                                 ADAM
                             (turns)
                        Fine, daddy.  Reiterate or elaborate.  I’m all 
                        ears. 

           Adam just stands there, looks at them.  Finally:

                                 TOM
                        Conversation is over.
           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - SHORTLY THEREAFTER 

           Adam lies in bed, wearing the bat-ears.. listening.  The posters 
           on his wall - the composers - are yellowed - but still there.  

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        ..supposed to just tell him he’s right?

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Supposed to not let him walk all over you.  

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        I don’t -- 

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        You do:  here, work - cause you wanna be liked 
                        - but instead they just walk--

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL QUAD - DAY

           LUNCH.  Adam removes crumpled bills, steps up to a folding table 
           where CHEERLEADERS sell tickets to a dance.   

                                 ADAM
                        One, please.  And one other, please.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - DAY

           ECU, LONG LENS, through the WINDOW of “VINYL FETISH RECORDS,” 
           where JEANNIE - now 21 - is working, finishing up with a 
           customer.  REVERSE ANGLE:

           ACROSS THE STREET - ADAM

           Is watching her with BINOCULARS and the BAT-EARS.. 

           He sees her changing shifts.  She gathers stuff, then stops - 
           aware she’s being looked at.  She turns, face brightening.

           Outside, Adam drops the binoculars, starts to rise as -

           A 22 YEAR OLD GUY crosses in front of Adam as Jeannie exits (now 
           carrying a GUITAR) and gives the guy a kiss.

           They walk right past Adam, heading for the guy’s car, which they 
           enter and take off in.  Adam stares, holding the dance tickets.

           INT. GYM - HIGH SCHOOL DANCE - NIGHT

           A DJ blasts a beat as 400 teens dance, grind, sing, while --
           Adam, the smallest kid by far (and the only one in a tie), 
           stands in back, holding punch, watching.  

           EXT. HOYT’S GARAGE - DAY

           Adam and Hoyt in the indoor/outdoor workshop.  They are working 
           on a small balsa wood AIRPLANE.  Hoyt nurses a scotch.

           Hoyt’s aged a lot - his thin hair is wispy and mismanaged.

                                 HOYT
                        Well.. It was seven years ago.  I do believe 
                        there’s a statute of limitations on proposals.  
                        And - if I remember correctly - you were drunk.  
                        Which is, by the way, the only reason I got 
                        your grandmother to say yes.  And that.. was 
                        the last time I ever heard that word from her.
                             (re plane)
                        Did I hollow this out enough?

           Adam looks into the “belly” - it’s hollowed out like a bird’s 
           belly.  Adam shrugs - possibly.  

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        Well grab the sander - give it a run.  
                             (as Adam stands there)
                        Hey.  Pull your weight or feel free to leave.

           Adam grabs the sander, starts helping.  

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        Okay - you’re the pointy-head, here’s my 
                        question for you:  how do I shrink myself so 
                        that I can launch myself in the cockpit?

                                 ADAM
                        Who would throw it?

                                 HOYT
                        Ahh -
                             (touches his head as if to say “I 
                              already thought of that”)
                        Before I shrink myself, I clone a big myself 
                        to throw little myself.

                                 ADAM
                        I see no flaw in this plan whatsoever.

                                 HOYT
                        I know.  I know.  And yet - no one’s done it.  
                        Go figure.
                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        HEY!  What are you doing?!

           Both turn - surprised to see Debbie rushing out of her hybrid.

                                 HOYT
                        See, that’s the problem with the damn 
                        Priuses.. Pri-i?  You can’t hear the dreaded 
                        things sneakin’ up on ya.

           Debbie grabs the sander from Adam and the scotch from Hoyt.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Have you gone mad?  One slip - one slip.  
                        Hoyt, Jesus..
                             (dumps drink)
                        ..it’s not even three o’clock.
                             (grabs Adam, drags him into Hoyt’s)
                        Hey - Buster - we have a two hour drive and 
                        you’re not even dressed yet.  Christ.. it’s 
                        like having two twelve year olds..

                                 HOYT
                             (calls after them)
                        Oh - Addo - next time you come - we gotta do 
                        that thing where we stick your hand in the 
                        propeller to see if it’s working.

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Ha ha ha.

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - TWO HOURS LATER - VERMONT

           Rural Vermont.  With Mozart playing in the car, Debbie and Adam 
           (now in a suit) turn down the extremely long driveway of a huge 
           estate with a vast lawn.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        You know, his Saint-Saens - he did this 
                        rendition, with Yo Yo Ma.  2003?  2004?  It 
                        was, literally, I think, the quintessential 
                        classic cello concerto.. Wow.  He lives in a 
                        castle.

           Debbie cuts the engine - and therefore Mozart.  Which now makes 
           it impossible NOT to hear the LOUD ROCK AND ROLL playing within 
           the huge estate.  (It’s “London Calling” by the Clash.)

           And it gets louder as the front door opens and out steps:

           The long-haired man-child, PAUL ALAN SMITH - a kind of Peter 
           Sellars/Gustavo Dudamel styled composer/conductor/pianist; 
           a former prodigy himself.  He wears low-cut ratty jeans and a 
           black vintage Ramones t-shirt.  And has bare feet.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Is that him?  Oh my God.. It is him.  It’s 
                        Paul Alan Smith.

           Smith widens his arms as Debbie and Adam get out of their car. 

                                 SMITH
                        See this is what I love about my life:  some 
                        call up and order in a pizza and wings.  I 
                        order in Thomas Adam Davis and his beautiful 
                        mother.  And voila - it arrives.  
                             (re Adam)
                        On time..
                             (re Debbie - playful)
                        And hot.
                             (then, quickly)
                        Sorry.
                             (equally quickly)
                        But true.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Adam at the piano, Debbie in a chair, Smith pacing like an 
           excited bird.

                                 SMITH
                        ..And why I’m watching a Tuesday afternoon 
                        talk show is beyond me.. But there I was:  
                        trashy tv, me, and the cat.  And what do I 
                        hear?  This child.  And Rachmaninov’s 
                        Prelude in G Minor.  Was it good?  Honestly - 
                        it might have been.  But unless I hear it 
                        myself, with these, I can’t tell.  So I make 
                        a few calls, badabing, badaboom, and.. May I 
                        say:  thank you for coming.

           There’s a pause - as if Adam should know what to do.

                                 ADAM
                        Are you asking me to play it?

                                 SMITH
                             (laughs)
                        Did I say I love my life?  Well I couldn’t 
                        always say that, Adam, I assure you.  Trust 
                        me.  Anyhow..  Who would you like to meet?  In 
                        the entire world?

                                 ADAM
                        Dr. Jane Goodall.
                                 SMITH
                        Well you can.  You can meet anyone, go 
                        anywhere.  If my suspicions are correct and 
                        you can hear the whispers.  Of the angels.  
                        Can you, Adam?  Where are you in school?

                                 ADAM
                        Saint Mary’s.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Adam is a senior in high school.

                                 SMITH
                        Have you heard of The Boswell School?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Um.. Yes.

                                 SMITH
                        Your mother knows it.  
                             (an aside - to Debbie)
                        They’ve had several cellists - Arentzen, 
                        Sawitzke..

                                 DEBBIE
                        You knew I was a cellist?

                                 SMITH
                        The Worchester String Ensemble.  

           Debbie’s surprised - even flattered - briefly, until:

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Well, I Googled you.  Well, him.

           Debbie nods with resignation as Smith turns back to Adam.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Boswell is in, of all places, Dallas, Texas.  
                        64 students, total.  8 matriculations a year.  
                        From all over the world.  Many like you.  
                        Young, gifted - in unique ways.  I went there.  
                        I am on the board.  Would you like to go 
                        there?

                                 ADAM
                        Would I have to go away?

                                 SMITH
                        Well I could see if they’d bring the school to 
                        you.

                                 ADAM
                        I believe I’d like to go to vet school.
                                 DEBBIE
                        Adam - seriously - you’re taking up Mr. 
                        Smith’s time.

                                 SMITH
                        No no no no no.  Adam - you are to play not 
                        for your mother - nor for me.  You play for 
                        yourself.  And the angels.  No one else.  What 
                        is it my teacher said?  “Cold rationality and 
                        a warm heart.”  That’s what makes a pianist.  
                        You come when you’re ready.  
                             (then)
                        Hey.  Idea.  Would you like to play something 
                        together?

           INT. SMITH’S DEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Adam and Smith, on the couch, playing X-Box.  Now Adam’s in bare 
           feet as well.

           INT. CAR - DRIVING

           Debbie and Adam, on the Turnpike, in silence.  Finally:

                                 DEBBIE
                        He called you.  Paul Alan Smith called you.  
                        And we drove to Vermont so you could play NOT 
                        Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G Minor, but rather 
                        “Mortal Kombat.”

                                 ADAM
                        “Call of Duty.”

                                 DEBBIE
                        Same thing.

                                 ADAM
                        They are not the same thing.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Like you’d know.  You’ve never played a video 
                        game in your life.  Till you could do it as a 
                        ‘fuck you.’  Yes - I said ‘the f-word.’

                                 ADAM
                        I believe I do wanna go to vet school.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I believe you were being a smart-ass.  And I 
                        believe you still are being a smart ass.

           A pause.  Adam nods.. Then just looks out the window.
                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        People would fly halfway around the world for 
                        an opportunity like that.  And not just 
                        children - adults.  Wasted.  A wasted 
                        opportunity.  Wasted.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s not my fault your cello’s been in the 
                        closet for two years.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Is that what you think this is about??

           Debbie’s so unnerved that she’s swerved halfway into the next 
           lane.  A car HONKS LOUDLY as she quickly readjusts.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Is that what you think this is about???

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’d better be sorry.  You’d better damned 
                        well be sorry.

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Adam, on his bed, wearing the bat-ears, hearing: 

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        My life on hold.  Why?  So he can reject every 
                        opportunity cause he thinks he’s smarter - 
                        better - whatever - I hate it.  It’s 
                        suffocating me.

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Debbie and Tom outside, talking quietly.

                                 TOM 
                        What is?

                                 DEBBIE 
                        IT!  IT!  This.. creature.  This fourth 
                        creature that’s living with us.  You.  Me.  
                        Adam.  And his.. whatever.  His ‘gift.’  Ha.  
                        More like the monster that’s sucking the air 
                        out of everything. 

           It starts to rain outside.  With thunder.  Debbie rises - enters 
           the apartment - BUMPS the coffee table.
                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        OW!  OW - damnit.
                             (kicks table)
                        Damnit.  I swear to god, this apartment is 
                        shrinking. I hate this place.

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Adam lies there, listening.  

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Look - things at work took a turn for the 
                        worse - but we’ll get back --

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        It’s not the ‘job’ - the ‘apartment.’  Christ - 
                        do you love your life?  I need air.  Get away 
                        from me.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        But you were just ou--

           Adam hears the door slam.  It’s just after midnight.  Lighting 
           illuminates the POSTERS on his wall.  Maybe it’s the mood - or 
           maybe it’s the light - but the ‘impassive’ faces of the Great 
           Ones look more severe, more harsh, more judgmental.  

           Adam rises - starts to tear them off the wall.

           EXT. BOSTON - NIGHT

           Thunder.  Lightning.  Pouring rain.

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

           Adam lies on his bed, eyes open, staring at his hands in the 
           flashing lightning.  Suddenly his eyes widen as --

           Something is growing out of his hands.  It’s a CREATURE - a bird-
           like MONSTER - which snarls and GNASHES ITS TEETH AND --

           Adam opens his eyes.  He was dreaming.  He looks through his 
           fingers at the clock - it’s 2:09 AM.  

           The door closes downstairs - that’s what must’ve awakened him.  
           He hears footsteps coming up the stairs.  Wet, heavy footsteps.

           Adam listens while his mother’s shadow passes under the door.
           LATER STILL

           Posters half-torn.  Those composers whose faces remain appear to 
           be positively scowling.  

           Adam stares at the big wooden bat-wings which hang on his wall, 
           lined in deep black shadow.  Lightning flashes outside.

           EXT. APARTMENT - BALCONY

           Adam slides the glass door open.  And steps out into the pouring 
           rain - the wooden wings strapped around his waist.

           A MOMENT LATER

           Adam is balancing, wearing the wings, on the railing.  He looks 
           down at the street two stories below.

           He turns toward it.  Lifts his feet.

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Debbie and Tom are awaked by a CRASH from outside.  BOLT UP.  

           ADAM’S BEDROOM - A SPLIT SECOND LATER

           Tom and Debbie race in and find the wings gone (just the 
           outline, in faded paint) - and the balcony door open.

                                 DEBBIE
                        ADAM!

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SAME

           Adam, scraped and bleeding - and unconscious - lies beneath the 
           shattered wings in the pounding rain.

           Neighbors and passersby are gathered as Tom and Debbie race out 
           into the street, frantically yelling, waving over the ambulance.  

           PUSH IN on them as the lights play off them.. and KEEP PUSHING 
           IN, so close it’s all just blurry shapes as we DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           A monitor on Adam’s ear, in his nose.  Bandages covering huge 
           scapes.  He opens his eyes and finds.. Tom and Debbie hovering.
                                 ADAM
                        You’re both here.

                                 TOM
                        Of course we’re both here.  

                                 ADAM
                        How long.. How long was I..

           He closes his eyes, asleep again as the DOCTOR enters.

                                 DOCTOR
                        He was lucky.  Very lucky.  There are miracles, 
                        though, especially with children.  At the 
                        moment the big issue is the concussion.  He 
                        shouldn’t play any football for a while.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t think you need to worry about that.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What do you mean “at the moment?”

                                 DOCTOR
                        Some injuries only show up after a few days.  
                        Or longer.  It’s the brain.. so..

                                 DEBBIE
                             (leans close to Adam)
                        Were you trying to fly away from me?  You 
                        could have killed yourself.  You realize that?  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Adam, sitting up in bed, plays chess with Hoyt.

                                 HOYT
                        You’re taking a long time.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry.

                                 HOYT
                        Well I have plenty of time.
                             (off Adam’s move; a counter)
                        Check.

           Adam just stares at the board.  Hoyt looks at him.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Leaving the hospital, Adam tries to open a car door; can’t.
                                 DEBBIE
                        Adam - what are you doing?  Over here.

           Debbie leads Adam to their car - which looks vaguely similar.

           AT HOME - THROUGHOUT THE EVENING:

           1.  Adam, at the piano, tries to - but can’t - read a Liszt 
           Etude.  He bangs the lid closed.  Eyes his mother, ashamed.

           2.  Tom and Adam sit at the table with Adam’s text books.  Adam 
           shakes his head - he’s not following something in it.

                                 TOM
                        You had this last week.  All you’re doing is 
                        following the line of thought..
                             (a pause)
                        Do you wanna take a break for a minute?  Come 
                        back to it later?

           3.  Adam sits in his room, lights on.  Just sits.  The impassive 
           expressions of the Composers - taped together now and a bit 
           washed out in the light - are inert, listless.  He hears the TV.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER

           Adam enters and sees his parents on the couch, arm in arm, 
           watching a sitcom.  They slide over, pat a spot for him.

                                 ADAM
                        What is this?

                                 TOM
                        This..
                             (as if introducing King Lear)
                        ..is Two and a Half Men.

           They watch for a minute - and chuckle.

                                 ADAM
                             (as if a Royal Edict)
                        I like this “Two and a Half Men.”  It is good.

           Tom laughs at Adam’s silliness.  Debbie does, too - though it’s 
           hard to know if she’s laughing because it’s actually funny, or 
           because she’s so desperate for the levity.

           LATER - ON THE COUCH

           Adam sleeps between Tom and Debbie as they watch Letterman.  
           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Tom drops Adam - clothed - in his bed.   

                                 TOM
                        Shh shh.  Stay asleep.

           Adam nods.  His dad kisses him.  Walks out, closing the door.

           Adam opens his eyes, sees his BAT-EARS, puts them on.  Listens.

                                 TOM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        This was nice. 

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Tonight.  Sitting there.  That was nice.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Debbie and Tom, cleaning up.  Debbie looks over.  Smiles.  

                                 TOM
                        Let’s do this more.

                                 DEBBIE
                             (nuzzles into him)
                        Mmmnn.

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Adam listens to the ensuing silence.  The last thing he sees 
           before he his head lolls and he falls asleep is that little 
           stuffed toy BAT - the one Jeannie made.  It blurs as we CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON JEANNIE

           Magnified - through BINOCULARS.  She’s laughing - at a cafe.  

           STREET - REVERSE ANGLE

           Adam watches as she rises, hugs a couple girlfriends, then 
           hurries across the street to catch a streetcar.

           Adam turns, runs to catch the trolley, but can’t. 
           INT. STREETCAR - VIEW THROUGH BACK WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           As it pulls away, Jeannie comes to the back - and suddenly 
           squints: does she recognize him?  Adam waves.  But the trolley’s 
           turning and she’s obscured in glare.  Adam’s left there.

           INT. NURSE/SPECIALIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Debbie with a specialist.

                                 SPECIALIST
                        I have - I believe - good news.  Please..  
                             (as Debbie sits)
                        We’ve tested his speaking and reading skills, 
                        his memory, and his sense of perception.  And 
                        we got normal levels.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What does “normal levels” mean?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Normal for his age group.  He’s even slightly 
                        above average, especially in his logical 
                        thinking.

                                 DEBBIE
                        And the IQ test..?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Yes?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Did you do..?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        Well, to be honest, these tests are 
                        irrelevant.  But if you really want to know, 
                        it’s around 120.

                                 DEBBIE
                        120?  It used to be literally off the charts.  
                        How is that possible?

                                 SPECIALIST
                        It’s hard to say.  Even for those of us in the 
                        field, the brain is still a crazy mystery.  No 
                        one knows where it comes from - or where it 
                        goes, frankly.

           Debbie nods, distant.  
                                 SPECIALIST (CONT’D)
                        Um.. Forgive me.. but I don’t understand your 
                        disappointment.  You have a healthy, normal 
                        child.  I have to give far worse news to a lot 
                        of parents.

           Debbie really wants to be consoled by this.  

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Adam - in the waiting area - looks up as Debbie steps out and 
           keeps walking.  Adam rises, catches up to her.

                                 ADAM
                        Is it good?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh - it’s great.  Really.  Super great - um - 
                        can you excuse me one second?

           As if someone had suddenly cut all the oxygen in the hospital, 
           Debbie abruptly turns and pushes through a side door and is - 

           EXT. OUTSIDE INNARDS OF THE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           - in that space no one ever enters:  that place between 
           buildings nestled within the city block that’s all air 
           conditioning ducts and fire escapes and pigeon roosts.

           Blanched in sunlight, Debbie just breathes as the door closes 
           and she’s alone, awash in machine noise and muffled city sounds.  

           On her face:  many things - not the least of which is shame, 
           rooted in her confusion as to why she’s not jumping for joy.

           There’s a knock from the other side.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Mom?

           Debbie turns, but there’s no door handle on this side.  She 
           hesitates, putting off for as long as possible the moment of 
           reentry.. then knocks lightly.  It opens.  She revs up a smile.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Well that sure was a wrong turn!

           And she starts to pull herself back in.
           INT. PUBLIC JR. HIGH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Kids mess around, as kids will do.  Adam enters with a teacher.

                                 TEACHER
                        Listen up - people - silence, please!  This is 
                        Adam.  He’s changed schools, and he’s with us 
                        now.  Adam, you can sit by Evan. 

           Adam sits.  Evan, in a hoodie, offers up a ‘fist-bump.’

                                 EVAN
                        Hi, Adam, what’s up?
                             (re Adam’s confusion about his fist)
                        Like this.  Loosen up.  Now make a fist.  Yeah 
                        yeah - right.  And again.

           Adam does it, nods, turns to his book:  INTRO TO PRE-ALGEBRA.  

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - RECESS

           Adam moves through the playground.  Just watching.. floating..

           Adam spots Evan playing basketball with other kids.  Evan 
           motions for Adam to join and passes him the ball.  But when Adam 
           gets it he dribbles with two hands - and not even that well. 

           A kid grabs the ball back and the game continues up the court 
           without Adam, who just stands there as the game goes on.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           A SCHOOL BUS drops a bunch of kids, including Adam, on a corner. 

                                 EVAN
                        ..well, by ‘going out’ he means, basically, 
                        she ‘friended’ him.
                             (to Adam)
                        Rack City?

           Adam has no idea what Evan’s referring to.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  Certainly.

           ‘RACK CITY’ SKATE PARK - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam sits while Evan skids up to him, flips the board up.

                                 EVAN
                        Wanna try?  It’s easy.
           A MOMENT LATER

           Adam - motionless - rides down a ramp, across the pavement, and 
           up another ramp.  The kids are yelling at him:

                                 EVAN/OTHER KIDS
                        Stop!!/TURN IT!/You gotta stop or turn!

           He gets halfway up the ramp.. but remains motionless, and--

           INT. APARTMENT - LOBBY - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam hobbles - bruised and a bit bloodied - as Evan opens the 
           door for him.  His pants are ripped; he’s covered in scrapes.

                                 EVAN
                        Dude.  That was sweet.  You were all..

           Evan mimes a gnarly crash.  Adam nods, not displeased.  Not 
           displeased at all.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Later.

                                 ADAM
                        Okay.  Later.

           They do the fist bump.  Initiated by Adam.

           INT. APARTMENT - LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Adam gets the mail.  Hobbles to the elevator.

           INT. TOM AND DEBBIE’S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

           Debbie’s doing their taxes - not pretty.  Adam enters, hands her 
           some mail:  “Massachusetts State Realty Board Qualifying Exam - 
           RESULTS.”  She notices him limping to the kitchen.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You okay?

                                 ADAM
                        Skateboard accident.

           Adam looks back.  A pause.. Is she gonna say anything?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Grab me a water, will you?

           Adam smiles, continues into the kitchen.
           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Adam plays piano - but not well.  Debbie is beside him.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Play the run, and take your time.  C sharp.. 
                        then C again.. Then B.. okay?

           He follows.. measured.  Stumbling a bit.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        C sharp!  Sharp.
                             (then)
                        Sorry.

           He gets up, comes behind her, puts his arms around her.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ADAM
                             (notices realty exam results)
                        You never opened that.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh.  Right.

           She opens it.  

                                 ADAM
                        Is it good?

           Debbie nods, emotionless.  Then turns to him.. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Hey, Ad.. Hey - would you like to..

           INT. SYMPHONY HALL - NIGHT

           The Boston Symphony plays Beethoven’s 6th - conducted by Paul 
           Alan Smith.  Smith is animated - engaged - masterful.  

           IN THE AUDIENCE

           Are Debbie, Tom and Adam.  Watching, listening.
           BACKSTAGE - AFTER THE SHOW

           Smith’s dressing room door opens - he beams.

                                 SMITH
                        Adam!
                             (feigning disappointment)
                        ..and parents.

           He laughs.  High-fives Adam, then hugs Debbie.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful as ever.
                             (turns)
                        You must be the engineer.  Wait --Tom?

           Tom nods - shakes.  There’s an instant wariness between the two 
           men - an instinctual thing.  Nothing too pronounced.  

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Adam.  Wanna show you something.  Just us.

           SMITH’S DRESSING ROOM

           He closes the door.  Picks up two basketball tickets.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You won’t believe this, but Kevin Garnett is a 
                        huge classical music fan.  Problem is.. I am 
                        in Detroit on Tuesday.  Know anyone who can 
                        use these?

                                 ADAM
                        My grampa loves the Celtics.

                                 SMITH
                             (hands them to Adam)
                        Well there you go.  

                                 ADAM
                        ..Thank you.

                                 SMITH
                        You’re welcome.  And call me - I want to hear 
                        every single direction the basketballers run 
                        around in.  Promise?
                             (off Adam’s nod)
                        And - oh - Adam.
                             (kneels right in front of him)
                        There’s no such thing as what you’re looking 
                        for.
                                 ADAM
                        I don’t understand.

           Smith waves a knowing finger at him - as if he knows Adam better 
           than Adam knows himself.

           For reasons that are unclear to us, this seems to set Adam back 
           on his heels.  Especially when --

           Smith glances back at Adam and winks - briefly - before wheeling 
           back into the hall, where he addresses Tom and Debbie.  

                                 SMITH
                        You coming to the reception?  It’s a meet and 
                        greet - for the patrons.  Free drinks.

                                 TOM
                        We’re not exactly patrons--

                                 SMITH
                             (waves them off)
                        Oh, please.

           Finally Adam starts in toward the hall as Tom’s phone rings - 
           startling Adam.  Tom looks at it.  Picks up as we cut to:

           INT. CAR - DRIVING

           Adam in back, half-asleep.  Debbie’s energized; Tom’s not.

                                 DEBBIE
                        You know why he’s going to Detroit?  To meet 
                        Eminem.  He had an idea to do something with 
                        Eminem, and now he’s doing something with 
                        Eminem.  One minute it was in his brain - and 
                        now - poof - it’s in the world.  Eminem!  Hey - 
                        do you think they have a special Directory 
                        Assistance for celebrities?  Like if one famous 
                        person wants to reach another, they have a 
                        special info line only they can use?  Like four 
                        and a half one one?  Hello?  Earth to Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Dad called.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh no..

                                 TOM
                        He needs another six thousand.  His roof guy 
                        says they can’t just patch.
                                 DEBBIE
                        What’d you tell him?

                                 TOM
                        I told him the truth.  I don’t have it.  I 
                        mean - what am I supposed to do?

           Adam’s eyes are semi-closed; but he’s listening to everything.

           INT. TD GARDEN ARENA - NIGHT

           Adam and Hoyt - courtside - at a Celtics game.  Hoyt tries to 
           actually touch a couple of the players as they race past.

                                 HOYT
                        Unbelievable.  Un-friggin-believable.  Adam - 
                        I used to tell you the best things in life, 
                        money can’t buy.  And you know what?  I had no 
                        idea what I was talking about.
                             (leaps to his feet; to the ref)
                        That was horseshit!  He was already out of 
                        bounds!  
                             (off the ref’s look)
                        Because I’m standing closer than you are!  If 
                        you can believe that!

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Thelonious Monk plays as Adam rides shotgun, no seat-belt.  

                                 HOYT
                        ..so while my platoon’s dropping face first 
                        into the rice fields, I’m in the infirmary 
                        getting penicillin shot into my ass.  What was 
                        the point?  Oh - point being:  the clap 
                        literally saved my life. ..Wait.  That wasn’t 
                        the point.  What was I getting at?

                                 ADAM
                        Relationships.

                                 HOYT
                        Right!  The thrill of the chase!  If you miss 
                        her, go talk to her.  It took me ten years to 
                        get your grandmother to marry me.

                                 ADAM
                        Are you glad?

                                 HOYT
                        It was a horrible hell, but I never was 
                        happier.
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOYT (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        Listen, as I think about it.. maybe that clap 
                        story we best keep between--

                                 ADAM
                             (ahead of him)
                        Yeah yeah.

           Adam notices - but Hoyt doesn’t - that Hoyt’s just driven 
           through a red light. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Adam enters, hears the “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” song in another room.  

           INT. HIS PARENTS’ BEDROOM 

           Debbie’s in bed watching a DVD as Adam enters, comes over. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Hey.

           Adam watches a moment:  it’s his 5th birthday - the part where 
           Adam played “Happy Birthday” back to everyone’s astonishment.  

                                 ADAM
                        Where’s Dad?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Work thing.  

                                 ADAM
                        Is work bad?

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s.. work.  How was the game?

                                 ADAM
                        Grampa swore a lot and yelled at everybody.  
                        Rajon Rondo actually told him to shut up.  It 
                        was pretty funny.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Hey - c’mere.   
                             (she hugs him)
                        Brush your teeth - I’ll be in in a minute.

           DEBBIE

           Watches him go.  Then rewinds and un-pauses the DVD and watches 
           that moment come to life again.  And then again.
           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Adam in bed as Debbie kisses him.  Looks at him sleeping.  She 
           finally steps out.  Closes the door.  And Adam opens his eyes.

           A MOMENT LATER, Adam hears something he hasn’t heard in years:  

           From downstairs, it’s the CELLO LINE from Suite #2 in D Minor by 
           JS Bach.  Soft, muted.  And very tentative.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Debbie is playing - practicing - but haltingly.  She’s rusty.  
           And she feels it.  She plays a bit more.. Then stops.  Sags.  

                                 ADAM’S VOICE
                        That sounded nice.

           She turns.  Adam is standing on the stairs.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh - sorry - is it keeping you up?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  But in a good way.  Seriously.  Can you 
                        keep going?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Really?
                             (off Adam’s nod)
                        Cause I saw an ad - have you heard of the 
                        Chesterfield Quartet?
                             (as Adam shakes his head)
                        Me either.  But they work a lot, and they pay - 
                        not much, but, still.. anyway.  You sure it’s 
                        not..?

           He nods again.  She picks up the bow.  INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER (1:15 A.M.)

           Adam, in bed, bat-ears on, listening to Debbie play.  What she 
           lacks in practice she makes up for in soul and feeling.  

           Suddenly it stops as Adam hears a door open and then close.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Tom trudges through the semi-darkness.  Makes a (pre-occupied) 
           nod to the cello - an acknowledgement of its return.
                                 TOM
                        Wow - hey.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Was it bad?

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - SAME

           In his bed, Adam listens through the bat-ears:

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Worse.  Results come out a week from Monday.  
                        At noon.  It’s gonna be ugly. 

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        How ugly?

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Fugly ugly.  Gentronics stock’s gonna plummet 
                        like the Hindenburg.  Remember when we thought 
                        it was such a good idea to take shares in the 
                        company in lieu of pay?  Ha.  Want some?

           Adam hears ice clink - then liquor poured into a glass..

                                 TOM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you just loooooove being a grown up?

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Daylight, silence.  The family eats breakfast.  Finally:

                                 ADAM
                        How’s work?

                                 TOM
                        What?  Fine.  

           Adam clears his plate, crosses to the kitchen - listening to:  

                                 DEBBIE
                        You know I got an actual client--

                                 TOM
                        Hey..

                                 DEBBIE
                        --but before you get too excited:  it’s your 
                        father.

           Adam moves to the doorway where he can hear better.
                                 TOM
                        Really?  He’s gonna.. Really?  When did --

                                 DEBBIE
                        We put the sign up yesterday.  I was gonna 
                        tell you last night, but..  

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.. thanks.  Wow.

                                 DEBBIE
                        He’s not what I’d call a ‘motivated seller,’ 
                        but I think he’s a realist..  
                             (aware of Adam - turns)
                        Hey.  School.  

           EXT. JR. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           Kids exit the bus.  Adam - in a ‘hoodie’ not dissimilar to the 
           one Evan was wearing a while ago (yet not quite pulling it off 
           with the ease that Evan does) - goes in a different direction.

                                 EVAN
                        You coming?

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll be back..

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY

           Adam turns a corner.  Goes down into the subway.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Adam rides out of the city, in his hoodie and shades.

           EXT. HOYT’S ROAD - DAY

           Adam walks toward Hoyt’s driveway - slows as he sees a FOR SALE 
           SIGN with “DEB DAVIS” as the listing agent.  

           EXT. HOYT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Hoyt is sanding the potting shed, prepping it to paint.

                                 ADAM
                        Hi, Grampa.  May I use your computer?
                                 HOYT
                        For?

                                 ADAM
                        World of Warcraft.

           Hoyt shrugs - be my guest - and gestures ‘go on in.’ 

           INT. HOYT’S KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

           Adam awakens the computer.  But the screen requires a PASSCODE.

                                 ADAM
                        Grampa!

                                 HOYT (O.S.)
                        “YASTRZEMSKI 1967.”

           Adam enters the code, then looks out the window.. Sees that Hoyt 
           is still sanding the shed.  Now..

           Adam takes a NOTEBOOK out of his backpack.  Lays it on the desk.

           It’s hard to know exactly what it is - but we see the word 
           “GENTRONICS” and a lot of very complicated charts and graphs.

           Then.. on screen, Adam searches through Hoyt’s files and finds 
           something.  Opens it.  It also requires a passcode.  Adam types 
           in “YASTRZEMSKI1967.”  And..

           ..gains access, just as Hoyt - having forgotten something - is 
           coming back inside.  Adam quickly slaps the keyboard and -

           As Hoyt passes, Adam is playing WORLD OF WARCRAFT.  

           Hoyt grabs a rag and some masking tape off the counter - then 
           turns, exits again.  And the minute the door closes..

           Adam returns to the other screen.  And now we see it clearly:

           It’s Hoyt’s bank account.

           Adam leans over, re-opens his notebook and refers to some of the 
           hand-written figures and very complex formulas..

           ..and - once more checking over his shoulder - Adam begins 
           typing on the keyboard.. for a while.  He enters some figures.  
           Waits.  Enters some more.  Waits again.. 

           ..then nods, closes the page, then clears the ‘history.’  
           OUTSIDE - AT THE POTTING SHED - HOYT

           Is laying down primer with a paint brush when he hears something 
           that makes him stop in his tracks.  It’s:

           Chopin’s Piano Sonata #2, coming from inside his house.

           Still holding his brush, he turns and slowly crosses the gravel 
           driveway toward the house.  He mounts the stoop and cautiously 
           creaks the door open.  Through the crack, he sees:

           Adam sitting behind the piano, his hands obscured from view.

           Hoyt slowly takes another step - so he can see Adam’s hands.. 

           ..which are on his lap.  In Adam’s right hand is the remote 
           control for the stereo.  Adam raises it, pauses the music.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes?

                                 HOYT
                        Sorry.  I thought.. Sorry.

           Adam nods.  As does Hoyt - who backs up.  Adam unpauses the 
           remote and the music resumes as Hoyt exits.

           Through the window we see Hoyt return to the potting shed as..  

           The piece comes to a natural break between movements.  And Adam 
           hits ‘pause.’  Then sets down the remote.  

           And turns toward the piano.  Raises his hands..  

           ..and plays the second movement of the Chopin sonata - 
           flawlessly, fluidly - on his own.  

           His eyes close and his body loosens as he plays.  And plays.

           OUTSIDE - SAME

           Hoyt slows, but never stops painting.  Finally this movement 
           comes to an end.  And there’s another beat of silence.

           Then the third movement begins and..  

           The door opens, as Adam, hoodie on and backpack slung over his 
           shoulder, scuttles down the stoop and continues toward the road.

                                 ADAM
                        Thanks.
                                 HOYT
                        You bet.

           Chopin continues from inside as Hoyt watches Adam walk all the 
           way down the driveway and out to the road, never looking back.

           INT. TRAIN - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Adam rides toward the city, hoodie covering most of his face.

           INT. JR. HIGH CLASSROOM - EARLY AFTERNOON

           A teacher talks as Adam - late - hurries toward his seat.

                                 JR HIGH TEACHER
                        Someone else?  Square root of 144?  Who knows 
                        what the square root of 144 is?
                             (as Adam raises his hand)
                        Okay - Adam - who is apparently late because 
                        he was out finding the answer.

                                 ADAM
                        14?

                                 JR HIGH TEACHER
                        No.  12.  The square root of 144 is 12.  We 
                        all know what 12 squared is - it’s 12 times 
                        12.. so the square root..

           Adam slides into his seat.  Takes a deep, deep breath..

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - AFTER SCHOOL

           SIX 12 AND 13 YEAR OLDS on skateboards, moving fast.  Evan is 
           5th.  The last in line - by a lot - is Adam.   

           The band veers around a corner.  Stay with Evan - who gets a 
           funny feeling and turns - then hurries off his board as..  

                                 EVAN
                        Whoa!  Dude - you okay?

           Back at the corner, Adam extracts himself from a hedge.  Picking 
           leaves from his shirt, he rises with a thumbs-up, then leaps 
           onto his board and they hurry to catch up with the others.

           INT. MALL - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Boards in hand, the gaggle of 6 enter “YE OLDE ARCADE SHOPPE” - 
           a vintage video arcade.  
                                 LEADER (DEREK)
                        Slurpees.  Low buys high.

                                 EVAN
                             (to Adam)
                        Lowest score has to pay for highest score’s 
                        Slurpee.  

           INT. YE OLDE ARCADE SHOPPE

           Space Invaders, PacMan, even Pong.  Derek plays vintage TETRIS.  
           Adam watches over Derek’s shoulder as Derek finishes, proud. 

                                 DEREK
                        8550.  I’m ready for my free Slurpee.  Who’s 
                        left?  Who wants to get beasted?

           Fingers point to Adam as the only one who hasn’t gone.  

                                 ADAM
                        I’m not.. I haven’t done this before.

                                 DEREK
                        Good.  Double or nothing.  Adding Quizno’s.

           Adam nods, sits.  Inserts money.  And the game begins.  Bricks 
           drop - and Adam places them, spacially, where he wants them. 

           Time passes.  And Adam’s at 4500.. And very focussed.  No one’s 
           really paying all that much attention.

           More time.  A few are watching as Adam’s score passes 7500.  By 
           8000 everyone’s watching.  By 8500 everyone’s - including 
           Derek’s - jaw has dropped.  Adam hits 8530, 40.. 50.

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        What?  Really?

           More time passes:  And people are speechless as Adam’s now at 
           9500... and rising.  Strangers are watching as Adam passes 
           12500.  Employees now, too, as he crosses 16000.  

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        Okay this is bullshit.  This dude’s a liar.

           Adam looks up - causing him to miss a brick - and his game ends.

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        You’ve totally done this before.
                             (pause)
                        Dude’s a shark!  We got card-sharked!  Fess 
                        up.  Truth time.  What’s up with that?
           Derek just glares at Adam.  Finally, Adam “relents” and nods.  
           Derek stares a moment, then breaks into a smile and fake “bows.”

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        This man deserves one hundred percent free 
                        Slurpification.

                                 ADAM
                        And --

                                 DEREK
                        Slurpification, with additional Quiznos-osity.

           INT. MALL - QUIZNO’S - A MOMENT LATER

           All 6 around a table, drinking Slurpees and eating Quizno’s.

                                 DEREK
                        Over the bra or under the bra?

                                 EVAN
                        Under.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Bullshit!/No Way!/I know her - you’re lying!

                                 DEREK
                        What about other dude?  Minnesota Fats-
                        friggin’-Tetris-Beastie-dude?

                                 ADAM
                        Me?  Um.. You know, mostly over the bra.  
                        Well, under first, then she let me go over.  
                        It was awesome.

                                 DEREK
                        Are you serious?

           Adam - sensing (and covering for) his mistake - rolls his eyes.

                                 ADAM
                        Of course I’m not serious.  Jesus.  Anyways, 
                        my girlfriend and me have a ‘don’t ask don’t 
                        tell’ policy regarding third parties.

           Adam returns to his Slurpee, hoping this ends things cleanly.

           INT. VINYL FETISH RECORD SHOP - AFTERNOON

           Jeannie, behind the register, hands a bag to a customer.
                                 JEANNIE
                        Here you go, ma’am.  Thank you.
                             (turns)
                        Next customer?

           She is handed something wrapped in paper.  She looks at it, 
           looks at the person who handed it to her (Adam, now in a hoodie 
           and beanie), then unwraps.. the little stuffed BAT.  

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Wait.. Oh my god!  Adam!  Hang on.  Mike?

           She signals another employee, then comes around, hugs Adam.

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god.  Look at you.  You’re like a little 
                        man.  I totally heard about your.. thing.  Your 
                        accident.  Yeah, it’s like - you’d think you 
                        would have died, the way they were talking about 
                        it.  Does it suck?  

                                 ADAM
                        It’s okay.  How are you?

                                 JEANNIE
                        Me?  Whatever, my parents are on me all the 
                        time.  My year off after high school kinda 
                        became three.. 

                                 ADAM
                        You play guitar now.

                                 JEANNIE
                        I do - kind of.  How do you know about that?  
                        Have you been stalking me?
                             (off Adam’s nod)
                        That was you the other day - behind the train-
                        thingy!  I love that!  I love that I have a 
                        stalker!

                                 JEANNIE’S BOSS
                             (passes, indicates “you’re at work”)
                        Jeannie?

                                 JEANNIE
                        Dude, I’m with my stalker.

           She grabs Adam’s CD’s, crosses to the register.

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Here, I’ll ring you up..  
                             (eyeing the CD’s)
                        Really?  Ke$ha?  Katie Perry?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay - this, to me, is the real tragedy of the 
                        accident.  This, and the lame beanie.

                                 ADAM
                        Can I come by again?

                                 JEANNIE
                        It’s a store.  They let anyone in.  Besides - 
                        stalkers don’t ask permission.  Otherwise 
                        they’re called “friends.”

           EXT. STREETS - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam walks through the city - a spring in his step.  He passes 
           an industrial loft complex advertising spaces for lease, slows..

           INT. INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - A MOMENT LATER

           Adam rides up the metal elevator with a (very wary) BUILDING 
           MANAGER - a guy in his early 20’s who’d rather be elsewhere.  

           INDUSTRIAL HALLWAY

           Adam’s led down the cement/metal/exposed duct hallway to a door.  

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        So.. okay.. What is your girlfriend’s band’s 
                        name?

                                 ADAM
                        Oh.  Yes.  Um.. Echolocation Ensemble.

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        “Echolocation Ensemble?”
                             (warily inserts key)
                        Listen - if this isn’t serious, I got like a 
                        lot of..

                                 ADAM
                        It is.  This is very serious.

           INT. HUGE LOFT SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           Adam steps into this open, empty loft in the middle of downtown.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  I believe this will be sufficient 
                        rehearsal space.  How much?
                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Year lease minimum, six thousand a month,
                        and a two thousand a month building fee.

                                 ADAM
                        Dollars?

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Yes.  Dollars.

                                 ADAM
                        May I just sit in here for a moment?

           The guy sags - there went a half hour of his life.

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        I have to show another unit - I’m coming back 
                        to get you after that.  By the way?  Your 
                        girlfriend’s band name?  No offense - but it’s 
                        retarded.

           A HALF HOUR LATER

           The Manager lets other prospective clients out the front, turns.

           INT. HUGE LOFT SPACE - SAME

           On the floor in the middle of the room, Adam leans against a 
           post, his computer open.  

           CLOSER:  Adam is on a BRITISH WEBPAGE.  We don’t see too much - 
           just the words “AMOUNT OF BET IN POUNDS STERLING.”

           Adam types in the number 1.  Then a 0.  Then four more.  And he 
           hits “enter.”  A beat.  Then the screen reads:

           “Please confirm your wager of 100,000 BRITISH POUNDS.”  

           Adam hits confirm -- then suddenly slams his screen closed as-

           The Building Manager pushes the creaking door open..

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Hope that wasn’t porn.

           INT. INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - A MOMENT LATER

           Riding down.  After a moment of silence.

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Do your parents know you’re here?
                                 ADAM
                        Am I gonna get in trouble?

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Am I?

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATER 

           Adam swoops at his front door and picks up a PACKAGE wrapped in 
           a Vinyl Fetish bag with a note that says:  “YOU MUST LISTEN TO 
           ALL OF THESE IN ORDER BUT CALL ME FIRST.”

           INT. APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           PILES OF CDS (some factory, others burned) with post-its on 
           them.  Adam is on the phone.

           INTERCUT with JEANNIE, AT WORK, also on the phone.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Then sixth:  Eels, “Electro-Shock Blues.”  I 
                        love them.  Love. 

           Adam writes #6 on a post-it, puts it on the Eels record.

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Number seven.. If you’ve never heard Brian 
                        Wilson’s Smile..

           INT. APARTMENT - LATE AT NIGHT

           Adam lies on the floor listening to The Eels.

           INT. HIGH RISE CONDO - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam twirls at the counter-stool of this empty high-rise condo 
           while Debbie shows a YOUNG COUPLE through the space.

                                 DEBBIE
                        ..as you see on the set-up, the den opens up 
                        to incredible light.

                                 HUSBAND
                             (to wife)
                        What about this - for the piano?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh, which of you is the musician?
           Adam watches as the couple makes a vague noncommittal gesture - 
           clearly not interested in getting personal with some broker.  

           We HEAR SOLO CELLO and cut to:

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - LATER IN THE NIGHT

           Adam, on his bed, listening to Debbie play cello downstairs.  
           It’s the haunting cello line from Dvorak’s Quartet in F, Op 96.

           INT. TOM’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Tom does the same thing from the couch in his den.  Eyes wide 
           open, he stares glassy-eyed, as his wife plays in the next room.  

           Then Debbie’s solo line is overlapped by THREE OTHER PARTS (two 
           violins and a viola) and we CUT TO:

           INT. SMALL MUSIC ROOM - DAY

           In a space we’ve never seen, Debbie plays, intense, with three 
           others.  They finish.  Debbie looks up, anticipatory.  As:

           The First Violinist - an older man - glances at the others, then 
           turns to Debbie.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Good.  That was good.  So.. what happened to 
                        the..
                             (checking a resume)
                        ‘Worchester String Ensemble?’

                                 DEBBIE
                        Our second violinist’s husband was transferred 
                        a couple years ago.. And I think it kinda.. 
                        You know, I don’t have to tell you what the 
                        market for string quartets is..

           The others nod - some agreement there. 

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        You mentioned on the phone another piece - the 
                        Razoumofsky thing.  Do you still..?  

                                 WOMAN
                        I think we’re good.  
           A MOMENT LATER

           Debbie lugs her cello into the WAITING ROOM - where THREE OTHER 
           CELLISTS are sitting.  The Man comes out, reads from a list:

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Elizabeth?

           Another cellist rises, revealing ADAM, waiting.  

                                 ADAM
                        You sounded great.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yeah - well - thanks, but.. I could tell two 
                        measures in that it wasn’t gonna..

           Debbie turns - but Adam’s not in the room.  He is, instead:

           BACK IN THE SMALL MUSIC ROOM - SAME

           Adam, petulant, chastises the Older Man and the two others.

                                 ADAM
                        Who are you anyways?  What’s the “Chesterfield 
                        Quartet?”  If you were any good why haven’t I 
                        heard of you?  Cause you know why?  You’re 
                        actually not good. 
                             (to the Older Man)
                        You in particular.  Your phrasing is as trite 
                        as it is old fash--

           The door suddenly swings open -

                                 DEBBIE
                        Adam!
                             (rushes in, grabs his arm)
                        I’m sorry.  I’m so so sorry.

           INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LATER 

           Elevator dings, Adam and Debbie head to the door.  Deb laughs.

                                 DEBBIE
                        “If you were any good why haven’t I heard of 
                        you!?”  I swear to god I if actually had a 
                        shot at it I’d’ve been pissed. 
                                 ADAM
                        I read a thing where they said to truly 
                        recognize rarified talent of a specific level 
                        you need to actually possess the very same 
                        qualities of that which you are judging.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        That’s sweet.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s true.  

           Debbie bends, picks up another PACKAGE in a Vinyl Fetish bag. 

                                 DEBBIE
                             (reads)
                        “Listen in order.  No exceptions.”
                             (hands it to him)
                        More from Jeannie, I think.

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Adam listens to a CD from Jeannie.  But his focus is on..

           The basketball ticket stub.  Which contains a phone number.  He 
           hesitates... and then dials.  A pause... then..

                                 ADAM
                        This is Adam Davis.

           And now we INTERCUT Adam in his room at night with:

           EXT. BUDAPEST, HUNGARY - DAY (IN EUROPE)

           Paul Alan Smith strolls the banks of the Danube.

                                 SMITH
                        I’m sorry - is this truthful Thomas Adam Davis 
                        or little lying man Thomas Adam Davis?  

                                 ADAM
                        Where are you?  Are you still in Detroit?

                                 SMITH
                        Was.  Till I heard this somewhat outre hard-to-
                        say-if-it’s-techno-inspired Hungarian pseudo-
                        retro string-punk ensem-blay.  You’d like them.  
                        It’s as if Bela Bartok sat in with Radiohead on 
                        a record produced by Brian Eno and, I dunno, Dr. 
                        Dre.  My Detroit friend played them for me 
                        online.. when?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SMITH (CONT'D)
                        Yesterday at dinner - and now - presto - I’m 
                        here, enjoying a delicious breakfast burger in 
                        Budapest.  And Monday, if all goes well, they’ll 
                        be there.  I LOVE this century almost as much as 
                        I love all the others.  Where are you? 

                                 ADAM
                        Boston.   

                                 SMITH
                        No - I mean in your ever-evolving narrative?

                                 ADAM
                        I want to see you.

                                 SMITH
                        Do you have a confession for me?

                                 ADAM
                        I want you to help my mother.

                                 SMITH
                        Do what?

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll tell you in person.

                                 SMITH
                        Come to symphony hall on the 14th after school.  
                        You still do go to school, do you not?

           EXT. JR. HIGH SCHOOL - RECESS - DAY

           Kids run around, play.  Evan looks around - no Adam.   

           INT. VINYL FETISH RECORDS - DAY

           Jeannie, working.  Adam drops a pile of CD’s in front of her.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        Radiohead - excellent, I approve.  You need to 
                        listen to track four on Kid A.  “How to 
                        Disappear Completely.”  It was my theme song 
                        for like all of high school
                             (next CD)
                        Dr. Dre.  Ooh, old school.  

                                 ADAM
                        Perhaps you could direct me to the works of 
                        Brian Eno?
                                 JEANNIE
                        Yes - “perchance I shall.”  “Indubitably, 
                        indeed.”

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 JEANNIE
                        You’re hilarious.  Little Man.  This way.

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY - SERIES OF SHOTS

           1.  Adam walks, alone, through the streets of Boston.  He’s 
           listening to BARTOK on his iPod.

           2. ECU’S:  Adam, in a public square, watches businessmen through 
           his binoculars.  He’s listening to DRE.   

           3. Adam, by the River, watches a family of ducks.  Now he’s 
           listening to Radiohead’s haunting “HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY.”  

                                 RADIOHEAD
                        THAT THERE, THAT’S NOT ME
                        I GO WHERE I PLEASE
                        I WALK THOUGH WALLS
                        I FLOAT DOWN THE LIFFEY
                        I’M NOT HERE
                        THIS ISN’T HAPPENING

           INT. BUILDING MANAGER’S OFFICE - INDUSTRIAL LOFT SPACE

           The BUILDING MANAGER looks up.  Sees Adam in the doorway.

                                 ADAM
                        May I sit in the space again?

           INT. HUGE EMPTY LOFT SPACE - DAY

           Adam, on the floor against the wall, still listening to 
           Radiohead.  He looks at his watch: 12.  He opens his computer.  

           A MOMENT LATER

           He is watching his screen closely.  An account of some kind.  A 
           lot of numbers.  He’s waiting.  Keeps checking the clock.

           It’s well after noon.  He checks his screen again.  Then the 
           clock.  Then the screen.  And then suddenly..

           The numbers on his screen start to change.  
           Adam just watches.. eyes widening as we cut to:

           A BEAUTIFUL PIANO

           In the window of a piano store.  And Adam’s reflection looking 
           in.  He crosses to the door.

           INT. PIANO STORE - A MOMENT LATER

           A SALESPERSON hears ELABORATE RAGTIME, moves to where--

           Adam sits at a PLAYER PIANO.  He nods to a nearby GRAND PIANO.

                                 ADAM
                        How much for the Boesendorfer?

                                 SALESPERSON
                             (chuckles)
                        Way more than mommy or daddy can afford.

           Adam nods.  Continues to watch the keys play themselves as - 

           EXTREME CLOSE UPS - THROUGH BINOCULARS

           People, seen in an office, move about morbidly - yet with a kind 
           of comic air, as if there’s some weird gallows party happening.

           EXT. BOSTON - AFTERNOON - SAME

           Adam is standing across from the ‘GENTRONICS’ building.  After a 
           moment he lowers the binocs and starts across the street.

           INT. TOM’S OFFICE - SAME

           Tom - weary - is on the phone..

                                 TOM
                        Right.. Yeah.. Okay..

           He hangs up.  Sees Adam seated across from him.

                                 ADAM
                        Hi Tom.  Bad time?

                                 TOM
                        You mean for you to be here?  On in terms of 
                        Life In General?  Aren’t you supposed to be in 
                        school?
           Suddenly NICK appears in the doorway - quite tipsy.  He has a 
           bottle of Moet and two paper cups.  He puts one by Tom.

                                 NICK
                        I’m not blaming your Bat-Ear.  Do I look like 
                        I’m blaming your Bat-Ear?  If I was, why would 
                        I be splitting this very expensive champagne 
                        that’s been in my desk since I think just 
                        after we went public? 
                             (just now noticing Adam)
                        --Oh, it’s the genius.  Ex-genius.  Sorry.  
                        For a while we thought your father was the 
                        genius.  Ooopsie, guess not.  What do they 
                        call you now?

                                 ADAM
                        Adam.

                                 NICK
                        You know what, Adam, be good to your father, 
                        be good to this man here because you know what 
                        I did?  I promised my own father that we could 
                        save all this.  Never give your word based 
                        only on hope.  That’s my advice to you, Adam, 
                        son of Tom, grandson of whatever his name is.

                                 ADAM
                        Hoyt.

                                 NICK
                        Hoyt, who is in fact grandson of someone, 
                        etcetera, all the way back to the Birth of Man 
                        - which weirdly seems to make us all related - 
                        you aren’t drinking your cup - which I will 
                        take and bring to HR - well, what’s left of 
                        HR.  More like “R.”  Resources, sans Humans.

           And Nick is gone.  

                                 TOM
                        He’s a bit drunk.

                                 ADAM
                             (’no shit’)
                        Really?

           Tom smiles.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Is this..
                                 TOM
                        ..how adults always behave when kids aren’t 
                        around?  Absolutely.  This is a typical day.  
                        Very very typical.

           Tom’s phone rings.  He eyes the caller ID, realizes something.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god - oh no - he had half his pension in 
                        stock.  He’s gonna blame me for this.  Hold on.
                             (picks up phone)
                        Dad - it’ll be okay - we’ll figure something 
                        out..

           EXT. HOYT’S YARD - SAME

           We now INTERCUT Tom with Hoyt, on his cordless phone, paces.  

                                 HOYT
                        So what do I tell my money guy?  

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know.  What’d he tell you?

                                 HOYT
                        That there was a drastic change in my balance, 
                        but he didn’t want to leave it on voice mail.  
                        I avoided calling him back so as to prolong 
                        what I’m sure will be a certain heart attack.  

                                 TOM
                        Okay, first, don’t panic..  

                                 HOYT
                        Does that ever work?  Does asking people not 
                        to panic ever get them-- ?

                                 TOM
                             (sharp)
                        Dad - Jesus - cut me some --
                             (pauses; resets)
                        Just let me talk to our analysts - we’re 
                        trying to get a read on where the bottom 
                        actually is.  I’ll get back to you.  Can you 
                        sit tight?  Till I do?  --Dad?

                                 HOYT
                        I’m nodding.  Sorry.

                                 TOM
                        Just hold tight - I’ll call you back.
           Hoyt hangs up.  We’re back with Adam and Tom, in the office.  
           Tom exhales.  Huge.  Rugs his eyes with his palms.  

                                 ADAM
                        Can I go over there?

                                 TOM
                        School night.  

                                 ADAM
                        Can I go on the weekend?

           Tom, distracted by more stuff flashing on his computer, nods.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY - SATURDAY

           Adam rides the train, listening to Radiohead again.

           EXT. HOYT’S ROAD - SAME

           Adam walks up the road to Hoyt’s property - sees that the FOR 
           SALE SIGN is no longer there.  He turns up the driveway, 
           hearing, as he gets closer to the house, a strange WHIRRING 
           SOUND.  As he approaches the garage, his eyes widen as he sees:

           INT. HOYT’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A small version of one of those AIRPLANE FLIGHT SIMULATORS 
           gyrating noisily.  His mouth drops.

                                 ADAM
                        Grampa?!  HEY GRAMPA!

           Adam runs to it as it grinds to a stop.  Hoyt’s voice echoes:

                                 HOYT (O.S.)
                        Adam?  Hang on, hang on.
                             (popping open door)
                        Whoo, boy!  Had the thing two days, already 
                        survived 68 plane crashes!  If only life had a 
                        reset button..

           He steps out of the machine.  Adam peeks in:  it’s like an 
           airplane cockpit - with a screen instead of a windshield.

                                 ADAM
                        Did you buy this?
                                 HOYT
                        Guy in Wichita makes em.  I got number three.  
                        This internet - I’m telling you, if it ever 
                        catches on, it’s gonna be huge.  Know what I’m 
                        ordering next?  An entire train.  

                                 ADAM
                        Can I try it?

                                 HOYT
                        Later, I need a break.  I was kidding about 
                        the train.

           Adam turns, follows Hoyt out of the garage.

                                 ADAM
                        I figured.  

                                 HOYT
                        You have something you wanna tell me?

                                 ADAM
                        No, why?

                                 HOYT
                        Just wondering.

           INT. KITCHEN - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Hoyt and Adam playing chess.  

                                 ADAM
                        So you’re not selling your house?

                                 HOYT
                        Damnedest thing.  Beginning of last week, best 
                        I could tell, I was dirt poor; nearly broke.  
                        Finally got the balls to call my money guy - 
                        turns out I suddenly had six hundred thousand 
                        dollars in the bank.  Don’t even know which 
                        stock it was.  Very strange.  
                             (moves bishop)
                        Check.

                                 ADAM
                        What did your money guy say?

                                 HOYT
                        He asked what your father knew about it - and 
                        I told him he knew nothing - and he said good, 
                        then he asked me to sign a pdf saying he knew 
                        nothing.  Then he resigned as my money guy.  
                        You have any idea why he would do that?
           Adam shakes his head, makes a chess move.  Hoyt counters.

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        And.. mate.

           Hoyt tips Adam’s king.  Then just stares at Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 HOYT
                        You moved pawn to rook 4.

                                 ADAM
                        So?

                                 HOYT
                        That was calculated to draw my bishop to the 
                        next logical position - which was there.  
                        Which meant you could only move there.. which 
                        put your king directly in danger.

                                 ADAM
                        What are you saying?

                                 HOYT
                        That you were trying to lose.

                                 ADAM
                             (rises, gathers things)
                        I believe I need to head home.

                                 HOYT
                        Adam. 

           Adam stops.  Turns.  

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        Where do you go?

                                 ADAM
                        What do you mean?

                                 HOYT
                        In the afternoon.  When you’re supposed to be 
                        in school.  Where are you?

                                 ADAM
                        At school.

                                 HOYT
                        Adam.

           Adam remains motionless.  
                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        I got a call.  Last week.  About your 
                        attendance.  Actually, your parents got a 
                        call.  At my number.  I thought:  why would 
                        the school call your parents at my number?  
                        Then I thought:  they would, if Adam had 
                        changed the contact info in the school 
                        computer.  Did Adam do that?

                                 ADAM
                        What did you tell them?

                                 HOYT
                        You had the flu.  

                                 ADAM
                        Why didn’t you say anything to me?

                                 HOYT
                        I figured you’d tell me when you were ready.  
                        But then you pissed me off.
                             (re chessboard)
                        I was trying to win.  I don’t like it when I 
                        find out we both have the same goal.  A man 
                        doesn’t do that to another man.  It’s not 
                        manly.  Do you hear me?  Not manly.  So.  
                        Adam.  One more time:  Where do you go?

           INT. INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - LATER

           Adam and Hoyt ride up, saying nothing.  It stops on the 11th 
           floor: the same floor Adam got off with the Building Manager.

           Only this time Adam has his own set of keys.

           INT. HALLWAY OF INDUSTRIAL LOFT BUILDING

           Hoyt looks around as Adam opens the door and indicates for Hoyt 
           to step inside.  Hoyt enters --

           INT. HUGE LOFT SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           The vast, empty corner loft in downtown Boston.  There is 
           absolutely nothing in there except for two things:

           That BOESENDORFER GRAND PIANO, and a DESK with a computer.

           Hoyt walks in.. slowly.  Taking it all in.  Walks along the 
           window.. looking out at the city rising around him.. then..

           He hears a simple note on the piano.  Followed by another.
           Slowly he turns and sees..

           Adam, at the piano, just looking at him.  Then Adam turns..

           And plays the first movement of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto 
           Number 5 in E Flat Major; Opus 73.  Flawlessly.

           The whole while Hoyt just watches.. moving slowly to the one 
           chair in the space, where he sits, silently, as Adam finishes.  

           A long pause.  Finally..

                                 HOYT
                        So.. The wings.  You just - what?  Threw em 
                        off the balcony?

           FLASHBACK:  RAIN.  Adam walks along the railing, illuminated in 
           flashes of lightning.  He turns.  Unstraps the wings.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        More or less.

           HARD CUTS:  Wings descending.. the ground rising.  

                                 HOYT (V.O.)
                        What about the scrapes?  The bruises?

           FLASHBACK:  Adam winces as he carefully and deliberately runs 
           his arm along the pavement until his own skin is peeling.  He 
           does it again - then again with his forehead.  And his cheek.  

           Face bleeding, he lifts a brick.. and brings it down on his leg - 
           hard.  So hard his eyes tear and he lets out a whimper of pain.

           FAST CUT: Adam loudly bangs a two-by-four into some trash cans.  
           Then quickly hobbles to the wings, which he re-straps to 
           himself, and climbs under, and closes his eyes as we hear:

                                 DEBBIE/TOM
                        ADAM!?  ADAM!?

           THE LOFT - PRESENT

           Silence.  Hoyt takes a moment to take this all in.  Finally:

                                 HOYT
                        Those were your birthday wings.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry.
                                 HOYT
                        Those were your goddamned birthday wings, 
                        Adam.  That was not what they were meant for.

                                 ADAM
                        I know, I’m sorry.

                                 HOYT
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ADAM
                        It’s not your fault.

                                 HOYT
                        No.  I’m sorry for whatever pain you were in 
                        that made this seem like a good idea.

           Adam looks at Hoyt, then looks away.

           INT. HOYT’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Thelonious Monk on the radio.  Adam in the passenger seat.  
           Silence.  For a while.  Finally:

                                 HOYT
                        So what’d I buy that made me so rich?

                                 ADAM
                        You didn’t buy, per se.  You borrowed on 
                        margin, then made a few advance trades on a 
                        flat fee, then transferred your short gain 
                        and used it to open an account on this 
                        British website, where you bet on some other 
                        stock type stuff.

                                 HOYT
                        You can do that?  You can bet on stocks?

                                 ADAM
                        Well, you bet against, really..

                                 HOYT
                        Gentronics?
                             (off Adam’s nod)
                        Is that why my money guy quit?
                             (quickly)
                        You know what, don’t tell me.  I’m not sure I 
                        wanna know.

           A pause.  Adam watches his grandfather listen to the music.
           INT. APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - GOING UP

           Adam and Hoyt.  Again, quiet.  Followed by:

                                 HOYT
                        Listen.. Since we’re confessing things.. 
                        There’s something I never quite knew how to 
                        tell you.
                             (as Adam looks over)
                        I hate classical music.  I know it’s 
                        sacrilege, but to me, it’s just a bunch of 
                        people doing exactly what they’re told.  You 
                        ask me, real music began and ended with one 
                        man:  Thelonious Monk.  I could listen to that 
                        man play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and I 
                        would be happy.  
                             (a big exhale)
                        I feel a lot better now.

           The elevator dings.  Hoyt and Adam step off and into --

           THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           And make their way to the apartment.

                                 ADAM
                        Um.. Grampa?  Do we have to tell my parents?

                                 HOYT
                        That I hate classical?  They’ll kill me.

                                 ADAM
                        No, I meant --

                                 HOYT
                        I know what you meant.
                             (as they arrive at the door)
                        One of us has to.  Either I do it now, or you 
                        do it when you’re ready.  Your call.

                                 ADAM
                        Me.  

                                 HOYT
                        Man to man?

                                 ADAM
                        Man to man.

           Hoyt and Adam shake hands.  Now Adam gets the key from the mat.
                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        By the way - the hardest part..?  Harder than 
                        lying all the time..?

                                 HOYT
                        Lemme guess:  losing at chess.

                                 ADAM
                             (nods, rises)
                        Oh - also.  Your money.  Is it okay if I keep 
                        playing with it?

           Hoyt kneels by Adam as if to admonish him.  Instead:

                                 HOYT
                        Do I get to keep my simulator?

           Adam nods.

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        Then hell yes.

           INT. HUGE LOFT SPACE - DAY

           Adam lies on the floor listening to THELONIOUS MONK as he tears 
           open a FED-EX PACKAGE.  It’s an ATM CARD.

           EXT. BANK - ATM - A MOMENT LATER

           Adam inserts the card, then enters a PIN.  Pause.  He pushes a 
           button.  Then another.  Pause.  He waits.  Then.. like magic..

           Money comes out.  Adam gapes.

           EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

           Adam and Jeannie eating lunch.  Adam has a note pad.

                                 JEANNIE
                        ..and then if you like the Eels you’ll like 
                        this other group, Saint America.  Hey - what’s 
                        the deal with school?  Am I gonna get like 
                        arrested by the truancy police?

                                 ADAM
                        We don’t have school today.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Really?  Why?
                                 ADAM
                        It’s a long lunch I mean.

           Jeannie looks at him warily.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Are you.. I hope this isn’t rude, but maybe 
                        it’s the accident, or whatever.. But you seem 
                        like something’s.. off.  I don’t remember you 
                        as having like such beady little eyes.

                                 ADAM
                        No, it’s good.  I’m good.  
                             (as the check comes)
                        I got this.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Adam.  Seriously.  I have a job.

                                 ADAM
                        So do I.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Right - what, are you making Nikes for some 
                        Taiwanese overlord?  
                             (wrests check from him)
                        No.  Sorry.  You’re 12.

                                 ADAM
                        I’ll get the next one.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Oh.  Okay.  Little Man.  You ‘get the next 
                        one.’

           EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAFE - A MOMENT LATER

           They exit.  Adam has a list, Jeannie has a latte in a to go cup.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        Okay - two of those you can’t download cause 
                        they’re on vinyl, so I’ll make sure I--

                                 ADAM
                             (abruptly)
                        Would you like to come back to my place?

           Jeannie abruptly LAUGHS WHILE DRINKING - nearly doing a spit-
           take.  She folds - half-laughing, half coughing.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Oh my god!  Oh my god did you just say that?  
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry..
                                 ADAM
                        What..?

                                 JEANNIE
                        I’m sorry - you literally made me laugh my 
                        coffee through my nose.. Oh my god.. this is 
                        disgusting, I need a napkin.. Hang on.. 
                             (grabs napkin from seating area)
                        Sorry - thanks.  No, I’m sorry, I can’t “come 
                        back to your place.”  That is hilarious.  I 
                        have to help James with a - thing.  He got 
                        into biz school - at Duke.  Which is in North--

                                 ADAM
                        Yes I’m aware of where it is.

           Adam’s sudden change of tone wakes her up.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Sorry.  Really.  Are you okay?

                                 ADAM
                        My father’s company’s falling apart.  And my 
                        mother is lost.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        Really?  That’s bad, I guess.  But why is any 
                        of that your problem?

           A pause.  Adam isn’t sure how to respond.  She hugs him.  He 
           doesn’t know what to do with his arms.  

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Adam..

                                 ADAM
                             (as they break apart)
                        By the way, The Eels are playing next week at 
                        the Royale.  Would you like to go?

                                 JEANNIE
                        I have plans with James.  And it’s sold out, 
                        cause I checked.  

                                 ADAM
                        I have three tickets.  Front row.  My grampa 
                        won this silent auction for this charity 
                        thing.  Anyways, James can come. 

                                 JEANNIE
                        Are you for real?
           INT. HUGE LOFT SPACE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam is at his computer on a TICKET SCALPER WEBSITE.  On screen 
           it tells him ‘I’m sorry, your request can only be processed in 
           quantities of 2 or 4.”  Adam chooses 4.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY

           Adam unlocks the front door and opens it.. And steps --

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Where he stops in the doorway as he sees HIS PARENTS in the 
           kitchen.  Tom looks bad.  He’s got a scotch.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Where were you?

                                 ADAM
                        I told you.  Jeannie’s.  

                          DEBBIE
           You didn’t tell me -
                                                           ADAM
                                              I left a message -

                                 DEBBIE
                        Go on upstairs.

                                 ADAM
                        Is everything okay?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Go on upstairs, I’ll be with you in a minute.
                             (off Adam’s hesitation)
                        Now.  Please.

           INT. APARTMENT - NOT TOO LONG AFTER

           EXTREME CLOSE UPS.  With the VOICES AMPLIFIED as Adam watches 
           his parents from the stairs with the BINOCULARS and BAT EARS.  
           Tom weaves about - tipsy.  Adam’s magnified view is partially 
           obscured.  (Adam’s also recording with a BOOM MIC.)  

                                 TOM
                        And he doesn’t just fire me - right?  That’s 
                        not degrading enough - no - he has to do it by 
                        text!  Oh! - and it’s on his stupid auto-
                        correcting iPhone!  So in fact it said ‘I 
                        “EGRIT” to inform you that we are paring down 
                        further and you’ve been “FRIED.”’ 
                                 DEBBIE
                        You’ve got to be kidding.

                                 TOM
                        Whatever, they “fried” everyone but four.  
                        Nick’s talking to the Chinese, trying to unload 
                        the whole company.  It’s basically a garage sale 
                        at this point.  I keep waiting to like wake up.  
                        Like I’m gonna snap my fingers..
                             (tries a snap)
                        Christ - I can’t even.. there.
                             (snaps)
                        Is this happening?  Is this really happening?  

                                 DEBBIE
                        I don’t know what you want me to say..

                                 TOM
                        It’s like I’m me, in my guidance counselor’s 
                        office, looking at me now going, like, yup - 
                        what you were afraid you’d amount to?  Boom.  
                        Nada.  Why was it okay before the fall?

                                 DEBBIE
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 TOM
                        The fall. Of Adam the Great. The literal fall.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Now you’re scaring me -- 

                                 TOM
                        No no no no no - think about it:  every year, 
                        practically every year since we’ve known each 
                        other, we’ve been on a slow, steady descent --

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m not doing this, Tom..

                                 TOM
                        No - it’s is a fact:  every year my salary’s 
                        dropped - the company’s slid - your whole music 
                        dream just, whatever, faded.  But it was always 
                        fine.  Cause when you were trotting him around, 
                        doing the, whatever, the dog and pony show, at 
                        least you knew where to put yourself.  Cause we 
                        had this.. thing we created.  Who was gonna 
                        rise above it all.  Like this floating piece 
                        of.. of magic.  In fact, he was the only thing 
                        I ever made that didn’t completely tank.  Till 
                        it did.  And now we’re just two middle-aged 
                        sacks of flesh in the same shitty apartment.
           UPSTAIRS Adam lowers the binocs but keeps listening.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You know what it’s like? ‘Member that song?  
                             (sloppily mimicking “Talking Heads”)
                        You may ask yourself.. What is that beautiful 
                        house?  You may ask yourself, how did I get 
                        here?  
                             (distorting it)
                        Well howwww did I getttttt here?

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           Adam lies on his side in bed, eyes open, staring ahead, when a 
           SHADOW appears under the door behind him and the doorknob turns.  

           His father sticks his head in.  

                                 TOM
                        Ad?  You up, bud?

           Adam is silent and motionless as Tom feels his way into the dark 
           room, stands for a moment above his son, and then sits.  Adam 
           looks so peaceful, so small just under him.

           Then Tom, work shoes still on, hauls his legs up and lies next 
           to Adam, big chest against Adam’s tiny back, heavy arm draped 
           over Adam’s side, head just above Adam’s on the pillow. 

           What Tom doesn’t know:  Adam’s eyes are wide open.    

           Tom closes his eyes.  Squeezes Adam tight.  Very tight.  
           Inhaling as he does - drinking Adam in.

           Adam continues to lie there.  Finally reaches out from under his 
           covers - and takes his father’s hand.  But it’s limp, now, as..

           Tom’s fallen asleep.

           Adam lies there, eyes still open, holding his father’s hand as 
           Tom sleeps behind him in his bed.

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           The FLIGHT SIMULATOR whirs as it gyrates.

           INT. SIMULATOR - SAME

           “Flying” over the nightscape of Boston city lights.  Adam at the 
           controls, Hoyt beside him.  
                                 HOYT
                        Good.  Now bring ‘er around, slowly.. Not too 
                        much, good.  That’s Logan down there.  Careful 
                        now - touch down is the most dangerous part.  

           Hoyt helps him bring it in.  

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom - not used to sitting in the apartment mid-morning mid-week, 
           stares at his phone.  Finally he picks it up, dials.  This is 
           hard for him.  We can hear an OUTGOING MESSAGE - then a BEEP.

                                 TOM
                        Hi, Nick.  Tom.  Listen, I know you’re swamped, 
                        but.. I’m wondering if I can see you..

           EXT. SYMPHONY HALL - DAY

           Adam walks up the steps of the Hall.

           INT. SYMPHONY HALL - A MOMENT LATER

           Adam follows someone down a hallway and into -

           A LARGE REHEARSAL ROOM

           Where Paul Alan Smith is in the middle of a work session with a 
           small GROUP OF MUSICIANS and a TALL MAN in his early twenties.

           (The group is the ensemble from Budapest.  It’s not commented 
           on, but the tall man is EMINEM, whom Adam doesn’t recognize.)

           Smith stops the moment he sees Adam and turns.

                                 SMITH
                        Ah!  Tibor, Vilmos, Hajna, Marshall - this is 
                        the young man I’ve been telling you about.

           EXT. CHARLES RIVER - ESPLANADE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Smith is walking with Adam.

                                 SMITH
                        Okay - first - before you go into why we’re 
                        talking - I can only sustain this charade for 
                        so long.
                                 ADAM
                        What charade?

                                 SMITH
                             (stops, looks at him)
                        Adam.  Really.  Please.

           Adam doesn’t say anything.  He doesn’t have to.  He just nods.  

                                 ADAM
                        Okay.

                                 SMITH
                        Thank you.

           They resume walking.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        One day, Adam, you will realize you’re part of 
                        a lineage, not a chain gang. 

                                 ADAM
                        So will you listen to my mother?

                                 SMITH
                        Do what?  Eat?  Fish?  Run on the treadmill?

                                 ADAM
                        Play cello.

                                 SMITH
                        Why?

                                 ADAM
                        Well.. I believe she would very much like if 
                        it you would hear her.

                                 SMITH
                        I believe you would very much like it if she 
                        would hear you.

                                 ADAM
                        I’m serious.  Would you help her?

                                 SMITH
                        Only if you promise me I can really help her.

                                 ADAM
                        That’s what I’m saying.
           INT. SYMPHONY HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Adam and Smith re-enter the rehearsal space.  Eminem and the 
           Hungarians are in the middle of a work session.

                                 SMITH
                        So where are we?

                                 EMINEM
                        They got something to play for you.

                                 SMITH
                        I was, am, and always will be all ears.

           A MOMENT LATER

           Smith and the Hungarians listen to playback as --

           NEARBY - IN SMITH’S OFFICE

           Adam and Eminem on the PlayStation on Smith’s couch.

                                 EMINEM
                        P A says you’re a hell of a pianist.

           Adam shrugs.  They play for a moment more.  Then:

                                 ADAM
                        So what is it you do?

                                 EMINEM
                        Really?

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY - SAME

           Tom - wearing a coat and a tie - exits a cab and crosses into-- 

           INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Tom sees NICK at a table.  Nick waves him over.  Tom comes, 
           sits.  This is brutally hard for Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Before you say anything - first, thank you.  
                        For seeing me.  There were like 40 of us and 
                        I’m sure if you sat for everyone’s -

                                 NICK
                        Tom.
                                 TOM
                        Please let me finish - I’ve been rehearsing -

                                 NICK
                        Tom.  I’ll save you the trouble.  I don’t work 
                        there any more.

           Tom just looks at him.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        As of eleven o’clock.  They sent out an email - 
                        which was weird.  I figured they’d’ve at least 
                        called you.

                                 TOM
                        No.. And I didn’t check emails cause I was - 
                        honestly, I was trying to get my head together 
                        for this.  So wait.  If you don’t work there, 
                        why’d you still meet me?

                                 NICK
                        Because I was expecting you to bail on me.  But 
                        when you didn’t, I figured I would take the 
                        chance to make a pitch to you about what is 
                        unassailable, which is that I know the insides 
                        of that company better than anyone.  But I think 
                        it’s pointless until you check your email.

                                 TOM
                        I’m extremely confused.

                                 NICK
                        I’d suggest you check your email.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - A MOMENT LATER

           Tom exits, checks his BlackBerry.  His jaw drops.

           INT. SIMULATOR - ‘FLYING’

           Hoyt pilots the plane over virtual Canada.

           INT. HOYT’S KITCHEN - DAY - SAME

           Adam is at the computer - working - when the DOORBELL RINGS.  He 
           crosses, opens the front door.

           There’s a HUGE TRUCK in the driveway and a guy with a clipboard.

                                 GUY
                        Your airplane’s here.
           Adam’s eyes widen.

           ABOUT AN HOUR LATER

           The huge truck lumbers off, leaving Adam and Hoyt with DOZENS of 
           VARIOUSLY SIZED AND SHAPED BOXES stationed around a partially 
           (about half) assembled light sport aircraft.  

           Hoyt has a packing slip on the clipboard, checking off items as 
           he goes from box to box.  Adam starts poking around.

                                 ADAM
                        You can just get it in a kit?  And then put it 
                        together?  A whole airplane?

           Hoyt nods.  IN THE GARAGE - on the wall - is the BLUEPRINT: a 
           drawing of what the plane would look like finished.  

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Then what are you gonna do?  Fly it? 

                                 HOYT
                        No, I’m gonna fill it with balled up plastic 
                        bags and push it around.  Of course I’m gonna 
                        fly it.  That’s the damn point.  
                             (hunting for labels on boxes)
                        “Fixed Leading Edge Wing Slats.”  There’s 
                        supposed to be this island, somewhere north of 
                        Maine, south of Nova Scotia.  Guess what lives 
                        on it?
                             (off Adam’s shrug)
                        Nothing.  Can’t moor a boat to it, can’t land 
                        on it.  Totally uninhabitable.  I wanna see 
                        it.  See for myself.  The last, uncharted..
                             (searching for another item)
                        Ah.. Here we go. “Flaperon Assembly.”  Okay.  
                        All set.  So.. Shall we start?  

           Adam nods - excited - when they hear a CAR pull up, honk.

                                 HOYT (CONT’D)
                        You expecting someone?

           Adam turns - at the end of the driveway is a LIMOUSINE.

                                 ADAM
                        I believe it’s time for my date.

           Off Hoyt’s look, we cut to:
           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door opens and Tom - beaming - enters with champagne.

                                 TOM
                        Hel-looooooooooo?  Wifely-wife-wife?

                                 DEBBIE
                             (stepping into room)
                        Tom?

                                 TOM
                        I believe the proper monicker is “Mister 
                        President.”

           EXT. BOSTON - NIGHT

           The LIMO waits outside a small apartment building as --

           Adam stands at a doorway holding FLOWERS and --

           A 22 YEAR OLD GUY (JAMES) steps out of his apartment.  

                                 JAMES
                        For me!?  --Kidding.  But I’ll put em in 
                        water.  I’m James, by the way.

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.  Adam.

           Adam initiates his now-practiced fist-bump.  James is a cool guy 
           - a decent guy.  And he understands full well the situation.  
           Still - how can you pass up free front row tickets - and a limo?  

                                 JAMES
                        It is totally a pleasure to meet you, Adam.  
                        And thank you for the extremely nice ride.
                             (as he enters past Jeannie, who exits)
                        Look what you got..

                                 JEANNIE
                             (bopping James good-naturedly)
                        Flowers - take a hint.  
                             (to Adam)
                        Notice anything?

                                 ADAM
                        Um..

                                 JEANNIE
                             (re her piercings)
                        I got two more.  My mom like shit a Twinkie, I 
                        think.  “
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEANNIE (CONT'D)
                        You still live in this house, you follow our 
                        rules young lady.”
                             (turns, spots huge limo)
                        Okay - that’ll do.  But I’d prefer a little 
                        legroom.

           James exits again, now filming with his phone.  Jeannie plays 
           for the camera.

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay - well - seeing as our normal car’s in 
                        the shop, I guess we can take the maid’s 
                        beater P.O.S.  

           James follows her to the limo door - holds it open for Adam.

                                 JAMES
                        Please.  After you.

           INT. ROYALE THEATER - LATER

           THE EELS on stage.  Adam, James, Jeannie, and an empty 4th seat 
           in the front row.  Adam is actually TOO close, given his size 
           and the height of the stage.  

           James and Jeannie are having the time of their life - sing along 
           with Novocaine For the Soul.

           INT. HUGE LIMO - LATER

           Adam, alone, in the quiet back, after Jeannie and James have 
           been long ago dropped off.  It pulls up to his apartment.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY

           Adam - spent - approaches the door.  Hears SCALES on the cello. 

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The place looks like a small party happened.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Well?

                                 ADAM
                        It was fun.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Did you say hi to Jeannie for me?
                             (off Adam’s nod)

                                 DEBBIE (CONT'D)
                        That was really nice of her to invite you.  
                        How is she doing?

                                 ADAM
                        Good.  
                             (re the empty champagne and glasses)
                        What happened?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Your father got his old job back.  Scratch 
                        that - he got Nick’s old job back.

                                 ADAM
                        Really?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Some Swiss guy swooped in and outbid the 
                        Chinese.  His name is Thaddeus Wolf.  Isn’t 
                        that funny?

                                 ADAM
                        Where’s Tom?

                                 DEBBIE
                             (indicates the den)
                        He’s already plotting away.  His new boss 
                        wants him to ‘think outside the box.’

           Debbie watches Adam as he goes into --

           THE DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Tom is hard at work as Adam enters.

                                 TOM
                        Pretty cool, huh?  Your old man is “President 
                        of Worldwide Development and Production.”  Of 
                        course, we only have six employees - for now.  
                        Till I turn it into a raging leviathan of 
                        acoustical.. Whatever..  

                                 DEBBIE
                             (stepping in)
                        Do you not remember your friend Thaddeus Wolf?

                                 ADAM
                        Who?  No.  Why?  

                                 DEBBIE
                        From Mommy and Me?  He was only in for a few 
                        weeks.  You were like 2.  Well dad’s new boss 
                        is named Dr. Thaddeus Wolf.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEBBIE (CONT'D)
                        I just thought it was funny - I mean - how 
                        many Thaddeus Wolfs are there in the world?

                                 ADAM
                             (oddly abrupt)
                        Apparently at least two.  And one is Swiss and 
                        old.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’m just saying it’s a funny coincidence.  And 
                        it’s late.  And you need to get to bed.

           A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Tom finishes an email - to “Dr. T Wolf” - and hits SEND.

           INT. ADAM’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Adam’s BLACKBERRY - which he keeps under his pillow - DINGS.  

           EXT. HOYT’S DRIVEWAY - NIGHT (SAME)

           Monk plays as Hoyt’s plane continues to take shape:  The wings 
           have expanded out.  It’s started to look more ‘whole.’ 

           Hoyt’s outside working on it, working late, engrossed.

           INT. GENTRONICS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM

           Tom, animated, talks to the small, pared-down office.  There are 
           designs up on the board behind him.

                                 TOM
                        ..idea here is the hearing aid as jewelry.  In 
                        the same way that, say, eyeglasses have become 
                        a cosmetic accessory.. It’s an idea of Dr. 
                        Wolf’s actually.  He said he got it while 
                        looking at his granddaughter’s piercings.  The 
                        notion is that we can be both smaller and more 
                        conspicuous - at the same time..

           INT. APARTMENT - EVENING

           Tom, Debbie and Adam, at dinner.  Tom is lively, still animated.

                                 TOM
                        -- oh - oh - you should have seen the look on 
                        Nick’s face when I brought him in.  Two days a 
                        week.  And he took it!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I love that he’s working for me now!  Part 
                        time.  Till we get those new casings 
                        launched..

           Adam watches.  Debbie looks at him - then back at Tom.  Curious.

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Debbie is looking around Tom’s desk.  Suspicious of something - 
           though unsure what.  She shuffles through some of his papers.  
           The door suddenly opens and Debbie, startled, drops the papers.

                                 ADAM
                        What are you doing?  

                                 DEBBIE
                        What?  Nothing.  Cleaning up.

           INT. JR. HIGH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Adam - bored out of his wits - leans back in his chair, 
           listening to a teacher talk about capital cities.

           A MOMENT LATER

           The teacher, at her desk, reads a note signed by ‘TOM DAVIS.’

                                 TEACHER
                        Really?  Another doctor’s appointment?

                                 ADAM
                        It’s just to go over the lab reports.  It’s 
                        just a routine thing.

           The teacher looks at him.

           INT. APARTMENT - SAME

           Debbie is in the living room, practicing scales.  Working hard.

           EXT. JUST OUTSIDE HOYT’S PROPERTY

           Adam walks.  Turns into Hoyt’s driveway.

                                 HOYT (O.S.)
                        Addo!   Perfect timing!  Come gimme a hand, 
                        will ya?
           EXT. HOYT’S DRIVEWAY - DAY

           The airplane is nearly finished.  Adam is holding up a piece of 
           metal so that Hoyt can affix a decal.

                                 HOYT
                        ..’ere we go.  What do you think? 

           Hoyt peels off a piece of paper, revealing:  a name.  In black 
           letters affixed to the side of the plane.  Blue Monk.  

                                 ADAM
                        The Monk song?

           Hoyt nods as Adam’s BLACKBERRY BEEPS with an instant message.  
           Hoyt looks - sees it’s from Tom - to Dr. Wolf.

                                 HOYT
                        Dr. Wolf?

                                 ADAM
                        It’s a work thing.  I mean, a school thing.

                                 HOYT
                        Adam.

                                 ADAM
                             (a pause)
                        We bought Gentronics.

           Hoyt stops what he’s doing.  Exhales deeply.  This is huge.

                                 HOYT
                        Ooh-boy.  And you expect this to end how 
                        exactly?

           THE KITCHEN - A BEAT LATER

           Hoyt puts ice in a glass, pours a Scotch.  Adam follows him in, 
           sits at the kitchen table.

                                 ADAM
                        It actually was quite a steal.

                                 HOYT
                             (pours a second shot)
                        Right.  Great.  
                             (turns)
                        Lemme ask you something.  Your dad.  Why do 
                        you think his old boss never promoted him?

                                 ADAM
                        What are you getting at?
           Hoyt sits at the table.

                                 HOYT
                        Adam, there are people who design planes, and 
                        people who fly them.  And I suspect they are 
                        entirely different skills altogether.

                                 ADAM
                        Tom said you always thought of him as a 
                        failure, no matter how well he did.

                                 HOYT
                        Not a ‘failure.’  Just that there was always a 
                        pronounced difference between what he aspired 
                        to and what he actually achieved. 

                                 ADAM
                        I think you’re a better grampa than father.

           Hoyt just looks at Adam.  Has nothing to add.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           EXTREME CLOSE-UPS as:

           Adam on the stairs with the binoculars and bat-ears.  There’s a 
           party going on.  A banner reads “CONGRATULATIONS MR. PRESIDENT!”

           It’s for Tom.  He’s in the middle of regaling people:

                           TOM
                                                          DEBBIE
           ..Oh!  And get this --
                                              This is great!

                                 TOM
                        -- Nick’s working for me now.  Part time.  I ask 
                        Dr. Wolf:  “Hey, I’d like to give this guy a 
                        shot.”  Well I don’t ask him, I email him, cause 
                        it’s all email - cause he’s deaf - which - and 
                        he never said this, but it explains his interest 
                        in a hearing aid company.  

                                 A FRIEND
                        To Dr Wolf!

                                 TOM
                        And his bad taste in companies!

                                 DEBBIE
                        But great taste in company presidents!

           People raise a glass.  
                                 TOM
                        And Debbie’s got news!

                                 DEBBIE
                        Tom - no -

                                 TOM
                        Yes yes.  Guess who called her - wants to 
                        listen to her play --

           On the stairs, Adam’s BLACKBERRY buzzes.  He puts down the 
           binocs, looks.  His text says, simply: “OUTSIDE.”  

           A MOMENT LATER

           Adam - in a sport coat and tie - comes downstairs.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        No, I don’t know.  According to my snoops at the 
                        Symphony Society he’s putting together some 
                        piece with a Hungarian string ensemble and 
                        Eminem.. Maybe he needs back up?  I don’t know..
                             (sees Adam)
                        Hey.  Gimme a kiss.
                             (kisses the top of his head)
                        Say hi to her.

                                 ADAM
                        I will.  

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT (”O YA”) - EVENING

           Adam and Jeannie sit across from each other.  A 21 year old in 
           jeans and t-shirt, and a 12 year old in a sport coat and tie.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        And James is all “Maybe if I’m going there for 
                        grad school you could like go to undergrad.” --
                        Let’s go 50-50 on this, okay?  But I’m like.. I 
                        don’t know - it’s like North Carolina - I might 
                        be in a total rut here but at least it’s a rut 
                        I know.  What are you doing?

           He is holding a jewelry box - which he slides over.

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously - wait - what are you doing?

                                 ADAM
                        Small gift.

           She hesitates.. Then opens it.  It’s a DIAMOND RING.
                                 JEANNIE
                        Is this real?

                                 ADAM
                        Of course.  It’s a round brilliant octahedron.

                                 JEANNIE
                        You’re crazy.  I can’t take this.  Anyway, why 
                        would you give me a diamond ring?

                                 ADAM
                        Because I love you.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Because you love me?
                             (as he nods)
                        For real?  With all the bits and pieces?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Listen, whatever, when I was your babysitter - 
                        which I sucked at, by the way - you were like 
                        a brother to me.  And I still feel the same.  
                        And I have a boyfriend.  Who you know.  Who 
                        adores you.

           He nods, looks off; this isn’t what he wanted to hear. 

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you listening to me?

                                 ADAM
                        Statistically, women are usually 7 years 
                        younger than their partners, but that’s really 
                        stupid because men die 7 years earlier, so 
                        women are widows for 14 years.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Okay - seriously - your bonk on the head?  It 
                        made you crazy and stupid.  I should go.

                                 ADAM
                        Wait.  We would die at the same time.  
                        Besides, a woman’s libido’s at its peak 10 
                        years later than a man’s.

                                 JEANNIE
                        The libido?  Really?
                                 ADAM
                        That’s why so many relationships fail.  Women 
                        should be older than their men.  We would make 
                        the perfect couple.

           A waitress brings a menu.

                                 JEANNIE
                        I don’t think we’re ordering.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  We are.  Just - give us a moment.  

           The waitress leaves the menus, departs.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        Jeannie, you’re the love of my life.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        Your “life” hasn’t even started.  And what 
                        about sex?  I bet you didn’t think that 
                        through, did you?  Mr. Libido.

                                 ADAM
                        Well, that could wait for a while.  It’s just 
                        an optional exchange of DNA anyway.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Okay - see - yeah.  You’re just proving my 
                        point.  Adam, I’m a woman and you’re 12.

                                 ADAM
                        But that’s just a number.  These are all just 
                        numbers.  I can’t live without you.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Adam - I’m sorry.  I can’t do this.  
                             (slides ring back)
                        I can’t take this.  I can’t do this.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Jeannie’s hailing a cab when Adam comes out.

                                 ADAM
                        Okay.  I’m sorry.  We don’t have to like - 
                        whatever.  But I.. I made something for you.

           INT. INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Adam and Jeannie ride up.  It stops at the 11th floor, opens.
           INT. HALLWAY OF INDUSTRIAL LOFT BUILDING

           Jeannie looks around as Adam leads her to a door.  Removes keys.  

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 JEANNIE
                        It’s just.. A 12 year old with keys.  It’s 
                        just funny.

           He inserts one into the lock.  Opens the door into -

           INT. HUGE LOFT SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           The vast, empty corner loft in downtown Boston.  

                                 JEANNIE
                        They just.. Let you do this?

                                 ADAM
                        Anyways it’s a write-off.  For my business.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Your business.  Why is there a piano in here?  
                        Are you playing? 

           Adam crosses to the (new) incredible sound system.  Indicates 
           for her to sit on one of two super-fancy arm chairs.  

                                 ADAM
                        This is what I made for you.

           Adam sits in the chair next to her and lifts a remote, then hits 
           “play.”  We HEAR a bit of a Beethoven’s Opus 10 #1 for piano.

                                 JEANNIE
                        What is this?

                                 ADAM
                        Just wait.

           ..then a beat starts - a modern, electronica-inspired beat - 
           taken from the music Jeannie gave him.  And over it the 
           classical riff repeats.  Then it repeats again.  And again.

           Then we hear 14 YEAR OLD JEANNIE’S VOICE - from the NANNY CAM 
           RECORDING 7 YEARS AGO: 

                                 JEANNIE’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        ..Ladies and gentlemen.. On piano.. The great 
                        Adam Davis!
           Jeannie looks at Adam.  He just stares up at the ceiling as we 
           now hear HIS FATHER’S VOICE - in time to the music.

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        Keep waiting to like wake up.  Like, you know, 
                        I’m gonna snap my fingers..

           We HEAR THE SNAPPING of Tom’s fingers - cut in and repeated, 
           rhythmically.  The mix is starting to build.  Debbie’s cello 
           weaves in and repeats.

                                 DEBBIE’S VOICE
                        Don’t know what you want me to say.  You’re 
                        scaring me.  Tom - Tom - Tom - you’re really 
                        scaring me.

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        Is this really happening?  Is this - is this - 
                        is this really happening?

           And then, extremely softly - and getting softer - as if it’s 
           tumbling off a very, very distant cliff:

                                 JEANNIE’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        SOULJA BOY OFF IN THIS--

                                 ADAM’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        OH!

           Now OTHER SOUNDS are woven in:  sounds of the city; sounds from 
           outside their apartment.. the saxophone player (from out their 
           window), edited to accompany his parents’ words:

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        Every year, practically every year since we’ve 
                        known each other, we’ve been on a slow, steady 
                        descent --

                                 DEBBIE’S VOICE
                        Tom - T-Tom - Tom - you’re really scaring me.

           Softly - like a very distant echo - we hear:

                                 TALKING HEADS
                        Letting the days go by, letting the water hold 
                        me down..

                      DEBBIE’S VOICE
                                                       TOM’S VOICE
           Don’t know - don’t know what 
           you want me to say..
                                              Is this - is this - is this 
                                              really happening?

                                 JEANNIE’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        WATCH ME CRANK IT WATCH ME--
                                 ADAM’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        ROLL!

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        ..Cause when you were trotting him around, at 
                        least you knew where to put yourself..  

                                 TALKING HEADS
                             (still extremely soft)
                        Into the blue again, after the money’s gone..

                       TOM’S VOICE
                                                      DEBBIE’S VOICE
                                              Don’t know - don’t know what 
                                              you want me to say..
           Cause we had this.. thing we 
           created.  Like this floating 
           piece of.. of magic.  

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        ..look at myself now going, like, yup.  BOOM.

                                 TALKING HEADS
                        You may ask yourself: where is that large 
                        automobile?

                                 DEBBIE’S VOICE
                        Tom..

                                 TOM
                        No.  No no.  Yup.  BOOM

           (The “Tom” and the “no - no no - yup - BOOM” continues)

                       TOM’S VOICE
           Two middle-aged sacks of flesh 
           in the same shitty apartment..
                                                   TOM’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                                              Like this floating piece of.. 
                                              of magic. 

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        You know what it’s like?  That song: 
                             (mimicking the “Talking Heads”)
                        You may ask yourself.. What is that beautiful 
                        house?  

                                 TALKING HEADS
                        You may ask yourself:  what is this beautiful 
                        house?

           (Add in Debbie’s “Don’t know what you want me to say”)

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        You may ask yourself, how did I get here?  

                                 TALKING HEADS
                             (gaining in volume)
                        Letting the days go by, let the water hold me 
                        down.. 
                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        Well howwww did I getttttt here?

                                 TALKING HEADS
                        Letting the days go by, water flowing 
                        underground.. 

                                 TOM’S VOICE
                        Well howwww did I getttttt here?

           Sudden silence - then:

                                 TOM’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Cause we did it.  This floating piece of.. of 
                        magic.

           And a CRASHING cacophony:  horns, trash cans, street musicians -- 
           and emerging out of that: classical piano - which is overwhelmed 
           by more city sounds.. Out of which emerges more classical music.  

           PUSH IN ON Adam as these two things battle for primacy.. And 
           under it, the whole time..

           The modern beat grows louder.  Until there’s SILENCE again, and:

                                 JEANNIE’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        No matter what happens, no matter who in our 
                        life can’t possibly understand us.. let’s 
                        promise - no swear - to always be there for each 
                        other, throughout all time.  Do you promise?  

                                 ADAM’S VOICE (FROM 7 YEARS AGO)
                        I promise.

           And it’s over.  Pause.  He hits “stop.”  Then turns to Jeannie.

           She’s just looking at him.  She’s very emotionally affected - 
           but it’s not just sadness; it’s far, far more complex.

                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 JEANNIE
                        I can’t help you, Adam.  

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t understand.

                                 JEANNIE
                        I just.. I have to leave.  

                                 ADAM
                        What are you talking about?  Leave where?
                                 JEANNIE
                        I don’t know.  Leave Boston, I think.  

                                 ADAM
                        And leave me?

                                 JEANNIE
                        I don’t know.  Yes.  I have to go to North 
                        Carolina.  Whatever - I have to get out of 
                        here.  I have to get out of this space.  It 
                        creeps me out.  Cause all this..
                             (referring to the loft)
                        This is bad.  I wanted to give you music so 
                        you could, I don’t know, like - what do you 
                        call it when something.. whatever, blends?  

                                 ADAM
                        Assimilate?

                                 JEANNIE
                        Yeah, sure.  Because you should live in the 
                        world, Adam.  Not this crazy - whatever - 
                        supervillain’s lair.  This.. Bat Cave.

                                 ADAM
                        But you promised --

                                 JEANNIE
                        I was a kid!  Kids say stuff!  Adam.  This is 
                        over my head.  All of it.  Seriously.  Please.  

           A pause.  Adam nods.  Jeannie turns.   

                                 JEANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           And she’s gone.

           Adam is motionless.  For a long time.  Many things play over his 
           face.  Is he going to break things?  Throw something?  Finally--

           He slowly - deliberately - crosses to the piano.  And sits.

           Brings his hands forcefully - almost violently - down onto the 
           keys.  And with intense feeling his playing continues over:

           EXT. BOSTON - NIGHT

           Adam wanders, alone, trying to make sense of what just happened.
           INT. APARTMENT - LATER 

           Adam enters - sees the post-party remains of a partially cleaned 
           up mess.  Hears his parents upstairs getting ready for bed.

           Something catches his eye: on the kitchen table is a piece of 
           paper with Debbie’s writing and the words:  “WOLF INVESTMENTS.”  
           “DR WOLF HOLDINGS” and “THADDEUS WOLF?”  “TADEUS WOLF?” 

           The piano music stays dark, ominous, dramatic.  Continues over:

           INT. TOM AND DEBBIE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Adam steps in as Tom is brushing his teeth.  

                                 ADAM
                        Hi.

                                 TOM
                        Oh, hey.  Fun dinner?

           Adam nods.  Debbie passes by, closing up the upstairs.

                                 ADAM
                        Was the party good?

                                 DEBBIE
                        It was great.  But you’re late - you said 
                        10:30 and it’s nearly midnight.  

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry.  We listened to some music after.
                             (a pause)
                        Um.. I happened to notice something on the 
                        kitchen table.  You were curious about Dr Wolf 
                        Holdings?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah - your mom thinks it’s too good to be 
                        true.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        No.  Tom.  Just - 

                                 TOM
                        See?  

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t understand - why would it be too good 
                        to be true?

                                 TOM
                        That’s what I said.
                                 DEBBIE
                        No - guys - you’re taking this too far.  I 
                        just.. Nothing.  It’s late - Adam - bed time.  
                        Now.

           Debbie - again - watches Adam wander off to his room.  And is 
           still watching when Adam turns back to look at them.

           INT. TOM’S DEN - NIGHT - LATER STILL

           Alone now, Debbie is on Tom’s computer, looking through Tom’s 
           emails.  The letter chains between Tom and “Dr Wolf.” 

           A MOMENT LATER

           Debbie Googles “T. Wolf.”  Then “Thaddeus Wolf Swiss Doctor.”  
           “Switzerland Thaddeus Wolf Hearing Aids Gentronics.”  Each time 
           she gets nothing.  Pause.  She hits “sleep.”  Music ends.

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY (SAME)

           Debbie gets out of a cab at Symphony Hall, lugging her cello.  
           She makes her way up the imposing steps.

           INT. SYMPHONY HALL - A MOMENT LATER

           Debbie checks in with a RECEPTIONIST.  She’s sent down a hall.

           INT. TOM’S OFFICE - GENTRONICS - DAY - SAME

           Tom is working when his secretary sticks her head in.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Tom - it’s Adam’s school.

                                 TOM
                             (picks up phone)
                        This is Tom.

           INT. REHEARSAL HALL - DAY

           Debbie sits in a folding chair across from Paul Alan Smith.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        So.. Do you want a modern piece, like Samuel 
                        Barber, or like a Lalo thing, or Dvorak..?
                                 SMITH
                        Whatever makes you comfortable.  I just wanna 
                        get a sense of you through your instrument.

           A pause.  She nods.  Is about to start - then stops.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Did Adam..?  

                                 SMITH
                        He asked me to hear you.  Yes.

           She nods.  Looks off.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        If that makes you want to stop, I understand.

                                 DEBBIE
                        No.  You did this thing - maybe eight years 
                        ago - the Saint-Saens - was it 2004?

                                 SMITH
                        Cello Concerto Number 1.  It was 2002.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I heard it at Tanglewood.   We drove all the 
                        way - my boss was giving me shit, we had 
                        sitter issues - yes!  2002, cause I worked at 
                        Mann-Gelon - anyway, we finally got there.  
                        Remember that thing you said - when you said 
                        that thing, to Adam, in Vermont, at your 
                        house, about hearing the whispers of angels..?

                                 SMITH
                        Some can hear them.  Others - very few others - 
                        can make it so others hear them.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Yes, well.. I think I heard them that night.  
                        In Tanglewood.  Anyway.. I want to.. No, I 
                        need to do this. 

                                 SMITH
                        Okay, then..

                                 DEBBIE
                        So..

           She takes a breath.  And she starts.  Music continues over: 
           INT. JR. HIGH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Tom stands in the back with the Administrator.  Adam’s seat is 
           not just empty - it looks as if it’s been empty for a long time.

                                 TEACHER
                        It was only last week we suspected that these 
                        were forgeries.   Did you write any of them?

           She hands Tom a pile of notes.  From his face we see the answer.

           INT. REHEARSAL HALL - SAME

           Debbie plays.. And plays.  With intensity.  Finally finishes.   
           A pause.  Smith thinks.  Then..  

                                 SMITH
                        Do you love playing?

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh my god I do.

                                 SMITH
                        Then you should play.  If it gives you joy.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Okay.  I can do that.
                             (then)
                        I’m sorry.  I’m not sure what you mean.

                                 SMITH
                        On the good side:  your bowing is suitable for 
                        most sectional work; a little pressed, but a 
                        good, open sound.  A tad analytical, at times - 
                        a bit Germanic, I think, for Edouard Lalo.  But 
                        you’ve got a lot of soul - and that comes 
                        through.  And is rare, actually.  Of the thirty 
                        thousand or so cellists in the world, you’re in 
                        the top - whatever - five or ten percent, 
                        easily, in terms of technique; rusty, sure, but 
                        you can see the chops.  But if you’re asking 
                        does the world need another cellist of your 
                        caliber.. The answer is most certainly no.  

           A pause.  Debbie takes this in.  Nods silently.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        You seem disappointed.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I am disappointed.  Of course I’m 
                        disappointed.  What did you expect?
                                 SMITH
                        That you would be devastated.  But the fact 
                        that you’re not makes me think that perhaps 
                        you knew this coming in.  

           A pause.  Debbie has to think about this a moment.

           Then she nods.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Why did you come then?

                                 DEBBIE
                        I guess I had hoped.. I don’t know.

                                 SMITH
                        Yes.  I did, too, to be honest.  I really 
                        wanted you to be special.  In that way.

           Another pause.

                                 DEBBIE
                        But I’m not.

                                 SMITH
                        No.  You’re not.

           Debbie nods again.  Lifts her cello - and her case, separately, 
           with a separate hand - and drags both out of the room.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Adam exits the T and starts toward his apartment building when 
           he stops - seeing his mother, ahead of him, exiting a taxi.

           She looks heavy.  As if she’s carrying a lot along with her 
           cello.  So he slows.. Lets her go in ahead of him.

           INT. APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

           Debbie opens the door and enters - surprised to see Tom sitting 
           in the living room.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What are you doing home?

                                 TOM
                        I was actually expecting Adam.  I was just at 
                        his school. 
                             (then)
                        Are you okay?
           There’s a pause.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        No.

           INT. SYMPHONY HALL - HALLWAY - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Adam charges down the hall, enters the rehearsal space, where 
           Smith is with the Hungarians, Eminem and some orchestra people.   

                                 ADAM
                        What did you say to her?

                                 SMITH
                             (to the others)
                        I’m sorry.. give me a minute.

           HALLWAY 

           Adam and Smith step out, close the door.

                                 SMITH (CONT’D)
                        I told you I would help her.  So I did.  Trust 
                        me - she’s free now to get on with her life.

                                 ADAM
                        What life?  How?

                                 SMITH
                        Why is that your problem?

                                 ADAM
                        Cause.. I don’t know.. 

                                 SMITH
                        Cause she’s special?

                                 ADAM
                        Well.. Yes.

                                 SMITH
                        Oh, grow up, Adam.  No one’s special and 
                        everyone’s special, and you can’t save your 
                        parents, and you can’t destroy them.

                                 ADAM
                        I can.  I did.

                                 SMITH
                        Well maybe that’s not so bad either.
                                 ADAM
                        No.  Where are you going?

                                 SMITH
                        To do my job.  Because I think I’m done with 
                        you.

           Adam follows him into the -

           REHEARSAL HALL

                                 ADAM
                        You mean now or always?

                                 SMITH
                        I meant now but I’m changing it to always.  

                                 ADAM
                        Wait.  Why?

                                 SMITH
                        Why?  Because you’re a little liar, Adam.  
                        With the biggest tragedy being the lies you’re 
                        telling to yourself.

                                 ADAM
                        Well you’re a show-off.

                                 SMITH
                        Not gonna work, Adam. 

                                 ADAM
                        Your best work is behind you.  

                                 SMITH
                        I don’t care!  I don’t care if it actually is, 
                        and I certainly don’t care if you think it is.   

                                 ADAM
                        You do care because you see yourself in me.  
                        I’m just another way to keep you immortal.

           Smith whirls back and gets right down in front of Adam.

                                 SMITH
                        Adam.  Believe it or not, there are others like 
                        you.  Thousands.  No, more.  And guess what 
                        else?  I see this all the time.  ‘The March of 
                        the Little Elfin Prodigy People.’  Cause Adam - 
                        special as you think you are, the road from then 
                        to now is littered with the carcasses of people 
                        like you.  People who hear beautifully but have 
                        no idea how to listen.  So go away.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SMITH (CONT'D)
                        My little project is over.  I’m done.  I’ll tick 
                        the ‘fail’ box and go back to the pool.  Next!

                                 ADAM
                        You can’t just make me leave.

                                 SMITH
                        Really?  How much do you weigh?

           EXT. SYMPHONY HALL - A MOMENT LATER

           Smith literally deposits Adam on the street and closes the door.  
           Beat.  Adam stands there. Pulls out his cell phone.  Dials.

           INT. HOYT’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Hoyt’s phone rings and rings.. Out the window we see into the --

           GARAGE - SAME

           Where the simulator whirs - occupied.

           INT. APARTMENT - SAME

           Tom and Debbie sit in the living room.  Debbie’s had a good cry.  
           But that’s over now.  Her cello is in the case on the floor.

           Tom watches as she picks up the cello, carries it into the 
           closet, then closes the door - then returns to the couch.

           They sit there.  Silently.  Tom takes her hand.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Adam rides out to the suburbs, looking out the window.

           INT. APARTMENT - SAME

           More silence.  Neither Tom nor Debbie look at each other.  
           Rather, they both just stare straight ahead.  Until..

           Debbie lets go of his hand and rises, then returns to the 
           closet, opens it, and removes the cello.  She opens the case.. 

           Then carries the cello back to the living room.  Sits at her 
           chair.  Takes her bow.. and Tom watches as..

           She starts to play scales.  Which continue over:
           EXT. HOYT’S PROPERTY - DAY

           Adam walks down the road, turns at Hoyt’s driveway.  Sees the 
           simulator on in the garage, whirring.  But there’s something odd 
           about it.  Something disturbingly rhythmic.  He walks to the -

           GARAGE

           Where the simulator is just going around - and around - and 
           around - and around.  He walks up.  Knocks.

                                 ADAM
                        Grampa?

           It just continues.

           INT. APARTMENT - SAME

           Debbie is playing as the phone rings.  Tom eyes the caller ID.

                                 TOM
                        Dad - can I call you right back?  I’m --

                                 ADAM’S VOICE
                        Daddy!

           EXT. HOYT’S PROPERTY - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Ambulance is parked, lights flashing - but the attendants not 
           really rushing as..

           Tom and Debbie’s car screeches to a halt and they run out 
           without bothering even to shut it off as they bolt to --

           The garage - where Adam runs to them.. And we CUT TO:

           INT. MEMORIAL CATHEDRAL - DAY

           The funeral.  Family, friends.  Adam, Debbie, Tom.  But not a 
           lot of people.  One gets the sense this is a less densely 
           attended service than the site is used to holding.  

                                 TOM
                        ..just want to thank you all - say how 
                        grateful we are that you came out - whether 
                        it’s dad war buddies.. grade school friends - 
                        gotta love Facebook - his old cronies from the 
                        print shop.  I guess, finally, before we head 
                        over to the house, is there anyone else who 
                        would maybe wants to say something?
           There is a pause.  People look around.  No one really has 
           anything left to say.. But before Tom continues..

           He notices that Adam has raised his hand.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Adam.  Okay.  My son - Hoyt’s grandson - Adam.

           Adam rises.  Tom steps from the podium - and passes Adam, 
           patting him on the shoulder before sitting by Debbie as -

           Adam walks toward the podium but then past it - and instead 
           crosses to the PIANO, which has been unnoticed until now.

           He sits.  And opens the cover. 

           Tom and Debbie look at each other.. Then at Adam as..

           Adam takes his left hand and places it gently on the keyboard..

           And slowly, simply - he plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  As 
           he continues with his left hand (Up Above The World So High)..

           He lays his right hand on the keys.  And with it he starts a 
           counter melody - Thelonious Monk’s Blue Monk - which, although 
           it begins quite simply, slowly, elegiacally..  

           ..it is masterful.  And increasingly complex and sophisticated.  

           All the while, the left just continues on, slowly, simply, never 
           varying - as if a child is playing Adam’s left hand - and a 
           sophisticated adult is playing the right.

           TOM AND DEBBIE

           Watch their son play.  PUSH IN.. As if things are dawning on 
           them.. KEEP PUSHING IN.. so close that things start to BLUR, 
           and, as the MUSIC CONTINUES, we DISSOLVE THROUGH to:

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           The countryside blurs by as Adam rides the train.

           EXT. HOYT’S PROPERTY - DAY

           Adam, a duffel over his shoulder, enters the quiet, slightly 
           overgrown yard.  Crosses the long, empty driveway.  Takes a key 
           from a log, enters the house.
           INT. HOYT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Adam crosses through the kitchen.. Heads down into --

           HOYT’S WOODSHOP - CONTINUOUS

           And sees the things on the wall - things they worked on together 
           over the years, carved, sanded..  Reaches, takes down the SMALL 
           WOODEN PLANE (the one they hollowed out so many years ago).   

           Music continues as--

           EXT. HOYT’S PROPERTY - DAY

           Adam approaches Hoyt’s plane.  Unzips the canvas, pulls it to 
           the ground, then opens the door and climbs inside.

           INSIDE THE PLANE

           Adam sits at the controls.  Takes a breath.  Then hits the 
           ignition.  And it starts.  

           EXT. HOYT’S PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

           Adam takes the throttle, then disengages the brake.  It turns.. 
           And starts rolling down Hoyt’s driveway and onto..

           EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOYT’S PROPERTY - CONTINUOUS

           Where it turns again.. And is now facing the long straightaway 
           that is the rural street outside Hoyt’s house.

           Adam looks straight ahead.  Pulls back on the throttle and..

           The airplane accelerates down the street.. Faster.. Faster.. 

           Until it starts to rise into the air.  And starts to arc up.. 
           and turn.. 

           Music continues, and starts to (ever-so-slightly) change in 
           tone.  There’s a barely-discernible modern beat emerging from 
           within, as..

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY - SAME

           Debbie and Tom go into Adam’s room, together, and go to Adam’s 
           desk.  Tom opens the drawer.  And now they dig through.
           At the bottom of a bunch of things they find the LOFT CONTRACT.  
           And a set of spare KEYS.  They look at it..

           The contract is between “CITY LEASING” and “DR WOLF HOLDINGS.”

           INT. AIRPLANE - FLYING - SAME

           Adam eyes where he’s heading, looks at the GPS.. He’s passing 
           the northernmost tip of Maine.. continuing out over the blue..

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY

           Tom and Debbie exit a cab.. And walk into the office lobby of 
           the LOFT SPACE.  They enter, speak to the BUILDING MANAGER.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Adam looks out the window, scouring the landscape for something. 
           Finally - he spots something, and starts to bank the plane..

           INT. LOFT BUILDING - HALLWAY

           Tom and Debbie get off the elevator.  The Building Manager 
           points them toward --

           ADAM’S LOFT

           Where they insert the key.  Enter.  And see the piano, the desk, 
           the stereo..

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Adam seems to be heading toward somewhere specific now.  He 
           locks in on what he’s looking for on the GPS - a tiny land mass.

           INT. LOFT - SAME

           Tom and Debbie look at Adam’s computer screen.  At the long list 
           of emails and IM’s from Tom to Dr Wolf..

           Debbie puts her hand on Tom’s shoulder as Tom has to sit.

           EXT. LOFT BUILDING - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

           Tom and Debbie exit the building.. Pausing on the steps, taking 
           in what they just saw.  Full of feelings - complex, unclear.
           INT. AIRPLANE - FLYING - SAME

           Adam flies over the island, surveying the landscape.  He reaches 
           behind him - picks up the small wooden airplane. 

           And now he reaches for something that’s been under his seat.  
           It’s an URN.  

           He lifts it.  Then carefully empties the contents of the urn 
           into the tiny hollowed “cockpit” of the wooden plane. 

           He then slides open his window, turns.. lifts the wooden plane.. 
           and throws it--

           OUT THE WINDOW

           Where it swoops down - then arcs up - then swoops again, ashes 
           from the wooden cockpit fanning in a grey rainbow of dust as --

           The wooden plane ducks and dives down and around, and..

           ADAM

           Banks the Blue Monk so that he can watch as..

           THE LITTLE WOODEN PLANE

           Continues its downward swoops.. Empty now.. But arcing and 
           diving until, finally, it smashes silently against the rocks of 
           the island, and..

           ADAM

           Yanks the throttle and the Blue Monk arcs and curves, music 
           continuing - and starting to fill out rhythmically:  some 
           guitars are heard, and a bass.  Some horns.  Strings.  The beat 
           is becoming more pronounced, more modern, still, as..

           EXT. CAB - BOSTON - DAY

           Debbie rests in the taxi outside the GENTRONICS OFFICES as Tom 
           looks at her.. Then goes up the steps..

           INT. GENTRONICS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           NICK looks up from his desk as Tom enters, sits across from him. 
                                 NICK
                        Hey - you okay?

                                 TOM
                        Nick, I.. I think I’m in the wrong job.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t understand.

           Tom reaches in to his pocket, pulls out his keys.  Takes his 
           office key off.  Slides it across Nick’s desk, as..

           EXT. GENTRONICS OFFICE - SAME

           Debbie, in the taxi, looks into Nick’s office window as she sees 
           her husband shake hands with Nick, then rise - for the first 
           time in what we have to assume is a while - to his full height.  

           Ever so slightly, she smiles.

           INT. AIRPLANE - FLYING

           Adam is flying outside of Tunbridge, Vermont - over farmland.  

           He looks on his map.  Sees where he is trying to go.  He starts 
           to bank the plane and begin its descent..

           EXT. RURAL VERMONT - SAME

           The plane is coming down now.  Approaching a vast green lawn.

           Now, within the music, an acoustical piano is starting to make 
           its way forward through the growing electronic groove, as:

           EXT. GREAT LAWN - DAY - SAME

           The Blue Monk touches down on the grass and bounces a bit before 
           rolling.  And then finally it slows to a stop near the base of a 
           lavish estate.  A pause.   

           Adam gets out.  He starts toward the imposing estate..

           ..and sees Paul Alan Smith standing there, on the steps, looking 
           at him.  He’s at Smith’s house.

                                 SMITH
                        And how may I be of service to you, young 
                        Thomas Adam Davis?

           Adam smiles as..
           The piano takes full control of the soundtrack - and we CUT TO:

           INT. STAGE - SOMEWHERE

           HANDS on a keyboard - masterful, vibrant - classically 
           influenced but fully modern in sound.. as we PULL BACK AND FIND:

           ADAM

           At 14.  Fully engaged.  Hair wild - unkempt; forehead beaded in 
           sweat (he’s clearly at the rousing end of what he’s playing); 
           dressed formally - but unconstrained as he moves with the music 
           as it builds.. his hands flying across the keys like a flock of 
           birds.. as --

           WIDER

           He swings around and now faces the array of ELECTRONIC KEYBOARDS 
           on a stand between him and --

           THE REST OF THE STAGE

           Which we now see for the first time:

           Artfully designed - we’re the end of some kind of modern fable, 
           or rock opera.  Bat-themed, it would appear from the: 

           GIANT WINGS - huge theatrical representations of Hoyt’s 
           ‘birthday wings’ - high in the center back of the stage.  

           PERFORMERS - singers - are arranged artfully throughout the many 
           levels of the stage.  And - 

           MUSICIANS, similarly arranged - guitars, and horns, and strings.  
           All with one thing in common:

           They are all kids - between the ages of 10 and 18.  

           Adam plays a riff on the keyboard as he’s facing them and..

           They return a riff back - fully orchestrated as we cut:  

           WIDER STILL

           A sign above the proscenium arch says “THE BOSWELL SCHOOL.”  
           IN THE AUDIENCE

           TOM, DEBBIE, and, in a separate section, PAUL ALAN SMITH - among 
           other proud PARENTS, and SIBLINGS are all totally into the music 
           as --

           ADAM 

           Gestures to someone offstage (another student) - who releases -- 

           A SCRIM which falls just as the music reaches a rousing climax 
           and Adam gives another signal and -

           The PERFORMER in the huge bat wings leans forward and steps off 
           a high ledge, and as he’s falling - 

           The LIGHTS SHIFT so that in one continuous motion --

           ON THE SCRIM NOW, the bat - rather than plummet, instead swoops 
           down and arcs up - as if in full flight.  And..

           As the bat rises, higher, higher still, wings beating, the actor 
           at the center (on film on the scrim), sublime, peaceful..

           Adam hits the final note and his fellow musicians follow with 
           theirs.. and the piece comes to an end and..

           The curtain falls.

           The audience bursts into cheers and rises to their feet.  Tom 
           and Debbie are up in a flash.  But ahead of them, even, was Paul 
           Alan Smith - who applauds wildly as the curtain rises now and..

           ON STAGE

           Aligned, arm in arm, are ALL 64 STUDENTS of the Boswell School.  
           Actors, singers, musicians, technicians, artists -- all involved 
           in this (and every) production.  Lovely and awkward, beaming and 
           proud.  Prodigies.  Misfits, perhaps, elsewhere.  But not here.

           Linked arm in arm with them is, of course --

           Adam, who smiles, proud, as his eyes go from Smith to his 
           parents, to his fellow artists.. And we cut..

           EXT. BOSWELL SCHOOL CAMPUS - DAY

           A BANNER over the front door reads “HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!” 
           PARENTS AND KIDS all leaving - with suitcases, instrument cases, 
           trunks.. Loading things into taxis, into cars.. families among 
           masses of families.  64 families, to be exact.  A community.

           BY A TAXI

           Tom and Debbie are loading the trunk of the cab.  Tom is trying 
           to shove stuff in; Debbie moves him aside - gives it a push.

           Then Tom moves Debbie aside a bit - and Debbie (playfully) 
           shoves Tom back.  He turns.  Does it back.  And now -

           ON THE TOP OF THE STEPS OF THE SCHOOL - SAME

           Adam steps out, carrying a school duffel as two friends - new 
           friends, friends from this year - help carry his keyboard cases.  
           He pauses at the top of the steps and looks around - then sees 
           something that makes him actually stop in his tracks:

           ADAM’S POV - ON THE BIG LAWN

           About 100 feet away, his father is literally chasing his mother 
           on the grass, kicking up leaves as he dives, tackling her.

           Tom grabs some leaves now and covers her with them.  And..

           They are both hysterically laughing.  Really cracking up.  And 
           gradually they notice the same thing:  Adam is watching.

           They turn - like two kids who have been “caught” rough-housing.

                                 TOM
                        Oh.  Hi.  Sorry.

           Adam is just motionless.  But in a good way.  He breaks into a 
           wide grin.  And we cut to:

           INT. AIRPLANE - AFTERNOON

           Sunlight through the window as Tom sleeps against the window and 
           Debbie and Adam sit beside him.  

                                 DEBBIE
                        I’ve tried to move as much of my studio out of 
                        your room as I could.  So I’ll take my 
                        students in the living room as long as you 
                        don’t mind a little clunky cello music around 
                        the house.  That okay?
                                 ADAM
                        Yeah - no it’s great.  I love clunky cello.
                             (then)
                        Hey.. Um.  Speaking of that.. I was wondering.  
                        Before we went home.  There’s someplace I’d 
                        like to stop.  Would that be okay?

           EXT. BOSTON - MARWOOD CONSERVATORY - LATE AFTERNOON

           A taxi is in front of this stately music conservatory as --

           Tom and Debbie, waiting outside the taxi, watch as Adam makes 
           his way up the steps, opens the large wooden door.

           INT. CONSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS

           Adam walks the marble hall.  We hear music from various practice 
           rooms.  Adam finds the room he was looking for.  Moves to it, 
           and knocks gently.  The music inside stops.  

                                 VOICE
                        Yes?

           Adam pushes open the door.  Enters --

           A PRACTICE ROOM

           Where distinguished JOHN SYDNEY - with another student - turns.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Adam?

                                 ADAM
                        I’m sorry to interrupt.  

                                 SYDNEY
                             (to his student)
                        Give us just a moment, please, Millicent.
                             (as his student leaves)
                        So to what do I owe this honor?

                                 ADAM
                        Um.. Yes.  I just wanted to say.. Well, what I 
                        wanted to say was thank you.  For the lessons.  
                        That you gave me, before.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Adam.. Really..
                                 ADAM
                        Yes.  And also:  you were right, about the 
                        power of the unresolved chord.  And I should 
                        have rested in it, longer, as you’d suggested.  
                        And so I’m sorry about the things I said, 
                        about that.  And other things.  So.. Thanks.  
                        Very much.  For everything.

                                 SYDNEY
                        Thank you, Adam.  Thank you very much.

           Adam nods.  Awkwardly - almost as an afterthought - he walks 
           over, shakes Sydney’s hand.  Then backs out of the room.

           Sydney watches him go, then, uncharacteristically we would 
           suppose, he smiles, more than a little moved.  

           EXT. MARWOOD CONSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS

           Adam exits the large wood doors and onto the steps which lead 
           down into the majestic city.  He takes a deep breath, exhales.  

           He sees his father outside the taxi, holding the door open.

                                 TOM
                        Anywhere else you want to go?

           Adam slides into the back of -

           THE TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Where he gets in the center, next to Debbie, as Tom slides in 
           the other side and closes the door.

                                 ADAM
                        No.  Home is good.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Home it is, then.

           And as the cab takes off into the city, Adam leans back in the 
           back seat, takes his mother’s hand.. Rests his head on his 
           father’s shoulder.  And we..

           FADE OUT.     

                                 THE END
