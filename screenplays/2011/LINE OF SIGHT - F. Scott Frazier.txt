                                 MYRA  (V.O.)
                        Audio only.  Hold on, think there's
                        a problem with --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A YOUNG SOLDIER'S FACE

           CORPORAL ANDREW JONES.  Handsome.  Athletic.  Late 20's. 
           Eager to please and champing at the bit to prove himself. 

           He stares right at us.  Reaching forward, adjusting focus.

                                 JONES
                        How 'bout now?

           MYRA <speaks> into his EARBONE RADIO.  We hear what he hears.

                                 MYRA
                        <Five by five.>

           Jones straps on a HELMET CAM.  Now, we see what he sees--

           INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS (JONES)

           FOUR SOLDIERS, prepped for a training exercise.  Equipped
           head-to-toe in next-gen gear, including HELMET CAMS and
           VIRTUAL RETINAL DISPLAY (VRD) GOGGLES.

           The men themselves are built for speed.  Precise.  Imposing.

           They are Delta Force Three-One. 

           The most dangerous men in the world.

           The team's FIRST LIEUTENANT, TOM NEWELL, approaches.  Tough
           but affable,  he's buttoned up in all the right places.  A
           soldier's soldier. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Hell of a week so far, rook.

                                 JONES
                        Want to make a good impression on
                        the Colonel, sir.

                                 NEWELL
                        You're here, aren't you?
           Newell moves on to SPECIALIST MARC GONZALEZ.  Che Guevara
           quotes tattooed down one arm; SpongeBob portrait on the other.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        John says she's hot.

                                 NEWELL
                        Who's that, Gonzo?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Chica at mission control.  I say no
                        way they hire anything but double-
                        woofs up at Langley.

           A VIDEO OVERLAY appears.  Wireless picture-in-picture (PIP)
           of MYRA GILL, CIA tech-extraordinare, working at a computer
           station.  She's definitely hot.  

                                 MYRA
                        You know I can hear every word you
                        say, right cowboy --

                                 GONZALEZ
                        -- Aye, mami --

                                 MYRA
                        -- And I'm not at Langley.  We're
                        analyzing off-site response time --

                                 GONZALEZ
                        -- Johnny-boy!  You win!

                                 WOLFE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Lou?  Got a minute?

           Newell is waved away by SERGEANT WOLFE, a black NCO with a
           severe allergy to authority.  Says a lot about him, he made
           it this far on such an abrasive personality. 

           They speak quietly in the hall as:

                                 MYRA
                        Company commissioned a study last
                        year, showed mission success rate
                        was twelve percent higher when male-
                        dominated operation teams were
                        shepherded by an attractive woman.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Twelve?  You'll get us to thirty on
                        those eyes alone.

           Myra giggles in spite of herself.  The PIP closes. 

           From down the hall --
                                 WOLFE
                        -- You haven't talked with him yet? 
                        What the hell is that?  You know I'm
                        ready for my own CAG --

           Wolfe catches Jones watching, pulls Newell further away.

           SPECIALIST JOHN CARTER inches up beside Jones.  He's the
           team's sniper, a good-old-boy from Savannah.

                                 CARTER
                        Old lady doesn't care?  

                                 JONES
                        'bout what?

                                 CARTER
                        You up and disappearing for weeks at
                        a time?  Drop of a hat.

                                 JONES
                        She understands the job.

                                 CARTER
                        How long you been married?

                                 JONES
                        Eight months -- nine next week.

                                 CARTER
                        Give it a year.  A kid.  That well
                        of understanding only runs so deep. 
                        Trust me.

                                 BYRON (O.S.)
                        Delta -- line up!

           COLONEL LOUIS BYRON, a rain barrel of a man, steps into the
           doorway.  Admires his crew.

                                 BYRON
                        Show time.

           EXT.  STAGING AREA - DAY (JONES)

           The bright sting of daylight.  A shimmering green forest.  

           Delta is lined up.  Byron paces, a conductor before the opera.

                                 BYRON
                        CIA and DARPA say they have new
                        hardware gonna save American lives.

                            (holds up helmet rig)
                        Real time, augmented reality headset
                        with 3D, thermal-optic imaging and
                        less than a two-hundred millisecond
                        delay.
                            (beat)
                        Now, I'm not exactly sure what any
                        of the fuck that means...
                            (pause for laughter)
                        But I'm told it's quite impressive. 
                        Also, expensive.  Special Agent Gill
                        will guide you through the exercises. 
                        Next eight hours, she is your God.  

           EXT.  TRAINING COURSE - DAY (NEWELL)

           A prefab city.  Automated TARGETS armed with LIVE-AMMO RIFLES
           move on tracks between pieces of cover.

                                 MYRA
                        <Need to boot each system
                        individually.  Stay with me.>

           A BLUE PULSE waves out in every direction.  Highlights nearby
           targets.  A 3D HUD illuminates every corner of the VRD.

                                 NEWELL
                        Correct me if I'm wrong -- haven't
                        the SEALs been using sonar imaging
                        for a decade now?

           Myra, insulted, appears in the PIP.

                                 MYRA
                        Don't get snobby on me just yet. 
                        That's barely the hors d'vours. 
                        Secondary intel incoming.

           The targets FLASH.  Intricate 3D WINDOWS appear.  Detailed
           info on the targets' height, weight, equipment loadout, etc.

                                 MYRA
                        That's a seven-terabyte, high-
                        resolution data overlay complete
                        with target assistance, object
                        recognition, projectile tracking,
                        muzzle flash alerts, and ongoing
                        threat detection analysis.

                                 NEWELL
                        Bonus points.  Keep it coming.
                                 MYRA
                        Finally -- augmented reality,
                        predictive analysis.

           Faint GHOST IMAGES and PARABOLIC ARCS fill the VRD, shifting
           around the course ahead of the targets they represent.

                                 NEWELL
                        Alright, that's a bowlful of awesome. 
                        You can tell me where Gomer's gonna
                        be in thirty seconds?

                                 MYRA
                        Bigger budget, enough processors --
                        I could tell you where he's gonna be
                        in thirty minutes.

                                 NEWELL
                        How does it work?

                                 MYRA
                        It doesn't.  We're at 27% accuracy. 
                        You'll be long retired before this
                        baby gets out of the incubator.

                                 NEWELL
                        And we're the first assholes get to
                        kick the tires?  How special.

           EXT.  SHOOTHOUSE - DAY (JONES)

           Stacked on a door.  Newell in front.  Wolfe and Gonzalez
           behind.  The VRD fully activated, we're looking at the world
           through LAYERS OF 3D ICONS and DIAGNOSTIC TELEMETRY.

                                 MYRA
                        <When you're ready, Lieutenant.>

           The VRD GOGGLES mark targets inside the building. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Seven Tangos inside.  AK's and
                        Makarovs.  Three on the ground, two
                        above, one below.  Standard flash
                        and clear.  GO!

           Newell CRACKS the door.  Wolfe tosses a FLASHBANG inside. 
           Two seconds for the POP.  Then, the team is rushing

           INSIDE

           Through a thin haze of smoke -- Newel FIRES on the two closest
           targets -- BRRDDTT-BRRDDTT -- his MP5 lights up the room.
           EXT.  SNIPER PERCH - SAME TIME (CARTER)

           Above and across from the shoothouse.  A BARRET M98 SNIPER
           RIFLE pressed to Carter's shoulder.

           A target's GHOST IMAGE moves in front of an open window --

           -- BOOM!  Easiest shot Carter's ever made.

                                 CARTER
                        ...Where's the fun in that?

           INT.  SHOOTHOUSE - SAME TIME (NEWELL)

           Clearing the ground floor with Wolfe.  Kitchen -- clear. 
           Bedroom -- clear.  Dining room -- one target -- BRRDDTT!

                                 NEWELL
                        Dining room, clear.  Moving --

           -- The door BURSTS open -- Jones SPINS inside -- FIRES --
           Wolfe HITS the deck -- Jones realizes his mistake --

                                 JONES
                        -- Oh-shit, oh-shit.  Sorry, sorry --

           EXT.  TRAINING COURSE - DAY (JONES)

           Byron, Newell, and Wolfe argue at the other end of the course. 
           Jones watches.  Can't hear what they're saying. 

                                 CARTER
                        Once, Sniper School in Benning --
                        tagged my spotter right in the ass.

                                 JONES
                        How's that even possible?

                                 CARTER
                        Dago prick was screwing my girlfriend. 
                        Shot practically lined itself up.

                                 JONES
                        Is that true?

           Carter winks.  Smiles.  Gonzalez steps in.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Old man's a stubborn son-of-a-bitch. 
                        He wants you in Three-One, this is
                        where you'll be.
           From over his shoulder:

                                 NEWELL
                        BECAUSE IT'S MY GODDAMN TEAM --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- HE ALMOST SHOT OFF MY FUCKING
                        HEAD!

           Byron pulls Newell and Wolfe around the corner.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        On the other hand, you ever considered
                        the Coast Guard?

           Suddenly, a STAFF SERGEANT runs out of the barracks, scared.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        It's Washington -- Chicago --
                        something's...

           He runs off.  Jones, Carter, and Gonzalez share a look, hustle

           INSIDE THE BARRACKS

           Where SOLDIERS are gathered around a TV set.

                                 SOLDIER
                        -- Sister's in Georgetown --

           Jones pushes through the crowd and sees

           ON THE TV

           Sights from a movie:  CIVILIANS fleeing--  Storefronts
           EXPLODING--  NATIONAL GUARD engaged in urban warfare-- 

           Only this isn't a movie.  This is CNN.  The headline reads:

                         NATION WIDE TERROR ATTACK? 
              Chicago, Dallas, Denver Reporting Heavy Casualties

           The broadcast tries to make sense of the violence.  SCATTERED,
           JUMBLED IMAGES from around the country--

           -- Cell phone towers collapsed in downtown CHICAGO.

           -- Gridlock on the 405 all around LOS ANGELES.

           -- A South Carolina POWER PLANT nearly in rubble.

           -- DFW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.  Planes stranded on the runway.

           Byron and Newell storm into the room.  Stare at the TV. 
                                 BYRON
                        Where's this happening?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Everywhere...

           For half a second, we see a look of horror in Byron's eyes. 
           Then, just as quick, he's all business.

                                 BYRON
                        EVERYONE ON STATION!  Raise General
                        Butler at Fort Jackson!

                                 NEWELL
                        Myra, you seeing this?

           Myra's PIP appears, nothing but commotion behind her:

                                 MYRA
                        Can't talk.  Shit's hitting the fan.

           And she's gone.

                                 BYRON
                        Someone get me Butler!

           A GRUNT in the corner holds up a phone.  Shrugs. 

                                 GRUNT
                        Line's dead.  Nothing in.  Nothing
                        out.

                                 BYRON
                        Radio?

                                 GRUNT
                        FUBAR'd -- every frequency is jammed.

           ON THE TV

           The images now show WASINGTON D.C.  People flooding the
           streets.  It's difficult to make sense of the chaos.

                           NATION'S CAPITAL NEXT? 
            No Official Response from White House or Homeland Security

           WOLFE AND NEWELL

           Whisper in Byron's ears:

                                 WOLFE
                        By air, we're only twenty minutes
                        out.
                                 NEWELL
                        We get court-martialed, engage without
                        orders. 

                                 WOLFE
                        You know anybody else, do what we
                        do?

           Byron taps his fingers.  Thinking.

                                 BYRON
                        THREE-ONE!  MOUNT UP!

           INT.  LOCKER ROOM - DAY (JONES)

           Delta gears up.  Loading themselves for bear with the latest
           in DARPA toys --

           -- BIOMIMETIC BODY-ARMOR, field-rated to withstand .35mm
           gunfire from distances within four feet.

           -- XM8 MULTI-FUNCTION ASSAULT RIFLES.  Customized stocks,
           barrels, sights and secondary firing capabilities.  Real-
           time, LED ammunition displays.

           -- THERMITE PLASMA BREACHING CHARGES stuffed into a duffel
           bag -- ZIIIIP!

           -- Collapsible RIOT SHIELD, folded down -- CHA-CHUNK -- and
           latched onto Carter's backpack.

           -- A SLEEK, BLACK BRIEFCASE with no identifying marks or
           logos.  Newell checks the contents, then locks it back up. 

           Jones is last to leave.  Searching frantically through his
           locker.  Finally pulls out his CELL PHONE.

                                 NEWELL (O.S.)
                        Rook!  Put a fire under that ass!

           EXT.  HELIPAD - DUSK (NEWELL)

           Delta double-time for a CHINOOK HELICOPTER at the center of
           the training facility. 

                                 JONES
                        -- If you guys are just screwing
                        with me...

           The team BOARDS the chopper.  Gonzalez takes the controls.

                                 CARTER
                        Anybody got family in DC?
                                 JONES
                        New York.  Westchester Village.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Boston --

                        -- Can't let you take that bird,
                        Major.

           Heads turn.  Byron and the Staff Sergeant are nose to nose.

                                 BYRON
                        You're about ninety ranks below me,
                        son -- stand down.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        All due respect, sir -- this facility
                        is under my authority, which
                        supersedes your rank.

                                 BYRON
                        What about I supersede my foot up
                        your ass, and we call it even.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Colonel, I --

           He grabs Byron's shoulder.  Wrong move.  Byron SLUGS the
           guy.  Knocking him out.  Delta applauds and whistles.

                                 WOLFE
                        Old man's still got the heat.

                                 BYRON
                            (climbing aboard)
                        Get us in the goddamn air!

           The Chinook BUMPS and SHAKES as it ascends out of the trees.

                                 CARTER
                        Jesus, Gonzo.  Some of us want to
                        hold on to our lunches.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Lo siento -- last time I mounted a
                        bird this huge, tu mamacita barely
                        got off the ground.

           Everybody chuckles.  

                                 CARTER
                        English, buddy.  English.  Or didn't
                        they teach you that in Beantown? 
           More laughter.  But as the helo clears the trees, the fun
           immediately stops--

           Because ahead--  Visible on the horizon--

           A MASSIVE SMOKE CLOUD hangs over DC.  Thick and black.

                                 JONES
                        Lieutenant?  Colonel?  What the hell
                        is happening?

           No response.

           INT.  CHINOOK - DUSK (NEWELL)

           Ten minutes later.  The helo flies over the Maryland suburbs.

                                 JONES
                        News didn't say anything about
                        Manhattan.  You don't think --

                                 CARTER
                        -- I'm sure your wife's fine.

                                 JONES
                        Keep imagining I'll hear from her
                        somehow.

                                 CARTER
                        Sure she's fine...

           INT.  CHINOOK - DUSK (JONES)

           Ten minutes later.  The smoke over DC is a mile away.

                                 MYRA
                        <Delta Three-One?  Colonel Byron,
                        you have me?>

                                 BYRON
                        Go ahead, command.

           Myra's PIP appears, disrupted by static and white noise.

                                 MYRA
                        Where are you?

                                 BYRON
                        Thirty seconds outside D.C.  Headed
                        to the fight.

                                 MYRA
                        On whose orders?
                                 BYRON
                        Mine.

           A brief pause.  Myra coordinates with ANALYSTS in her office.

                                 MYRA
                        Chain of command is boned.  Secure
                        lines are deaf and dumb -- comms
                        that do make it through, orders are
                        conflicted.

                                 BYRON
                        Any idea who's behind it?

                                 MYRA
                        All the visual intel I'm seeing shows
                        masked paramilitary units.  No one
                        international is claiming
                        responsibility.  Lucky if we know
                        for sure this time next week.

                                 BYRON
                        Your location secure?

                                 MYRA
                        For now.  Langley got hit a few
                        minutes ago.
                            (beat)
                        Delta fit to run an op for me?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Colonel -- we're here.

                                 MYRA
                        Call me back when you're secure on
                        the ground.

           The PIP closes.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Hell of a "light training day", boss.

                                 BYRON
                        No such thing as vacation in the
                        Three-One, hu-ah?

                                 GROUP
                        Hu-ah!

           The distant sound of GUNSHOTS and EXPLOSIONS grow outside.

           The Chinook SHUDDERS.  Bullets suddenly PING off the armor.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Taking us in!  Grab hold!
           The chopper descends.  Fills with black smoke. 

                                 GONZALEZ
                        ...Thirty...seconds...

           Everyone coughs.  Struggles to breathe.

           Then, the chopper DROPS out of the smoke --

           -- AND DESCENDS INTO HELL.

           Washington in ruins.  Directly below, brutal fighting at the
           NATIONAL MALL and outside the CAPITAL BUILDING.

                                 JONES
                        Could be China.  North Korea.

                                 CARTER
                        No way.  Even gooks ain't that stupid --
                        try and invade us?

           We catch glimpses of the incomprehensible madness below--  

           Tracer bullets.  Fireballs.  Car wrecks.  Burst water mains.  

           And the men behind it all.  MASKED PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS. 
           Full-cast body armor, it's impossible to see their faces. 
           But it's easy to see -- they are the enemy.

           Nearby, AA FLAK EXPLODES -- BOOM!  BOOM!!  BOOM!!!

                                 BYRON
                        GET US DOWN!  We're a fat fucking
                        iron bulls-eye up here --

           BOOM!

           A side panel BURSTS apart behind Byron--  He SCREAMS out-- 
           Hit by shrapnel--  Falls forward--

                                 GONZALEZ
                        HANG ON!

           The chopper BANKS hard.  Alarms wailing.  Descends.  Through
           the fire and flak.  Finally touching earth.  Safe for now.

           Newell scramble from his seat.  Moving for Byron.  Flipping
           the Colonel onto his back and -- he's dead.  

                                 WOLFE
                        SHIT!

           Jones back away.  Repulsed.  His first team K.I.A.
                                 NEWELL
                        Delta!  Secure the LZ!

           Carter pops the door and they rush out of the chopper onto

           EXT.  13TH STREET - CONTINUOUS (JONES)

           Above, smoke covers the setting sun, creating a weird,
           otherworldly light.  Red and orange, as if on Mars.

           Dead SOLDIERS fill the otherwise lifeless street.  Blown out
           store fronts and abandoned cars surround Delta.

                                 NEWELL
                        Firing zones.  Tight formation. 
                        Rules apply.

           The Capital Building appears through the smoke.  Burning.  A
           grim beacon at the end of the block.  

           Wolfe bends over a dead soldier.  Checks his tag and patch.

                                 WOLFE
                        General Butler's men.  Ironhorse

                        Where's the rest of Charlie Company? 
                        Where's the counter-attack?

                                 NEWELL
                        ...Colonel Byron's dead. 

           Myra's PIP appears.  She's stunned.

                                 MYRA
                        Oh, Jesus.  I'm sorry, it's just...
                            (beat)
                        Is Three-One mission capable?

           Newell looks at Delta.  At the bodies littering the street.

                                 NEWELL
                        Absolutely.  Get us in the fight.

           INT.  UNDERGROUND MALL - MOMENTS LATER (CARTER)

           Newell leads Delta.  Checking corners, moving quick.
           The mall echoes.  EXPLOSIONS from above RUMBLE the foundation. 
           FRIGHTENED CIVILIANS take shelter in stores. 

           Myra on PIP -- her office is a busy hive.

                                 MYRA
                        -- Capital Building looks like the
                        primary target.  Senate was in the
                        middle of a vote when the first bomb
                        went off --

           An AIDE hands Myra a file.  She flips through it, then feeds
           it into a shredder.

                        Quantico is rubble along with four-
                        hundred FBI field offices.  AF-One
                        disappeared off radar twenty minutes
                        ago with POTUS on board and VEEP's
                        motorcade got hit outside Cleveland. 
                        I've been trying to coordinate with
                        Secret Service for the last hour,
                        but so far nothing.  We need Three-
                        One inside Whiskey Hotel.  Where I'm
                        praying to a God I don't believe in
                        you'll find the Speaker of the House
                        alive.  I have footage of him giving
                        a press conference five minutes before
                        the attack --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- The Speaker...?  You think they're
                        going after Presidential succession.

                                 MYRA
                        It's what we would do.

           WHA-BOOM!

           The whole underground RUMBLES and SHAKES violently.  Delta
           is thrown off their feet as tiles fall from the ceiling. 

                                 MYRA
                        Oh...God...oh shit...

                                 NEWELL
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 MYRA
                        The Capital building...

           A SECOND PIP opens: NEWS HELICOPTER FOOTAGE of the Capital
           Building.  On fire -- then EXPLODING in a BLINDING FLASH.
                                 NEWELL
                        Another bomb?

                                 MYRA
                        No.  Three jets on a bombing run,
                        out of the north...  They -- shit --
                        they leveled it.

                                 NEWELL
                        Delta, we're running out of time!

           Delta, back on their feet, follow Newell into

           A SERVICE ENTRANCE

           Hustling down the back hallways.

                                 NEWELL
                        What are we looking for?

                                 MYRA
                        You'll know it when you see it. 
                        Emergency exit built in eighty-four.

           They turn the corner to a pair of double-reinforced, three-
           inch-thick STEEL DOORS.  A KEYPAD is the only visible lock.

                                 JONES
                        This kind of thing actually exists?

                                 MYRA
                        Give me two minutes.  We're breaking
                        Homeland's cloud for the passcode.

                                 CARTER
                        Couldn't you just ask 'em for it?

                                 MYRA
                        Their office got leveled twenty
                        minutes ago.  Total loss, what we
                        hear.

           Wolfe steps forward.  Holds up a THERMITE CHARGE.

                                 WOLFE
                        Got my own passcode we could try.

           Newell nods.  Wolfe sets the charge.  The team pulls back --

                                 JONES
                        They'll hear us coming.

                                 NEWELL
                        Good.
           -- WHOOSH!  The corridor fills with blue fire, as the door
           melts and disintegrates within seconds.

                                 NEWELL
                        Oscar Mike!

           The team follows Newell -- through the smoke -- down a flight
           of stairs -- into a dark tunnel -- the VIDEO FEED flickering--

                                 MYRA
                        -Elta- -osing your sig- -ow cop-

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT (JONES)

           The VIDEO FEED cracks back to life--  The VRD fizzling as--

           Delta stacks on a door.

                                 MYRA
                        <There you are Delta.>

                                 NEWELL
                        Where is here, exactly? 

           Myra's PIP appears.  She sifts through building schematics.

                                 MYRA
                        Service basement.  West wing.  VRD
                        coming back online. 

           The VRD stabilizes -- TARGETS are marked through the door.

                                 MYRA
                        Situation Room on the other side of
                        that door.  Could be friendlies.

           Newell looks into the camera.  Holds a finger to his lips.

           Myra salutes as her PIP closes.

           Newell counts down on his fingers.

           Three...  Two..  One.

           WOLFE

           KICKS the door in -- as Delta rushes inside

           THE SITUATION ROOM

           Spotting a PARAMILITARY SOLDIER on the right -- BANG!
           NEWELL

           CROSSES the room -- laying SUPPRESSIVE FIRE.

           JONES

           Rolls a corner -- BRRDDTT-BRRDDTT -- two TANGOS down.

           THE LAST SOLDIER

           Takes aim -- a heartbeat from killing Jones when

           CARTER

           Rises from behind -- SLICING the soldier's throat.

           Delta exhales simultaneously.  Reloads.  Even in rest, they
           move as one.  As if connected by an invisible string.

           A long conference table splits the room in half.  Florescent
           lights swing from the ceiling.  Computers shot to hell.

                                 NEWELL
                        ID's?  Foreign nationals?

           Carter and Gonzalez pull the masks off the soldiers --

                                 CARTER
                        -- Not a Hadji in the bunch.

           Wolfe picks through their equipment --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- FN-SCARs, Dragon Skin body armor,
                        nightvision, IR -- nothing about
                        these guys says terrorist.

                                 CARTER
                        What the hell is going on?

           No one has an answer. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Stay frosty.  No bars and stars on
                        their shoulder -- you put them down. 
                        Hu-ah?

                                 GROUP
                        Hu-ah!

           INT.  BASEMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT (NEWELL)

           Delta hustles down a stately corridor.  Their steps echo off
           the polished marble.  Fighting has torn the walls apart.  
           Filled the hall with rubble and dirt. 

                                 MYRA
                        <VIP was last seen in the Press Room.>

                                 NEWELL
                        Good a place to start as any.

                                 MYRA
                        <I'm tracking three low altitude
                        bogies.  From the north.  ETA --
                        five minutes.  Got a bad feeling...>

           Newell clears a corner -- TAGGING a pair of SENTRIES.  Delta
           continues up 

           A GRAND STAIRCASE

           To the second floor landing.  Pushing through a door into

           THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM

           Rows of chair lined to face a podium in front of a blue velvet
           backdrop.  This is all starting to look familiar...

                                 WOLFE
                        Clear!

           Delta continues outside onto 

           THE WEST COLONNADE

           Getting our bearings.  Oh.  No wonder this place is familiar.  

           We're at The White House.

           Delta advances in a perfect cover-and-move formation.

           The building creaks.  Offices smoke.  Others still burn. 
           Explosions have torn out chunks of the facade. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Oval Office -- eleven o'clock.

           SOLDIERS and SECRET SERVICE AGENTS lay dead and dying up and
           down the colonnade.  An unsuccessful last stand.

                                 JONES
                        Christ Almighty --

           -- BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!

           Automatic gunfire RIPS down the hall -- Delta COVERS as more
           PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS block their path --
           Delta RETURNS FIRE.  Immovable object, meet unstoppable force.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        POPPING SMOKE!

           Gonzalez ROLLS a smoker--  It BURSTS-- 

                                 NEWELL
                        -- COVER AND CLEAR!

           CARTER

           Lays SUPPRESSIVE FIRE -- BAM-BAM-BAM -- as

           JONES AND WOLFE

           Rush forward -- SHOOTING soldiers as they break from cover.

                                 WOLFE
                        TANGO DOWN!

           NEWELL

           CHARGES forward to assist -- bullets WHIZZING past -- A
           GRENADE rolls through his feet -- BOUNCES off a body and --
           BOOOOOM -- the explosion CHUCKS Newell into the wall.

           JONES

           Rushes from the smoke -- TAGGING the last three soldiers.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Lou -- you OK?

           Newell picks himself up -- dusts himself off.

                                 NEWELL
                        Nothin' broken, nothin' bloody.

           Delta continues into

           THE OVAL OFFICE

           Searching through the destruction for their target.  

                                 NEWELL
                        Anyone even know what he looks like?

           Then sweep out into

           THE ROOSEVELT ROOM

           Where TWO DOZEN CIVILIANS are bound and gagged.
                                 NEWELL
                        We're looking for the Speaker of the
                        House.  Richard Titmus.  Have you
                        seen the Speaker --

           RICHARD TITMUS, the paunchy yet fearsome Speaker of the House
           SHOUTS OUT from under his gag.  Carter and Wolfe untie him.

                                 NEWELL
                        Mr. Speaker, we're here to extract
                        you.  To get you to safety.

                                 TITMUS
                        And the others?

                                 NEWELL
                        Gonzo, Carter, untie them -- fast as
                        you can --

           Carter and Gonzalez have gotten three hostages untied when
           Myra's PIP cuts in --

                                 MYRA
                        Cowboy, I've ID'd the bogies hit the
                        Capital Building -- decommissioned
                        Super Hornets, loaded for hell.  Got
                        'em on a trajectory coming right
                        back at Whiskey Hotel.  You got two
                        minutes to be somewhere else.

           The rest of the hostages plead with their eyes.  The decision
           crushing down on Newell.

                                 NEWELL
                        Secure the Speaker -- we're Oscar
                        Mike.

           Newell leads as Carter and Jones pull Titmus toward the exit.

                                 WOLFE
                        We can't just leave these people
                        here.

                                 NEWELL
                        The Speaker is the mission -- his
                        safety is essential.  Delta, from up --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- We can't just leave them here --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- This isn't a goddamn democracy. 
                        These are your orders.  Now form the
                        fuck up and --
                             -- [Footage Missing] -- 
           EXT.  ROSE GARDEN - NIGHT (JONES)

           Delta, Titmus and the three hostages bolt across the White
           House lawn.  To the south, DC in ruins.  East and West,
           sustained fighting.

                                 NEWELL
                        Find some cover!

           Jones looks back over his shoulder--  Trips--  Falls onto
           his back--  Scrambling to get to his feet when--

           -- FWOOOOOOM --

           We hear them before we see them--

           THREE F-18 SUPER HORNETS--  Moving fast--

           Flashing overhead--  Dropping BLU-109 "PENETRATOR" BUNKER
           BUSTERS onto the White House--

           You have never been this close to an explosion this big.

           The White House crumbles--  Dissolves--  The FIREBALL reaches
           into the sky--  The SHOCKWAVE ripples out--

           The VRD flashes.  The image frays.  Splits.  Static. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY (NEWS BROADCAST)

           A well-dressed stage.  Flags on either side.  A podium at
           the center.  Presidential seal.

           GENERAL MAXWELL BUTLER, in full military dress, walks to the
           podium.  Gathers himself.  Looks into the camera.  Somber.

                                 BUTLER
                        My fellow Americans.  I am General
                        Maxwell Butler.  The last twenty-
                        four hours have seen an unprecedented
                        attack on American soil.  I have the
                        unfortunate responsibility to inform
                        you that President Edward Wilson is
                        among the dead.  Along with Vice
                        President Smith, the Joint Chiefs
                        and many other high ranking officials
                        within our government.  Our way of
                        life has been compromised.  Our
                        infrastructure debilitated.

                                 BUTLER (CONT'D)
                        I am now personally in command of
                        our armed forces.  As well as our
                        Nuclear arsenal.  I have called for
                        the enactment of marshal law until
                        such a time that your safety can be
                        guaranteed.  I will act, in the
                        interim, as your commander in chief. 
                        Until such a time, where I can pass
                        this responsibility onto a lawful
                        and willing successor.  I know you
                        must have a lot of questions I cannot
                        answer at this time.  But know this. 
                        Your country still stands strong. 
                        God bless you all.  God bless America.

           He steps off the podium.  Walks off the stage.  The image
           blurs--  Pixelates--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A TRAIN PLATFORM

           Abandoned.  Silent.  We're clearing a corner.  No contact.

           EXT.  SUBURBAN METRO STATION - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta and Titmus creep down the platform.  Spattered in blood
           and dust.

           A stalled COMMUTER TRAIN is visible down the tracks. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Gonzo, cover -- everyone else, take
                        five.

           Myra's PIP opens.  She and her team have moved into what
           appears to be a BUNKER.

                                 MYRA
                        Little less than twenty miles, now. 
                        Straight shot to the RV in Manchester
                        with Charlie Company. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Don't tell General Butler -- and
                        it's not that I'm complaining -- but
                        that's a long fucking hike for
                        extraction.

                                 MYRA
                        Harden up, cowboy.  Would if I could
                        be out there with you.
                                 NEWELL
                        That right?

                                 MYRA
                        Sure.  Started in the field.  Company
                        desked me after losing an argument
                        with a Somalian land mine.

           Myra props her leg up on the desk.  Pulls her jeans back to
           reveal a prosthetic leg from the knee down.

                                 NEWELL
                        Used to be a roughneck?  Just like
                        us?

                                 MYRA
                        But you know, with breasts.

           Myra winks.  The PIP closes.

           Delta enjoys their moment of rest.  Carter checks his rifle. 
           Titmus prays.  Gonzalez has a thought --

                                 GONZALEZ
                        -- Tell you -- first time I've ever
                        been glad to hear Rangers were on
                        their way.

           Wolfe walks to the end of the platform.  Stares at the
           abandoned train.  Shakes his head.

                                 WOLFE
                        Screw this...

           He walks toward Newell.  Indignant.

                                 WOLFE
                        What are we doing?

                                 NEWELL
                        Getting the Speaker to safety --

           Wolfe presses closer.  Right in Newell's face.

                                 WOLFE
                        -- Cause if you hadn't noticed --
                        the world has changed.

                                 NEWELL
                        But not our place in it.

                                 WOLFE
                        Which is what, exactly?
                                 NEWELL
                        Doing good.  Serving.  Protecting.

                                 WOLFE
                        After last night, who's to say how
                        that compass points?

                                 NEWELL
                        Myra --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- Is civilian.  And the men we're
                        legally obligated to obey?  They're
                        all dead!

                                 CARTER
                        Hey bro, maybe turn it down a notch.

           Wolfe turns on Carter.  Nostrils flaring.

                                 WOLFE
                        Bro?  Bro?  Are you kidding me?  Who
                        the fuck do you think you're talking
                        to?

                                 CARTER
                        I didn't mean anything --

           Wolfe pushes Carter back.  Stands his ground.

                                 WOLFE
                        -- Lou, I swear to Christ -- Aryan
                        Brotherhood over here opens his mouth
                        again, I'm gonna zero him out.

                                 NEWELL
                        He didn't mean --

                                 CARTER
                        -- Honestly, I didn't mean anything --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- Carter, shut up.  He didn't mean
                        anything, OK?  Cool it, both of you. 
                        You took a goddamn oath.

                                 WOLFE
                        To my country.  Not to Butler.  And
                        as much as I respect the man --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- All he's doing is what's best --
                        GONZALEZ
                                                     WOLFE
                -- Maybe we should
                take a minute --
                                             -- He might as well be the
                                             Five-Star General of Hogan's
                                             Heroes, all it matters --  

                        NEWELL
                -- One more word --
                                                     WOFLE
                                             -- And it's a new world
                                             order out there --

                        NEWELL
                -- Very thin ice --
                                                     WOLFE
                                             -- Cause the way I math
                                             it, you just let twelve
                                             innocent people die to
                                             save one worthless prick
                                             who's total worth to the
                                             union could be measured on
                                             an atomic scale --

           Newell snaps.  Punches Wolfe across the jaw.  Jumps on him
           as he falls.  Gonzalez pulls them apart.

                                 WOLFE
                        Brilliant.  Yeah, no, great fucking
                        leadership.

                                 NEWELL
                        Nothing has changed.  You are a cog
                        in the machine.  You do not breathe
                        but for the greater good. 

                                 WOLFE
                        And when's that line gets crossed?
                        From greater good to lesser evil?

           Newell doesn't have an answer.  Gathers his equipment.

                                 NEWELL
                        Three-One!  Oscar-fucking-Mike!

           Newell walks off.  Carter and Titmus quickly follow.

           Gonzalez and Jones are twenty feet behind.  Gonzalez stops
           when he realizes Wolfe hasn't moved.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        How much you'd hate yourself -- find
                        out any of us died trying to keep
                        him alive?

           Wolfe waits as long as possible, then jogs to catch up.
           EXT.  PARK - DAY (JONES)

           Delta on the move.  Birds are the loudest sound for miles. 
           Signs of a protest from the day before litter the ground.

           Titmus wanders up to Newell and Jones.

                                 TITMUS
                        Thanks for...back there...

                                 NEWELL
                        It's my job.

                                 TITMUS
                        Anyway, didn't have stick up for me
                        like you did.

                                 NEWELL
                        Yes.  I did.

           The trio walk in silence for a moment.

                                 TITMUS
                        You know this General?  Butler?

                                 NEWELL
                        We're typically deployed from his
                        corps at Fort Jackson.

                                 TITMUS
                        Not yesterday?

                                 NEWELL
                        On a training exercise.

                                 TITMUS
                        Lucky me.
                            (a thought)
                        I guess what I mean is, you know him
                        personally?

           Newell stops.  Delta forms up around them.

                                 NEWELL
                        I was his radio bitch in Kandahar. 
                        Gonzo his driver.  Wolfe spent time
                        as his aide on Capital Hill.  Carter's
                        sister got married to his second
                        cousin's nephew or some shit.  Did I
                        get that right?
                                 CARTER
                        Aw, shucks Lou -- back home we lose
                        track of that sort of thing pretty
                        quickly.

                                 TITMUS
                            (to Jones)
                        You?

                                 JONES
                        Never met the man, myself.

                                 TITMUS
                        Can we trust him?  To do what's right?

                                 NEWELL
                        'Bout as much as we can trust you.

           Wolfe raises his fist.  Points across the park.  Delta moves
           into cover, hiding.  Jones drags Titmus into the brush. 

           A HUMVEE, packed with PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS drives past. 

           Jones presses his hand over Titmus' mouth.  Staring down
           into his frightened eyes.  

           No one even thinks about moving...  Were they seen...?   
           The humvee disappears over a hill.  No contact.

           EXT.  OVERPASS - DAY (JONES)

           Delta move under a highway.  Jones bringing up the rear. 
           Steps echoing around him.

           As they emerge out into the light, Jones takes out his cell
           phone.  Holds it up to the sky, can't find a signal.

           Scrolls through his CONTACTS to HOME.  Hits SEND, hoping
           against hope.  Nothing.  Not even a busy tone.  The signal
           is just dead.  He jogs to catch up with Delta.

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DUSK (JONES)

           Delta moves down the street.  FACES peek from inside houses.

                                 MYRA
                        <RV is an industrial lot at the north
                        end of town.  Exfil is about two
                        hours out.>

           Gonzalez, first at the corner, holds his fist in the air. 
           Delta drops, everyone covers.  Newell moves forward to meet
           Gonzalez.  Jones steps up behind.
                                 NEWELL
                        -- How many?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Seven at first look.

                                 NEWELL
                        No one saw you?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        We're still alive, aren't we?

           Jones crouches low.  Moves forward.  Peering 

           AROUND THE CORNER

           Where PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS have built a FORTIFIED MACHINE
           GUN NEST at the top of a hill.  Guarding the neighborhood. 

           Myra's PIP appears as she rolls her chair across the room.

                                 MYRA
                        What?  What is it...  Oh.

                                 NEWELL
                        LZ is FUBAR.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        What the hell are they even doing
                        here?

                                 MYRA
                        Town must be on a resupply line.

                                 NEWELL
                        We'll go around the long way.

                                 WOLFE
                        Let these assholes go?  Business as
                        usual?

                                 NEWELL
                        We don't have time --

                                 MYRA
                        -- Sergeant Wolfe's right.  LZ is
                        too close, you'll need to pop that
                        nest before Charlie Company can land.

                                 WOLFE
                        Come on, boss.  We've seen worse
                        before breakfast.

           Newell motions for the team to huddle up.
                                 NEWELL
                        Wolfe cuts power to the block.  That's
                        our go.  Gonzo, you have the comm
                        tent, then flank from the right with
                        the XM-25.  Jones and I will come at
                        them from above on the left.  Carter's
                        on overwatch.

           Newell moves to Titmus, covered between two garden walls.

                                 NEWELL
                        No matter what happens.  No matter
                        what.  You stay flat on the ground. 
                        Until one of us comes to get you.  

                                 TITMUS
                        Won't be difficult. 

           Newell turns back to Delta.  Gonzalez works on assembling
           the sleek XM-25 RECOILLESS ORDNANCE LAUNCHER.

                                 NEWELL
                        You got that piece of DARPA shit
                        working right?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Fifty billion dollar agency, you'd
                        think it would be worth more than
                        one shot.

                                 NEWELL
                        Only boomer we got big enough to
                        take out that nest.  Get as close as
                        you can.  Make it count.  
                            (to Delta)
                        We're radio silence.  Myra calls the
                        plays.  Jones, on me.

                                 GROUP
                        Hu-ah.

           Newell and Jones move

           DOWN THE STREET

           Sticking to the shadows.

                                 MYRA
                        <Scanning Tangos.>

           The VRD lights up as the ENEMY MERCENARIES are targeted up
           and down the street.

           Newell CLIMBS the side of a house.  Jones follows.
           EXT.  STREET CORNER - DUSK (CARTER)

           Carter climbs into the upper branches of a tree.  Scopes the
           nest at the end of the street.

                                 MYRA
                        <Overwatch in position.  Looks like
                        we have a sentry coming up on your
                        three.>

           Carter shifts positions.  Sights a pair of SOLDIERS rounding
           the corner.  On an intercept to his perch.

           EXT.  ADJACENT CUL-DE-SAC - SAME TIME (WOLFE)

           Wolfe sneaks to the end of the cul-de-sac and plants a CHARGE
           at the base of a TELEPHONE POLE.

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOPS - SAME TIME (JONES)

           Moving at speed.  Jumping between houses.  Jones and Newell
           make their way to the last house on the block.  Overlooking
           the fortification.  Below, SOLDIERS chat.

           EXT.  STREET CORNER - SAME TIME (CARTER)

                                 MYRA
                        <Mark and execute.>

           Carter FIRES -- two silenced rounds -- two perfect headshots
           from his concealed position in the tree.  The foot patrol
           drops into the shadow of the tree. 

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOPS - SAME TIME (JONES)

           Jones and Newell wait.  SIXTEEN TARGETS marked on the VRD. 

                                 MYRA
                        <Alpha in position. Gonzo clearing
                        the comms tent.  We're thirty seconds
                        from showtime.>

           EXT.  RADIO TENT - SAME TIME (GONZALEZ)

           Gonzalez circles around the outside of a COMMS TENT.  Set up
           on the street parallel to the fortification.

           A single TARGET is visible inside the tent.  The VRD tracks
           his movements.  Gonzalez draws a COMBAT KNIFE.  Waiting.
           As soon as the target's back is turned, Gonzalez RUSHES

           INSIDE THE TENT

           Moving silently on the balls of his feet.  Knife raised. 
           Coming up fast behind the soldier.  STRIKING --

           EXT.  BACKYARD - SAME TIME (WOLFE)

           -- And we hear the soldier's dying gasp over the radio.  

           Wolfe pushes a gate aside to reveal a POWER GENERATOR.  He
           SLAPS a charge on the side.

                                 MYRA
                        <We have three minutes of scramble
                        time on their radios.  Power reroutes
                        in four.  Everyone needs deading
                        before then.>

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - SAME TIME (FORTIFICATION CAMERA)

           Looking down the street.  We see the HOUSE to our right where
           Jones and Newell are hidden on the roof.

           We see the tree at the end of the block where Carter waits
           with his sniper rifle.  Maybe a glint in the branches.

           We see a glimpse of Gonzalez sneaking through the bushes to
           our left.  Gone in the blink of an eye.

                                 MYRA
                        <Counting.  Five.>

           WOLFE

           Peers around the corner.  Holds out a RADIO CONTROLLED
           CLACKER.  His fingers dance on the trigger.

                                 MYRA
                        <Four.>

           GONZALEZ

           Crawling through bushes.  Twenty yards from the nest.

                                 MYRA
                        <Three.>

           CARTER

           Exhales.  Won't breathe again until this is all over.
                                 MYRA
                        <Two.>

           JONES

           Snaps the safety from his rifle.  Newell winks at him.

                                 MYRA
                        <One.>

           THE FORTIFICATION CAMERA

           Unflinching--  Wait for it--

                                 MYRA
                        <Mark.>

           Multiple EXPLOSIONS--  The street lights up--  

           EXT.  STREET CORNER - SAME TIME (CARTER)

           Carter FIRES.  Five HEAD SHOTS in as many seconds. 

           The VRD flickers trying to keep up with his movements.

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOPS - SAME TIME (JONES)

           Below, the soldiers waste no time:

                                 SOLDIER
                        SNIPER!  SIX O'CLOCK!

           The MACHINE GUNNER lets loose a volley of fire --

           -- DUM-DUM-DUM--DUM-DUM-DUM --

                                 NEWELL
                        Go!

           -- Newell LEAPS from the roof.  Jones follows down into

           THE YARD

           Coming up on the nest's left flank.

           Newell FIRES--  Tango down--  Jones slides to cover behind a
           Volvo--  Stray bullets THUNK-THUNK off Swedish engineering--

           -- DUM-DUM-DUM --
           EXT.  STREET CORNER - SAME TIME (CARTER)

           -- DUM-DUM-DUM --

           -- The .50 CAL BULLETS rip through the tree.  A hurricane of
           TRACER BULLETS.  Carter PUSHES back.  Drops.

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - SAME TIME (GONZALEZ)

           Gonzalez flanks right.  SHOOTING two soldiers.  Moving fast.

           -- DUM-DUM-DUM--DUM-DUM-DUM --

                                 NEWELL
                        <Gonzo where are you?!?>

           Gonzalez SLIDES behind a garden wall--  SLAMMING into cover-- 
           Exchanging FIRE with a TRIO OF SOLDIERS guarding the nest--

           Wrestling with the XM-25--  Something's wrong--  It won't
           fire--

           EXT.  YARD - SAME TIME (JONES)

           Jones lays COVER for Newell.  Still advancing on the nest. 

           Two SOLDIERS wedge between them.  Cutting them off.

           SHOOTING -- Jones moves behind an SUV -- a soldier moves
           around for the kill -- Jones is trapped -- nowhere to go.

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - SAME TIME (WOLFE)

           Coming up fast behind Gonzalez--  .50 cal bullets WHIZZING
           in our periphery--  Shattering windows--  Ripping concrete--

                                 WOLFE
                        Give it!

           Gonzo tosses the XM-25 to Wolfe--  He wrestles with the round-- 
           Finally SLAMS it into place--  Yanks back on the safety bolt--

                                 WOLFE
                        Heads down!

           Wolfe shoulders the XM-25--  Aims--  WHA-BOOM!  It takes
           exactly .02 seconds from the time he pulls the trigger to
           when the machine gun nest EXPLODES in fire and ash.

           Dust and smoke and screams carry on the wind.
           EXT.  YARD - SAME TIME (JONES)

           Pops up from behind the SUV -- BRRDDT-BRRDDT!  Saving Jones
           at the last possible second.  

                                 NEWELL
                        Tangos down!

           Newell helps Jones to his feet as Carter, Gonzalez, and Wolfe
           move up the street to join them.

                                 NEWELL
                        Myra.  LZ is secure.  Get us the
                        fuck out of here.

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT (JONES)

           Down the block, FAMILIES frantically load cars and flee.

           Jones watches a YOUNG COUPLE run from their house, a single
           suitcase between them.  The wife is pregnant.  The husband
           helps her in the car.  They peel out down the driveway.

           Delta convenes nearby.

                                 NEWELL
                        Knocked on every door?

                                 CARTER
                        Ones that would answer.  Told 'em to
                        clear town, move as far west as
                        possible.

                                 NEWELL
                        We're forty minutes to exfil.  Double-
                        time.

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT (JONES)

           Delta moves between a pair of squat, industrial buildings. 
           Opens up onto an abandoned parking lot.

                                 NEWELL
                        Jones and Carter, overwatch.  Gonzo
                        and me on the Speaker.  Wolfe, sentry,
                        quarter mile each direction.

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL PARK - ROOF - NIGHT (JONES)

           Jones and Carter keeping an eye from above.  As Carter speaks,
           he never takes his eye away from the sniper scope. 
                                 CARTER
                        What's her name?  Your wife.

                                 JONES
                        Anne.  Annie. 

                                 CARTER
                        Where'd you meet?

                                 JONES
                        Bookstore.

                                 CARTER
                        Smart girl, huh?

                                 JONES
                        She married me.

                                 CARTER
                        Couldn't be more in love, right? 
                        Finish each other's sentences?

                                 JONES
                        Yeah. 

                                 CARTER
                        Kid?

                                 JONES
                        One in the oven.  Seven months.

                                 CARTER
                        Well shit, son -- you got right to
                        work.

                                 JONES
                        Honeymoon in Bora-Bora.  What are
                        you gonna do?

                                 CARTER
                        You want to make it home alive?  You
                        put her out of your head.  Right
                        now.

           Carter pulls a hidden chain out from under his shirt.  A
           WEDDING BAND dangles from the end of it.

                                 CARTER
                        Trust me.

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT (NEWELL)

           Newell, Gonzalez, and Titmus wait in a drainage ditch. 
                                 NEWELL
                        Twenty minutes late...

                                 MYRA
                        <I've been assured they're on the
                        way.>

           Titmus blows into his hands.  Not cold, nervous.  Scared. 

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Everything be fine.  You're in good
                        hands, Mr. Speaker.

                                 TITMUS
                        Never wanted the job to begin with.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        That right?

                                 TITMUS
                        Charlie got cancer.  What was I gonna
                        do, turn it down? 
                            (a thought)
                        Now first in line for President? 
                        Talk about pressure.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Greatness finds both the king and
                        peasant equally unprepared.

                                 NEWELL
                        Smartest thing I've ever heard you
                        say, Gonzo.

                                 TITMUS
                        Who was that?  Yeats?

                                 WOLFE
                        My dad.  Man loved to philosophize,
                        belting us at halftime.

           From somewhere distant, the familiar sound of a helicopter
           draws close.

                                 WOLFE
                        <Lights, half-mile up the road.>

                                 NEWELL
                        Myra, this our ride?

                                 MYRA
                        <Double-checking...>

                                 CARTER
                        <Eyes on, helo.  Looks Apache.>
           Newell climbs out of the drainage ditch.  Can't see anything
           from here.  Just the sound of the chopper growing louder.

                                 WOLFE
                        <Humvee on the ground.  Am I making
                        contact?>

                                 NEWELL
                        <Myra, what do you got?>

           Her PIP opens.  She's all smiles.

                                 MYRA
                        Just confirmed with Butler's command --
                        it's your ride.

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL PARK - LATER (NEWELL)

           Five minutes later.  The chopper circles overhead, spotlights
           searching the immediate vicinity.  As Carter and Jones join
           Newell, a HUMVEE turns the corner, comes to a stop.

           Wolfe and a CHARLIE COMPANY TEAM LEAD hop down from the car. 
           Shout over the chopper:

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        You Newell?

                                 NEWELL
                        Couldn't be more grateful, Captain.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        This the VIP?

           Newell pulls Titmus forward.  Introduces him.

                                 NEWELL
                        Not a goddamn scratch on him.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        Let's get you out of here.

           Delta moves for the humvee.  The team lead stops short.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        Sorry -- didn't make it clear.  We
                        got orders for VIP and Lieutenant
                        Newell only.  No room for the rest
                        of you.

                                 WOLFE
                        You're fucking kidding --
                                 NEWELL
                        -- I'm not leaving my men out in the
                        field.  Take the speaker, we'll
                        manage.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        Butler's orders.  You and the Speaker. 
                        Made it abundantly clear.

                                 NEWELL
                        I'm not going without my men.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        I'm sorry, Lieutenant.  It's an order. 

           Newell is conflicted.  Looks back and forth between the humvee
           and the rest of his team.  Finally: 

                                 NEWELL
                            (to Delta)
                        Stay put -- I'll have evac for you
                        if I have to steal the wheels myself.

           Delta nods.  The team lead helps Titmus into the humvee as
           Newell climbs 

           INSIDE

           And the door is quickly shut behind him.  Looking around--

           The DRIVER is dressed in the Paramilitary uniform.  A third
           SOLDIER, similarly masked, has his hand over Titmus' mouth
           and a knife to his throat.

           The team lead sits up front, and the driver starts away.

                                 NEWELL
                        What the fuck is going on?

           The team lead turns around in his seat.  Gun in hand.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        Butler said you'd understand. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Pretend I don't.

                                 TEAM LEAD
                        Isn't it obvious?  You're either
                        with us, or against us.

           EXT.  INDUSTRIAL PARK - SAME TIME (JONES)

           Delta stares.  Watching the humvee drive off.
                                 WOLFE
                        You fucking believe this?  He left
                        us here.  He fucking abandoned us.

                                 CARTER
                        Didn't really have a choice, did he?

           Then.  From inside the humvee.  Two flashes.  Two gunshots.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        The hell?

           The humvee slows.  Rolls forward.  Hits the side of a
           building.

           Delta moves forward.  Weapons out.  Above, the helicopter
           circles back around.

                                 CARTER
                        Lou?  Lou, you OK?

           Titmus falls out of the back seat.  Followed close behind by
           Newell.  Running toward them.  Waving.

                                 NEWELL
                        <Into cover!  Into cover!>

           The helicopter OPENS FIRE, raining bullets--  Splitting
           concrete--  Launching MISSILES--  They strike the side of a
           building--  EXPLODING in glass and mortar--

           Carter blind fires on the chopper--  As Delta runs for the
           drainage ditch--  Taking cover--

                                 NEWELL
                        <Knock that bird out of the sky!>

           Delta--  Turning as one--  UNLOAD on the chopper--  Not really
           doing any damage--  But scaring it--

           The Apache BANKS hard--  Gets caught in telephone wires--
           Struggling to break free--  Rotor broken--  Pulls the chopper-- 
           Into the side of the nearby office building--  WHA-BOOM!

           Delta is frozen in place.  Events of the last few minutes
           washing over them.  Coming down off the adrenaline.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Hey, Lou?

                                 NEWELL
                        Yeah?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        We're fucked, aren't we?
                                 NEWELL
                        Like a cheerleader at Prom.

           INT.  OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT (JONES)

           Delta waits in the dark.  Newell stands guard, looking out
           the bay of windows.  Wolfe paces.  Around them, the room
           settles.  Creaks. 

                                 WOLFE
                        What in the hell just happened --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- It's not like I'll have a better
                        answer for you if you keep repeating
                        the goddamn question.

                                 WOLFE
                        And we just sit here with our dicks
                        in our hands --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- Got a better idea?  Please,
                        Sergeant, I'm all ears.  What should
                        we do?

           Wolfe is silent.  Has no response.

                                 NEWELL
                        That's what I thought.

           Myra's PIP opens.  Her analysts at work behind her.

                                 NEWELL
                        Tell me you have good news.

                                 MYRA
                        More of a bad news, good news
                        situation.

                                 NEWELL
                        We're stuck out here?

           Myra nods.  The whole team deflates.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Suppose the good news is you just
                        saved fifteen percent on car
                        insurance.

                                 MYRA
                        Fuck.  I wish.  Actually, got someone
                        wants to speak with Delta Three-One.
           A SECOND PIP opens.  ADMIRAL CURTIS RAYMOND sits in front of
           the camera.  His hawkish features look overtired.  The signal
           cuts out every few seconds.

                                 MYRA
                        Here they are, Admiral Raymond.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Who am I -- speaking --

                                 NEWELL
                        First Lieutenant Tom Newell -- Delta
                        Three-One out of Fort Jackson.

                                 RAYMOND
                        -- Ah -- Jesus -- sorry --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- You're breaking up, sir.

                                 RAYMOND
                            (over shoulder)
                        -- Someone get -- goddamned signal
                        going -- before I -- right in the
                        ass!

           Behind him, TECHNICIANS rush to fix the problem.  After a
           beat, the signal steadies.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Look -- no easy way to say...  General
                        Butler -- Charlie Company --
                        spearheaded the attack on Washington. 
                        The country. 

           Delta is frozen at the news.  No one can believe it.

                                 NEWELL
                        A coup?

                                 WOLFE
                        Bullshit.

                                 NEWELL
                        No way.  Bit of a stretch any one
                        man could convince --

                                 MYRA
                        -- He's not alone.  Intel him backed
                        by another dozen high-ranking military
                        officials.  Army, Air Force, Navy,
                        FBI, Secret Service.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Blackriver, too.
                                 TITMUS
                        Blackriver?

                                 CARTER
                        Mercenary company, out of New Mexico --

                                 TITMUS
                        -- I know who they are.  Bodyguard
                        celebutauntes at award shows.

                                 MYRA
                        All due respect, Mr. Speaker.  That
                        was fifteen years ago.  Before the
                        wars.  Outfit's twenty-thousand strong
                        now, worth more than thirty billion.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Want to guess the name of the General,
                        sponsored their Congressional bid?

           Newell takes a seat.  Straight up mind-fucked.

                                 MYRA
                        We're guessing Butler's plan was to
                        disrupt the government long enough
                        to take control.  Now that the
                        "danger" has passed, martial law
                        keeps him in power.  Potentially for
                        months.  I doubt most his soldiers
                        even know they're on the wrong side
                        of things.
                            (beat)
                        The Speaker represents the greatest
                        threat to Butler's control right
                        now.

                                 NEWELL
                        Why?  Twenty-five years of service,
                        turn traitor...

                                 RAYMOND
                        Man's always been critical of the
                        way things were run.  Spin a wheel,
                        pick a complaint.

                                 CARTER
                        Sure, I mean -- hasn't been great
                        these last few years -- but Jesus,
                        if that ain't opening a can with a
                        rocket launcher...

           Raymond whispers to an aide over his shoulder before turning
           back to the camera.
                                 RAYMOND
                        We're staging a counter attack.

                                 NEWELL
                        Who, sir?

                                 RAYMOND
                        The rest of us.  Ones didn't betray
                        our country.

                                 NEWELL
                        There a lot of us?

           A long silence.  Says more than a thousand words.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Enough.  I got twelve destroyers and
                        sixteen carriers off the Long Island
                        sound.  Seven thousand marines dying
                        to get rowdy. 

                                 NEWELL
                        What's the plan?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Don't have one yet.  Not until we
                        can verify Butler's location.

                                 NEWELL
                        What can Delta do in the mean time?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Glad you asked.  Happens to be why
                        I'm calling.

                                 NEWELL
                        Sir?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Only way to get the public on our
                        side of this is to stand behind our
                        lawful Commander-in-Chief.  Need you
                        hard-asses to transpo the Speaker to
                        New York.  Harbor, actually.  City's
                        under Martial Law, but I trust you
                        can sneak him through.  Get him out
                        to the fleet.  

                                 TITMUS
                        Admiral, not sure I agree -- these
                        men all serve under Butler.
                                 RAYMOND
                        And they haven't killed you yet, so
                        I'd try not to question their loyalty
                        a second time.

                                 NEWELL
                        Getting to New York shouldn't be a
                        problem.

           Newell looks around at his team.  Jones nods immediately. 
           Followed by Gonzalez.  Carter, almost imperceptibly.  All
           eyes on Wolfe.  He doesn't answer, one way or the other.

                                 NEWELL
                        Admiral, Myra -- give us a minute?

           Myra nods.  The PIPs close simultaneously.

                                 NEWELL
                        Something to say, Sergeant?

                                 WOLFE
                        Like you said -- it's a little hard
                        to believe.  Butler --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- Just sent a team to kill the
                        Speaker.  Not to mention me --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- You even know this guy?  This
                        Admiral?

                                 NEWELL
                        Heard his name before.  Seen him on
                        C-SPAN.

                                 WOLFE
                        All we know, he's the one behind the
                        coup.  Or part of it.

                                 NEWELL
                        We start second-guessing everyone's
                        motivations, run out of friends damn
                        fast --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- So you just trust him?  Right out
                        of the gate?

                                 NEWELL
                        Thought you'd rather not sit here
                        with our dicks in our hands?
                                 TITMUS
                        You realize, this is treason.  Don't
                        you.  Us.  We're the rebels now.

           He's right.  Everybody knows he's right, too.

                                 NEWELL
                        The team is all we got.  Doesn't
                        change -- whether we're following
                        Myra or Butler or Raymond or Patton's
                        fucking ghost.  Team's all we've
                        ever had.  You keep him safe, I'll
                        keep you safe. 

           A long beat.  As Wolfe thinks it through.

                                 WOLFE
                        Suppose there's something to be said
                        for going down swinging...

           EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT (NEWELL)

           Delta and Titmus dress in UNIFORMS from the back of the
           humvee.  Wolfe approaches Jones, who's smiling ear to ear.

                                 WOLFE
                        What's that grin about, rook?

                                 JONES
                        Going home is all, sir.  New York.

           Wolfe cinches Jones' straps taut.  Makes him wince.

                                 WOLFE
                        Team first, family second.  Hu-ah?

                                 JONES
                        Hu-ah.

           But nothing is going to spoil his mood.  Goes back right on
           smiling as soon as Wolfe walks away.

           Gonzalez, behind the wheel, starts the engine.  

                                 NEWELL
                        Run OK?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Damage is mostly cosmetic, far as I
                        can tell.

           Wolfe pulls the bodies out of the humvee.
                                 NEWELL
                        Make sure to wipe the dash for blood. 
                        Seats.  Floor.  Best you can.

           Carter helps button up Titmus in his uniform.  Then slaps a
           .45 into the Speaker's hand.

                                 TITMUS
                        My constituency would disown me if
                        they ever found out -- I've never
                        held a gun, much less fired one.

                                 CARTER
                        And you won't ever have to.  OK?

           Titmus nods.  Tucks the gun down the back of his pants.

                                 NEWELL
                        Delta!  Mount up!

           INT.  HUMVEE - NIGHT (JONES)

           Speeding down the empty New Jersey Turnpike.  Gonzalez drives. 
           Eyes focused.  Newell scans a map.

                                 NEWELL
                        Goddamn -- a map of New Jersey does
                        not need to be this complicated.

                                 JONES
                        Want me to look?  I'm pretty good
                        with maps.

                                 NEWELL
                        No kidding -- I've been in Afghani
                        cave networks easier to navigate.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Heads up.  Incoming.

           FOUR HEADLIGHTS appear on the other side of the highway.

                                 NEWELL
                        Slow down.  No problem.  We belong
                        here.

           Gonzalez slows.  The cars come into view.  A STATION WAGON
           in front.  Followed close by a BLACK SUV.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Blackriver transpo.  Fully loaded.

           The fleeing station wagon CLIPS the median wall--  SPINS out-- 
           CRASHES!
                                 WOLFE
                        Stop!

           Gonzalez SLAMS the brakes.  Everyone watches as the Blackriver
           SUV slows and FOUR MERCENARIES jump out.  Weapons trained on
           the people inside the crashed station wagon.

                        BLACKRIVER MERC
                                                     GONZALEZ
                                             What do we do?
                Out of the car!  Hands
                in the air!

                                 NEWELL
                        Move on.  Not our concern.

                                 WOLFE
                        No.

                                 NEWELL
                        This isn't --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- They're going to kill them!

                                 NEWELL
                        Put it in drive, Gonzo.  Get us out --

           Wolfe draws his SIDEARM.

                                 WOLFE
                        You're not going to help?  Fine. 
                        But stay out of my way.

           Outside, the mercs drag three CIVILIANS from the station
           wagon.  Line them up on their knees for execution.

           Wolfe climbs out of the Humvee.  Jones looks

           OUTSIDE

           As the mercenaries become aware of Wolfe's presence.

                                 WOLFE
                        Need any help there?

                                 BLACKRIVER MERC
                        Just some runners -- we have it
                        handled --

           Wolfe SLINGS the assault rifle off his back -- SHOOTS all
           four mercs -- POP-POP-POP-POP --  turns on the SUV -- as the
           DRIVER tries to return fire -- Wolfe UNLOADS his clip.

                                 CARTER
                        Guy's a machine...
           Wolfe pulls the civilians to their feet.  Helps them into
           the SUV.  They thank him multiple time before driving away.

           Wolfe climbs back into the humvee.  Delta stares at him. 

                                 NEWELL
                        You ever pull a gun on me again,
                        endanger the mission --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- Country's gone tits-up -- they
                        are the mission.

           Newell freezes.  No way to tell how this is going to go.

                                 NEWELL
                        We're wasting the clock.  Drive. 

           Gonzalez starts the humvee back down the highway.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  HUMVEE - NIGHT (GONZALEZ)

           Ahead, a ROADBLOCK has been erected at a tollbooth spanning
           the highway.  SOLDIERS and SPOTLIGHTS.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        What do we do?

                                 NEWELL
                        Calm down.  We're fine.  I'll do the
                        talking.

                                 WOLFE
                        Better not.  Rook's wearing the bars
                        now.

           Everyone looks.  Realizes Wolfe is right.  Jones commandeered
           the Lieutenant's uniform.

                                 NEWELL
                        Alright.  Stay calm.  Hit a deer on
                        the highway.  We're on our way to
                        New York.  Be as vague as possible.

                                 CARTER
                        All it is is acting.  Ain't you ever
                        been in the school play before?

                                 JONES
                        Our Town -- junior high.  Broke into
                        a flop sweat and vomited on the front
                        row --
                                 NEWELL
                        -- Shitty play anyways -- here we go --

           Gonzalez pulls up to the checkpoint.  More than FORTY TARGETS
           appear in the VRD.  Armed.  Ready to disco.

           The POST CAPTAIN circles the humvee.  Kid couldn't be more
           than twenty.  Way out of his depth.  

           Jones lowers his window.  Gonzalez looks straight forward. 
           We only hear the following exchange behind us:

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        -- No word we had anybody comin'
                        through tonight.

                                 JONES
                        Change of plans.

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        What happened to your ride?

                                 JONES
                        Goddamn dear, jumped out in front of
                        us few miles back.  Can't see shit
                        in this dark.

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        You're telling me...
                            (beat)
                        Got IDs for everybody?

                                 JONES
                        Running late as is.  Get someone in
                        New York on the horn.  They'll let
                        us through.

           IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR

           We see the post captain shine his light on each man's face. 
           Holds on Titmus.  Does he recognize him...?

           AHEAD

           More GUARDS have started to take an interest in the scene. 
           Moving closer.  Suspicious. 

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        Lieutenant, is that blood on your
                        uniform?

           We can feel Newell wince...  Delta holds its breath... 
           Brutally long seconds tick past...  Then... 
                                 JONES
                        Lost a man back in Washington.

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        Oh, shit.  Sorry to hear.

           Newell slowly draws his sidearm.  Still as glass.

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        New York? 

                                 JONES
                        That's right.

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        I ask?  Purpose of your mission?

                                 JONES
                        No you may not.

           Another long pause.  Newell chambers a round and --

                                 POST CAPTAIN
                        LET 'EM THROUGH!

           The guards back off.  Soldiers raise the gate.  Gonzalez
           drives through.  Back out on the open road.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Cabron, you got brass ones the size
                        of a Tijuana truck stop.

           A look in the mirror reveals Jones more surprised than anyone.

                                 CARTER
                        Lost a man in Washington?  You believe
                        this guy?

                                 NEWELL
                        Don't celebrate just yet.  Long way
                        to the city.

           INT.  HUMVEE - LATER (JONES)

           Still on the Jersey turnpike.  Trenton is visible to the
           west, but the power is off.  It's unnerving to see.

           Myra's PIP is open.  In the middle of a conversation.

                                 MYRA
                        -- Satellites show smooth sailing
                        from there to Lower Manhattan.  We're
                        coordinating an RV with the Admiral's
                        longboat as we speak.
                                 NEWELL
                        'preciate it.  How you holding up?

                                 MYRA
                        Ask me again tomorrow.

           Her PIP closes. 

           Titmus turns to Jones in the back.  Whispers:

                                 TITMUS
                        You're new to the team?

                                 JONES
                        That's right.

                                 TITMUS
                        Never worked directly for General
                        Butler?

                                 JONES
                        I'd trust every one of them with my
                        life, if that's what you're asking.

                                 TITMUS
                        Don't have that luxury.  Right now --
                        you -- you're the only I can trust.

           INT.  HUMVEE - LATER (JONES)

           Manhattan is visible on the horizon.  Instead of the typical
           skyline, the city is filled with SPOTLIGHTS and HELICOPTERS. 
           Otherwise, the place is completely dark.

                                 NEWELL
                        -- Myra?  We have eyes on New York. 
                        Crossing Staten Island now.  ETA,
                        one hour and --

           Around the bend, another ROAD BLOCK comes into view.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Shit --

           Myra's PIP opens.  She and her team distracted six ways.

                                                     WOLFE
                                             -- Another one?
                        MYRA
                -- We're coordinating
                with the fleet --

                                 MYRA
                        Another one what?
                                 NEWELL
                        Road block.

                                 MYRA
                        Satellites show no activity near
                        your location.

                                 NEWELL
                        Someone's feeding you bullshit intel.

                                 MYRA
                        Which means someone knows where we
                        are.  Shit --

           Myra closes the PIP.  

           Gonzalez rolls to a stop at the post.  BLACKRIVER MERCS,
           fifty all told, circle the humvee.

           The BLACKRIVER SERGEANT, a jarhead-wannabe washout, approaches
           the back window.  Toothpick in mouth.

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        Destination?

                                 JONES
                        New York.  Midtown. 

           The sergeant gives him a look: "Well of course, New York..."

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        Purpose?

                                 JONES
                        Classified, sergeant.

           A merc SHOUTS something from one of the guard towers.  We
           can't hear the words, but the sergeant turns away to talk.

           Up front, Newell once again preps his sidearm.

                                 NEWELL
                        ...On my mark, Gonzo...

                                 GONZALEZ
                        ...Way ahead of you...

           The sergeant comes back to the window.

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        Sorry about that.  Just need a scan --
                        get you on your way.

           The sergeant takes out a HANDHELD RETINAL SCANNER.
                                                     WOLFE
                                             ...Movement on the right...
                        JONES
                Y-yeah...  Sure... No
                problem.

           Jones holds his eye to the scanner.  It BEEPS after the scan.

                        BLACKRIVER
                        SERGEANT
                                                     NEWELL
                                             ...I see it...
                Takes a minute for the
                results.

           The sergeant shines his light inside the humvee.

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        How's everyone doing tonight?

           Delta mutters their responses.

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                            (re: the smashed hood)
                        Saw some action?

                                 JONES
                        D-dear -- crossing the highway...

                                                     WOLFE
                        BLACKRIVER
                        SERGEANT
                                             ...We're fucked...
                This time of year? 
                Really? 

           He shines his light on the blood stains on Jones' uniform.

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        You get shot, Lieutenant?

                        JONES
                Not my blood.
                                                     NEWELL
                                             ...Calm down...

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        How 'bout your bullet hole?

           The sergeant leans in.  Sticks his finger through a bullet
           hole in Jones' uniform.

                                 JONES
                        R-r-ripped it on...

           A BLACKRIVER MERC runs up.  Whispers in his sergeant's ear. 
           The humvee is surrounded from every angle. 

                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        Lieutenant, you do me a favor --
                        step out of the vehicle please.

           Jones looks at Newell.  He imperceptibly shakes his head.
                                 BLACKRIVER SERGEANT
                        -- I won't ask again -- step out of
                        the vehicle please, Lieutenant --

           The sergeant reaches for his sidearm--  Wolfe leans across
           the seat and--  BAM!  Shoots the sergeant point blank!

                                 NEWELL
                        Gonzo, now!

           Gonzalez PEELS OUT -- SMASHING through the roadblock --
           running over mercenaries as they FLIP off the hood and roof.

           The rest OPEN FIRE on the humvee -- bullets PING off the
           armor-plated doors and windows.

           Out the back window--  Mercs climb into SUVs to give chase--

                                 NEWELL
                        Away from the city!

           Gonzalez CUTS the wheel--  A sharp turn down an interchange--

           The pursuing vehicles close the gap--  

           MERCS lean from windows.  FIRING in patterned bursts-- 

           Titmus COVERS his ears, screaming--  

           Carter leans from the window, RETURNING FIRE--

           Gonzalez SWERVES--

           Jones YANKS Carter back inside as an SUV speeds past -- inches
           from decapitation!

           Wolfe climbs up to the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN--  FIRING!  

           The THUNDER of the .50 cal ECHOES through the humvee--

           An SUV paces -- SIDESWIPES the humvee -- Titmus is KNOCKED
           back -- CRACKING his head -- OUT COLD --

           Newell TOSSES Jones a freshly loaded XM8--

                                 NEWELL
                        GO FOR THE TIRES!  TAKE OUT THEIR
                        FUCKING LEGS!

           Jones leans from the window -- PEPPERING the closest SUV --
           the VRD glitches -- Jones is blinded by DIGITAL NOISE.

                                 JONES
                        MYRA!  GET THIS SHIT TURNED OFF RIGHT
                        NOW!  I CAN'T SEE A GODDAMNED THING!
           The VRD switches off--  

           Jones is now staring down the barrel of a MERCENARY'S gun--
           He DUCKS back inside--  

           As Carter jams his collapsible RIOT SHIELD out the window-- 
           CHA-CHUNK!  Covering them--  Bullets THUNK-THUNK-THUNK into
           the shield--

           Jones--  Low in the seat--  JAMS a new clip into his rifle--

           Blind firing from behind the shield--  When the SUV swerves--

           CAROMS OFF THE MEDIAN -- CLIPPING THE HUMVEE -- SPINNING OUT --
           LESS THAN TEN FEET AWAY -- ROLLING END OVER END IN A TWISTED
           WRECK OF METAL AND GLASS!

                                 NEWELL
                        Incendiary grenades!

           Newell opens a cache of explosives from under his seat.  

           Gonzalez--  Checking the mirrors--  SWERVES side to side-- 
           As the pursuers attempt to box in the humvee.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        EIGHT AND FOUR!  EIGHT AND FOUR!

           Jones--  FIRES on the nearest SUV--  The shots nearly
           impossible to make--  Mostly luck at this point--

           Above--  Wolfe runs out of .50 cal ammo--  Slides back inside-- 
           Working quick to reload the machine gun--

                                 NEWELL
                        RPG!

           FWOOM!

           A rocket-propelled grenade EXPLODES--

           RATTLING the humvee--

           KNOCKING them off course--

                                                     NEWELL
                        CARTER
                He's reloading!
                                             Do not slow down!

           Newell TUGS the pin from a grenade and--

                                 NEWELL
                        Three -- two -- one --

           TOSSES it out the window--  EXPLODING in front of an SUV-- 
           RIPPING up the concrete--  But missing its target--
                                 WOLFE
                        GOING BACK UP!

           FWOOM!

           Another RPG hits -- this one closer -- Gonzalez SPEEDS through
           the smoke -- rubble CLATTERS off the roof.

                                 NEWELL
                        Three -- two -- one --

           Second GRENADE out the window--  This one HITS--  Catching
           the back end of the SUV--  EXPLODING in twenty-foot flames--

           Wolfe OPENS FIRE with the .50 cal--  Takes out the next SUV--
           CRASHES into three other vehicles before coming to rest--

           The back window SHATTERS--  Bullets RIP through the humvee--
           RICOCHET inside--  One CLIPS Gonzalez in the side--

                                 GONZALEZ
                        FUCK!

           As he SPASMS--  The humvee jerks wide--  And--

           WE'RE CRASHING THROUGH A METAL BARRIER-- 
           OFF THE HIGHWAY-- 
           INTO OPEN AIR-- 
           TWENTY FOOT DROP--

           GRILL SMASHES INTO CONCRETE-- 
           EVERYONE INSIDE THROWN FORWARD-- 
           HUMVEE SUSPENDED VERTICALLY-- 
           THUDDING BACK ONTO ITS WHEELS...

                                 NEWELL
                        ...Everyone OK?

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Clipped my side -- bleeding bad.

                                                     CARTER
                        WOLFE
                They're circling back.
                                             Coming down the off-ramp.

                                 NEWELL
                        The Speaker?

                                 CARTER
                        Still breathing.

           Gonzalez TWISTS the key.  But the humvee won't start.  We
           hear the METAL GRINDING of a dead engine.
                                 WOLFE
                        Thirty seconds!

                                 NEWELL
                        Firing zones!  Cover!

           Jones opens the door and jumps

           OUTSIDE

           Using the humvee to lay down suppressive fire as Wolfe UNLOADS
           from the mounted gun.  

           The three pursuing SUVs slam brakes fifty yards away.  MERCS
           climb out.  Take cover.  Return fire.

                                 JONES
                        We need to get this fucking thing
                        moving right now!

           Newell opens that sleek black briefcase he's been carrying
           around.  Inside: a SUITCASE DRONE.  Newell drops the drone
           on the ground, as wings UNFOLD and microscopic engines FIRE.

                                 NEWELL
                        COVERING FIRE!

           Newell controls the drone from a proprietary laptop.  The
           drone gains speed down the highway.  Finally LIFTS OFF and
           disappears into the night sky.

           As Jones SLAMS a new clip into his rifle--

                                 CARTER
                        RPG!

           Jones SPINS out from behind cover -- FIRING -- CLIPPING the
           merc -- just as he fires -- the RPG goes wide --

           -- EXPLODES beside Jones -- and we RAG DOLL through the air --
           over the highway -- into a drainage ditch --

           For a moment.  Jones is motionless.  We're motionless. 
           Staring up into the night sky.  Everything is silent as the
           audio sensors and microphones switch off.

           Then.  Muffled.  The sounds of the battlefield FILTER back
           into existence.  All around us.  The VRD slowly reboots.

           But we do not move.  Or make a sound.  Are we dead?

           Wolfe appears.  Standing over us.  Leaning down.  Smiling. 

                                 WOLFE
                        Still with us, rook?
           Wolfe grabs Jones--  DRAGGING him back toward the humvee--

                                 WOLFE
                        Rook's breathing!

                                 NEWELL
                        Cover your heads!

           Flashing across the night sky--  The Drone--  Firing on the
           Blackriver SUVs--  A package of VF1 VALKYRIE MICRO-MISSILES--

           KA-BOOOOM--  The SUVs explode--  One-two-three--  A shower
           of fire and glass and metal!  

           Carter and Newell LAY FIRE on the surviving mercenaries. 
           Wolfe loads Jones into the humvee.  Gonzalez prays in Spanish.

                                 GONZALEZ
                        Please.  Turn this damn car over. 
                        Just this once.  Never say another
                        unkind thing about you --

           The humvee turns over.  The engine CHOKING to life.

           Newell and Carter jump back inside.  Gonzalez PEELS out. 
           Tearing off down the highway.  Mercenaries FIRING after them --

                                 NEWELL
                        To that bridge -- across then --

           -- BAM!  A bullet hits the mark -- PUNCHING a hole in the
           back of Gonzalez's head -- FROSTING the dash with blood --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- SHIT --

           Gonzalez LURCHES forward--  Foot JAMMED to the gas pedal-- 

                                 NEWELL
                        Hold on to --

           The humvee HITS the guardrail--  SMASHES through--  Back out
           into open air--  Below us, there is nothing but dark--

           --And an icy river some three hundred feet below.

           Physics says this drop should take four seconds.  But because
           we're inside.  Because Jones is staring out the front window.  

           It feels like forever...

           The river rushing up to meet us--
           Slamming into the water--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           RAPID FIRE SHOTS

           As the camera flickers in and out:

           -- Water SURROUNDING Jones.

           -- His leg PINNED under the seat.

           -- Wolfe dragging Carter and Titmus behind him.

           -- Newell swimming to Jones.  YANKING his leg free.

           -- Below.  Gonzalez.  Dead.  Pulled into the dark of the
           river.  Deeper.  Further away.  The whites of his eyes the
           last thing we see before he disappears...

           EXT.  RIVER BANK - NIGHT (JONES)

           Splashing out of the water.  Crawling up the rocky shore. 
           Gasping for air.

           Nearby.  Wolfe gives CPR to Carter.  Titmus watches, head
           between knees, catching his breath.

                                 NEWELL
                        We're out of time.

                                 WOLFE
                        He's not breathing -- give me ten
                        seconds.

           Jones looks to the bridge above.  Headlights shine over the
           side.  Mercenaries lean over the rail, searching.

                                 JONES
                        They're right on us.

                                 NEWELL
                        Leave him.

                                 WOLFE
                        TEN FUCKING SECONDS!

                                 NEWELL
                        Goddamnit!  We don't --

                                 WOLFE
                            (quietly)
                        -- Please...
                                 (MORE)
                                 WOLFE (CONT'D)
                            (begging)
                        Just give him ten more seconds.

           Newell relents.  Nods.  They haven't been spotted.  Yet. 

           Wolfe compresses Carter's chest.  Switches to mouth-to-mouth. 
           No response.  Back to chest compressions.

           Myra's PIP opens.  The image is shaky, the VRD fizzles.

                                 MYRA
                        Delta -- you're back.  Signal strength
                        is weak.

                                 NEWELL
                        Took a swim.

                                 MYRA
                        That'd do it.  I'm shutting off the
                        systems so the batteries don't drain.

           Her PIP closes.  The VRD turns off.  For the first time in a
           while, we're seeing the world as it actually exists.

                                 MYRA
                        <Audio should still work.  I'm here
                        if you need me.>

                                 WOLFE
                        Come on, you stubborn racist prick!

           Wolfe finishes another round of compressions.  Moves in for
           mouth-to-mouth.  When.  Carter coughs, sputters, sits up.

                                 NEWELL
                        Get him on his feet, we need to move.

           A PAIR OF FLASHLIGHTS shine down on them.  Immediately, the
           mercenaries above OPEN FIRE.  Bullets rain down.

                                 NEWELL
                        Into the trees!  Now!

           Jones SPRINTS for the tree line fifty yards away.  Newell
           DUCKS behind a log -- laying COVER FIRE. 

           Wolfe helps Titmus run, Carter keeps close to their heels. 
           Jones a few feet behind them.

           The darkness of the forest SURROUNDS them.  The POP of gunfire
           more diffused with every step.

           Delta Three-One wheezes.  Coughs.  Runs.  Flat out.  No one
           even thinks about slowing.
           INT.  WOODS - NIGHT (JONES)

           Deep in the woods.  The gunfire all but stopped.  Delta takes
           a micro-rest as everyone catches their breath.

                                 CARTER
                        Gonzo?

           Newell shakes his head.

                                 CARTER
                        Kid always knew how to make me laugh.

                                 NEWELL
                        How many is that now?

                                 WOLFE
                        Five.

                                 TIMUS
                        Five what?

                                 NEWELL
                        That can't be right.

                                 WOLFE
                        Gonzo, the Colonel.  Bowman. 
                        Cartwright and Stedman. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Stedman.  Shit.  I forgot about him...

                                 TITMUS
                        Five what?

                                 WOLFE
                        K-I-A's. 

           Quiet.  A long moment.  Wolfe snaps his head, thinks he heard
           something.  Turns out it was nothing.

                                 NEWELL
                        We were doing so well.

                                 CARTER
                        Had a bad day is all.

                                 WOLFE
                        Whole world had a bad day.

           -- CHUNK --

           White-hot halogen light beams into the forest.
           CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK!

           More lights flash on.  Blinding the team.  From near pitch-
           black to Las Vegas strip in three seconds flat.

           Delta ducks behind trees.  Hidden in the slimmest of shadows.

                                 MERCENARY (O.S.)
                        Two-by-two!  Keep alert!  Do not
                        lose sight of the team next to you!

           Blackriver mercs appear.  Moving methodically.

           The light at their back, they have the perfect tactical
           advantage.  Casting long shadows across the ground.

                                 MERCENARY (O.S.)
                        Shoot to kill!

           Jones looks around.  Frantic.

           Newell and Carter are at the next tree over.  Slotting fresh
           clips into their rifles. 

           Titmus just beyond.  Covering his mouth so as not to scream.

           Wolfe is flat on the ground.  Caught in the open.  Covered
           by less than ten inches of brush.

           The mercenaries CRUNCH through dead leaves.  Ever closer.

                                 MYRA
                        <Stay still.  Could be hundreds of
                        them.>

           Stepping into view.  Ten mercs.  Halogen flashlights sweeping
           through the trees.  Delta stays hidden.  Unmoving. 

           The mercs continue forward.  Oblivious.  Missing our team.  

           A sigh of relief--  Then--  

           Thirty more mercenaries appear.

           It's only a matter of odds.  One of them is going to see
           Wolfe.  One of them is going to step on Wolfe.

           But.  Somehow.  They don't.  Somehow they all miss him.  By
           inches.  They continue on.  Moving deeper into the woods. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Delta.  On me.

           They convene on Newell, crouched low.
                                 NEWELL
                        Need a bearing into the city.

                                 MYRA
                        <North by Northeast.>

           Carter checks a compass.  Points in the direction of the
           Blackriver mercs.

                                 NEWELL
                        Perfect.  We move in their wake.

           EXT.  RED HOOK SHOPPING CENTER - NIGHT (JONES)

           Delta covers-and-moves through the parking lot.  Out across
           the bay, the STATUE OF LIBERTY stands in silhouette against
           the full moon.  Manhattan draws ever closer.

                                 MYRA
                        <Got a minute, Delta?>

                                 NEWELL
                        Not the best time --

           Myra's PIP opens.  She and her team are obviously distressed.

                                 MYRA
                        Change of plans.  A recon team on
                        the ground spotted Butler arriving
                        in the city forty minutes ago. 
                        Admiral Raymond and his fleet are
                        launching their attack.

                                 NEWELL
                        When?

                                 MYRA
                        Two hours, maybe less.

                                 CARTER
                        Then what?

                                 MYRA
                        They've decided the collateral damage
                        is worth the cost.

                                 WOLFE
                        Collateral -- what the hell are you
                        talking about?

                                 MYRA
                        Their gonna raze as many military
                        targets as they can.  Up and down --
                        from the Bronx to Brooklyn.
                                 NEWELL
                        Ah, Christ --

                                 JONES
                        -- The whole city --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- Can't be serious --

                                 JONES
                        -- It'll be a massacre --

                                 MYRA
                        -- Three-One should double back. 
                        Hole up somewhere.  Protect the
                        Speaker until it's all over.

                                 NEWELL
                        Thanks for the heads up.

                                 MYRA
                        Stay safe.

           Her PIP closes.  Newell is floored.

                                 NEWELL
                        Alright.  You heard her.  This is as
                        good a place as any.  Inside, Delta. 
                        Set up firing lines --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- No.

                                 NEWELL
                        Not this again.

                                 WOLFE
                        I won't stand by --

                                 JONES
                        -- My wife is still in the city --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- We could be inside the city,
                        marking targets --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- That's not our mission.  We protect
                        the Speaker.

                                 WOLFE
                        How many lives -- this is insane! 
                        He's one guy.
                                 NEWELL
                        Without him, we've already lost.

           Carter tries to move between them.  Newell pushes him away. 
           Gets right in Wolfe's face.

                                 WOLFE
                        Butler took what he wanted -- fuck
                        the cost -- and now we're willing to
                        follow him straight into hell --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- Stand down --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- It's exactly what he wants.  For
                        the rest of us to look like the bad
                        guys --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- One more time --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- If we let this happen -- we let
                        our people die just to get to this
                        prick -- we've lost.

           Wolfe backs away.  Looks around at the rest of Delta.

                                 WOLFE
                        Carter.  Rook.  I'm going into the
                        city.  Save as many lives as I can. 
                        Or you can stay here with the
                        Lieutenant.  For the greater good.

           Carter thinks it through.  Steps up beside Wolfe. 

                                 NEWELL
                        You'll die.  No way out of that city,
                        you get involved.

                                 CARTER
                        Suppose so.  But sitting out a fight? 
                        Not in my blood.

           All eyes turn on Jones.  He nods, then steps beside Wolfe.

                                 JONES
                        My wife, is all.  Can't get back to
                        her, least do everything I can to
                        keep her safe. 

           Newell stares back at his men.  Unexpected duplicity.
                                 NEWELL
                        Want to know why the old man never
                        gave you your own CAG?

                                 WOLFE
                        Cannot wait to hear.

           Newell steps in front of Wolfe.  His hand on his shoulder.

                                 NEWELL
                        It's cause I begged him to keep you
                        in Three-One.  Told him you were the
                        only guy, could ever keep me honest.

                                 WOLFE
                        You're coming?

                                 NEWELL
                        You know anybody else, do what we
                        do?

           Wolfe smiles.  Carter and Jones exhale.

                                 NEWELL
                        Mr. Speaker -- might be best you
                        stay here.  Keep low.

                                 TITMUS
                        Like hell.  Time came, I couldn't
                        defend myself.  You're stuck with me
                        until the end.

                                 NEWELL
                        Delta!  Oscar-Mike!

           Delta embarks.  Titmus hangs back for a second, realizing
           what he just said.  Then hustles to catch up.

           The image FLICKERS as we

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT.  BATTERY PARK HIGH RISE - DAWN (WEATHER CAMERA)

           Looking south.  The rising sun gleams off The Golden Sphere.

           The camera PANS.  A 360-DEGREE view of the Financial District. 
           HEAVY ARTILLERY has been set up on the roof.  SOLDIERS mill
           about, waiting to be relieved. 

           New York as an occupied police state.
           EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           A lower view of the city.  Cars abandoned up and down Park
           Drive.  Squads of INFANTRY move through the park in patterned
           patrol details.

           EXT.  GUARD TOWER - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           Midtown.  HEAVY ARTILLERY has been set up on every visible
           rooftop.  Scanning the skies.

           PERSONNEL CARRIERS and HUMVEES move up and down the streets. 
           Passing GUARD TOWERS every few blocks. 

           Across the street, a HUNDRED NEW YORKERS watch from a balcony. 
           Scared.  Huddled.  Trying to accept this new way of life.

           EXT.  MADISON AND 59TH - DAWN (TRAFFIC CAMERA)

           MACHINEGUN NESTS at the end of every street.  The APPLE STORE
           is nearly rubble, the site of what we can only imagine was
           an intense bit of fighting.

           An ABRAMS TANK rolls through the intersection.  Turning the
           corner, continuing its patrol route.

           Above.  TWO AC-130s (heavy, ground-attack aircraft) circle.

           EXT.  SKIES ABOVE BALTIMORE - DAWN (AC-130 TARGETING CAMERA)

           An INFRARED VIEW of Manhattan as seen from a mile above the
           ground.  Friendly units on the ground FLASH every few seconds. 
           Non-friendly targets appear as DARK BLACK SPLOTCHES.

           EXT.  WATER STREET SOUTH - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta Three-One is motionless in the shadow of the BROOKLYN
           BRIDGE as the AC-130s pass overhead.

                                 NEWELL
                        They come back for another pass, IR
                        owns us.

           Wolfe moves on point.  Delta ducks down an alley.  Methodical. 
           Precise. 

                                 MYRA
                        <Must be using some sort of RF chip
                        to ID ground forces.>
                                 CARTER
                        Meaning we could steal it?

           EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta approaches the GUARD POST set up across the south
           entrance to the bridge.  Moving as if on patrol.  As if they
           belong here.  BLACKRIVER MERCS on duty stare.

                        GUARD TOWER MERC
                                                     MYRA
                Here to relieve us?
                                             <Three.>

                        NEWELL
                                                     MYRA
                                             <Two.>
                Nope.  Called back
                into the city on who
                knows what.  Tell
                command, you need to
                take a piss.

                        GUARD TOWER MERC
                                                     MYRA
                                             <One.>
                Been pissing off the
                side, myself.

                                 MYRA
                        <Mark.>

           Moving as one--  Delta QUICK AIMS their rifles--  Silencers
           affixed--  Each taking a target--  THIP-THIP-THIP--

           The entire post is dead before the first casing falls.

           Delta convenes on the bodies.  Newell and Wolfe search
           pockets.  Jones and Carter cover.

                                 NEWELL
                        What am I looking for?

                                 MYRA
                        <Small card.  Plastic.  An ounce,
                        maybe less.  Could be in their
                        wallets, like a keycard.>

                                 WOLFE
                        Found one.

           Wolfe holds up a SMALL RF CHIP.  Size of a credit card.

                                 MYRA
                        <That's it.  Stick it in your pocket,
                        gunship won't be able to tell you
                        from Adam.>

                                 WOLFE
                        Now what?
           Newell looks at the BRIDGE TOWER across the water.

                                 NEWELL
                        Up.

           EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAWN (JONES)

           Running across the empty Brooklyn Bridge.  AIR RAID SIRENS 
           sound throughout the city. 

                                 NEWELL
                        Double-time, Three-One.

           EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE WEST TOWER - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta climbs the service stairway.  Rounds the last landing.

           A PAIR OF LOOKOUTS stand at the top of the stairs.  Watching
           the UPPER BAY with nervous eyes.  Backs to Delta.  Last
           mistake they'll ever make.

           Newell motions.  Wolfe moves beside him.  Reaching the
           lookouts simultaneously.  COVERING their mouths.  PLUNGING
           knives into spines.

                                 NEWELL
                        <Clear.>

           Jones, Carter and Titmus move to join them.  Cresting the
           top of the tower, a PANORAMA of the Financial District. 

           The sight of the occupied city is staggering.  Chilling.

                                 NEWELL
                        Delta Three-One, in position.

           Myra's PIP opens.  She is alone in her bunker.  Distracted. 

                                 MYRA
                        You mark targets, they'll be instantly
                        relayed to the fleet.

           From somewhere above Myra, there is a loud EXPLOSION.

                                 NEWELL
                        You OK?  What's happening?

                                 MYRA
                        The Huns are at the gates.  Safehouse
                        has been compromised. 

                                 NEWELL
                        How long you got?
                                 MYRA
                        Hour.  Maybe less.

                                 NEWELL
                        There was anything we could do...

           Myra's on the verge of tears.  But she's proud.  Strong.

                                 MYRA
                        Just finish the mission, cowboy. 
                        Command out.

           Her PIP closes.  Delta is silent.  

           The VRD reboots.  Carter scopes Wall Street in his rifle.

                                 NEWELL
                        Artillery is priority one.  Then,
                        guard towers, bunkers.  Technicals
                        after that.

                                 CARTER
                        On it.

           Carter moves quickly.  "TAGGING" an AA GUN on top of a
           building.  It lights up on the VRD.  He continues.

           There are hundreds of targets...

           Wolfe looks south.  Stares at GOVERNOR'S ISLAND.   The air
           raid sirens have become white noise in the background.

                                 WOLFE
                        We sure they're out there?  See
                        nothing but waves.

                                 NEWELL
                        Maybe we got lucky.  They called it
                        off.

                                 CARTER
                        Hey, Lou -- got a minute?

           Newell joins Carter at the edge of the tower.

                                 CARTER
                        The sports bar.

                                 NEWELL
                        What about it?

                                 CARTER
                        Eyes on AA.  STS missiles.  Whole
                        rat's nest on top of that roof.
           Newell uses a pair of BINOCULARS to scope the target.

                                 NEWELL
                        Mark the target then.

                                 CARTER
                        It's just...

                                 NEWELL
                        What?

                                 CARTER
                        Look again.  Blackriver's got
                        prisoners inside.

           Oh.  Shit.  Jones scopes the SPORTS BAR on the other side of
           the river.  The NUMB FACES of CIVILIAN PRISONERS look out. 
           From behind rebar and razorwire.

                                 NEWELL
                        Give us ten minutes, then mark it.
                        You got overwatch and the Speaker. 
                        You feel any heat, drop back to
                        Redhook for RV. 

           A single HOWITZER at the edge of Battery Park fires out across
           the bay.  Followed by another.  Then another.  The night sky
           quickly filled with ARTILLERY FIRE.  Loud.  Thundering. 

                                 NEWELL
                        And now we're running out of time. 
                        Oscar-fucking-Mike!

                                 JONES / WOLFE
                        Hu-ah!

           Jones glances over his shoulder one last time as the first
           of the INVASION ARMY enters the Upper Bay--

           EXT.  NAVY DROPSHIP - DAWN (FORWARD CAMERA)

           A fast boat.  Normally used to deliver a team of six Navy
           SEALs into hot zones.  Under the radar.

           But right now.  More than FIFTY ARMED MARINES wait on the
           forward deck as the boat slips through the bay.

           To our right and left.  More DROPSHIPS.  Three dozen more. 
           Keeping pace.  The first wave of the attack.

                                 DROPSHIP PILOT  (O.S.)
                        Landing zone ahead -- grid mark four-
                        seven-seven.
           The SERGEANT in charge paces.

                                 DROPSHIP SERGEANT
                        Gonna be hell -- check your targets --
                        enemy looks just like us --

           Half of the dropships break rank.  Turn up the EAST RIVER.

           EXT.  BATTERY PARK GUARD POST - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           The dropships grow on the horizon.  CHARLIE COMPANY and
           BLACKRIVER MERCENARIES rush to defensive positions.  

           The ALARMS are deafening down here.

           EXT.  BATTLESHIP RUSH - DAWN (TARGETING CAMERA)

           Infrared.  About two miles offshore.  The screen DIGITALLY
           ZOOMS toward ON-SCREEN TARGETS.

                                 OPERATOR  (O.S.)
                        Delta Three-One made it.  Targets
                        coming online.

                                 GUNNER  (O.S.)
                        Canons echo-four and echo-five.
                        Online.  Go, no-go for fire command.

           A long beat.  Finally:

                                 DECK COMMAND  (O.S.)
                        Go.  Marked targets only.  Watch for
                        friendlies.

                                 GUNNER (O.S.)
                        Solid copy.  Echo-four -- firing.

           EXT.  BATTERY PARK HIGHRISE - DAWN (WEATHER CAMERA)

           From here, our view of the battlefield is complete--  Invading
           forces from the south--  Defending forces entrenched--

           The HEAVY ARTILLERY rain destruction into the bay.  SOLDIERS
           run, reloading and firing as fast as their training allows.

           In the distance.  We can just make out the BATTLESHIP RUSH. 
           The rest of the fleet behind it --

           -- THOOM --

           A flash of light.  A streak of CANON FIRE.  And. 
           EXT.  DROPSHIP - DAWN (MARINE HELMET CAM)

           Straight ahead.  A quarter-mile away.  The high-rise is TORN
           IN HALF as the ACCELERATED RAIL CANON hits its target.

           The EXPLOSION is frightening...  The skyscraper CRUMBLES...

                                 SAILOR
                        Holy-fucking-shit!

           Our MARINE looks at his BUDDY.  Kid is scared shitless. 

                                 MARINE
                        Stay on me -- keep tight -- be fine.

                                 DROPSHIP SERGEANT
                        EYES FORWARD!  BARRELS --

           -- TRACER BULLETS tear through the dropship.  Killing everyone
           in the front line.  Blood spatters.  Salt water stings.

           Then.  An EXPLOSION--  The dropship rocks--  Tips on its
           side--  Water rushing on board--  We're blinded--

           EXT.  BATTERY PARK GUARD POST - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           .50 CAL MACHINE GUNS have opened fire--  

           But the invaders persevere--  Through the storm of bullets--

           The dropships CRASH onto dry land--  Unloading MARINES--

           -- THOOM --

           A block away--  Another building is DESTROYED by canon fire--  
           Covering the park in SMOKE and ASH--

           EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta Three-One runs behind the front line.  The battle taking
           place a few blocks away.  At the park.

           Above.  On a roof.  MOUNTED ARTILLERY fires--  SINKING
           dropships--  PASTING marines--

                                 NEWELL
                        -- STEP LIGHT!

           EXT.  UPPER BAY - DAWN (MARINE HELMET CAM)

           Churning water.  Screams of death.
           Our marine swims for his life.  Surrounded on every side by
           DYING COMRADES.  BULLETS crack into the water.

           Dust and ash cover his landing position. 

           The marine reaches a dock.  Pulls himself onto dry land. 
           Reaches back.  YANKS his buddy up from the crashing water.

           A second to gather themselves.  That's all they get.  Above
           and behind.  The blind DUM-DUM-DUM of a .50 CAL SENTRY GUN.

                                 MARINE
                        WE'RE TAKING OUT THAT FUCKING GUNNER'S
                        NEST, YEAH?

                                 BUDDY
                        ON YOUR SIX!

           Above.  The AC-130s pass overhead.  Moving across the harbor.
           Out toward the fleet.

           EXT.  EAST RIVER - DAWN (DROPSHIP CAMERA)

           The second stage of the attack.  The dropships moving up the
           east river.  Toward a landing zone on the UPPER EAST SIDE.

           HEAVY MACHINEGUNS fire in patterned bursts from the banks of
           the river.  Some dropships sink.  Burst apart.  Most push
           through the defenses.

           EXT.  BATTERY PARK - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           All around us.  Buildings are REDUCED TO RUBBLE every few
           seconds.  The Battleship Rush attacks without mercy.

           An ABRAMS TANK swings around the corner.  Riding over the
           rubble with ease.  Swiveling its main canon at a SQUAD OF
           ARMED SAILORS running into the park.

           The tank FIRES--  Blasting a hole in the ground--  Marines
           SCATTER--  Most dead--  Survivors LAYING FIRE as

           A SINGLE SAILOR

           Flanks the armor--  Climbs up the side--  Stuffs a grenade
           into a SIDE CANON--  Leaps away--  The tank EXPLODING from
           the inside out!

           EXT.  EAST RIVER LANDING - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           The dropships have landed.  HUNDREDS OF MARINES storm into
           the city.  
           Laying waste to the thin veneer of defenses protecting Uptown.

           EXT.  EAST 96TH & MADISON - DAWN (ATM CAMERA)

           The two armies CRASH together...

           Automatic WEAPON FIRE flares in the lens...

           Both sides brutal in their attack...

           Both sides taking heavy losses...

           The fighting slowly dropping back into CENTRAL PARK...

           EXT.  SPORTS BAR - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta Three-One rounds the corner.  Coming at the sports bar
           through a service entrance.  Opening the door and sneaking

           INSIDE

           Where PRISONERS are chained to walls and tables.  Screaming. 

           The building across the street EXPLODES--  Rubble SHATTERS
           the front windows--  Ricocheting through the sports bar--  A
           CHUNK OF ASPHALT missing Jones by inches--

           Two MERCS appear from upstairs.  See Delta.

                                 SPORTS BAR MERC
                        Shit.  Fighting as bad as it sounds
                        out there?

                                 WOLFE
                        Worse.

           Wolfe FIRES on the mercs.  Killing them.

           The prisoners panic.  Unsure what to do.  Pulling at their
           chains.  Jones sees.  They're all locked individually--

                                 JONES
                        Got a fucking problem here!

           EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE WEST TOWER - DAWN (CARTER)

           A god's-eye view of the battle--

           Artillery fire LIGHTS up the sky--  Small skirmishes-- 

           Dropships delivering their payloads around the bay--
           Carter SNIPES targets fast as he can scope and trigger.

                                 NEWELL
                        <Carter -- we need a couple more
                        minutes breathing room.>

                                 CARTER
                        Hands are kinda full up here --

                                 TITMUS  (O.S.)
                        -- Carter!  CARTER!

           Titmus slides beside Carter.  Breathless.

                                 TITMUS
                        Com-com-company.

           Thundering up the service stairs--  A SQUAD OF SOLDIERS--

                                 CARTER
                        Stay tight.  Close to me.

           Carter shoulders his rifle.  Pulls Titmus down the smaller,
           secondary stairwell.  Moving fast.  Jumping down four stairs
           at a time.

                                 NEWELL
                        <Did you copy?  What the hell is
                        going on?>

                                 CARTER
                        You're on your own.  Artillery on
                        your roof is hammering our boys in
                        the harbor.

                                 NEWELL
                        <We'll handle-->

           --GUNFIRE!  From above.  Shooting down on them.  Ricocheting
           around the metal stairs.  They haul ass.

           EXT.  BATTERY PARK - DAWN (MARINE HELMET CAM)

           Our marine and his buddy move between cover.  Pushing back
           the defending forces.

           BULLETS whiz past in every direction--

           EXPLOSIONS rip the ground apart--

           A TREE is hit.  Falls.  CRASHING to earth right beside us. 
           The marine vaults the obstacle.  SLAMMING home a fresh clip. 
           Leading the attack.
           EXT.  SKIES ABOVE - DAWN (AC-130 TARGETING CAMERA)

           Moving fast.  The row of invading ships approaches below. 
           Stuck on the south side of the VERRAZANO-NARROWS BRIDGE.

                                 AC-130 GUNNER  (O.S.)
                        Target in sights.

           The AC-130 fires--  Laying waste to smaller targets in the
           fleet--

           Battleships return fire--  Missing short--  Missing wide--

           EXT.  BATTLESHIP RUSH - DAWN (STERN CAMERA)

           Two DESTROYERS explode and sink.  The M61 VULCAN and the
           BOFORS 40MM CANON rain death and destruction from above.

                                 DECK COMMAND (O.S.)
                        -- Under heavy fire!  Lost Paramount
                        and Skyline.  Retask defensive
                        bombardments on my mark!

           EXT.  WALL STREET - DAWN (TRAFFIC CAMERA)

           The DEFENDING FORCE has started to withdraw.  The fighting
           spills from the park into the Financial District.

           GUNFIRE is exchanged.  The INVADERS grow in numbers.

           The dropships seem to have no end.  The marines are infinite.

           EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - DAWN (TRAFFIC CAMERA)

           ABRAMS TANKS roll through the park--  FIRING on marines as
           they flank around the north side of the reservoir.

           EXT.  ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAWN (FORWARD TANK CAMERA)

           The fighting is not going as well for the invaders here.  

           A PHALANX OF TANKS rolls down the street.  Chasing down a
           SQUAD OF HEAVY MARINES.  Frantically trying to reload their
           ROCKET LAUNCHER.

           RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL is hit by stray fire--  Slowly CRUMBLING
           as--  The marines drop a fresh round into the launcher--
           The marines flank the Abrams-- Setting up their shot-- FIRING--
           The tank is hit, but does not explode--  Turning its canon
           onto them--  Dead to rights--

           INT.  SPORTS BAR - DAWN (JONES)

           Delta Three-One CRASHES through a service door.  Up a flight
           of stairs and out onto

           THE ROOF

           Where heavy artillery FIRES endlessly on the invading force.

           Newell moves with precision--  SHOOTING the operators from
           behind--

           Wolfe covers--  Laying fire--  Protecting his ass--

           Jones ducks--  Sweeps between the AA canons-- 

                                 JONES
                        -- Clear!

           Jones moves to the edge of the building.  Looking out on the
           fighting below.  It's only getting worse.

           Across the bay.  The AC-130s circle the fleet.  Laying waste
           to every ship in their reticule.

                                 NEWELL
                        Cover my six!

           Newell climbs up into one of the AA CANONS --  

           -- And FIRES on the AC-130s --  

           -- The massive TRACER ROUNDS streaking through the sky!

                                 NEWELL
                        Take it in the ass you sons of
                        bitches!

           EXT.  SKIES ABOVE - DAWN (AC-130 FORWARD CAMERA)

           Turning back toward the city.  AA CANON FIRE streaks past. 
           Most shots miss.  A few THUD into the armor-plated hull.

                                 AC-130 PILOT  (O.S.)
                        Those our own fucking men shooting
                        on us?
                                 AC-130 GUNNER (O.S.)
                        Circle back -- southern defenses
                        have been compromised.

           EXT.  BROOKLYN HOUSING PROJECTS - DAWN (CARTER)

           Carter and Titmus running.  Balls out.  Soldiers giving chase. 
           Closing in.  No more than twenty yards back.  Bullets whipping
           past our head.

                                 CARTER
                        Alley!  Left!

           Titmus turns into 

           AN ALLEY

           But it's a dead end.  Ten foot brick wall blocks their escape.

                                 CARTER
                        Over the wall.  I'll boost.

           Titmus obeys.  Carter boosts him up onto the wall.

                                 TITMUS
                        Let me pull you up!

                                 CARTER
                        Not enough time -- run!

           Titmus nods.  Understands the sacrifice.  Drops off the other
           side of the wall.  Disappearing. 

           Carter turns to face his pursuers.  They fill the alley. 
           Long shadows stretching towards us.

                                 CARTER
                        Surrender!  Surrender!

           He drops his rifle--  The soldiers slowly advance--  

           Carter pulls his wedding band out from under his shirt. 
           Stares at it.  Places it on his finger.

                                 CARTER
                            (whispering)
                        You somehow ever see this, babe.  I
                        love you.

                                 PURSUING SOLIDER
                        ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES!

           Carter does as he's told.  Onto his knees.
                                 PURSUING SOLIDER
                        ONTO YOUR STOMACH!

           Again, does as he's told.  Raising his arms over his head.

                                 CARTER
                        I surren--

           -- BLAM!  

           We JERK violently--  Then immediately relax--

           Blood pools out from under us...

           The soldiers laugh... 

           EXT.  SKIES ABOVE - DAWN (AC-130 FORWARD CAMERA)

           Over Battery Park.  AA fire crashes around us.  One shot
           hits the mark perfectly.  A round SLAMS into the camera and --

           EXT.  SPORTS BAR - DAWN (JONES)

           The AC-130 explodes at the nose.  Down, but not out.  The
           gunship banks.  Hard.  Aims itself at Midtown.  Toward the
           fighting.

                                 JONES
                        Oh, hell.

           Watching in horror as the AC-130 tries to right itself. 

           Delta is safe.  But they have no way to stop the inevitable --

           EXT.  WEST 34TH & 5TH AVENUE - DAWN (MARINE HELMET CAMERA)

                                 MARINE
                        DANGER CLOSE!  TAKE COVER!

           Everyone scrambles--  No way to escape--

           The gunship's wing CUTS through the middle of the EMPIRE
           STATE BUILDING--  Debris and metal and glass raining down--

           Both sides of the battle RIPPED to shreds--  Ash and smoke
           covering--  Chunks of the building CRASHING into the street--
           EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           The gunship tips--  Missing a wing--  Can't stay straight-- 
           Spinning--  Dropping--  Everyone half-frozen--  Staring up
           at their impending doom--

           The gunship CRASHES to the ground in the middle of the park-- 
           CRATERING--  RIPPING up concrete and asphalt and grass and
           trees--  

           Seventy-five tons of flaming, twisted metal--

           SMASHING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF BOTH ARMIES!

           The gunship's wing catches a GROUP OF TANKS--  Flips them up
           into the air--  Nose DIVING back into the earth--

           The gunship SPLASHES into the reservoir--  Water WAVING out
           in every direction--  The tangle of metal and fire finally
           coming to rest...

           We're forty feet from the crash site...

           There is nothing left...

           EXT.  SPORTS BAR ROOF - DAWN (JONES)

           Newell climbs down from the AA gun.  Out of ammo.

           Looks out across the bay.  At the Battleship Rush.

                                 WOLFE
                        Think they know they got a vulture?

           Above the Battleship Rush, the second AC-130 still circles.

                                 NEWELL
                        Let's hope so --

           The AC-130 FIRES its main canon:  A HOWITZER ANTI-ARMOR GUN.
           It CRACKS the Battleship Rush right down the middle--

           Delta can do nothing but watch.  As Battleship Rush is
           bombarded with fire.  Explodes.  Sinks. 

                                 WOLFE
                        That's it.  We're done.

                                 NEWELL
                        Think you're right --

                                 WOLFE
                        -- LOOKOUT!
           Wolfe PUSHES Newell back--  As a SNIPER two buildings over-- 
           FIRES--  And the bullet meant for Newell--  Hits Wolfe.

           Punches a hole through his chest.  Blood frosts Jones' camera.  

           Wolfe stumbles back.  Trips.  Falls off the roof.

           Newell reaches out to grab him--  Misses--  We hear the THUD
           over the radio--

                                 NEWELL
                        -- NO -- GODDAMNIT --

           Newell SHOOTS.  Killing the sniper.  Too little, too late.

           Newell and Jones look over the edge.  Wolfe's twisted body
           three stories below.

                                 NEWELL
                        Asshole saved my life...

           Jones is wordless.  Newell wipes the blood from his camera
           and goggles.  Stares down at his stained gloves.

           EXT.  TIMES SQUARE - DAWN (MARINE HELMET CAMERA)

           The marines chase the fleeing enemy forces.  Down the street.

                                 MARINE
                        Push them up against the buildings!  

           The marine turns the corner--  And comes face to face with
           TWENTY ABRAMS TANKS--  Waiting--  A trap--

                                 MARINE
                        Back!  Back!  Double-time!

           But as the Marines turn to run.  They've been PINCERED by a
           PHALANX OF TWENTY MORE TANKS.

                                 BUDDY
                        We're fucked!

                                 MARINE
                        OFF THE STREETS!  INTO COVER!

           But it's too late.  The tanks OPEN FIRE.  Ripping the trapped
           marines to shreds in a little less than thirty seconds.

           The surrounding buildings caught in the cross fire--  LED
           signs shatter and fall--  Billboards explode--

           Our marine breaks for it.  Sprinting.  Ten feet from a door. 
           Ten feet from escape --
           -- WHA-BOOM!  The building EXPLODES --

           EXT.  ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAWN (TRAFFIC CAMERA)

           -- And the last of the marines are ENGULFED in fire and
           debris.  The tanks join forces, sweeping the streets.

           EXT.  SPORTS BAR ROOF - DAWN (JONES)

           Jones and Newell stare down at the battle.  It's obvious
           their side has lost.

           From across the bay.  The remaining AC-130 moves fast.  Toward
           the sports bar.

                                 JONES
                        He's coming back around.  Think he's
                        mad we shot his buddy down?

                                 NEWELL
                        We should not be here anymore.

           They run back down

           INTO THE BAR

           Where the prisoners shout out.  Won't accept their fate.

                                 PRISONERS
                        You have to help us! / Unlock the
                        chains! / Save us!

           Jones looks at them.  Absolutely defeated.

                                 NEWELL
                        Not enough time...

                                 JONES
                        We can't leave them...

           Newell thinks.  Paces.  The AC-130 visible outside.

                                 JONES
                        If we smash the RF chips before we
                        run --

                                 NEWELL
                        -- They'll have no reason to level
                        the bar.

                                 JONES
                        But we'll be sitting ducks, out in
                        the open.
           The sacrifice is clear.  Both men nod in unison.

           Jones takes out his RF CHIP.  Offers it to Newell.  He crushes
           both chips under his boot.

                                 NEWELL
                        Stay close.  We get separated, get
                        as far from the city, as fast as you
                        can --

           EXT.  WALL STREET - DAWN (JONES)

           Running.  Through the carnage.  As the last of the fighting
           dies down.  No one pays them much attention.

           Bullets POP--  Explosions BURST--

           EXT.  SKIES ABOVE - DAWN (AC-130 TARGETING CAMERA)

           Flying over the Financial District--

                                 AC-130 GUNNER (O.S.)
                        Out of the target building.  Two
                        runners.

                                 AC-130 PILOT (O.S.)
                        Rerouting.  Track and kill.

           The camera repositions.  Finds two dark splotches (Newell
           and Jones) hauling ass down Wall Street.

           The gunner opens fire with the minigun.  Indiscriminate. 

           EXT.  WALL STREET - DAWN (JONES)

           TRACER BULLETS rain down from above.  RIPPING through cars
           and cement and billboards.

           Ahead.  Newell DIVES inside a jewelry store.  Bullets SHATTER
           glass and TEAR through brick.  Jones follows

           INSIDE

           As they SPRINT out the emergency exit into

           AN ALLEY WAY

           Where the buildings provide cover.  For the moment, anyway.

           Above.  The AC-130 flies past, begins a wide turn to come
           back around for a second pass.
                                 JONES
                        The parking structure!

           A half mile away.  A five-level, cement and steel parking
           structure is the only thing in sight that resembles safety.

           EXT.  SKIES ABOVE - DAWN (AC-130 TARGETING CAMERA)

           Following Newell and Jones as they flee between buildings.

                                 AC-130 GUNNER (O.S.)
                        Targets moving inside parking
                        structure.

                                 AC-130 PILOT (O.S.)
                        Taking us low.  Bring out the big
                        guns.

                                 AC-130 GUNNER (O.S.)
                        Switching to Howitzer.

           The plane drops low.  On a perfect trajectory for the parking
           structure.  This is going to be bad.

           INT.  PARKING STRUCTURE - DAWN (JONES)

           Running.  Flat out.  Newell twenty feet ahead.  We hear the
           howitzer before we feel it.  

           -- BOOM-BOOM-BOOM --

           Then.  The earth moves.  EXPLOSIONS above and around us. 
           Ripping into the top of the structure.

           A round hits at ground level outside--  FLIPPING a car through
           the air--  Jones JUMPS back as the car SKIDS past--  Nearly
           CRUSHING him.

                                 NEWELL
                        THIS IS A FUCKING TOMB!

                                 JONES
                        Find an older car.  Late eighties,
                        early nineties.

           Around them.  The first level is mostly empty.  A few ELECTRIC
           CARS parked at charging stations.  Newell stops -- points.

           Three levels up.  Visible through girders and beams.  Newell
           sights a STATION WAGON.  Still intact.

                                 JONES
                        Meet me up there!
           Jones sprints.  Fast as he can.  Turning into

           THE STAIRWELL

           Taking the steps three at a time.  Up one level.  KA-BOOM!

           The structure shakes.  He falls on his ass.  WHA-BOOM!

           Four floors up, the roof EXPLODES.  Raining debris.  He
           presses against the wall, waiting out the worst of it. 

           Continuing up the stairs out onto

           THE THIRD LEVEL

           Where the station wagon sits.  Untouched.  Intact.  He climbs

           BEHIND THE WHEEL

           Ripping the panel from the ignition.  Working as fast as his
           shaking hands will allow.  Tying off various wires.

           Another EXPLOSION rocks the structure.  That one was fucking
           close.  He shakes it off.  Back to work.

           Out the window.  Newell exits the stairwell.  Stops short. 
           Yells.  We can't hear him.  

           Newell runs for the station wagon.  Waving.

                                 JONES
                        Almost got it!

           Newell PULLS open the car door--  GRABS Jones by the arm-- 
           And YANKS him out, falling on their backs as--

           The ground under the station wagon CRUMBLES.  Breaking away. 
           Taking the car with it.  Dropping three stories before
           SMASHING to the ground.

                                 JONES
                        Thanks.

           A moment to catch their breath.  Jones realizes --

                                 JONES
                        -- The explosions stopped.

                                 NEWELL
                        They'll come back around until this
                        building is rubble.

                                 JONES
                        We could always run some more.
                                 NEWELL
                        Something to be said for going down
                        swinging...

           Jones helps Newell up.  As predicted, the EXPLOSIONS start
           all over.  The structure rumbles.  Loose from its foundation.

           Behind them--  THE ROOF COLLAPSES--

           They run.  The imploding building racing to catch up.  Cement
           and dust and ash filling the air.  Limiting visibility.

           Ahead, the end of the structure draws closer...  

           No chance to see what's below...

           No chance to make another choice...

           THEY JUMP.

           Arcing out into open space.  The structure FOLDING behind
           them.  A torrent of sound and fury.

           And then.  Their saving grace: TREES rushing to meet them.

           Branches breaking their fall.  Wood SNAPPING.  Then they
           drop the last ten feet to the cement below.

           Jones rolls onto his back.  Looking straight up.  Dust clouds
           our vision.

                                 NEWELL
                        You still with me, Jones?

                                 JONES
                        ...Yeah...

           Above.  The AC-130 recedes into the night. 

           Somewhere distant, the POP of gunfire. 

           Then, the air raid alarms shut off.

           For the first time in hours, there is complete silence.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT.  OFFICE (TELEVISION BROADCAST)

           A staged office.  Official.  Flags nearby.  A Presidential
           seal.  General Butler arranges a speech in front of him.
                                 BUTLER
                        My fellow Americans.  A man I greatly
                        admire.  This man once said that the
                        patriot -- the true patriot -- must
                        be prepared, at all times to defend
                        his country against his government.

           Butler flips through a few pages of notes.  Limitlessly
           charismatic, he makes this lack of preparation endearing.

                                 BUTLER
                        For far too long.  The people of
                        this country have been used.  As
                        second class citizens.  Lives forever
                        altered on the whims of but a few
                        powerful men.  A nation.  Once so
                        strong.  Has been reduced to the
                        world's largest debtor.  

           The camera slowly ZOOMS on Butler's face.

                                 BUTLER
                        Fighting wars for others we cannot
                        win.  The courts are corrupt.  Poverty
                        on our streets.  Drugs in our homes. 
                        The system is broken.  Has been for
                        quite some time now.  This is not
                        about the right or the left.  Liberal
                        or Conservative.  This is about
                        America.  A country I love very much. 
                        Ask any carpenter.  To build, you
                        must first demolish. 

           He places the speech back down on the table.  Looks dead
           into the camera.  And smiles.

                                 BUTLER
                        But know this.  The patriots will
                        win.  No matter the cost.  God bless
                        you all.  God bless America.

           Which is when we notice the flags on his desk are wrong:
           vertical stripes instead of horizontal.  ZOOMING IN further. 
           On the Presidential Seal: The Federated States of America.

           The image blurs--  Pixelates--

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT.  CHINATOWN HOUSING PROJECTS - DAY (JONES)

           Hidden in shadow.  A caravan of humvees passes.  Newell steps
           out, looking back down the street.  Motions.
           Jones follows him down the block.  Away from the caravan.

           Newell climbs the front stairs to a row house.  Peeks through
           the window.  No one home. 

           Picking the lock.  Moving

           INSIDE

           Clearing each room.  All quiet.  Newell finally breathes.  

           Sits.  Wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                 JONES
                        What's the plan?

                                 NEWELL
                        Don't have one.

                                 JONES
                        Just sit here?

                                 NEWELL
                        I don't know...

                                 JONES
                        My wife could still be alive.

                                 NEWELL
                        I DON'T KNOW!

           INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT (JONES)

           Jones on a bed.  Stares at the ceiling.

           Outside.  SCREAMING.  The POP of gunfire.  Jones runs

           DOWNSTAIRS

           Where Newell is at the front door.  Peeking outside. 

                                 NEWELL
                        They've chased someone down.

                                 JONES
                        Looks like the Speaker.

           Newell gives him a look.  That's exactly what he thinks.

                                 NEWELL
                        Stay frosty.

           They slip through the door
           OUTSIDE

           Crouched low behind a brick wall.  Watching as --

           AN ARMY PRIVATE drags a PRISONER toward a waiting squad of
           soldiers.

                                 ARMY PRIVATE
                        Sarge?  This bastard look familiar
                        to you?

           We catch a glimpse of the prisoner's face: it's Titmus. 
           Bloodied.  Bruised.  Shot in the gut.  Moaning. 

                                 SARGE
                        I don't know -- can't tell through
                        all that blood.

           More laughter.  Titmus is dropped unceremoniously in front
           of SARGE.  The grizzled vet wipes the blood from his face. 
           Wrenches his head back.

                                 SARGE
                        Someone, bring me the sheet.

           He snaps his fingers.  A SOLDIER quickly delivers a poster.  

           Newell and Jones inch closer--  Can't make a sound--

                                 SARGE
                        Look at that.  Number one most wanted
                        with a fucking bullet.  Bagged
                        ourselves a unicorn boys.

           The squad cheers.  Sarge KICKS Titmus in the face.  The
           kidney.  Steps on his ankle, breaking it.

           Titmus opens his mouth to scream.  Nothing comes out.

                                 SARGE
                        General's gonna see to our reward
                        personally, guarantee you that.

           NEWELL

           Pulls Jones in close.  

                                 NEWELL
                        Move quick.  Follow my lead.

           Jones nods.  Newell counts down with his fingers.

           Three...  Two..  One.

           NEWELL
           Rises.  Already shooting.  BRRDDTT-BRRDDTT!  Two down.

           SARGE

           Pulls a sidearm.  Gets off a shot.  Clips Newell.

           JONES

           Has his back.  BRRDDTT!  One more target down.

           THREE SOLDIERS

           Focus fire on Newell.  He takes the hits, but keeps moving.

           SARGE

           Backpedals.  Tripping over his own feet.

           TITMUS

           Covers his head.  Stray bullets ripping into the street.

           JONES

           Rolls off a light post.  Low.  SHOOTS two more targets.

           NEWELL

           Is hit from the side.  He drops to a knee.

           SARGE

           Shoots off a round.  Hits Newell square in the forehead.

           JONES

           Kills the last soldier.  Turns on Sarge.  Pulls the trigger. 
           CLICK!  Out of ammo.

           SARGE 

           Smiles.  Takes aim.  Tables turned.  Jones is screwed.  When

           TITMUS

           Pulls the .45 from his belt.  Fires without aiming.  Nails
           the Sarge right in the temple.  Blood spatters a mailbox.

           All told, it took less than twenty seconds...

                                 TITMUS
                            (gasping)
                        ...Easier...than I...thought...it
                        would be...
           Jones rushes to Newell.  Rips open his shirt.  Finds Newell's
           body armor pocked with more than a dozen bullets.

           Newell sits up--  GASPING for air--  Alive.

                                 JONES
                        Lou!  Holy shit!  You see that?

           Newell pulls off his helmet.  Stares at where the camera
           used to be.  Shattered into a thousand pieces.

                                 NEWELL
                        Actually, no.  But someone got great
                        fucking footage of it.

           EXT.  SHOPPING CENTER - NIGHT (SECURITY CAMERA)

           Newell carries the unconscious Titmus over his shoulder as
           they approach an abandoned strip mall.

                                 NEWELL
                        Two hour rest, then back out on the
                        road.  I'll take first watch.

                                 JONES
                        We won't make it out of the city.

                                 NEWELL
                        I know.

           INT.  ELECTRONICS STORE - NIGHT (JONES)

           Jones startles.  Wakes up.  Finds Newell and Titmus around a
           small lamp.  Staring at the POSTER taken from Sarge.

                                 NEWELL
                        General Butler's most wanted list. 
                        From our friends back there.

                                 JONES
                        The Speaker's on it?

                                 TITMUS
                        A-numero-uno.

           Newell checks one of Titmus' lesser wounds.  Helps him cover
           it with a bandage.  Slow the bleeding.

                                 NEWELL
                        Thinking about what we heard them
                        say.
                                 JONES
                        Oh?

                                 TITMUS
                        Someone were to bring in Number One
                        Most Wanted -- hell, I bet General
                        Butler would come around.  Shake
                        that man's hand.

                                 JONES
                        Yeah?  So?

                                 NEWELL
                        What if it was my hand he came to
                        shake?

           Jones thinks it through.  Realizes --

                                 JONES
                        -- They'll execute him.

                                 NEWELL
                        It was his idea.

                                 TITMUS
                        Dying anyway...  Might as well make
                        it worth something...

                                 JONES
                            (to Newell)
                        You wouldn't make it out alive.

                                 NEWELL
                        Neither would Butler.

                                 JONES
                        Hell of a thing to do...

           Titmus winces in pain as he tries to sit up.

                                 TITMUS
                        Actually, figured it'd be me and
                        Jones going.  
                            (to Newell)
                        Considering your history with the
                        General.

           Newell is hurt.  Shakes his head.

                                 NEWELL
                        You think I'm lying?

                                 TITMUS
                        No.  It's not --
                                 NEWELL
                        -- You think I went through all of
                        this?  For what?  For fun?  I'll
                        finish the goddamn mission.  You
                        have my word.

                                 TITMUS
                        No offence...  Everything that's
                        happened...  Your word doesn't mean
                        as much as you think it does...

           Newell resigned.  Looks at Jones.

                                 NEWELL
                        You OK with that, rook?

                                 JONES
                            (not all "OK")
                        Yeah.  Sure.

           EXT.  SHOPPING CENTER - DAWN (SECURITY CAMERA)

           Jones paces in the parking lot, cell phone in hand.  A silent
           argument with himself.  Finally, dials a number.  Waits. 
           The call finally went through --

                                 JONES
                        -- Annie, it's me, I --

           Then, he deflates:

                                 JONES
                        Yeah, yeah -- machine got me again. 
                        Guess I never learn.
                            (beat)
                        Wanted to let you know I'm fine and --
                        tell you to stay inside --
                        everything's going to be OK.

           Newell appears in the corner of the screen.  Watching Jones
           from just inside the electronics store.

                                 JONES
                        And, uh...  And I was thinking -- if
                        it's a boy -- what do you think of
                        the name Archer?  Just a thought.  I
                        don't know.  My phone's almost out
                        of power so...  OK.  Say hi to him
                        for me.  Tell him anything he wants
                        to know.  I love you.  Very much.

           Jones ends the call.  Pulls the back off the phone.  Pries
           out the battery and the SIM card.  Smashes the phone against
           the ground.  Taking out all his frustration.  All his anger.
           Even after everything we've seen so far...  

           This is particularly unbearable.

           INT.  ELECTRONICS STORE - NIGHT (JONES)

           Walks back in.  As Newell preps for travel and Titmus catches
           a few minutes of sleep.

                                 JONES
                        We should be moving.

           Jones turns away from Newell.  Packs up his stuff.

                                 NEWELL (O.S.)
                        For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

           Jones turns.  Finds Newell standing over him.  A long metal
           pipe in hand.  He WHACKS Jones across the head.

           Jones falls.  The camera stays on.  Newell leans into frame,
           picking up Titmus and slinging him over his shoulder.  He
           steps out of the store and starts down the street.

           EXT.  UPTOWN - NIGHT (SECURITY CAMERA)

           In the middle of a shift change.  Newell appears with Titmus
           at the end of the street.

           SOLDIERS immediately draw weapons.  Newell lowers Titmus. 
           Tosses his weapons to the ground. 

           The soldiers converge on him.  Zip-tie his hands behind his
           back.  Escort him into a nearby building.

           INT.  ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY (JONES)

           Jones stumbles to his feet.  Looks around.  Realizes what
           time it is.  Realizes --

                                 JONES
                        -- Stubborn son-of-a-bitch...

           INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY (SECURITY CAMERA)

           Newell is led inside.  He looks wrung through a wringer. 
           Bloodied.  Cut.  Sweating.  Clothes a mess.  He's pushed
           down behind a metal table.  Handcuffed to the chair.  

           Two ARMED GUARDS stand just inside the door.  Staring.
           After a moment, the door opens and General Butler is led
           inside.  He sits across from Newell.  Smiles.

                                 NEWELL
                        Hell of a reward.

                                 BUTLER
                        My men are.  For lack of a better
                        word.  Cautious.  They wanted to
                        make sure your story held up under. 
                        Scrutiny.  I was concerned about
                        your loyalty, after the extraction
                        team's difficulties in Virginia.

                                 NEWELL
                        I brought you the Speaker.

                                 BUTLER
                        So you did.

                                 NEWELL
                        I'm either with you, or against you. 
                        That's what I was told.

           Butler motions.  The guards move in and unlock Newell's cuffs. 
           They back up, but stay inside the room.

                                 BUTLER
                        I am nothing, if not a man of my
                        word.  Welcome home, son.

           Butler stands to leave.

                                 NEWELL
                        The Speaker.  We'll hang him, right?

                                 BUTLER
                        Unfortunately not.  He bled out twenty
                        minutes ago.  Would have made a great
                        YouTube video.

           Newell stands.  Offers out his hand.

                                 NEWELL
                        General.  It's a pleasure, being
                        back in Charlie Company again.
                            (beat)
                        Where I belong.

           Butler smiles.  Shakes Newell's hand.

                                 NEWELL
                        How did you know?  How'd you know
                        I'd go along with it?
                                 BUTLER
                        Out of all the men in Three-One, you
                        understand the cost of the greater
                        good.

           And as Butler starts to pull away--  Newell moves like
           lighting--  Yanking the General close--  Drawing him into a
           tight headlock--

           The guards take aim.  Newell uses Butler as a human shield.

                                 BUTLER
                        Come on, son.  Don't throw your life
                        away.  I'll die a martyr.

                                 NEWELL
                        Me too.  How's that for your greater
                        good.

           And.  SNAP!  Newell TWISTS the General's head almost 90
           degrees to the side.  Butler drops dead at his feet.

           The guards hesitate for just a second.  Unsure.  Then.

           BAM-BAM-BAM!

           They shoot Newell dead in the blink of an eye.

           EXT.  WESTCHESTER SUBURBS - DAY (JONES)

           Most houses here are still standing.  A few here and there
           looted or burnt out.  But otherwise, the neighborhood was
           untouched during the fighting.

           Jones turns up a walkway.  A few steps.  The door creaks
           open.  A WOMAN'S FACE peers out.

                                 ANNIE
                        Andrew?

           Jones' wife, ANNIE, seven months pregnant, opens the door
           wide.  Stares.  In absolute disbelief.

                                 JONES
                        Hey, hon.

           Eyes locked.  Moving toward one another.

           Jones sloughs off his gear with every step.  Flak jacket. 
           Ammo lanyard.  VRD goggles.  And finally.  Helmet cam.

           Throws it on the grass.  From our slanted view, we see Jones
           and Annie embrace.  Can't take our eyes off of them.
                                 ANNIE
                        I never thought I'd --

                                 JONES
                        -- Me neither.

                                 ANNIE
                        You look like --

                                 JONES
                        -- Feel like it, too.

                                 ANNIE
                        Come inside.  I'll make --

                                 JONES
                        -- That'd be nice.

           They head inside.  The image FLICKERS.  From somewhere
           distant, the sounds of a parade.  

           A MARCHING BAND playing a triumphant anthem in prelap --

           EXT.  ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - DAY (HANDHELD CAMERA)

           Pushing through a thick crowd.  Hundreds of people gathered
           on the street.  Watching a parade.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Get to the front.  The front.

           We see the extent of the parade.  Nearly four blocks long. 
           ARMY PERSONNEL and VEHICLES.

           Flags of the Federation wave from the tops of cars.  Soldiers
           carry large PHOTOGRAPHS of General Butler.  Not unlike
           Chairman Mao, if we're looking for comparisons.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Across the street.  On the roof. 
                        You getting it?

           We FOCUS on the five-story building across the street.  We
           ZOOM IN on a TRIO OF SILHOUETTES that have just appeared.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Make sure you're getting them.

                                 VIDEOGRAPHER
                        I'm getting them.  I'm getting them.

           A half block away.  A TRUCK drives out of an alley.  Parks
           across the street.  Blocking the parade.
           The crowd collectively steps back.  Revealing ARMED MEN up
           and down the street.  They OPEN FIRE on the soldiers. 

           The silhouettes on the rooftop throw MOLOTOV COCKTAILS onto
           the vehicles -- WHOOM!

                                 SOLDIER
                        RPG!

           An EXPLOSION rocks a humvee.  Flipping it on its side.

           The street errupts into chaos as REBELS storm the parade. 
           The attack was perfect -- the army caught entirely off guard.

           The camera turns toward the woman off-screen.  It's Myra. 

                                 MYRA
                        Make sure you're getting all of it. 
                        FOR THREE-ONE!  FOR DELTA!

           The crowd around her cheers.  Swells.  Pushes the attack.

           She pulls an AK-47 off her shoulder and joins the fight. 
           Running into the street.  

           A BURNING FLAG flutters through the air beside her...  

           As it touches ground, we ZOOM IN...

           The image pixelates into nothing...

                                 THE END
