           OVER BLACK:

           The faint sound of a guinea pig squeaking gradually grows 
           louder...

           More and more guinea pigs join in until it becomes a 
           cacophony of shrill, high pitched squeaking. It’s 
           disturbing and unsettling. The squeaking builds in 
           intensity and volume. It’s deafening, and strangely 
           chilling...

           And then suddenly, it stops. An eerie silence.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           MONTAGE: A series of beautiful images show a venti skinny 
           caramel macchiatto being made...

           Coffee beans pour into a grinder...

           A blast of mechanical noise as the beans are ground to a 
           powder... 

           Hot water gurgles through the coffee into a cup... 

           A blast of steam heats a jug of milk...

           In contrast to the beautiful images, JOSH (early-twenties, 
           handsome) wears a blank, bored expression as he pours the 
           hot milk into the cup and tops it up with froth. He places 
           the cup on the counter, announcing its arrival with a 
           distinct lack of enthusiasm...

                                 JOSH
                        Venti skinny caramel macchiatto.

           An attractive PROFESSIONAL WOMAN (mid-thirties) reacts with 
           frustration...

                                 PROFESSIONAL WOMAN
                        I ordered a tall...

           JOSH greets the complaint with indifference...

                                 JOSH
                        So that’s a bonus. Twenty fluid 
                        ounces for the price of twelve. 
                        We have a winner.

                                 PROFESSIONAL WOMAN
                        I don’t like these big cups. 
                        They’re too big...

                          (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                            (with real venom)
                        I hate big cups. They’re so 
                        voluminous... 

           The PROFESSIONAL WOMAN isn’t amused...

                                 PROFESSIONAL WOMAN
                        What? Is that meant to be funny?

                                 JOSH
                            (dead pan)
                        No.

           JOSH and the PROFESSIONAL WOMAN trade stares for a long 
           beat. JOSH gives no indication that he is about to correct 
           the mistake any time soon. The PROFESSIONAL WOMAN snaps, 
           grabs the coffee and heads over to a table...

                                 PROFESSIONAL WOMAN
                        Prick.

           JOSH absorbs the insult. His colleague ED (early-twenties) 
           has witnessed the exchange...

                                 ED
                        I see you’re starting with the 
                        petty, vindictiveness early 
                        today. It’s very attractive.  

           JOSH can’t even be bothered to react to the remark...

           MONTAGE: Beautiful images of coffee making, cut with JOSH’s 
           blank, bored expression as he calls out the orders...

                                 JOSH
                        Grande skinny latte.

                                 JOSH
                        Short soy Americano with extra 
                        foam.

                                 JOSH
                        Tall, decaf, skinny cappuccino...

           JOSH’s words trail off as he sees ZOE (early-twenties, 
           beautiful, tanned) standing at the counter...

                                 ZOE
                        Hi.

           JOSH is stunned to see her...

                                 JOSH
                        What’re you doing here? You’re 
                        back? 
                                 (MORE)

                        Aren’t you supposed to be doing 
                        something with lepers in Peru...?

                                 ZOE
                        The lepers will have to take care 
                        of themselves. I got a job! A 
                        research post. It’s a proper job.

                                 JOSH
                        That’s great...

                                 ZOE
                        How are you? You look...you look 
                        the same...

           JOSH nods, gestures to ZOE...

                                 JOSH
                        You have a tan...

                                 ZOE
                        I do. You noticed...

           JOSH stares at ZOE intensely. A real sense of heartache...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s so great to see you.

           ZOE looks a little uncomfortable as she takes this in. She 
           sees ED, just standing there, glaring at her....

                                 ZOE
                        Hi Ed.

           ED gives a begrudging acknowledgement, making no secret of 
           his ill-feeling toward ZOE. She looks back at JOSH...

                                 ZOE
                        How’s Mr Tibbs...?

                                 JOSH
                        He’s got really fat. I got him 
                        one of those little wheels...
                            (mimes frantic running 
                             with his hands)
                        Never even goes near it. He’s a 
                        lazy bastard.

           ZOE gives an affectionate smile...

                                 ZOE
                        Say ‘hi’ from me. I miss him.

           It sounds like ZOE’s saying she misses JOSH. An awkward 
           beat. JOSH grabs the chocolate shaker and a stencil...

                                 JOSH
                        Chocolate...?
                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 ZOE
                        Yes please.

           JOSH sprinkles chocolate through the stencil onto the 
           Cappuccino. A stylised shot as the cocoa powder falls 
           through the air, creating a heart shape on the white foam.

           JOSH and ZOE stare at the heart, then at each other. JOSH 
           is flustered...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s the new slogan...

           JOSH points upwards. A sign above his head reads ‘Love 
           coffee, love life’...

                                 JOSH
                        ‘Love coffee, love caffeine’...

           ZOE makes to go...

                                 ZOE
                        You’ve got customers waiting...

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah, well they can all fuck off.

           The remark strikes an odd cord with ZOE, and JOSH 
           immediately regrets making it...

                                 ZOE
                        I’ve got some calls to make, 
                        so...

           JOSH grabs a loyalty card and quickly stamps it nine times - 
           manically going back and forth between the card and the ink 
           pad with the stamp. JOSH smoothly offers ZOE the loyalty 
           card...

                                 JOSH
                        The next one’s free. It’s on me.

           ZOE nods, smiles faintly...

                                 ZOE
                        Thanks.

           ZOE heads over to a table. JOSH stares at her intensely. ED 
           takes in his plaintive look...

                                 ED
                            (mock profound)
                        De-nial isn’t just a river in 
                        Egypt.

           JOSH snaps to, looks at ED, doesn’t follow...
                                    (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)

                        De-nial isn’t just a river in 
                        Egypt.

                                 JOSH
                        What’re you talking about...?

                                 ED
                        The Nile. The river. In Egypt. 
                        Fucking pyramids! Sounds like 
                        denial. Which is what you have a 
                        severe case of if you think she’s 
                        back here because she still loves 
                        you.

           JOSH reacts, defensive...

                                 JOSH
                        Like you know how she feels. You 
                        hate her. I didn’t go chasing 
                        after her. She came to see me.

           ED throws an open bag of coffee at JOSH, showering him. 
           JOSH reacts, annoyed...

                                 JOSH
                        You dick...

                                 ED
                        You’re up to your nut sack in 
                        coffee. You need to wake the fuck 
                        up and start smelling it. That’s 
                        another analogy.

                                 JOSH
                        I’ve got a degree in English 
                        Literature. I do know what an 
                        analogy is.

                                 ED
                        Do you...?
                            (sticking a finger in

                        again, I will beat the crap out 
                        of you. I will hurt you.

           ED walks off. JOSH takes this in, then looks over at ZOE. 
           She talks on the phone, smiling. The sunlight streaming in 
           through the window casts an almost angelic glow around 
           her...

           closes his eyes as he sinks into the embrace, becomes lost 
           in the moment - sniffs ZOE’s neck. This means a huge amount 
           to JOSH. Whereas ZOE looks uncomfortable, even a little 
           disdainful. She pats JOSH on the back, a release signal, 
           then pulls away, smiles...

                                 ZOE
                        We should hang out. I’ll call

                        you call me. Whatever happens 
                        first.

                                 ZOE
                        We’ll catch up, soon.

           JOSH nods, smiles - awkward. ZOE heads off down the 
           corridor. JOSH stares after her with a sense of longing...

                        Depends what you mean by

                        national drug company. They’re 
                        sponsoring her to do a PhD.

           JOSH can’t really argue with that. He’s keen to change the

           INT. JOSH’S HOUSE (GARAGE) - DAY

           The light’s off. In the darkness, the faint sound of a 
           guinea pig squeaking gradually grows louder. Harsh strip 
           lighting comes on, revealing MR TIBBS (a fat guinea pig) in 
           a cage. 

           JOSH crosses over, squats, looks MR TIBBS in the eye. Beat. 

                                 JOSH
                        Zoe’s back. She says ‘hi’.

           On MR TIBBS as he takes this in. JOSH suddenly feels 
           ridiculous for confiding in MR TIBBS... 

                                 JOSH
                        Why am I telling you?

           JOSH looks at the little bowl of feed...

                                 JOSH
                        What’s up?...Maybe if you did 
                        some exercise you might be 
                        hungry. Have a little spin in the 
                        wheel. 

           MR TIBBS stares back at JOSH. He appears lacklustre. JOSH 
           is concerned...

                                 JOSH
                        Well my fat little friend, I 
                        think we might need to take you 
                        to the vets. 

           MR TIBBS gives a particularly shrill squeak. JOSH frowns as 
           he takes it in, unsure what to make of it. JOSH heads out, 
           switching off the light as he goes. MR TIBBS gives some 
           shrill, unsettling squeaks from the darkness...

           INT. JOSH’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           ON COMPUTER MONITOR: A web based, multi-player computer 
           game in the style of ‘Resident Evil’. Two characters 
           ‘Monkey Face’ and ‘Apollo’ make their way through a 
           futuristic laboratory, killing various infected creatures 
           as they go.  
                                                                   (cid:13)                       (cid:13)

           horde of infected creatures. Monkey Face sneaks into a side 
           passage to avoid being seen. He turns to see Apollo hasn’t 
           followed. Apollo fixes him with a poignant look, then 
           simply stands and advances on the horde of infected 
           creatures, guns blazing...

           JOSH, who’s controlling ‘Monkey Face’, reacts with horror 
           to this move...

                                 JOSH
                        What’re you doing? No!

           Monkey Face bursts back into the laboratory. Apollo’s 
           surrounded, fighting for his life. A creature jumps on 
           Apollo and rips him apart, splattering Monkey Face in 
           blood...

                                 JOSH
                        Apollo!

           Monkey Face takes the creature out with a head shot, but 
           then finds himself under attack. He sprays the creatures 
           with automatic gunfire, puts up a heroic fight, but he’s 
           eventually overwhelmed and ripped apart. The health 
           indicator at the side of the screen flat-lines, emitting a 
           continuous note.   

           JOSH stares at the screen, shocked by the death of his game 
           character. He suddenly stands and marches over to the 
           window...

           JOSH and ROB (early-twenties, bed-hair, blood-shot eyes), 
           who lives in the house next door, open their bedroom 
           windows simultaneously. JOSH fixes ROB with a glare...

                        You killed us you dick! We’re

           ROB’s unconcerned, sparks up a spliff which he smokes 
           through the following...

                                 ROB
                        I’m done gaming.

                        You ever think there’s more to 
                        life than jerking off, playing 
                        computer games and getting fucked 
                        up on a cocktail of chemical 
                        substances?

                                 JOSH
                        Probably, but what has that got 
                        to do with anything...?

                                 ROB
                        I’ve been talking to this guy...

                                 ROB
                        A guy I met on-line.

                        big handful of sweets before he 
                        rapes you. 

           JOSH sees ROB’s arm moving as he shakes something. JOSH 
           reacts, disturbed...

                                 JOSH
                        Are you having a piss...?

           ROB produces an old coke bottle that he just pissed in and 
           pours it out of the window...

                                 JOSH
                        Beautiful...

           ROB passes JOSH the joint. JOSH takes a drag. They stare 
           out of their windows for a contemplative beat. 

                                 ROB
                        I heard Zoe’s back.

           JOSH nods, thoughtful...

                                 ROB
                        You gonna let her shit all over 
                        you this time...?

           JOSH reacts, frustrated by the presumption...

JOSH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           On an iPad: a photograph of ZOE on her Facebook page... 

           JOSH stares at it intensely. He picks up his phone, thinks 
           about calling Zoe, but he can’t bring himself to do it. He 
           throws his phone across the room. It hits a glass, knocking 
           it to the floor, smashing it, compounding JOSH’s 
           frustration.

           A classic genre shot as the camera moves in on the house. A

           BARNEY the cat sleeps soundly in his basket. The stairs

           Faint light seeps in through the curtains. Open on JOSH, 
           mouth hanging open, fast asleep - looking gormless. We hear 
           two voices, one male, one female. They talk in serious, 
           hushed whispers...

                                 WOLF (O.C.)
                        So this is him.

                                 TIGER (O.C.)
                        We found him.

                                 WOLF (O.C.)
                        The future of all mankind rests 
                        in his hands.

           On JOSH for a gormless beat. A hand enters the shot and 
           slaps JOSH hard around the face. 
                                         (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)           JOSH wakes up, startled - takes a moment to come to his 
           senses. He’s stunned and scared to see two figures looming 
           over his bed. He scrabbles around, switches on the bedside 
           light, illuminating WOLF (late-twenties, handsome) and 
           TIGER (mid-twenties, beautiful). They behave like heroic 
           characters from a genre film - cool, sexy, dangerous and 
           very intense. 

           JOSH goes to call out. WOLF clamps a hand over JOSH’s mouth 
           and holds an automatic pistol to his own lips, indicating 
           for JOSH to be quiet...

                                 WOLF
                        Sssshhhh...

           JOSH is terrified into silence...

                                 WOLF
                        If I take my hand away, are you 
                        going to scream like some 
                        terrified little girl?

           JOSH shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared. WOLF removes his 
           hand from JOSH’s mouth...

                                 TIGER
                            (friendly)
                        Hi.

                                 JOSH
                        Take whatever you want and just 
                        go...

                                 WOLF
                        We’re not here to steal from you. 
                        We’re not going to hurt you...

           WOLF makes a show of holstering his gun to reassure JOSH...

                                 WOLF
                        You need to listen carefully. We 
                        have something very important to 
                        tell you.

                                 JOSH
                        Who are you...?

                                 TIGER
                        I’m Tiger. He’s Wolf.

           JOSH looks between TIGER and WOLF, bemused by their 
           names...

                                 TIGER
                        We’re from the future. The year 
                        two-thousand and forty-eight.

           JOSH really isn’t sure what to make of this...

           (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        You’re from the future...?

                                 WOLF
                        One possible future. 
                            (fixing JOSH with a 
                             poignant look)
                        Do you believe in fate...?

           JOSH isn’t sure what to say, tries to appease them...

                                 JOSH
                        Yes. No. Maybe...?

                                 WOLF
                        We're here because you know 
                        something. What you know, you 
                        can't explain. But you feel it. 
                        You've felt it your entire life. 
                        That there's something wrong with 
                        the world. You don't know what it 
                        is, but it's there. Like a 
                        splinter in your mind, driving 
                        you mad. Do you know what I'm 
                        talking about?

                                 JOSH
                        Not really. No.

                                 WOLF
                        You know there has to be more to 
                        life than working in some shitty 
                        dead-end job. Your parents, your 
                        teachers, your friends, your 
                        girlfriends, they have made you 
                        feel worthless. They are wrong. 
                        You’re special. You’re more 
                        important than they could 
                        possibly understand. 

           JOSH is being strangely drawn in. It strikes a cord with 
           how he feels about his life right now. TIGER fixes JOSH 
           with a highly charged look...

                                 TIGER
                        You’re the one...

           JOSH is flattered at receiving such an adoring look from 
           such a beautiful girl...

                                 JOSH
                        If you say so...

                        Forget everything that you have 
                        been told and that you think you 
                        know. Are you ready to start 
                        living...?

           JOSH is swept along, answers instinctively...

                                 JOSH
                        Yes...Fuck yes...

           WOLF and TIGER give faint, satisfied smiles. It seems they 
           have their man. But then WOLF looks grave...

                                 WOLF
                        In three months time, six billion 
                        people will die... 

           JOSH reacts, shocked...

                                 JOSH
                        What? What people...?

                                 WOLF
                        A flu virus will wipe the human 
                        race from the face of the planet. 
                        Only you can stop that from 
                        happening.

           JOSH struggles to accept this, stares at WOLF and TIGER, 
           who stare back at him. Beat.

                                 JOSH
                        You’re shitting me, right?

           TIGER shakes her head, deadly serious...

                                 TIGER
                        It’s you. You can stop it. You’re 
                        the frigging saviour of mankind. 
                        You’re the one Apollo.

           This pulls JOSH up short...

                                 JOSH
                        What? No. I’m not Apollo...

           WOLF and TIGER are thrown...

                                 JOSH
                        I’m Monkey Face. Apollo lives 
                        next door.

           WOLF and TIGER take this in...

                        Seventeen. Apollo lives at number 
                        seventeen.

           WOLF realises their mistake, fixes JOSH with a look...

                                 WOLF
                        Then forget everything I just 
                        told you. Wrong guy.

           JOSH can’t let it go that easily...

                                 JOSH
                        What? What d’you mean forget 
                        it...?

                                 TIGER
                        We’re after the guy next door.

                                 JOSH
                        So now you’re telling me he’s the 
                        one...?

                                 WOLF
                        Looks that way.

                                 JOSH
                        Seriously? Some days he doesn’t 
                        even get out of bed. I’m pretty 
                        certain the saviour of mankind 
                        doesn’t piss in an old coke 
                        bottle. 

           Undeterred, WOLF eyes the partition wall...

                                 WOLF
                        Is this Apollo’s bedroom on the 
                        other side of this wall?

           JOSH nods, confused as to where this is headed...

                                 WOLF
                            (to TIGER)
                        We’ll shoot our way through...

           WOLF and TIGER draw two pistols each and point them at the 
           wall...

                                 JOSH
                        What!? No you won’t! You’re not 
                        shooting anything! You’re gonna 
                        wake my mum up!

Fair enough. They holster 
           their guns, then make to leave. JOSH is baffled...

                                 JOSH
                        So that’s it...?

           TIGER fixes JOSH with a pitiful look...

                                 TIGER
                        You’re not the guy we thought you 
                        were.

           JOSH feels strangely snubbed...

                                 JOSH
                        You don’t even know me. Coming in 
                        here, waking me up, telling me 
                        I’m the one, then telling me I’m 
                        not the one. Fuck you. 

           WOLF suddenly draws his gun and sticks it in JOSH’s face. 
           JOSH is terrified into silence...

                                 WOLF
                            (threatening)
                        You tell your mum from me - put a 
                        house number on the front door.

           JOSH nods, intimidated...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. I’ll tell her. We’ll get 
                        right on it.

           WOLF accepts this, then holsters his gun and follows TIGER 
           out, closing the door behind him. JOSH sits there for a 
           long beat, struggling to process what just happened, and 
           completely unsure what he should do about it...

           INT. JOSH’S HOUSE (UPSTAIRS LANDING) - NIGHT

           The door to Josh’s room opens. JOSH peers out cautiously. 
           The landing’s deserted. Tension as JOSH creeps over to the 
           stairs. He peers over the banisters, down the stairs. No 
           sign of Wolf and Tiger. It seems they’ve gone. 

                                 DIANNE (O.C.)
                        Josh...?

           JOSH jumps out of his skin, spins round to see DIANNE 
           standing there, sleepy-eyed, tousled hair, wearing a very 
           sexy camisole...

                        Who were you talking to...?

           JOSH really isn’t sure how to handle this, instinctively 
           lies, not wanting to involve his mum...

                                 JOSH
                        No one. Just go back to bed.

           DIANNE’s confused. JOSH takes in what she’s wearing and is 
           disturbed by it. DIANNE sees this and looks 
           uncomfortable...

                                 JOSH
                        What? Go. There’s nothing to see 
                        here...Go on...Go...

           DIANNE eyes JOSH curiously as she heads back into her 
           bedroom, closing the door behind her. JOSH hesitates, then 
           peers downstairs. All is quiet. It seems they really have 
           gone.

           INT. JOSH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           JOSH enters, closing the door behind him. He hesitates, 
           then hears faint, muffled voices coming through the 
           adjoining wall from Rob’s room. The muffled talking 
           continues a moment, then stops. Silence.

           JOSH crosses over to the wall and listens. Silence. But 
           then he hears a sound from outside. 

           JOSH crosses to the window and peers out through the 
           curtains. He’s stunned to see WOLF, TIGER and ROB hurrying 
           up to a car that’s parked up on the street. As they go to 
           get in the car, TIGER looks up and sees JOSH peering out. 
           Their eyes lock for a second, then JOSH steps out of sight 
           behind the curtains.  

           JOSH lingers behind the curtains. He isn’t even sure why 
           he’s hiding. The sound of an engine firing and a screech of 
           tyres as the car pulls away... 

           JOSH peers out to see the car speeding off down the street. 
           It disappears from view. JOSH stares after it, taking a 
           long moment to process what just happened...

           Resting on the bedside table, the alarm on Josh’s phone 
           goes off. A cheery, upbeat ringtone. Lying in bed, JOSH 
           stirs, groans, reaches out without opening his eyes. His 
           hand searches for his phone, eventually finds it, presses 
           some buttons and finally switches the alarm off.

           JOSH’s hand withdraws and he starts to slip back to sleep. 
           But then he suddenly recalls the strange events of last 
           night. His eyes snap open.

           JOSH holds his phone at his ear as he pisses. He gets

                                 JOSH
                        It’s me. What’s the story with 
                        those two crazies showing up in 
                        my bedroom last night? Did you go 
                        somewhere with them? Like - what 
                        the fuck?...Anyway. Call me.

           JOSH ends the call. He finishes pissing and shakes himself.

           shut behind him. As he heads off, he looks up at Rob’s 
           bedroom. The curtains are closed. JOSH frowns as he takes 
           this in. He puts in his ear-phones as he walks on...

                                      (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Then I see Rob heading off 
                        somewhere with them. It’s four in 
                        the morning. Now he’s not 
                        answering his phone.

           ED realises he’s confused...

                                 ED
                        Rob...? Is he the guy with the 
                        fit sister, or the fat sister...?

                                 JOSH
                        Both. One’s fit, one’s fat.

           ED shakes his head...

                                 ED
                        How does that happen? The same 
                        genes. Life is fucking cruel.

                                 JOSH
                        Don’t you think it’s weird, these 
                        two crazies turning up in my 
                        room, telling me they’re from the 
                        future...?

                                 ED
                        It’s totally insane.

           JOSH and ED contemplate the insanity of it for a moment, 
           but then find they don’t really have anything else to say 
           on the subject. They hesitate, then head off in different 
           directions with their iced drinks...

           JOSH walks across the coffee shop, carrying the iced drink. 
           He sees the headline on the front cover of the newspaper 
           that a MALE CUSTOMER is reading: ‘Flu pandemic could kill 
           billions’. Given what he was told last night, JOSH finds 
           this unsettling. He stops and stares at the headline. The 
           MALE CUSTOMER sees JOSH standing there with the drink...

                                 MALE CUSTOMER
                        Is that for me?

                                 JOSH
                        No.

           JOSH wanders off...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           JOSH smokes a cigarette as he holds his phone to his ear, 
           gets through to voice mail, leaves a message...
                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Hey Zoe. It’s me. I was just 
                        calling to see how it’s going, 
                        see when you wanted to hang out, 
                        you said you wanted to, so...All 
                        right. Call me. 

           JOSH ends the call, looks at his phone a moment, then sees 
           ED standing there, eyeing him with contempt... 

                                 ED
                        Jesus. Have some self-respect.

                                 JOSH
                        She said she wanted to hang out.

                                 ED
                        What? Maybe if she gets really 
                        bored, drunk, and lonely, she’ll 
                        let you scratch the itch in her 
                        knickers.
                            (sniffing JOSH)
                        You stink of shit, and 
                        desperation.

                                 JOSH
                        I do not stink of shit...

                                 ED
                        She doesn’t call you in months. 
                        She shows up here. ‘We should 
                        hang out’. Fuck off. She uses you 
                        to make her feel good about 
                        herself. 

                                 JOSH
                        Maybe she’s changed. Doing stuff 
                        with lepers and that. It changes 
                        people...

                                 ED
                        Does it? Your leper fella. He 
                        wouldn’t take this shit. A leper 
                        knows when he’s being fucked.

                                 JOSH
                        I had no idea you were such an 
                        authority on lepers. I did not 
                        know that about you.

                                 ED
                        Wake up, man! Just because you 
                        love her, doesn’t mean she isn’t 
                        a nasty, selfish bitch.

           JOSH knows that’s true, and it hurts. He wants to escape, 
           stubs out his cigarette...
                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)

                        I’m going for lunch.

                                 ED
                        You mean you’re going home...
                            (putting on a comedy 
                             Italian accent)
                        ...for a fucking massive 
                        shiiiitttt! 

           JOSH heads off, frustrated. ED calls after him...

                                 ED
                            (light, friendly)
                        We should go for a drink after 
                        work. Sink a few beers. Nail some 
                        cheap skanks. My treat. 

           JOSH walks away, inserting his ear-phones and selecting a 
           music track on his phone. ED stands there, lights up a 
           cigarette, smokes, looks round, bored...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The song on JOSH’s phone provides the sound-track as he 
           walks down the busy high street, eating a baguette. He 
           passes PEOPLE going about their daily business, talking on 
           phones, eating lunch - everyday stuff. JOSH looks downcast, 
           lost in troubled thought - the sound-track emphasising the 
           emotion...

           But as he walks on, JOSH sees something. ROB, WOLF and 
           TIGER are striding purposefully down the other side of the 
           street. Cool, purposeful, focused, detached - they appear 
           at odds with the mundane lives all around them...

           JOSH stares, hesitates, unsure whether to call out, but 
           then decides he should...

                                 JOSH
                        Rob!...Rob!

           ROB doesn’t hear. JOSH starts to head across the street...

                                 JOSH
                        Rob!
                            (feeling silly shouting 
                             it out)
                        Wolf!

           WOLF, TIGER and ROB now look round and see JOSH 
           approaching. Their expressions change. WOLF and TIGER draw 
           two pistols each and seemingly point them at JOSH...
                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                             (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           JOSH freezes, terrified. WOLF and TIGER open fire, a volley 
           of shots...

           The camera follows the path of a bullet as it shoots toward 
           JOSH. He instinctively flinches, turns away. The bullet 
           rips through his baguette, spraying his face with Brie and 
           avocado...

           As JOSH turns, he sees four MEN IN SUITS, dark glasses and 
           ear-pieces on the other side of the street drawing their 
           guns. This is who WOLF and TIGER are firing at. The MEN IN 
           SUITS return fire...

           JOSH drops to the ground. PEOPLE scatter and take cover as 
           a gun battle erupts... 

           We see the gun battle from JOSH’s POV, the music playing on 
           his headphones drowning out the sound...

           Lying on the ground, JOSH is horrified to see a jeep coming 
           toward him. He doesn’t have time to move, winces - 
           expecting to be hit. The jeep screeches to a stop over 
           JOSH, the high clearance meaning he doesn’t get hit. JOSH 
           opens his eyes, takes in his good fortune. Bullets smash 
           the jeeps windows, causing glass to rain down...

           JOSH crawls out from under the jeep and takes shelter 
           behind it. The DRIVER gets out and flees. JOSH sees WOLF 
           and TIGER exchanging fire with the MEN IN SUITS. 

           But then JOSH is stunned to see ROB, a short distance away, 
           sheltering behind a car, holding two automatic pistols. 
           JOSH watches with amazement as ROB springs up from behind 
           the car and fires a volley of shots... 

           ROB ducks back down behind the car. ROB now sees JOSH 
           staring in amazement. A huge grin spreads across ROB’s 
           face. He’s never felt so alive. But just at that moment, a 
           bullet rips through the back of ROB’s skull and explodes 
           out through his grin. JOSH recoils as he’s showered in 
           blood and teeth. A tooth impales itself in JOSH’s cheek. 

           JOSH stares with abject horror as ROB falls face down on 
           the ground. He sees TIGER react, horrified - her lips move 
           as she shouts...

                                 TIGER
                        No.....!

           JOSH watches as TIGER hurries over to ROB. She’s horrified 
           by his injuries, cradles ROB in his arms, utterly 
           distraught...

           JOSH is struggling to believe what he’s seeing. TIGER sees 
           JOSH, fixes him with a desperate look as tears run down her 
           cheeks.

           track JOSH is listening to ends. JOSH hears a moment of 
           chaos, screams, shouts and gun-fire...

           But then a stirring, high energy, upbeat track kicks in, 
           once again drowning out all other sound. The change in 
           track stirs a change in emotion and attitude in JOSH. He 
           watches WOLF struggling to hold the MEN IN SUITS at bay. 
           They’re pinned down. As JOSH takes in their desperate 
           situation, he starts to psyche himself up...   

           The soundtrack ends as we join TIGER, cradling ROB, utterly 
           distraught...

                                 TIGER
                        You can’t die! You’re the one. 
                        You can’t die...

           WOLF ducks down to re-load. WOLF and TIGER share a 
           desperate look. WOLF peers out. The MEN IN SUITS are 
           closing in. They’re surrounded...

           There’s a roar of an engine. The jeep screeches up beside 
           them. The passenger-side door gets thrown open. JOSH looks 
           at them from the driver’s-seat, still wearing his 
           headphones...

                                 JOSH
                        Get in!

           INT. JEEP - DAY

           The sound-track kicks back in as we join JOSH inside the 
           jeep...

           WOLF and TIGER return fire as they haul ROB’s limp body 
           into the back seat of the jeep...

                                 WOLF
                        Go!

           JOSH floors the accelerator. The jeeps roars away, bullets 
           hitting it. JOSH realises WOLF is shouting at him, but he 
           can’t hear what he’s saying. JOSH rips the headphones out, 
           ending the soundtrack...

           JOSH is suddenly confronted with the sound of what’s 
           happening - the engine roaring, bullets flying, WOLF 
           returning fire, TIGER screaming and sobbing, and suddenly 
           it seems all the more scary and intense...

                                 TIGER
                        Don’t you fucking die!

           WOLF climbs into the front seat...
                            (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)

                        Go left! Left!

           JOSH pulls on the wheel. They take a left turn, clipping a 
           car...

                                 JOSH

                        They were sent from the future to 
                        stop us!

           JOSH’s mind swims, starting to believe that the far-fetched 
           story he was told last night is true. WOLF turns and fires 
           out of the back of the jeep, deafening JOSH...

                                 JOSH

JEEP - DAY

           JOSH sits there, hands gripping the steering wheel. He 
           takes a long moment to get over the shock of what just 
           happened. JOSH turns to see TIGER, distraught, cradling ROB 
           in the back-seat, gently rocking him back and forth...

                                 JOSH
                        How is he...?

           TIGER fixes JOSH with a blank look, blood staining her 
           face...

                                 TIGER
                        He’s dead.

           JOSH is stunned and horrified. WOLF struggles to accept 
           this, gets out of the jeep. TIGER plants a soft tender kiss 
           on ROB’s forehead, gently lays his body on the back seat 
           then gets out of the jeep. 

           JOSH now gets a proper look at the bloody, disfigured mess 
           that was once ROB’s face. JOSH recoils at the sight, dry 
           wretches for a long beat, but isn’t actually sick.

           WOLF and TIGER stand there, devastated, reeling - 
           struggling to accept Rob’s death and what it means. JOSH 
           takes a moment to process the enormity of events... 

                                 JOSH
                        This is actually happening, isn’t 
                        it? You’re for real. Billions of 
                        people are going to die...

                        At first, she’ll feel like she’s 
                        getting a cold. But then her 
                        muscles will start to ache. Soon 
                        they’re aching so bad she can’t 
                        move. Fluid starts to back up in 
                        her lungs. Every breath feels 
                        like it’s her last. You’ll try 
                        and get help, but the hospitals 
                        are piled full of bodies. There’s 
                        no doctors. No nurses.

                        was the one. He was going to 
                        change the future.

           WOLF pulls a dirty tarpaulin off a vehicle to reveal a van 
           with ‘A little slice of heaven’ and a sandwich graphic on 
           the side...

                                 WOLF
                        He delivers sandwiches to Devlin 
                        Pharmaceuticals. The flu virus 
                        escapes from their laboratory. 
                        That’s how it starts.

           JOSH takes this in. It’s starting to make more sense.

                        Apollo drives it into the carpark 
                        under the labs.

                                 WOLF
                        The virus gets incinerated. The 
                        epidemic never happens. A new 
                        future.

                                 JOSH
                        Why doesn’t one of you drive it 
                        in there...?

                                 WOLF
                        There are replicants everywhere. 
                        They know our faces. If they lock 
                        down the building. No one’s 
                        getting inside.

           JOSH takes a moment to psyche himself up, then rises to the 
           occasion...

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll do it. I’ll drive the van.

           WOLF and TIGER react dubiously to the offer...

                                 TIGER
                        You...?

                                 WOLF
                        Who are you again? What d’you do?

           JOSH isn’t entirely sure how to describe himself...

                                 JOSH
                        I’m a barrista...

                                 TIGER
                            (dismissive)
                        We’re not looking for legal 
                        advice.

                                 JOSH
                        No. A barrista. I make coffee...

                                 WOLF
                        You’re the fucking tea boy...?

                                 JOSH
                        Excuse me?...Making a really good 
                        cup of coffee - it’s a skill.

                                 WOLF
                        The world’s best and brightest 
                        minds, they all work in coffee 
                        shops.

                        Maybe they do...
                            (realising that’s 
                             ridiculous)
                        What’s your point...?

                                 WOLF
                        That weak-arse shit you serve - 
                        that isn’t even real coffee. It’s 
                        all milk. It’s a comfort drink. 
                        It’s like sucking on your mummas 
                        tit.

                                 JOSH
                        Right. It’s exactly like that, if 
                        your mum’s tits serve a choice of 
                        six freshly ground Arabica coffee 
                        beans with a wide variety of 
                        flavoured syrups...

           WOLF draws his gun and sticks it in JOSH’s face. JOSH is 
           instantly terrified, cowers away...

                                 TIGER
                        Wolf...

           A tense beat. JOSH holds his nerve...

                                 JOSH
                            (to WOLF)
                        You want to talk tits and coffee, 
                        or d’you want to save the human 
                        race? 

           WOLF hesitates, then lowers his gun. WOLF stares back at 
           JOSH...

                                 WOLF
                        If you do this, there’s no going 
                        back. Your old life. It’s over. 
                        This isn’t something you can fix 
                        by dragging your dick over your 
                        iPad.

                                 JOSH
                        I generally use my finger. That’s 
                        just me...Whatever works...

           WOLF stares, isn’t amused, then looks at TIGER...

                                 WOLF
                            (to TIGER)
                        I need to set up this deal to buy 
                        the semtex.

                        Be careful. They’ll be looking 
                        for us now.

           JOSH takes in the affectionate look between WOLF and TIGER 
           and grows curious about the nature of their relationship. 
           WOLF heads off... 

                                 WOLF
                        You and the tea boy stay here.

           JOSH pulls a face, annoyed by the description...

                                 JOSH
                        Again with the tea boy thing...

           JOSH sees TIGER eyeing him curiously. She indicates her 
           face...

                                 TIGER
                        You’ve got something...

           JOSH wipes his face, identifies various lumps...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s a baguette. Brie and 
                        avocado...
                            (wincing as he pulls it 
                             from his cheek, then 
                             reacting, horrified as 
                             he sees what it is)
                        ...and teeth...

           Appalled, JOSH drops the tooth...

           An epic, slow motion shot as the tooth falls through the 
           air and lands on the floor, bouncing in the dust...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. DERELICT WAREHOUSE (ROOF) - NIGHT

           The city lights stretch into the distance. TIGER stares out 
           over the city. JOSH walks up, hesitates, then...

                                 JOSH
                        Are you okay...?

           TIGER can’t even begin to answer that question, but she’s 
           grateful that JOSH asked. JOSH takes out a packet of 
           cigarettes, offers one to TIGER. She shakes her head. JOSH 
           lights up, looks out at the city...

                                 JOSH
                        What’s the future like...?
                                    (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 TIGER
                            (staring out, 
                             thoughtful)
                        It’s exactly like this...except 
                        everyone’s dead.

           JOSH takes in this, chilled by the thought. TIGER has a 
           faraway look in her eyes as she talks...

                                 TIGER
                        The few of us who survived the 
                        virus, we were rounded up by the 
                        replicants. They put us to work 
                        in labour camps, disposing of the 
                        bodies.

                                 JOSH
                        How d’you tell - if someone’s a 
                        replicant...?

                                 TIGER
                        You need to cut into their skull. 
                        They’ll have a micro-chip...
                            (gently touching the 
                             side of JOSH’s head 
                             with her finger)
                        ...right here.

           JOSH takes this in. It feels strangely intimate, TIGER 
           touching him like this. Their eyes meet. TIGER withdraws 
           her hand. JOSH eyes TIGER curiously, then...

                                 JOSH
                        You and Wolf, are you...?
                            (insinuating with a 
                             look)

                                 TIGER
                        You want to know if we’re 
                        fucking...?

                                 JOSH
                        I wasn’t going to put it quite 
                        like that...

           TIGER moves in on JOSH, gets in his face...

                                 TIGER
                        D’you think about me fucking 
                        him...?

                            (bemused)
                        No. That would be weird...

           TIGER searches JOSH eyes, up close, intimate. An intense 
           beat. JOSH feels uncomfortable...

                        What d’you think’s going to 
                        happen between us...?

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know. Nothing. 
                        Something...? You’re from the 
                        future. You tell me. 

           TIGER holds the look for a poignant beat, then...

                                 TIGER
                        We need to go.

           TIGER turns away and walks across the roof. JOSH stares 
           after her, confused as to what to make of the exchange...

           EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

           An industrial building that’s been converted into a club. 
           The thud of loud music comes from within. WOLF, TIGER and 
           JOSH stride past the long queue of achingly cool YOUNG 
           PEOPLE who are waiting to get into the club. 

           WOLF, TIGER and JOSH walk up to the BOUNCER at the head of 
           queue. He acknowledges WOLF and TIGER and stands aside to 
           let them pass. JOSH sees ANNABEL (mid-twenties, beautiful) 
           at the front of the queue, eying him curiously. JOSH gets a 
           buzz, feels very cool as he heads inside...

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           Flashing lights. Loud music. Screens show images - clips 
           from the news, black and white films and natural history 
           programmes. WOLF, TIGER and JOSH look out over the club, 
           taking in the scene. JOSH looks pained, experiencing some 
           discomfort. TIGER sees it...

                                 TIGER
                        Are you all right...?

CLUB (TOILETS) - NIGHT

           Open on a row of toilet cubicles...

           JOSH stands there, staring at them. He’s desperate for a 
           shit. He reacts with frustration. He just can’t bring 
           himself to use the cubicles. He walks out...

           WOLF and TIGER scan the club. JOSH rejoins them. TIGER 
           stares at him, making him feel uncomfortable...

                                 JOSH
                        There’s a queue. I can wait.

           WOLF spots TONY (early-thirties, hard) talking to some 
           GIRLS...

                                 WOLF
                            (to JOSH)
                        Stay here. 

           WOLF and TIGER head off...

                                 JOSH
                        Where are you going...?

           WOLF and TIGER don’t answer. JOSH is annoyed at being 
           ignored. JOSH looks round. He takes in all the PEOPLE 
           enjoying themselves. Knowing what he now knows about the 
           future, he feels strangely detached from it. But then JOSH 
           sees ANNABEL standing there, staring at him...

                                 ANNABEL
                        You should buy me a drink.

                                 JOSH
                        Right. Okay. You’re very direct. 
                        What would you like?

                                 ANNABEL
                        A bottle of Champagne.

                                 JOSH
                            (taken aback)
                        A whole bottle? You must be 
                        thirsty. Do they have 
                        champagne...?

           WOLF appears. He hardens as he takes in what’s going on 
           between JOSH and ANNABEL. WOLF holds ANNABEL’s eye...

                        Fuck off.

           JOSH is taken aback by WOLF’s aggression. ANNABEL sneers, 
           gives WOLF the finger as she heads off...

                                 JOSH
                        Why d’you do that? I think she 
                        liked me...

                                 WOLF
                        You jeopardise our mission for a 
                        little sniff of clunge...?

           JOSH disapproves of the terminology...

                                 JOSH
                        You know, you really shouldn’t 
                        talk about women like that. It’s 
                        very offensive.

           WOLF pokes a finger in JOSH’s chest...

                                 WOLF
                        Don’t let any of these beautiful 
                        little bitches pussy whip you. 

                                 JOSH
                        Another defamatory reference to 
                        female genitalia. Lovely. Is that 
                        how you talk to your mum? ‘Mum 
                        you whore! Get your dirty snatch 
                        in here and make my tea you ugly 
                        twot!’

           WOLF stares with contempt, then simply walks away. JOSH is 
           frustrated...

                                 JOSH
                        Am I supposed to follow you this 
                        time?

           WOLF walks on, ignoring JOSH. JOSH follows...

           intimidating) sits at a desk. BILLY (steely) keeps a 
           watchful eye on proceedings. It’s all very intimidating.

                            (to TONY)
                        These the people...?

           TONY nods...

                                 JOSH
                        Hi.

           Everyone looks at JOSH, who squirms. Moving on...

                                 MARCUS
                            (to WOLF)
                        So what are you looking to blow 
                        up?

                                 WOLF
                        A building.

                                 MARCUS
                        This building. Is anyone going to 
                        be in it...? 

                                 WOLF
                        No one who matters to you.

           JOSH doesn’t like the sound of that. MARCUS accepts it, 
           nods to the BILLY. BILLY reaches into a cupboard, takes out 
           a heavy holdall and throws it to WOLF, who catches it.

           WOLF looks inside the holdall. It contains blocks of 
           semtex, timers and detonators...

                                 MARCUS
                        There’s some timers and 
                        detonators and other shit in 
                        there. Let’s call it fifty K.

           WOLF takes this in...

                                 WOLF
                        Fifty, huh?...I was thinking, you 
                        let me take this, and you and 
                        everyone you love gets to live. 

           The tension ratchets up as MARCUS takes this in. JOSH looks 
           nervous as hell. MARCUS holds WOLF’s eye...

                                 MARCUS
                        Is that a threat...?

           WOLF shakes his head...

                                 WOLF
                        It’s a historical fact.

           Tension as WOLF and MARCUS trade stares for a long beat...
                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                 MARCUS
                            (to BILLY)
                        Shoot this prick.

           BILLY, WOLF, TIGER and TONY all draw their guns 
           simultaneously. BILLY aims at WOLF. WOLF aims at MARCUS. 
           TONY aims at TIGER. TIGER draws two guns, aims one at TONY 
           and one at BILLY. JOSH stands there, frozen, terrified, 
           eyes darting between everyone. MARCUS fixes WOLF with an 
           incredibly hard stare...

                                 MARCUS
                        You put your guns down, and I’ll 
                        think about not killing your 
                        parents and your entire family.

                                 WOLF
                        My parents haven’t even been born 
                        yet.

                                 MARCUS
                        Is that right? I guess that makes 
                        you some kind of biological 
                        fucking miracle. 

           WOLF and MARCUS trade stares. Unbearable tension. JOSH’s 
           phone starts to ring, interrupting the moment...

                                 WOLF
                            (without looking at 
                             JOSH)
                        Who is that?

           JOSH takes out his phone, looks at the caller ID: ‘Zoe’. 
           JOSH reacts, frustrated - bad timing...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s my ex-girlfriend...

           TIGER takes in the mention of an ex-girlfriend with 
           interest...

                                 MARCUS
                            (to JOSH)
                        I’m gonna find her, and I’m gonna 
                        cut her tits off.

           JOSH is taken aback, but he’s desperate to talk to ZOE...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. But can I just tell her 
                        I’ll call her back...?

                                 MARCUS
                            (to WOLF)
                        You got ten seconds to put your 
                        guns down.

           JOSH quietly answers his phone... 

                                 JOSH
                            (low)
                        Hello. Zoe...?

           JOSH reacts with frustration. She’s hung up...

                                 MARCUS
                        Five...Four...Three...Two...

           WOLF raises his gun, fires - takes out the light, plunging 
           the room into darkness. Shots ring out, muzzle flashes 
           temporarily lighting up a chaotic scene as everyone ducks 
           for cover. BILLY screams from the darkness as he gets shot 
           in the leg...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           WOLF, TIGER and JOSH burst through a door. JOSH is wired, 
           adrenaline pumping. WOLF, TIGER and JOSH head across the 
           packed dance floor, disappearing into the CROWD. Moments 
           later, TONY and MARCUS burst through the door. They look 
           round, eyes scanning. TONY talks into a walkie-talkie.

           Tension as WOLF, TIGER and JOSH push through the CROWD. 
           JOSH’s eyes dart round anxiously, disorientated by the sea 
           of FACES, the loud music, the flashing lights and the fast 
           cut images on the screens... 

           WOLF sees several BOUNCERS heading toward them, pressing 
           their fingers to ear-pieces. WOLF looks round, sees TONY 
           and MARCUS approaching from the other side of the dance 
           floor. WOLF changes direction, barges through the CROWD...

           The DJ whips the CROWD into a frenzy as the dance track 
           builds to a crescendo...

           JOSH gets jostled as the CROWD go wild, jumping as one. 
           JOSH loses WOLF and TIGER in the scrum. JOSH looks round, 
           disorientated, eyes searching...

           TIGER realises they’ve lost JOSH, signals WOLF. They split 
           up and head off, searching for JOSH...

           TIGER sees MARCUS approaching and ducks out of sight. 
           Tension as TIGER looks at the feet all around her. She sees 
           MARCUS’ feet heading off...

           MARCUS looks round, catches a glimpse of JOSH, heads 
           straight for him, pushing through the CROWD...
                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)           JOSH looks round, increasingly anxious and disorientated - 
           FACES, flashing lights, images... 

           On screen, images of a lion closing in on its prey...

           JOSH stands on the spot, looking round. Suddenly he sees 
           MARCUS approaching, levelling a gun at him. JOSH freezes, 
           terrified - time seems to slow. But as MARCUS fires, a GIRL 
           knocks his arm...

           The DJ beckons to the crowd, whipping them up. The stray 
           bullet hits him in the chest. He falls onto the turntable 
           and light console, activating the strobe lighting and 
           knocking the needle to the end of the record with a loud 
           scratch. The needle jumps continuously in its groove, 
           creating an anxiety inducing heartbeat like sound - duh, 
           dum, duh, dum, duh, dum...

           The CROWD think it’s a deliberate track change, moving 
           their bodies to the new beat. The strobe lighting makes 
           their movements appear jerky and robotic...

           JOSH makes a run for it, stumbling through the CROWD as the 
           lights strobe and the record jumps - duh, dum, duh, dum, 
           duh, dum... 

           JOSH stops, looks round, disorientated. MARCUS looms out of 
           the CROWD and sticks his gun into JOSH... 

                                 MARCUS
                        You’re dead...

           All JOSH can do is stare, eyes wide with terror. Suddenly 
           WOLF lunges from the CROWD, grabs MARCUS’ gun hand and head-
           butts him. MARCUS loses his balance, falls, WOLF landing on 
           top of him. MARCUS and WOLF struggle on the floor...

           As the lights strobe, JOSH sees WOLF clamp his mouth on 
           MARCUS’ nose. JOSH stares, horrified, as WOLF shakes his 
           head violently as he bites MARCUS’ nose off...

           WOLF pulls away, leaving MARCUS screaming, his face a 
           bloody mess. WOLF locks eyes with JOSH. He spits MARCUS’ 
           nose out. JOSH stares, shocked, as the lights strobe and 
           the record jumps - duh, dum, duh, dum, duh, dum...

           TIGER grabs JOSH, bundles him toward a fire exit. JOSH sees 
           ANNABEL staring, shocked, having witnessed WOLF biting 
           MARCUS’ nose off. JOSH instinctively gives ANNABEL a smile 
           and a friendly wave...

CLUB - NIGHT

           JOSH, TIGER and WOLF burst out of a fire exit and run up to 
           the sandwich van. JOSH is freaking out...

                                 JOSH
                        You bit his fucking nose off!

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           WOLF hops into the driver’s seat. JOSH shuffles across into 
           the middle. TIGER gets in behind him and slams the door. 
           WOLF and TIGER quickly fasten their seat-belts. JOSH 
           struggles to buckle his seat-belt. It won’t fasten...

                                 JOSH
                        My seat-belt won’t do up.

           WOLF reacts with contempt, then fires the engine and pulls 
           away...

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           WOLF, JOSH and TIGER travel in silence. JOSH looks 
           thoughtful...

                                 JOSH
                        So how does this virus get 
                        released...?

                                 WOLF
                        It started with the pigs...

                                 TIGER
                        Guinea pigs.

           JOSH isn’t sure what to make of this revelation...

                                 JOSH
                        As in the little furry

                        starts to learn at a geometric 
                        rate.

                            (dubious)
                        A guinea pig? Really...?

                                 WOLF
                        On the 2nd of October they 
                        implant the same chip in a human 
                        being. They create the first 
                        replicant. Two weeks after that, 
                        the virus gets out. People start 
                        dying. The scientists realised 
                        the replicant was immune to the 
                        virus. So they start using people 
                        who were dying from the virus to 
                        create more. They thought it was 
                        the answer. They thought the 
                        replicants would help us fight 
                        the virus...The replicants were 
                        just waiting until we were too 
                        weak to fight back, and then they 
                        turned on us.

           JOSH is struggling to take it all in...

                                 JOSH
                        Just run through that one more 
                        time... 

                                 WOLF
                        Don’t you see...? It was the 
                        replicants. They released the 
                        virus. They created the 
                        conditions so they could take 
                        over the planet. While you were 
                        all busy with your iPhones and 
                        your Face-bollocks, the world got 
                        fucked in the arse. 

           JOSH takes this in. A thoughtful beat, then...

                        I’ve got a guinea pig.

           WOLF slams on the brakes. JOSH gets thrown into the 
           dashboard. He pulls himself up, takes a moment to 
           recover...

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus! What the fuck! You knew I 
                        wasn’t wearing a seat-belt! 

           JOSH sees WOLF and TIGER fixing him with hard stares...

                                 TIGER
                        You’ve got a pig...?

           JOSH nods...

                                 WOLF
                        Where is it...?

                                 JOSH
                        Where d’you think it is? It’s not 
                        out bowling. It’s at home.

                                 TIGER
                        Did it know Apollo...?

                                 JOSH
                        It’s a guinea pig...

                                 WOLF
                        Did it know him!?

                                 JOSH
                        I guess. As much as a guinea pig 
                        can really know anyone...
                            (amused, reminiscing)
                        Actually, me and Rob used to do 
                        this thing where we’d drive Mr 
                        Tibbs around in this little 
                        electric car. We made him do 
                        jumps and everything. It was 
                        hilarious...

           WOLF and TIGER stare at JOSH. They clearly don’t share that 
           sentiment. JOSH feels silly...

                                 JOSH
                        We were very stoned. 

                                 WOLF
                            (to TIGER)
                        It could be a sentinel.

                        cages. Acting all cute, and 
                        innocent. Running round in those 
                        little fucking wheels...

                                 JOSH
                        It’s a guinea pig...

                                 WOLF
                        It’s proof, of what happens in 
                        the future. The replicants won’t 
                        let it be found. They’ll kill 
                        anyone who gets in their way. 

           JOSH takes in the implications and is suddenly fearful...

           The lights are on inside the house. 

           A little way down the street, with the headlights off, the 
           sandwich van rolls to a stop.

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           WOLF, JOSH and TIGER look out at the house...

                            (to JOSH)
                        Wait here.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m coming with you.

                                 WOLF
                        You’re too important to the 
                        mission. It’s safer if I go 
                        alone.

                                 JOSH
                        No way am I letting you go in 
                        there on your own. You’ll freak 
                        her out...

                        How much d’you love your mum?

           JOSH isn’t exactly sure how to answer that...

                                 JOSH
                        You know...A normal amount...

           WOLF continues to stare. JOSH becomes increasingly 
           defensive...

                                 JOSH
                        There’s nothing weird going on 
                        ...She looks good for her age. So 
                        what?...You’re worse than the 
                        kids at school...I’m not fucking 
                        my mum!

           WOLF takes this in, doesn’t look convinced...

                                 WOLF
                        Stay here. I’ll make sure she’s 
                        safe.

           JOSH is persuaded to stay. WOLF opens the door, gets out, 
           silently closing the door behind him. JOSH watches 
           anxiously as WOLF moves stealthily toward the house. JOSH’s 
           anxiety increases as WOLF draws a pistol and screws a 
           silencer onto it...

           Meat sizzles in a frying pan...

           DIANNE is cooking, consulting a recipe book on a stand. She 
           turns to grab the salt cellar, sees something and freezes, 
           staring, terrified. WOLF stands there, puts his finger to 
           his lips, indicating DIANNE to be silent...

                                 WOLF

                            (DIANNE’s too scared to 
                             answer)
                        The guinea pig. Where is it...?

           DIANNE points to the internal door leading to the garage. 
           DIANNE looks on, terrified, as WOLF creeps over to the 
           door. Tension as WOLF listens at the door. Silence. WOLF 
           suddenly steps back and kicks the door open...

JOSH’S HOUSE (GARAGE) - NIGHT

           The door flies open. WOLF sees the cage, illuminated by the 
           light from the kitchen, fires a quick succession of 
           silenced shots at it. WOLF pauses. He now sees the cage is 
           empty.

                        Where is it!? Where’s the pig?

                        He’s...He’s at the vets. I 
                        forgot. He’s at the vets. I’m 
                        sorry. Don’t hurt me. Please...

           WOLF fixes DIANNE with a hard, intimidating stare...

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           JOSH grows increasingly anxious as he and TIGER wait in the 
           van. JOSH’s phone beeps as it receives a text message. JOSH 
           opens the message. It’s from Zoe: ‘where are you?’. JOSH 
           hesitates, isn’t sure how to answer. TIGER eyes JOSH 
           curiously...

                                 TIGER
                        Is that your girlfriend...?

                                 JOSH
                        Ex-girlfriend. 

           A faint, almost subliminal scream. JOSH reacts, alarmed, 
           looks toward the house, isn’t sure he even heard it... 

                                 JOSH
                        What was that...?

                                 TIGER
                        What...?

                                 JOSH
                        I thought I heard something. 
                        What’s he doing in there...?

                                 TIGER
                        He’s doing what needs to be done.

He suddenly scrabbles 
           across to the driver’s side door...

                                 TIGER
                        Don’t! It’s not safe!

           JOSH throws the door open, gets out and runs toward the 
           house. TIGER goes after him...

           INT. JOSH’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT

           JOSH bursts through the door and is greeted by a horrific 
           sight...

           DIANNE is gagged and tied to a chair, WOLF’s sitting on her 
           lap, straddling her. DIANNE’s screaming through the gag as 
           WOLF finishes cutting into the side of her head with a 
           flick knife. Blood runs down DIANNE’s face. WOLF fixes JOSH 
           with a reassuring look...

                                 WOLF
                        It’s okay. She’s not chipped.

           WOLF climbs off DIANNE’s lap, leaving her sobbing 
           hysterically. JOSH is utterly appalled...

                                 JOSH
                        Mum...? Oh Jesus...
                            (to WOLF)
                        What did you do you crazy 
                        bastard!?
                            (to DIANNE)
                        Mum...? Mum. Are you okay?

           All DIANNE can do is sob as she fixes JOSH with a desperate 
           look...

                                 JOSH
                        She’s bleeding...Oh God. I’m 
                        sorry. I’m sorry...

           TIGER appears in the doorway...

                                 WOLF
                            (to TIGER)
                        The mum’s clean.

           JOSH reacts, outraged...

                                 JOSH

                        We had to be sure. 
                            (to TIGER)
                        She says the pigs at the vets. I 
                        believe her.

                                 TIGER
                        That’s good news.

                                 JOSH
                        How is any of this good? That’s 
                        my mum...

                                 WOLF
                        A sentinel would never allow 
                        itself to be taken to the vets. 
                        It couldn’t risk being 
                        discovered. 

                                 JOSH
                        Oh. So it’s just a guinea pig. 
                        Like I told you it was! 

           JOSH pulls the gag out of DIANNE’s mouth...

                                 JOSH
                        Mum...? Say something...

                                 DIANNE
                        Who are these people...?

           JOSH isn’t sure how to describe WOLF and TIGER...

                                 JOSH
                        They’re friends...

           DIANNE reacts, appalled that friends of her sons could have 
           done this to her...

                                 JOSH
                        Not exactly friends...It’s 
                        complicated. There’s things 
                        happening...They’re going to 
                        happen, in the future - bad 
                        things, terrible, terrible 
                        things. I have to stop them from 
                        happening.

           To DIANNE, JOSH sounds completely insane...

           TIGER spots movement behind the long curtains covering the 
           french doors that lead to the garden. TIGER points as she 
           draws her gun, which also has a silencer on it...

           WOLF also draws his gun, levels it on the curtains. 
           Silence. Tension as everyone stares at the curtains. More 
           movement. TIGER and WOLF fire a volley of shots.

           from behind the curtains. BARNEY runs across the kitchen, 
           down the hallway and out the open front door... 

                                 JOSH
                        You nearly shot my cat you dicks!

                                 DIANNE
                        What is going on...?

           JOSH grabs a tea towel and presses it to the wound on 
           DIANNE’s head...

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll explain everything...

           As JOSH pulls the tea-towel away, a lump of hair and skin 
           pulls away with it. JOSH reacts, disgusted and appalled...

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus...
                            (to WOLF)
                        You scalped her...
                            (to DIANNE)
                        It’s okay. I’ll call an 
                        ambulance.

                                 WOLF
                        No ambulances.

                                 JOSH
                        What...?

                                 WOLF
                        Not until we complete the 
                        mission. We can’t risk it.

                                 JOSH
                        We can’t just leave her here like 
                        this. She’s bleeding...

                                 TIGER
                        If we fail, she dies. Everyone 
                        dies.

           JOSH takes this in, daunted...

                                 DIANNE
                        Josh...What’s she talking about? 
                        Untie me. Josh...?

           JOSH is torn, comes to a decision, fixes DIANNE with a 
           poignant look...

                                 JOSH
                        I have to do this. I have to stop 
                        it. I’m sorry.

She’s 
           horrified, struggles...

           INT. JOSH’S HOUSE (HALLWAY) - NIGHT

           JOSH emerges into the hallway, closing the door behind him. 
           WOLF and TIGER can see that he’s traumatised by the thought 
           of what he’s just done...

                                 TIGER
                        One day, she’ll thank you for it.

                                 JOSH
                        Somehow I really doubt that...Can 
                        we just go?

           They head for the front door. JOSH sees something, stops - 
           stares at the toilet in the downstairs bathroom. He 
           suddenly remembers that he really needs to shit, but feels 
           awkward about admitting it... 

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll catch you up.

           WOLF and TIGER eye JOSH suspiciously...

                                 WOLF
                        What are you doing...?

                                 JOSH
                        I just need to use the toilet...
                            (off disbelieving looks)
                        I’ll be two seconds...

           JOSH sinks onto the toilet and finally relaxes. As he sits 
           there, he shakes his head, disbelieving at what he’s got 
           himself into...

                        What the fuck were you doing in 
                        there...?

                                 TIGER
                        You were in there ages? Is there 
                        something wrong with your bowels? 

           JOSH is very uncomfortable...

                                 JOSH
                        No...D’you want to talk about 
                        what I was doing in the toilet, 
                        or d’you want to break into this 
                        laboratory and blow it up...?

           WOLF regards JOSH suspiciously, then fires the engine. JOSH 
           is relieved to have changed the subject. As they pull away, 
           the horror of what just happened returns to JOSH...

                                 JOSH
                        You cut into her head. That’s my

           JOSH shuffles over to the driver’s seat. Standing by the 
           open driver’s side window, WOLF fixes JOSH with a serious 
           look...

                                 WOLF
                        Are you sure you know what you’re 
                        doing?

                                 JOSH
                        Not really, no. On account of 
                        never having done anything like 
                        this in my life.  
                            (off a stare from WOLF)
                        Yes. Okay.

                                 WOLF
                        It’s all on you now. The future

JOSH is daunted by the 
           responsibility, but annoyed by how it was expressed...

                        He had his spleen ripped out in 
                        an industrial cleaning accident.

           The SECURITY GUARD’s shocked...

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Fuck...

                                 JOSH
                        That’s what he said...It was more

                        ‘Fuuuuuuuuuuuck!’...And then he 
                        died, horribly. 

           The SECURITY GUARD stares, disturbed. JOSH struggles to 
           conceal his anxiety. He sees the SECURITY GUARD’s hand 
           slowly reaching out to press a button. JOSH fears he’s been 
           rumbled. Anxiety rises inside him...

           But then there’s a mechanical whirring as the gates begin 
           to open. JOSH can’t entirely conceal his relief. The 
           SECURITY GUARD nods, signally JOSH to move on. JOSH pulls 
           away...

           The van parks up. JOSH gets out. He glances round anxiously 
           as he walks round to the back of the van. He has a final 
           look round then opens the rear doors, fixes WOLF and TIGER 
           with a serious look...

                                 JOSH
                        We’re in.
                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           WOLF and TIGER get out of the van. As WOLF looks round the 
           car-park, he becomes lost in thought, has a far away look 
           in his eyes, as though recalling memories of being here 
           before. JOSH watches WOLF, curious as to what he’s doing...

                                 TIGER
                        Wolf...

           WOLF snaps to, focuses...

                                 WOLF
                            (to JOSH)
                        Keep watch while we rig the van.

           WOLF draws his gun, spins it round and holds it out to 
           JOSH, handle first. JOSH is daunted...

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not shooting anyone.

                                 WOLF
                        Don’t pussy out on us. Just 
                        having a pair of balls doesn’t 
                        make you a man.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s a pretty strong indication.

           WOLF holds JOSH’s eye as he suddenly grabs JOSH’s hand, 
           then forces the gun into it...

                                 WOLF
                        Try not to shoot yourself in the 
                        face.

           JOSH looks at the gun in his hand, takes in the seriousness 
           of the moment...

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (SECURITY GATE) - NIGHT

           The SECURITY GUARD looks round as the headlights of an 
           approaching vehicle light up the booth. His expression 
           changes as he sees something troubling. An identical 
           sandwich van pulls up at the gate. A FRIENDLY GUY smiles 
           from the driver’s seat... 

                                 FRIENDLY GUY
                        Sandwiches...

           The SECURITY GUARD looks toward the laboratory building as 
           the alarming implications sink in...

                                                            CUT TO:
                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (UNDERGROUND CAR-PARK) - NIGHT

           JOSH struggles to suppress his anxiety as he watches the 
           entrance to the car-park and the lift. His eyes dart 
           nervously between the two...

           JOSH sees something, reacts, worried. He walks toward the 
           lift, stares, wide-eyed. The lift’s on the move, the floor 
           indicator counting down from the eighth floor... 

           JOSH looks over toward the van across the car-park, but 
           WOLF and TIGER are out of sight, inside the van, rigging 
           the explosives. JOSH is on his own.

           JOSH looks back at the floor indicator as it continues to 
           count down. At each floor, JOSH desperately hopes the lift 
           will stop, but it keeps heading downward...

           JOSH looks at the gun in his hand, then over at the van - 
           still no sign of WOLF and TIGER... 

           The lift is at the ground floor, and is still heading 
           downward...

           JOSH raises the gun, his hand shaking as he points it at 
           the lift doors. He can’t actually believe he’s doing this. 
           The tension rises as we cut between JOSH pointing the gun, 
           his hand trembling and the lift doors...

           The indicator shows the lift has arrived at the car-park...

           On JOSH, terrified...

           Ping! The lift doors open, to reveal WALENTYNA (Polish 
           cleaner, early-forties). She emerges from the lift, pushing 
           a cleaning trolley. JOSH gives a war cry as he immediately 
           steps out from beside the doors and pistol whips her. 
           WALENTYNA falls to the ground, face up, unconscious. JOSH 
           is horrified by what he’s done...

                                 JOSH
                        Oh Jesus!...I’m sorry. I am 
                        really sorry.
                            (peering down at 
                             WALENTYNA)
                        Are you okay...?

           WOLF and TIGER appear on the scene, they take in WALENTYNA 
           lying on the ground, seem unconcerned. WOLF holds up a 
           detonator...

                                 WOLF
                        The van’s rigged. Let’s go.

           JOSH gestures to WALENTYNA...
                                                                      (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        What about her?

                                 WOLF
                        Collateral damage.

           JOSH is outraged...

                                 JOSH
                        She’s not collateral damage! 
                        She’s...
                            (reading her name badge, 
                             but struggling to 
                             pronounce it)
                        ...Walen...Walent...Walenty... 
                        She’s a cleaner. Probably a damn 
                        good one. There’s people in the 
                        building.

                                 WOLF
                        They knew the risks when they 
                        decided to come into work.

                                 JOSH
                        No they didn’t. Trust me. They 
                        aren’t expecting to get blown up, 
                        not for minimum wage. We need to 
                        evacuate the building.

                                 TIGER
                        It’s too risky.

                                 JOSH
                        I will not be responsible for the 
                        deaths of numerous Eastern 
                        European cleaners.

                                 WOLF
                        We do not jeopardise the mission. 
                        Not for anyone.

           JOSH steps back, points the gun at WOLF...

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah? Well I say different, and 
                        I’m the one holding the gun...

           Quick as lightening, WOLF grabs JOSH’s wrist twists it, and 
           easily disarms him, leaving JOSH frustrated and nursing a 
           painful wrist...  

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus...

                                 WOLF
                        Let’s go. Move out.
                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)
                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)           JOSH can’t accept what they’re about to do. He sees a fire 
           alarm button. WOLF follows his gaze, realises what JOSH is 
           about to do. Too late. JOSH runs for it. WOLF tries to stop 
           him, but he can’t get there in time. JOSH slams the button 
           down. The fire alarm sounds. WOLF fixes JOSH with a hard 
           stare...

                                 WOLF
                        You have just risked the entire 
                        human population to save a few 
                        Eastern European cleaners.

                                 JOSH
                        Sue me.

           WOLF looks on the verge of hitting JOSH, but then walks 
           away. JOSH stares after him... 

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS - NIGHT

           EASTERN EUROPEAN CLEANERS are evacuating the building 
           through the front entrance. They walk over to an assembly 
           point a safe distance from the building. They discover 
           WALENTYNA slumped over the cleaning trolley and react 
           hysterically in various Eastern European languages...

           JOSH, WOLF and TIGER watch from a distance. JOSH looks 
           satisfied that he has saved their lives... 

                                 WOLF
                            (to TIGER)
                        You get the fence. I’ll lock down 
                        the car-park.

                                 JOSH
                        What do I...?

                                 WOLF
                        Stay here. Hold this.

           WOLF hands JOSH the detonator. WOLF and TIGER head off. 
           JOSH looks at the detonator, daunted by the responsibility 
           that now rests with him... 

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (PERIMETER FENCE) - NIGHT

           TIGER approaches the fence. She squats down and starts to 
           cut through the fence with a pair of wire cutters.

           she scans the darkness, but there’s seemingly no one 
           there...

           EXT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS - NIGHT

           WOLF breaks open a control box beside the entrance to the 
           underground car-park. He pulls a lever. A gate starts to 
           lower over the entrance. As WOLF turns to leave, he’s 
           confronted by several armed POLICE OFFICERS...

                                 POLICE OFFICERS
                        Armed police! Put your hands on 
                        your head! Get down on the 
                        ground! Down! Do it!

           EXT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS - NIGHT

           JOSH waits anxiously. A tense beat. JOSH sees TIGER 
           sprinting toward him...

                                 TIGER
                        Blow the building!

           TIGER’s brought down by several POLICE OFFICERS. Before 
           JOSH has a chance to react, POLICE OFFICERS armed with 
           tasers, bean-bag guns and semi-automatic rifles emerge from 
           various locations, surrounding him...

                                 POLICE OFFICERS
                        Armed police! Drop it! Put it 
                        down!

           JOSH freezes, terrified. TIGER fixes him with a desperate 
           look as she struggles on the ground...

                                 TIGER
                        Blow the building! Do it!

           JOSH has no idea what to do. His finger hovers over the 
           trigger on the detonator. He looks round, his mind spinning 
           as everyone shouts at him...

                                 POLICE OFFICERS
                        Put it down! Drop it!

                                 TIGER
                        Do it!

           JOSH snaps...
                        (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        Stop shouting at me!

           The OFFICER IN CHARGE signals everyone to stop shouting...

                                 OFFICER IN CHARGE
                        Listen to me. No one has to get 
                        hurt. It’s over. Just put it 
                        down. 

           JOSH responds with a desperate look, eyes flicking between 
           the trigger, the POLICE OFFICERS and TIGER, who gives him a 
           look, pleading - a POLICE OFFICER has clamped a hand over 
           her mouth...

           Unbearable tension as JOSH is paralysed by fear and 
           indecision, his finger hovering over the trigger...

           JOSH’s phone starts to ring, making him jump. The POLICE 
           OFFICERS respond to the movement with a barrage of beanbags 
           and tasers. JOSH goes down, his body convulsing from the 
           electric shocks as beanbags thud into him...

           JOSH falls to the ground, the detonator falling out of his 
           hand onto the ground...

           TIGER’s horrified, struggles to break free...

           JOSH lies on the ground, eyes closed - face contorted. His 
           body gives a final little convulsion, then lies perfectly 
           still. White bile dribbles from his mouth. He looks dead. 
           Go out on this shocking image.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION (OBSERVATION ROOM) - DAY

           The door opens. DI BLAKE (sharp suit) enters, carrying a 
           file. DS HARRIS (sharp suit) is looking at something. DI 
           BLAKE follows his stare...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        Is this the guy...?

           DS HARRIS nods. On the other side of a two way mirror, we 
           now see JOSH is sitting at a table in an interview room...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE STATION (INTERVIEW ROOM) - DAY

           JOSH winces as he feels his bruised chest, from where the 
           beanbags hit him. The door opens. DI BLAKE enters, closing 
           the door behind him. 
                                       (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                                   (cid:13)

           the table. DI BLAKE opens the file, takes out two 
           photographs and slides them across to JOSH.   

           JOSH looks at the photographs. They are mugshots of Tiger 
           and Wolf... 

                                 DI BLAKE 
                        I believe you know them.

           JOSH nods, indicates the photographs in turn...

                                 JOSH
                        Tiger and Wolf.

           DI BLAKE shakes his head, also indicates the photographs in 
           turn...

                                 DI BLAKE 
                        Denise Brown and Brian Ward. 

           JOSH frowns as he takes this in, unsure what to make of 
           it...

                                 DI BLAKE 
                        Doesn’t sound quite so 
                        futuristic, does it?

                                 JOSH
                        If it’s true...?

                                 DI BLAKE
                        These are copies of their birth 
                        certificates...

           DI BLAKE slides them across the table. JOSH studies them, 
           looks troubled, but isn’t about to concede anything...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        The building that you were going 
                        to blow up. Did Brian tell you 
                        that he used to work there?

           JOSH frowns, shakes his head...

                                 JOSH
                        He worked there...?

                                 DI BLAKE
                        He was a data input clerk.
                            (mimes typing)

           JOSH is increasingly unsettled...
                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                           (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                 DI BLAKE 
                        One day, he just snaps. He walks 
                        out of his little cubicle and 
                        takes the lift to the fourth 
                        floor. He walks into the lab 
                        where they keep all the guinea 
                        pigs and gets busy with a meat 
                        cleaver. 

           DI BLAKE slides several crime scene photographs across the 
           table. JOSH is appalled by the scenes of carnage - stomach 
           churning images of slaughtered guinea pigs...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        He was sectioned under the Mental 
                        Health Act and remanded to 
                        Downside Psychiatric Unit, which 
                        is where he met Denise. She’s a 
                        paranoid schizophrenic. 

           JOSH struggles to accept what he’s hearing... 

                                 DI BLAKE
                        You see, what Brian does is, he 
                        targets vulnerable, 
                        impressionable, bored young 
                        people with chronically low self-
                        esteem and he spins them this 
                        incredible story that he’s 
                        cobbled together from films like 
                        The Matrix and The Terminator 
                        franchise. He tells them he’s 
                        from the future, and the world’s 
                        going to end, and only they can 
                        stop it from happening. And he 
                        persuades these vulnerable, 
                        impressionable, bored young 
                        people with chronically low self-
                        esteem to do all kinds of crazy 
                        shit, like blowing up buildings. 
                        Does any of that sound familiar 
                        to you...?

           It sounds very familiar and deeply troubling, but JOSH is 
           determined to save face...

                                 JOSH
                        Which part...?

                                 DI BLAKE
                        You got sucked into a delusional 
                        fantasy concocted by two total 
                        fucking nutters, or whatever it 
                        is we’re supposed to call “the 
                        mentals” these days.

           JOSH fights back...
                                           (cid:13)

                        All right. If all that’s true, 
                        who were the men in suits? They 
                        were shooting at us. They tried 
                        to kill us...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        You mean, suits like this...
                            (indicating his own 
                             suit)

           JOSH frowns as he gets an inkling of where this is 
           headed...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        They were police officers 
                        attempting to apprehend two 
                        heavily armed, and very dangerous 
                        fugitives. When they were fired 
                        upon, they returned fire.

           JOSH thinks he’s spotted a hole in this story...

                                 JOSH
                        Then why didn’t they identity 
                        themselves as police officers? 
                        Answer that.

           DI BLAKE refers to a statement...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        According to several witnesses, 
                        you were wearing earphones during 
                        the shoot-out. They did identify 
                        themselves as police officers, 
                        you just didn’t hear them.

           The truth strikes JOSH, leaving him stunned. He tries to 
           think of another argument to prove his point, but fails to 
           do so. JOSH stares blankly. 

                                 DI BLAKE
                        Now if you want to walk out of 
                        here with just a caution, I would 
                        suggest that you say that these 
                        armed, dangerous, mentally 
                        unstable fugitives coerced you 
                        into going along with their plan.

           JOSH finds himself strangely reluctant to agree to that... 

                                 DI BLAKE 
                        Say it...Say it.

           JOSH reluctantly complies...
                                       (cid:13)                                     (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                        (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                                 (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)

                        I was coerced...

           DI BLAKE takes this in...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        Okay. So I guess the question is. 
                        Exactly what kind of fucking 
                        idiot are you?

           Right now, JOSH feels like a total fucking idiot...

           The door to the interview room opens. JOSH emerges. He sees 
           DIANNE sitting there, waiting for him. She has a bandage 
           covering where Wolf cut into her head. DIANNE fixes JOSH 
           with a desperately worried look. They trade troubled 
           stares. JOSH feels deeply ashamed.

           A clip from ‘The Matrix’ plays on an iPad screen, during 
           which MORPHEUS addresses NEO...

                                 MORPHEUS
                        Let me tell you why you're here. 
                        You're here because you know 
                        something. What you know you 
                        can't explain. But you feel it. 
                        You've felt it your entire life. 
                        That there's something wrong with 
                        the world. You don't know what it 
                        is, but it's there. Like a 
                        splinter in your mind, driving 
                        you mad. It is this feeling that 
                        has brought you to me. Do you 
                        know what I'm talking about?

           JOSH watches the clip, appalled that what DI Blake told him 
           is seemingly true.

                        They were very convincing. There 
                        was guns, and shooting, and loud

                        Hey. I need this. My life is 
                        shit. One of the small crumbs of 
                        consolation is that your life is 
                        infinitely more shit. If it 
                        wasn’t for that, I’d probably 
                        kill myself.

           ZOE’s lying on the bed, pouring a large glass of white 
           wine, holding her phone to her ear, looking seductive...

                                 ZOE
                        I’m bored.

           Sunlight streams in through the windows... 

           JOSH wakes up, comes to his senses, sees something. ZOE’s 
           bent over, in her underwear, pulling on work trousers. JOSH 
           smiles softly as he watches her...

                                 JOSH
                        Hey.

           ZOE looks round, locks eyes with JOSH. She looks troubled, 
           hesitates...

                                 ZOE
                        I had a really good time last 
                        night, but this was a mistake.

           JOSH is appalled, can’t accept that...

                                 JOSH
                        No. Don’t. Don’t do this again. I 
                        won’t let you...

           JOSH stares, distraught - hating himself. ED looks on, 
           feels for him...

                                 ED
                        It’s like de-ja-fuck-you.

           As JOSH wallows in self-pity, a blueberry muffin comes into 
           shot, ED’s finger stuck in the base of it. He uses it as a 
           finger puppet...

                        Fuck the nasty bitch. I hope you 
                        gave her VD.

           This fails to raise JOSH’s spirits, but he’s grateful for 
           the attempt. ED tosses a letter over to JOSH, continues to 
           use the blueberry muffin as a finger puppet...

                        This came from head office.

                                 JOSH
                        What is it?

                        The boss men want us to use less 
                        coffee and more milk. 

           This strikes a cord as JOSH remembers what WOLF said...

           ED reacts, curious, reverts to his normal voice...

                        Is your mum seeing anyone at the

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Open on a coffin at the front of the church. A framed 
           photograph of Rob, smiling, rests on the coffin. A PRIEST 
           stands beside it, addressing the MOURNERS...

                                 PRIEST
                        Robert was an exceptionally 
                        talented, gifted and hard-working 
                        young man. He was full of energy 
                        and enthusiasm, and achieved so 
                        much in his short life.

           Sitting in a pew, JOSH struggles to recognise this 
           description of Rob...

                                 PRIEST
                        Robert will be sadly missed by 
                        everyone who knew him. Robert’s 
                        family felt he would have wanted 
                        us to remember him by playing one 
                        of his favourite songs. 

           The PRIEST gives a nod. A bizarrely inappropriate 
           nihilistic rap song kicks in, full of references to “ho’s”, 
           “bitches” and “niggas”. The PRIEST and the MOURNERS grow 
           increasingly awkward as the song plays for a long beat.  

           JOSH looks over at Rob’s FAT SISTER and his extremely 
           beautiful FIT SISTER, consoling each other through their 
           tears. JOSH eyes them curiously, wondering how on earth 
           they could come from the same gene pool...

           INT. JOSH’S HOUSE (GARAGE) - DAY

           The door flies open. The strip lights come on, to reveal Mr 
           Tibb’s cage is empty. JOSH stares, stunned to see the cage 
           door is open. The wheel squeaks as it spins mysteriously.   

           JOSH is spooked. He looks round the garage. There’s no sign 
           of Mr Tibbs. A faint sound comes from a pile of boxes 
           covered by a dust sheet. JOSH reacts, stares. Another faint 
           scratching sound.

           JOSH isn’t sure how to handle this. He sees something, 
           reaches out, grabs a vicious looking claw hammer. Tension 
           as JOSH cautiously approaches the boxes, hammer at the 
           ready...

           JOSH peers at the dust sheet. There’s a sudden movement. 
           Startled, JOSH panics, lashes out with the hammer, 
           repeatedly hitting the boxes...

           BARNEY the cat lets out a terrified shriek as it flies out 
           from under the dust sheet and runs for the door. JOSH is 
           horrified...

                                 JOSH
                        Oh Jesus...!

           JOSH hurries after BARNEY...

                                 JOSH
                        Barney! I’m sorry!

           JOSH exits into the kitchen...

                                 JOSH (O.C.)
                        Barney!

           We stay in the garage for an eerie beat. The door to the 
           kitchen slowly closes, to reveal DAVE (late-twenties, blond 
           hair) hiding behind it, his hand clamped tightly over MR 
           TIBBS’ mouth. MR TIBBS lets out a few muffled squeaks. DAVE 
           fixes MR TIBBS with a stare...

                                 DAVE

           JOSH searches the far end of the garden. He’s still holding 
           the hammer. He calls out...

                                 JOSH
                        Barney! I’m not going to hurt

           There’s no sign of Barney. JOSH reacts with frustration...

           Above his head, the floorboards creek. JOSH looks up, 
           spooked. More creaking. Someone’s walking about upstairs.

           toward it - tense, alert, ready to strike with the hammer. 
           JOSH stops, listens at the bathroom door...

           Tension as JOSH approaches the shower. He draws back the 
           hammer, ready to strike. He psyches himself up, then throws 
           back the shower curtain, to reveal a startled DIANNE 
           soaping her tits and genitalia. She stares back at JOSH, 
           who is seemingly about to strike her with the hammer... 

           Mortified, JOSH yanks the shower curtain back across, and 
           takes a moment to process the sheer horror of the moment...

           sees that DAVE’s holding MR TIBBS...

           JOSH runs, wielding the hammer. DAVE throws MR TIBBS into

           JOSH sprints toward the Mercedes. It screeches away. JOSH 
           throws the hammer. It hits the rear window, cracking it...

           The Mercedes speeds down the street, leaving JOSH standing 
           in the middle of the road, reeling, suddenly once again 
           believing that everything that Wolf and Tiger told him is 
           true...

           JOSH and DIANNE eat dinner, sitting on opposite sides of

           cutlery on their plates. Given what happened earlier, they 
           can’t bring themselves to look at each other. A long, 
           excruciating beat through which JOSH grows increasingly 
           uncomfortable and wound up. He finally snaps, slamming his 
           cutlery down on the table, which startles and scares 
           DIANNE. JOSH fixes DIANNE with a manic stare...

           cover her chest. JOSH takes this in, but chooses to ignore 
           it. He pulls on his jacket. DIANNE chooses her moment 
           carefully, fixes JOSH with a look of concern...

                                 DIANNE
                        I think you should talk to 
                        someone.

           JOSH takes this in, non-committal...

                                 DIANNE
                        I spoke to Doctor Jones. He’s 
                        arranged for you to see a 
                        psychiatrist.

                                 JOSH
                        Mum. I’m not a mental. You have a 
                        good day.

           With that, JOSH walks out, leaving DIANNE increasingly 
           worried about him...

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (RECEPTION) - DAY

           JOSH enters and walks up to reception...

                                 JOSH
                        Hi. I need to see Denise Brown 
                        and Brian Ward. They’re patients 
                        here.

           The efficient RECEPTIONIST checks the computer...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Are you family...?

                                 JOSH
                            (unconvincing)
                        Yes.

           The RECEPTIONIST fixes JOSH with a dubious look...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        So you’re related to both of 
                        them...? 

           JOSH realises his mistake...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. I’m clearly lying. I really 
                        need to see them...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m afraid neither of them is 
                        currently allowed visitors.

                                 JOSH
                        Please. I have to see them. It’s 
                        a matter of life and death. Lots 
                        of death...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’m sorry, but you can’t see 
                        them. Excuse me...

           As the RECEPTIONIST turns away, JOSH grabs her arm, fixes 
           her with a desperate look...
                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        If you don’t let me see them, you 
                        are going to be responsible for 
                        the deaths of six billion people. 
                        You seem like a really nice, 
                        efficient lady. I’m sure you 
                        don’t want that.

           The RECEPTIONIST hardens, fixing JOSH with a stare...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Keep it up, and you’ll be seeing 
                        them when you’re sectioned to the 
                        unit yourself.

           The RECEPTIONIST snatches her arm away and heads off. The 
           sense of an idea forming as JOSH takes in what she just 
           said...

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           We watch PEOPLE passing by outside, going about their 
           everyday business...

           JOSH stares out at the PEOPLE passing. He suddenly feels 
           like he holds their fate in his hands. Standing beside him, 
           ED’s pouring a tube of sugar into his mouth. JOSH looks at 
           ED, takes in what he’s doing, then...

                                 JOSH
                        If you had to get yourself 
                        admitted to a psychiatric 
                        hospital, what would you do? 

           ED gives it a moments thought as he crunches the sugar in 
           his mouth, then...

                                 ED
                            (casual)
                        I’d kill a prostitute and 
                        mutilate her genitals.

           ED wanders off, leaving JOSH disturbed by the suggestion. 
           JOSH thinks a moment, then takes out his phone, makes a 
           call, waits for an answer...

                                 JOSH
                        Mum. It’s me. You know what you 
                        said about seeing this 
                        psychiatrist. I think it might be 
                        a good idea.

HOSPITAL (WAITING ROOM) - DAY

           JOSH sits there, anxiously staring at the door to the 
           consulting room. A plaque on the door reads ‘Doctor T. 
           Phillips’. JOSH battles his nerves. DANNY (mid-twenties) 
           enters, grabs a magazine, then takes a seat two along from 
           JOSH. 

           DANNY casually flicks through the magazine. JOSH shoots a 
           glance at him, catches his eye. DANNY detects JOSH’s 
           nerves...

                                 DANNY
                        First time...?

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah.

                                 DANNY
                        So are you...?
                            (twirling a finger 
                             beside his head)

                            (instinctively)
                        No...

           DANNY responds with a curious look. JOSH realises his 
           mistake, looks uncomfortable. The door to the consulting 
           room opens. DOCTOR PHILLIPS (early-forties) appears in the 
           doorway...

                                 DOCTOR PHILLIPS
                        Josh. Would you like to come 
                        in...?

           JOSH hesitates, daunted, then stands and heads over, 
           disappears inside, closing the door behind him.

           looks round the small, sparsely furnished room, takes in 
           the bars on the window. The door closes behind him. JOSH 
           turns, hears the door being locked. JOSH experiences a 
           sudden moment of panic at what he’s done, feels himself

           JOSH peers through the glass panel in a door. The corridor 
           appears deserted. JOSH pushes through the door and heads 
           off down the corridor, tense, alert, peering through doors 
           leading off the corridor as he passes...

           JOSH rounds the corner, ducks back out of sight as a NURSE 
           emerges from a room. The NURSE disappears into an adjoining 
           room. JOSH creeps round the corner, looks into the room and 
           sees something troubling...

           TIGER is strapped to the bed. She is extremely heavily 
           medicated, barely conscious, eyes rolling around in their 
           sockets. She’s disorientated and confused. JOSH approaches 
           the bed, extremely disturbed to see TIGER like this...

                                 JOSH
                        Oh Jesus. What did they do to

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry. I should’ve believed

           Strapped to the bed, mumbling and dribbling, TIGER actually 
           looks crazy as hell right now. JOSH becomes increasingly 
           aware of this contradiction as TIGER continues to mumble 
           and dribble...

           Visiting time. PATIENTS and their RELATIVES talk in hushed 
           whispers around the room. DIANNE and JOSH sit together in 
           some comfortable chairs. DIANNE is struggling to conceal 
           how disturbed and upset she is to find herself visiting her 
           son in a psychiatric unit...

                        It’s horrible, but you know. Some 
                        of these guys eat their own shit. 
                        I guess they have a pretty low 
                        benchmark. 

           DIANNE isn’t sure how to respond, changes the subject, 
           trying to keep it light...

                                 DIANNE
                        Zoe says ‘hi’. She wants you to 
                        know that she’s thinking about 
                        you.

           JOSH is appalled...

                                 JOSH
                        You told her - you told her I was

                        you do that? What is wrong with 
                        you...?

           DIANNE’s fearful of upsetting JOSH. He eyes a NURSE as she 
           passes, biding his time until she’s out of earshot...

                                 (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                 JOSH
                        You know what you said to me - 
                        all that stuff about the splinter 
                        in my mind - it’s from The 
                        Matrix, isn’t it?  

           WOLF nods, unashamed...

                                 WOLF
                        We found DVDs in the ruins of 
                        your civilisation. The Matrix, 
                        and The Terminator franchise. 
                        They showed us what was possible. 
                        They taught us that the future 
                        isn’t set in stone. ‘There is no 
                        fate, but what we make for 
                        ourselves’.

           JOSH isn’t sure what to make of this...

                                 JOSH
                        Right. So the whole, grand plan 
                        to save mankind was hatched after 
                        you watched a few DVDs...?

           WOLF nods as he selects some desert...

                                 WOLF
                        Those DVDs gave us hope in man’s 
                        darkest hour.

           WOLF heads off, leaving JOSH with renewed doubts...

           WOLF and JOSH join TIGER at a table. TIGER looks round to 
           check no one’s paying them any attention, then...

                                 TIGER
                            (to JOSH)
                        So what’s the plan? How does you 
                        getting yourself admitted help us 
                        get out of here? 

           JOSH hesitates as he suddenly sees a huge hole in his 
           thinking, but he isn’t about to admit that...

                                 JOSH
                        I obviously wanted you guys to 
                        know, that I know, that you’re 
                        not crazy.

                                 WOLF
                        We already know that.

                                 JOSH
                        Right...
                            (turning defensive)
                        Hey. I’m new to all this stuff.

                        You don’t know what I had to do 
                        to get in here. 

                                 TIGER
                        What did you do...?

           JOSH looks very uncomfortable...

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

           WOLF glances round, then...

                                 WOLF
                        Neither of us has been taking our 
                        medication for weeks.

           JOSH is troubled by this revelation, feeding his concerns 
           about their mental health...

                                 JOSH
                        Right. Is that a good idea...?

                                 WOLF
                        We use our medication to drug the 
                        staff and bust out of here. We 
                        just need to find a way to get it 
                        into their drinks. 

           JOSH looks thoughtful as he takes this in...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (CORRIDOR) - DAY

           JOSH walks down the corridor. As he passes an open door, he 
           sees something and stops in his tracks. There’s a coffee 
           machine in the staff room. Sunlight falls on it - casting 
           an almost heavenly glow over it. JOSH stares - the sense of 
           a plan forming.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (WOLF’S ROOM) - DAY

           JOSH appears in the open doorway, excited by the sense of a 
           plan coming together...

                                 JOSH
                        Wolf...?

           JOSH sees that Wolf isn’t there, but then he sees 
           something, reacts, curious. ‘no fate’ has been carved into 
           the wall in spidery letters. 
                                        (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)           Then JOSH sees something else. A shelf full of DVDs. JOSH’s 
           eyes travel over the titles - The Matrix Trilogy, The 
           Terminator franchise, Twelve Monkeys, Back to the Future... 

           JOSH is troubled by the reminder of what DI Blake told him. 
           We now see DAVE, standing in the doorway behind JOSH. JOSH 
           is oblivious as he takes The Matrix DVD from the shelf and 
           looks at the back cover...

           DAVE suddenly walks purposefully toward JOSH, holding a 
           clear plastic bag taught in his hands. DAVE thrusts the bag 
           over JOSH’s head and tightens it around his neck, pulling 
           JOSH off balance. JOSH struggles frantically, his face 
           contorted inside the bag...  

           JOSH’s POV through the bag. DAVE squeaks manically and 
           bares his teeth like a rodent...

           JOSH is fighting for breath, sucking the bag into his 
           mouth. JOSH claws at DAVE’s hands, but it’s no good... 

           DAVE squeaks as he repeatedly slams JOSH’s face into the 
           ‘no fate’ graffiti on the wall, as though ramming the point 
           home. JOSH stares at the words - ‘no fate’ - as his face 
           travels toward them, and then smashes into them. Inspired, 
           JOSH summons all his inner strength, swings his feet up, 
           pushes hard against the wall. DAVE staggers backwards, 
           trips, falls...

           JOSH lands on DAVE. DAVE loses his grip on the bag. JOSH 
           pulls away, rips the bag off his head as he struggles to 
           his feet, gasping for air. DAVE scrabbles to his feet. They 
           trade stares.

           DAVE squeaks and bares his teeth at JOSH, but then he hears 
           voices approaching down the corridor. DAVE flees out the 
           door. JOSH wobbles on his feet, supports himself as he 
           takes a moment to recover...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (WOLF’S BEDROOM) - DAY

           JOSH takes a painful breath. WOLF and TIGER look on in 
           concern. JOSH’s painful breaths will punctuate the scene...

                                 JOSH
                        It was the same guy who was at my 
                        house. Blonde hair. He squeaked 
                        at me.

           WOLF and TIGER react, swapping a meaningful look. JOSH 
           catches it...

                                 JOSH
                        What...?
           (cid:13)                              (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                               (cid:13)                            (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                 WOLF
                        They know you’re a threat to them 
                        now.

                                 JOSH
                        I nearly died...

                                 WOLF
                        Everyone dies. Not everyone 
                        lives.

           JOSH swallows painfully, then reacts angrily...

                                 JOSH
                        That sounds like a line from a 
                        film poster. If you want people 
                        to take you seriously, don’t say 
                        that kind of shit.

           JOSH and WOLF trade stares...

                                 TIGER
                        We need to get out of here. He 
                        won’t stop until you’re dead. 

           JOSH swallows painfully, then...

                                 JOSH
                        Lucky for me, you, and the rest 
                        of humanity, I’ve got a plan.

           MONTAGE: Beautiful images of coffee making inter-cut with 
           JOSH’s expression, but in contrast to earlier, he now looks 
           determined and focused. He has a purpose. Finally, JOSH 
           snaps open lots, and lots, and lots of plastic capsules and 
           pours the powder into the coffees...

           Open on JOSH, standing in the doorway, carrying a tray with

                                 JOSH
                        Morning ladies...

           Closest to the door, NEIL (long hair, male nurse) turns 
           round to reveal he is in fact a man, taking JOSH by 
           surprise...

                        ...and man...It’s the hair...

           NEIL responds with a hard stare, making JOSH uncomfortable.

           KAREN and SUSIE (early-thirties, attractive, nurses), react 
           with enthusiasm to the arrival of their coffees...

                                 KAREN
                            (to JOSH)
                        You’re a complete star.

                                 SUSIE
                        I so need this. I’m on suicide 
                        watch until midnight. 

                                 JOSH
                            (going for the joke)
                        You’d have to be mad to work 
                        here...

           The gag is met with disapproving stares...

                                 KAREN
                        Josh. That’s not funny.

           JOSH squirms...

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry. 
                            (to NEIL)
                        Chocolate...?

                                 NEIL
                        You know how us chicks love a bit 
                        of chocolate. 

           JOSH forces a smile as he sprinkles chocolate on the 
           cappuccino. JOSH sees KAREN raising her coffee to her 
           lips...

           CLOSE-UP on KAREN’s lips as she tastes the coffee. She 
           smacks her lips, reacting to the taste. Something’s 
           wrong...

           On JOSH as he sees this. KAREN frowns, turns to JOSH, who 
           is struggling to control his nerves...

                                 KAREN
                        Has this got sugar in it...?

           JOSH is relieved, shakes his head - takes out a tube of 
           sugar and hands it to KAREN, who responds with a warm 
           smile...

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (DAY ROOM) - DAY

           JOSH emerges from the nurses station. He passes WOLF and 
           TIGER, gives them a nod. WOLF and TIGER look over at KAREN, 
           NEIL and SUSIE drinking their coffees...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (TOILETS) - DAY

           Open on a row of cubicles. The door of the middle cubicle 
           is shut. Inside, the toilet flushes. The door opens. JOSH 
           emerges, letting out a deep breath. He crosses to the sink, 
           rests his hands on it, takes a moment to recover from the 
           huge shit he just had. He looks proudly at himself in the 
           mirror. The sense he is growing as a person.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (TIGER’S ROOM) - DAY

           JOSH enters, sees TIGER...

                                 JOSH
                        Hey.

           But then JOSH sees that TIGER has her hand inside her top, 
           feeling her breast. JOSH reacts, shocked - covers his 
           eyes...

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry. I’ll uh...
                            (making to leave)
                        You’re busy...

           TIGER fixes JOSH with an anxious look...

                                 TIGER
                        I think I found a lump...

           JOSH is taken aback, isn’t sure how to respond. TIGER grabs 
           JOSH’s hand and shoves it into her top, underneath her bra. 
           JOSH is shocked as TIGER guides his hand, feeling her 
           breast...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay...

                            (tentative)
                        A nipple...?

                                 TIGER
                        Below the nipple. There...

           JOSH feels around...

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t feel anything...

                                 TIGER
                        Are you sure?

           JOSH is uncertain...

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know. I’m not a tit 
                        doctor.

           TIGER takes this in. They trade stares. JOSH feels 
           uncomfortable that his hand is still on TIGER’s breast...

                                 JOSH
                        Am I done...?

           TIGER nods. JOSH withdraws his hand, watches TIGER as she 
           buttons her top. He has something on his mind...

                                 JOSH
                        If we do this. We stop the virus 
                        getting out. What happens when 
                        it’s over...?

                                 TIGER
                        I get to go home.

           JOSH looks sad at the thought. TIGER fixes JOSH with a 
           poignant look...

                                 TIGER
                        Don’t.

                                 JOSH
                        What...?

                                 TIGER
                        If I fuck you, six billion people 
                        could die.

           JOSH tries to make light of it...

           TIGER fixes JOSH with a piercing, troubled look of mixed 
           emotions, through which JOSH becomes increasingly 
           uncomfortable, until he finally has to ask...

                                 JOSH
                        What...?

                            (hurting)
                        I can’t do this.

           TIGER walks out, leaving JOSH confused, staring after her, 
           strangely moved by the moment...

           SUSIE’s staring intensely at a box of cakes. Suddenly, she 
           grabs one and tries to shove it into her mouth in one go. 
           She ends up smearing cake over her face. Looking on, JOSH 
           takes this in, he turns to find NEIL up close, in his 
           personal space...

                                 NEIL

                        I can fly like a bird...

           NEIL raises a table tennis bat, then slowly runs his tongue 
           up it, giving it a long, slow lick. JOSH takes this in, 
           disturbed, then hurries over to WOLF and TIGER, who are 
           also taking in the scene...

                                 JOSH

           uncontrollably. She grips a set of keys in her hands. WOLF 
           and TIGER keep watch...

                                 WOLF
                            (to JOSH)
                        Get the keys.

           JOSH crosses over, really uncertain how to deal with KAREN. 
           KAREN sees JOSH approaching and reacts with fear, pressing 
           herself into the corner...  

                                 JOSH
                        It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt 
                        you.

           JOSH squats and attempts to gently pry the keys out of 
           KAREN’s hands...

                                 JOSH
                        Give me the keys.

           KAREN hugs the keys to her body...

                                 KAREN
                        These are my keys...

           JOSH becomes increasingly forceful as he tries to pry the 
           keys out of KAREN’s hands...

                                 JOSH
                        Just give me the keys. C’mon...

           At the door, WOLF sees something...

                                 WOLF
                        Someone’s coming. Get the keys.

                                 JOSH
                        She won’t give them to me.

                                 WOLF
                        Hit her.

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t hit women.

           JOSH and KAREN wrestle over the keys, the struggle becoming 
           increasingly desperate and physical...

                                 JOSH
                        Give me the keys!

                                 KAREN
                        No! My keys!

                        My keys! My keys! My keys!

                                 JOSH
                        Let go!

                                 WOLF
                        Hit her!

                                 KAREN

                                 WOLF
                        HIT HER!

           JOSH lashes out, slaps KAREN hard round the face a couple 
           of times. She breaks down, sobs, holds out the keys. JOSH 
           feels terrible, takes the keys...

                                 JOSH
                        Thank you.

           JOSH stands to leave. KAREN grabs one of his ankles, fixes 
           him with a terrified look...

                                 KAREN
                        They’re going to eat my face...

           JOSH drags KAREN across the floor as she clings onto his 
           ankle. He tries to shake her off...

                                 JOSH
                        Let go! Get off!

                                 WOLF
                        We need to go, now!

                                 KAREN
                        Help me. Please...

           JOSH aggressively kicks KAREN away...

                                 JOSH
                        Fuck off!

           KAREN releases JOSH’s ankle. He hurries out, leaving her 
           lying on the floor, sobbing...

           The alarm is sounding. A door flies open as JOSH, TIGER and 
           WOLF burst out. They run up to a car. WOLF opens the boot, 
           fishes inside a holdall and starts pulling out pistols, 
           clips of ammunition and mobile phones...

                                 JOSH
                        Where did all that come from?

                                 WOLF
                        We stashed it on our last break-
                        out. Let’s go.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           JOSH, TIGER and WOLF get in, slamming their doors - WOLF’s 
           at the wheel, JOSH is in the passenger seat, TIGER’s in the 
           back. WOLF fires the engine. BANG!!! JOSH, WOLF and TIGER 
           shriek and recoil from the massive impact as NEIL lands on 
           the bonnet, his face smashing through the windscreen. A 
           beat as JOSH, WOLF and TIGER take a moment to recover from 
           the shock. JOSH peers at NEIL’s bloody face...

                                 JOSH
                        Are you all right...?

           NEIL opens his eyes, fixing JOSH with a weak look...

                                 NEIL
                        I can fly like a bird.

           JOSH grimaces. The evidence would suggest otherwise. WOLF 
           suddenly floors the accelerator. The car shoots backwards. 
           JOSH is outraged...

                                 JOSH
                        There’s a male nurse on the

           WOLF spins the car round, throwing NEIL off the bonnet. 
           WOLF shoots a look at JOSH...

                        Is there...?

           A classic genre shot of the headlights illuminating the

           JOSH looks thoughtful as he takes this in. He stares out at 
           the broken white line as they travel down the road. 
           Suddenly, the headlights illuminate the security gates 
           outside the Devlin Pharmaceutical building. JOSH’s 
           expression registers shock. He braces himself as he 
           realises the car’s headed straight toward the gates at high 
           speed...

                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                                      (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                          (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)           He’s stunned to see the car parked up at reception. He 
           peers inside. It’s apparently empty. 

           The SECURITY GUARD senses a presence, looks round, sees 
           WOLF, TIGER and JOSH standing there. Before the SECURITY 
           GUARD can react, WOLF pistol whips him, knocking him to the 
           floor. JOSH is again troubled by the casual violence...

                                 JOSH
                        I’m down with the whole black 
                        highway at night thing, but can 
                        we just try and hurt as few 
                        people as possible, as little as 
                        possible? Work with me on this.

           WOLF ignores JOSH...

                                 WOLF
                            (to TIGER)
                        Take his pass and tie him up.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (LIFT) - NIGHT

           WOLF, JOSH and TIGER enter. WOLF presses a button for the 
           fourth floor. The doors close. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (ANIMAL LAB) - NIGHT

           The lights are off. It’s pitch black. The faint sound of a 
           guinea pig squeaking gradually grows louder...

           More and more guinea pigs join in until it becomes a 
           cacophony of shrill, high pitched squeaking. It’s 
           disturbing and unsettling. The squeaking builds in 
           intensity and volume...

           Suddenly strip lighting comes on, travelling down the 
           length of the room, revealing dozens of guinea pigs in 
           cages. Some of them have electrodes running from their 
           heads to equipment which monitors heart rate, pulse and 
           brain function... 

           Standing by the door, WOLF, JOSH and TIGER take in the 
           scene. JOSH is disturbed by the sight, walks forward - sees 
           a guinea pig which is wired up. He looks at the monitor. As 
           the guinea pig stares at JOSH, the monitor shows its brain 
           function increasing...

           WOLF and TIGER’s expressions harden in anger as they take 
           in the scene. They look at each other and share a little 
           nod...
                                       (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                      (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                             (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                     (cid:13)           Bang! JOSH recoils as a bullet takes out the guinea pig he 
           was staring at. The graphs on the monitor flat-line as it 
           emits a continuous note.  

           JOSH looks round to see WOLF and TIGER, their pistols 
           drawn...

           A high energy track kicks in. We go into SLOW MOTION as 
           WOLF and TIGER move through the lab, shooting the guinea 
           pigs as they go. We stay on WOLF and TIGER and their 
           balletic, stylish shooting, rather than the actual 
           slaughter...

           Bullets explode from their guns. Empty cartridges fall 
           artfully to the floor, tinkling on impact...

           TIGER runs, dives through the air, firing, lands on her 
           hands, springs off them onto a bench and walks along it, 
           firing downwards at the guinea pigs in the cages... 

           WOLF runs up the side of a wall, catches a cage with a 
           powerful kick, sends it flying through the air. WOLF blasts 
           it out of the sky with a volley of shots, as you might a 
           clay pigeon...

           On JOSH, frozen, looking on in horror...

           On a terrified guinea pig in a cage, squeak. WOLF fires 
           backwards, under his arm. Bang! 

           Standing on the bench, TIGER lets out a final volley of 
           shots, then stops firing. She surveys the carnage...

           WOLF hears a squeak, spins to see a guinea pig in a cage, 
           the sole survivor, levels both guns at it, pulls the 
           triggers. Two clicks. The guns are empty.

           The guinea pig stares, seemingly reprieved...

           WOLF draws a grenade, flicks out the pin, opens the cage, 
           poised to drop the grenade...

                                 WOLF
                            (passionate, Portuguese)
                        São você pronto para morrê-lo mau 
                        bastardo.

           WOLF drops the grenade and closes the cage...

                                 WOLF
                        Fire in the hole!

           WOLF, JOSH and TIGER take cover... 

           As the guinea pig stares at the grenade, a monitor shows 
           its brain functions going wild. Beep, beep, beep, beep, 
           beep, beep, beeeeeeep. BOOM! The grenade explodes.  
                                        (cid:13)                       (cid:13)                                                         (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                     (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                 (cid:13)                                                          (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                         (cid:13)                                                (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)           WOLF, JOSH and TIGER stand. It takes a moment for the smoke 
           to clear. JOSH takes in the carnage, then...

                                 JOSH
                        Was that really necessary?

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (VACCINE LAB) - NIGHT

           The alarm is sounding. A couple of shots shatter the glass 
           panel separating this lab from the animal lab. WOLF, JOSH 
           and TIGER enter.

           WOLF looks round, sees a secure storage unit...

                                 WOLF
                        There.

           On the storage unit. There are rows of test tubes inside. A 
           sign warns that the contents of the unit are hazardous - 
           ‘Biological Materials’. WOLF, JOSH and TIGER stare in at 
           the test tubes...

                                 JOSH
                        Is that it...?

           WOLF nods, poignant, then snaps into action...

                                 WOLF
                        Open up the gas taps. We’ll 
                        incinerate it.

           MONTAGE: On multiple gas taps as they’re opened. High 
           pressure gas hisses out...

           WOLF places his phone on a work bench beside a gas tap...

                                 WOLF
                        We wait until enough gas has 
                        built up, then we make the call.

           TIGER sees something...

                                 TIGER
                        Wolf!

           WOLF looks round, sees a guinea pig approaching the storage 
           unit. WOLF fires instinctively...

           We go into SLOW MOTION as we travel with the bullet. It 
           misses the guinea pig, hits the storage unit, smashes the 
           glass and shatters the test tubes...

           WOLF, TIGER and JOSH react with horror...

                        Move!

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (CORRIDOR) - DAY

           JOSH, WOLF and TIGER sprint down the corridor. JOSH is in 
           the lead, glances behind him, runs straight into a clear 
           perspex door. BANG! He goes down, stunned from the impact. 

           TIGER and WOLF run up. TIGER swipes the card and opens the 
           door. WOLF drags a dazed JOSH through the door. TIGER 
           presses a button to close the door. WOLF drops JOSH, 
           causing him to hit his head on the floor. WOLF goes to work 
           on a control panel beside the door...

           JOSH starts to recover, climbing to his feet...

                                 JOSH
                        Did we just release the virus...?

                                 WOLF
                        We can seal off the labs. The 
                        virus will be contained. It will 
                        give us enough time for the gas 
                        to build up.

           TIGER sees something...

                                 TIGER
                        Shit.

           WOLF and JOSH look round to see a FIGURE in a lab coat 
           running toward the door. But then JOSH is stunned and 
           horrified to see it’s ZOE...

                                 JOSH
                        Zoe...

           ZOE runs up to the door, and is stunned to see JOSH on the 
           other side of it. It’s soundproof. We see her lips move, 
           but can’t hear her as she questions what JOSH is doing 
           here. JOSH can’t even begin to answer that. 

                                 TIGER
                            (to JOSH)
                        You know her...?

                                 JOSH
                        She’s my ex-girlfriend...

           ZOE swipes her card to open the door, but it won’t work. 
           ZOE tries it again, but the door still doesn’t open...

                                 WOLF
                        We can’t. The virus is airborne. 
                        She could be infected.

           ZOE’s banging on the door, demanding that JOSH open it...

                                 JOSH
                            (to WOLF)
                        Open the fucking door!

                                 WOLF
                        If we let her out, we all die. 
                        Everyone dies.

                                 JOSH
                        You don’t know that. Maybe she’s 
                        all right. She might not be 
                        infected.

                                 WOLF
                        Are you really willing to risk 
                        all of humanity for her...?

           JOSH looks at ZOE, who’s pleading with him to open the 
           door. JOSH is torn, doesn’t know what to do...

                                 WOLF
                        You think she’d do that for you?

           JOSH isn’t sure...

                                 TIGER
                        Who ended it, you or her...?

           JOSH looks pained at the memory. WOLF reads the look...

                                 WOLF
                        She crapped all over you, didn’t 
                        she?

                                 JOSH
                        What does it matter who did the 
                        crapping? I won’t let her die. I 
                        still love her. 

           TIGER looks hurt as she takes this in...

                                 TIGER
                        Why...?

           That’s a hard question for JOSH to answer. He looks at ZOE 
           sadly...

                        I don’t know...I don’t know how 
                        to stop loving her.

           JOSH struggles to process what he’s feeling...

                                 WOLF
                        If the virus gets out, she’s dead 
                        either way, and so are you, and 
                        so is your mum, and six billion 
                        other people...
                            (indicating ZOE)
                        ...all to save this piece of 
                        snatch.

                                 JOSH
                            (wincing at the 
                             terminology, appalled)
                        Jesus...

                                 WOLF
                        If she’s really that special - 
                        she’s that amazing - maybe we 
                        should open the door.

           JOSH considers this question as he looks at ZOE. She’s 
           desperately pleading, fearing for her life. JOSH knows what 
           he must do, but he’s pained at the thought of it. He fixes 
           ZOE with a devastated look as he prepares to explain...

           CUT TO ZOE’s SIDE OF THE DOOR: JOSH’s lips move as he gives 
           a heartfelt explanation of what he has to do. ZOE looks 
           confused, can’t hear a word of it.

           CUT TO JOSH’s SIDE OF THE DOOR: ZOE’s lips move as she 
           desperately pleads with JOSH to the open the door. JOSH 
           looks confused, can’t hear a word of it. JOSH realises that 
           he has to end the ‘silent’ exchange...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. I have to go now.

           JOSH misreads ZOE’s pleading, responds to what he thinks is 
           a declaration of love. JOSH places his hand on the perspex, 
           mirroring the position of ZOE’s hand... 

                                 JOSH
                        I love you too.

           CUT TO ZOE’s SIDE OF THE DOOR:

                                 ZOE
                        Open the fucking door you useless 
                        prick!

           JOSH fixes ZOE with a desperately troubled look as he turns 
           and walks away.

           is abandoning her. She hammers on the door with both 
           fists...

                                 ZOE
                        No! Where are you going? Open the 
                        door! Josh! Open the door! You 
                        crazy fuck! Josh...!

           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (CORRIDOR) - NIGHT

           WOLF, JOSH and TIGER emerge through a door...

                                 WOLF
                        We need to get clear before we 
                        blow the lab.

           WOLF sees that JOSH is staring back through the doors, 
           traumatised at the thought of abandoning ZOE. WOLF looks at 
           JOSH with a new-found respect...

                                 WOLF
                        You did what had to be done.    

           WOLF cups his balls, gripping them in a symbolic gesture of 
           manhood. JOSH is strangely moved by the respect. JOSH and 
           WOLF share a moment. BANG! BANG! BANG! A quick succession 
           of shots. The bullets strike WOLF, who goes down...

           JOSH and TIGER recoil, startled, then see DAVE advancing 
           down the corridor, his gun levelled...

                                 TIGER
                        Wolf!

           TIGER returns fire. DAVE ducks into a doorway. TIGER’s guns 
           click. They’re empty...

           DAVE steps out and fires. Bullets smack into the wall, just 
           missing TIGER and JOSH. WOLF fixes them with a desperate, 
           weak look...

                                 WOLF
                        Go...Blow the lab...Go...

           TIGER freezes, unable to leave WOLF. JOSH sees DAVE 
           advancing. He grabs TIGER and pulls her through a door. She 
           fixes WOLF, who’s staring at her weakly with a desperate 
           look as she resists leaving him... 

                                 TIGER
                        No! Wolf! No...!

           The lights are off. JOSH struggles to get TIGER through the 
           door...

                                 TIGER
                        We can’t leave him!

                                 JOSH
                        We have to. We have to blow the 
                        lab. C’mon.

           As much as it pains her, TIGER realises JOSH is right. They 
           run through the canteen...

           DAVE walks purposefully down the corridor, squeaking and 
           bearing his teeth...

           WOLF’s crawling away from him, dragging himself along, inch 
           by inch, leaving a trail of smeared blood. WOLF weakens as 
           the life drains out of him. He can’t crawl any further. 
           WOLF rolls over onto his back. DAVE shows no emotion as he 
           looks down at him. He points his gun at WOLF’s face. For 
           the first time, we see WOLF’s fear. He pleads for his 
           life...

                                 WOLF
                        Don’t...

           Bang! JOSH and TIGER stop in their tracks as they hear the 
           shot ring out. They know it means WOLF is dead, and that 
           hits them hard. As they stare toward the door at the other 
           end of the canteen, it starts to open. JOSH and TIGER duck 
           out of sight behind the serving counter.

           TIGER peers out. DAVE appears in the doorway, silhouetted 
           against the light from the corridor. A chilling, high 
           pitched squeak echoes around the canteen. TIGER fixes JOSH 
           with a look as she holds out her phone. They talk in low, 
           urgent whispers...

                                 TIGER
                        I’ll buy you some time. Get 
                        clear, then blow the lab.

                        I’m not leaving you.

           TIGER presses the phone into JOSH’s hand...

                                 TIGER
                        Don’t let it all be for nothing. 
                        We owe Wolf that. Go. Go. 

           JOSH is torn, fixes TIGER with an emotional look, then 
           scurries through the kitchen, keeping low. The strip lights 
           come on. TIGER grimaces. Shit. She looks round, sees some 
           kitchen knives...

           DAVE walks swiftly through the seating area toward the 
           kitchen...

           JOSH reaches the door at the end of the kitchen. Tries the 
           handle. It’s locked...

                                 JOSH
                            (low)
                        Shit.

           DAVE enters the kitchen, sees JOSH, advances, gun levelled. 
           JOSH freezes, terrified...

                                 TIGER (O.C.)
                        Hey.

           DAVE looks round to see TIGER standing there. She throws a 
           knife. DAVE dodges it, fires. TIGER dives for cover behind 
           a counter. DAVE continues firing. Click. His gun’s empty.

           TIGER emerges from the behind the counter, holding a 
           saucepan in either hand. DAVE selects two saucepans from a 
           wrack. They square up, ready for combat. 

           TIGER attacks. TIGER and DAVE exchange fast-paced blows - a 
           martial arts style fight, with saucepans. The clanging of 
           the pans adding an almost musical soundtrack... 

           JOSH looks on. TIGER’s getting beaten back, fending off 
           blows. JOSH picks his moment, launches himself at DAVE. 
           DAVE barely pauses his assault on TIGER to smash JOSH in 
           the face with one of the saucepans. JOSH recoils, stunned, 
           bends double, clutching his nose. We stay with JOSH as the 
           sound of clanging saucepans continues nearby...

           DAVE and TIGER lock saucepans, face to face. TIGER head-
           butts DAVE. DAVE’s momentarily stunned. TIGER seizes the 
           moment, drops the saucepans and lunges for a knife that’s 
           in a tray of assorted cutlery. DAVE grabs her. They lose 
           their balance and fall to the floor, taking the tray of 
           cutlery with them...

           JOSH is still recovering from the blow to the face...
                                       (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                                  (cid:13)                                (cid:13)                                    (cid:13)                                       (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                        (cid:13)                                              (cid:13)                             (cid:13)                                                                     (cid:13)                                                             (cid:13)                                  (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)           TIGER and DAVE struggle. DAVE pins TIGER, clamps his hands 
           around her throat, strangling her. TIGER sees the knife 
           lying among the cutlery on the floor. She reaches for it, 
           straining. Her hand’s centimetres from the knife, feeling 
           for it...

           TIGER’s struggling to breath. Her hand gropes for the 
           knife. TIGER feels her hand grab something metallic. She 
           plunges what she assumes is the knife into DAVE. They both 
           pause, DAVE expecting to feel pain. But he feels nothing. 
           They both look down and see that TIGER is in fact holding a 
           desert spoon. Both TIGER and DAVE take a moment to process 
           the mix up. TIGER reacts first. She rams the spoon in 
           DAVE’s eye and twists it viciously... 

           DAVE screams, releases TIGER, clutching his eye, staggers 
           to his feet...

           TIGER sees something, dives, lands, rolls, grabs a heavy 
           cast iron frying pan as she springs back onto her feet and 
           immediately throws it at DAVE, who’s still clutching his 
           eye... 

           We go into SLOW MOTION as we follow the frying pan as it 
           spins through the air toward DAVE’s head...

           With lightening reactions, DAVE snatches the frying pan out 
           of mid air and throws it straight back at TIGER... 

           We follow the frying pan at full speed as it spins through 
           the air. It catches TIGER with a vicious glancing blow on 
           the forehead. She goes down, stunned...

           JOSH finally recovers, only to see DAVE advancing on him, 
           blood seeping from his eye. DAVE grabs JOSH and slams him 
           face down on a counter. JOSH loses his grip on the phone. 
           It clatters across the floor. JOSH is appalled... 

           DAVE squeaks as he puts his arm round JOSH’s neck and 
           starts to squeeze. Pinned, face down on the counter, JOSH 
           flails helplessly. He makes a horrible gurgling sound as 
           DAVE crushes his windpipe. JOSH looks round desperately. He 
           sees a coffee machine beside his head... 

           A loud clang. DAVE looks round to see TIGER staggering 
           through the kitchen toward them. Blood pours from a nasty 
           wound on the side of her forehead. TIGER’s legs are like 
           jelly. She zigzags wildly, crashing into pot stands, 
           sending pots clattering across the floor. She staggers, 
           falls, collapses, flails around helplessly on the floor, 
           desperate to help JOSH, but unable to do so... 

           DAVE looks round as his full attention returns to 
           strangling JOSH. He reacts with surprise as he finds 
           himself staring straight into the coffee machine’s steam 
           nozzle, inches from his face. JOSH turns the dial. 
                        (cid:13)
           (cid:13)                                                    (cid:13)           Steam blasts into DAVE’s face. DAVE squeals as he recoils, 
           scolded, clutching his face, releasing JOSH...

           DAVE staggers backwards, takes a moment to recover. He 
           opens his eyes. JOSH hits him square in the face with a 
           rolling pin, shattering his nose. DAVE goes down. JOSH 
           stands over him, gives him a savage beating, hitting him 
           again and again...

                                 JOSH
                        What? You not squeaking now? 
                        Squeak piggy, squeak! 

           JOSH squeaks as he delivers a few final blows. He stops, 
           then gives DAVE a final whack for good measure. He’s 
           momentarily shocked by what he’s done.

           As JOSH looks down at DAVE, he’s suddenly curious. He has 
           to know the truth. JOSH grabs a kitchen knife and a 
           sharpening stick. JOSH strokes the knife up and down the 
           sharpening stick a few times, then squats over DAVE, grabs 
           him by his hair and cuts into the side of his forehead... 

           JOSH dry wretches as he cuts into flesh. He psyches himself 
           up then peels the skin back. JOSH reacts, stunned. DAVE has 
           a micro-processor in his skull. JOSH is struck by the 
           moment. The conclusive proof he has been looking for. He’s 
           over-come with relief...

                                 JOSH
                        Thank fuck for that.

           JOSH looks round and sees TIGER standing there, weak and 
           bloody. They trade a poignant look.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS - NIGHT

           Standing a short distance away, JOSH and TIGER stare at the 
           building. TIGER gives JOSH a nod. JOSH dials the preset 
           number on the phone...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS (VACCINE LAB) - NIGHT

           Gas hisses out of the taps. Lying on the counter, the 
           mobile phone lights up as it starts to ring and vibrate - 
           an ironically upbeat pop song ringtone...

DEVLIN PHARMACEUTICALS - NIGHT

           A huge explosion rips through the fourth floor of the 
           building. A wall of fire bursts through the windows...

           JOSH and TIGER take it in. It’s a bitter sweet moment for 
           JOSH...

                                 JOSH
                        I just killed my ex-girlfriend...

                                 TIGER
                        You just saved six billion 
                        people. 

           JOSH takes some comfort in this. TIGER fixes him with an 
           emotional look...

                                 TIGER
                        It’s you. It was always you. 
                        You’re the one. I have always 
                        loved you.

           JOSH can’t accept that...

                                 JOSH
                        How can you say that? You don’t 
                        know me. We’ve stared at each 
                        other a few times, and I felt 
                        your tit. That isn’t love. You 
                        can’t love me. You don’t. The 
                        world doesn’t work like that... 

           TIGER impulsively kisses JOSH. A soft, tender kiss. They 
           pull back and search each others eyes. JOSH goes with his 
           feelings, accepting TIGER’s declaration...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay.

           The moment is interrupted by approaching footsteps behind 
           them...

                                 POLICE OFFICERS (O.C.)
                        Armed police! Put your hands on 
                        your head! Down! Down on the 
                        ground!
                            (etc)

           JOSH and TIGER continue looking at each other...

                                 JOSH
                        I have to tell you something...

                                 TIGER
                        What...?

                        Those beanbags. They really hurt.

           JOSH reaches out, takes hold of TIGER’s hand. They share a 
           soft smile, then turn to face the POLICE OFFICERS together. 
           JOSH fixes the multitude of POLICE OFFICERS with a defiant 
           look... 

                                 JOSH
                        Fuck you.

           The POLICE OFFICERS fire a barrage of beanbags and 
           tasers...

           We watch PEOPLE passing by outside, going about their 
           everyday business. A sense of the world continuing as 
           normal...

           At the counter, ED stares at the front page of a newspaper 
           with utter disbelief. It features photographs of Josh, Wolf 
           and Tiger, under a headline that reads ‘Psychiatric 
           Patients Cause Explosion at Laboratory’.

           ED struggles to take it in. He folds the paper and turns to 
           make a cup of coffee. As he operates the coffee machine, he 
           wears a blank, bored expression. After a moment, he shoots 
           an envious look at Josh’s photograph in the folded 
           newspaper...

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (OFFICE) - DAY

           Open on JOSH, sitting on a chair. He looks calm, confident, 
           purposeful and composed. DI BLAKE and DOCTOR PHILLIPS look 
           back at him...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        It seems Denise somehow managed 
                        to escape from the back of the 
                        police van that was transferring 
                        her back to the unit. She’s 
                        missing.

           JOSH gives a bitter sweet smile as he takes this in...

                                 DI BLAKE

                                 JOSH
                        Everyone dies. Not everyone 
                        lives.

           DI BLAKE gets in JOSH’s face, menacing...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        Listen to me you crazy little 
                        shit. I’ll make you tell me where 
                        she is.

           DOCTOR PHILLIPS fixes DI BLAKE with a disapproving look. DI 
           BLAKE backs off, frustrated...

                                 JOSH
                            (to DI BLAKE)
                        You should be out there catching 
                        the guy who killed Wolf. You 
                        catch him, and I can prove 
                        everything I’m telling you is 
                        true. 

           DI BLAKE opens a file on the desk, and slides a photograph 
           across to JOSH...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        You mean this guy...?

           JOSH is surprised to see it’s a head shot of Dave...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        We’ve already caught him.

           JOSH is surprised by this revelation...

                                 DOCTOR PHILLIPS
                        His name’s Dave Watson. He’s a

                                 JOSH
                        Here? In this unit...?

           DOCTOR PHILLIPS nods...

                                 DOCTOR PHILLIPS
                        It appears Brian drew him into 
                        his fantasy, exactly like he did 
                        with you. 

           JOSH can’t accept that...

                                 JOSH
                        No. He’s a replicant. He’s 
                        chipped. I saw it. You have to 
                        cut into his skull...

                                 DI BLAKE
                        Because we’re really allowed to 
                        do that.

                                 JOSH
                        Cut into his skull, right here. 
                        You’ll find a micro-chip. A 
                        processor...

                                 DOCTOR PHILLIPS
                        Josh. He’s as much a victim in 
                        all this as you are.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not a victim. I saved you. I 
                        saved all of you. If it wasn’t 
                        for me, you’d be drowning in your 
                        own flem...

           DI BLAKE and DOCTOR PHILLIPS look dubious. JOSH gives up 
           trying to convince them...

                                 JOSH
                        I know what I did. I know what 
                        happened. That’s good enough for 
                        me.

           JOSH stands to leave...

                                 DOCTOR PHILLIPS
                        Where are you going...?

                                 JOSH

                        I’m afraid we can’t let you 
                        leave. You’ve been sectioned 
                        under the Mental Health Act.

           JOSH gives a little shake of the head, not wanting to 
           believe that’s true...

           JOSH struggles with four MALE NURSES as he’s bundled out 
           the door...

                                 JOSH
                        Cut into his head! He’s chipped!

                        inside a human body! Cut into his 
                        fucking head!

           The MALE NURSES pin JOSH down. He struggles desperately. 
           One of them injects him. This is really disturbing...

                                 JOSH

           Strip lights pass over-head...

           JOSH stares up at them blankly as he’s wheeled along, 
           strapped to a trolley. He’s heavily medicated. The lights 
           pass over-head in a blur... 

           The trolley stops. JOSH looks round and sees DAVE strapped 
           to a trolley on the other side of the corridor. DAVE’s face 
           is burnt and bruised. DAVE is also heavily medicated, but 
           just about manages to bare his teeth in an exaggerated 
           rodent like over-bite...

           JOSH tries to speak, but all he can do is mumble and 
           dribble as he struggles against his restraints. Go out on 
           JOSH mumbling and dribbling and DAVE squeaking and 
           dribbling...

                        rest.

           ZOE wipes her snotty nose on the back of her hand...

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (JOSH’S ROOM) - NIGHT

           There’s a faint sound at the door, a key sliding into the 
           lock. The door opens. TIGER slips in, silently closing the 
           door behind her.

           TIGER crosses over to the bed. She sees something and 
           reacts, appalled. Lying in bed, JOSH’s mouth hangs open 
           limply. His eyes are partially open, his pupils rolled back 
           in his head. He looks brain dead. 

           TIGER’s devastated. She stares down at JOSH for an 
           emotional beat. She looks incredibly sad as she leans down 
           and plants a soft, tender kiss on JOSH’s lips. She pulls 
           away, then carefully takes the pillow from under JOSH’s 
           head. TIGER stares down at JOSH, steels herself, then 
           places the pillow over JOSH’s face, smothering him...

           TIGER presses down on the pillow as JOSH starts to 
           suffocate. He thrashes around violently. TIGER increases 
           the pressure. JOSH’s legs start to jerk horribly as he 
           suffocates...
                                        (cid:13)                                                                (cid:13)                                                                   (cid:13)                                                        (cid:13)                                               (cid:13)                                                                 (cid:13)                            (cid:13)           But just as we think he’s going to die, JOSH manages to 
           wriggle out from under the pillow. He’s stunned to see 
           TIGER standing there...

                                 JOSH
                        What the fuck are you doing!?

           TIGER’s shocked...

                                 TIGER
                        I thought they’d monged you...You 
                        looked like a total mong... 

           JOSH is outraged...

                                 JOSH
                        That’s just how I look when I 
                        sleep. Jesus! You nearly 
                        suffocated me! Take a pulse...

           TIGER feels really bad...

                                 TIGER
                        Sorry.

           JOSH takes a moment to compose himself, then fixes TIGER 
           with a curious look...

                                 JOSH
                        They said you escaped. What are 
                        you doing here?

           TIGER fixes JOSH with a poignant look...

                                 TIGER
                        I came back from the future... 

           JOSH takes in that familiar phrase, and is unsettled by it, 
           isn’t sure whether to believe it. TIGER looks emotional...

                                 TIGER
                        Nothing’s changed. The virus. It 
                        still gets out.  

           JOSH is deeply troubled by this revelation...

                                 TIGER
                        I think I figured out a way we 
                        can stop it. 

           JOSH is torn, doesn’t know what to believe, fixes TIGER 
           with a desperate look...

                                 JOSH
                        Just tell me. Are you for real? 
                        The virus - the future - is it 
                        all true? I need to know.

                                 TIGER
                        If it isn’t, then everything we 
                        did, it was all for nothing. Wolf 
                        died, for nothing. Your life, it 
                        doesn’t matter. You don’t matter. 
                        You’re no one. You don’t count 
                        for shit.

           JOSH looks thoughtful as he takes this in...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT (CORRIDOR) - NIGHT

           Moving along the dark corridor toward a set of double 
           doors. It’s deserted and earily quiet. The alarm sounds...

           JOSH and TIGER burst through the doors and sprint down the 
           corridor. As he runs, JOSH looks determined and focused - a 
           faint smile playing on his lips. JOSH and TIGER disappear 
           through another set of double doors into a brightly lit 
           corridor. The doors swing shut behind them, rocking back 
           and forth as the alarm continues to sound...

           Ends.
