           INT. MEL'S SPORTING GOODS -- DAY

           Muzak drips Hooked on a Feeling from the ceiling. 

           A few straggly shoppers pick over the selection of Frisbees, 
           camping equipment, sweat-socks. 

           A MAN-- white, late twenties, in a three-quarter length 
           hunting jacket-- pays for a stack of gear-- ammo-pouches, 
           sweatpants, knit caps-- at the register. 

           A WOMAN at his side, white, late twenties, cropped hair, 
           helps the cashier bag.

           ON A BLACK SECURITY GUARD, off to the side, huddled with the 
           manager.

           The manager nods, the security guard unsnaps his holster.

           EXT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME

           In the driver's seat, a WHITE WOMAN-- early twenties-- puffy 
           Afro wig and jumbo shades-- flips lazily through a newspaper, 
           looks across Crenshaw Boulevard at Mel's. Back to Marmaduke. 
           Bored as hell.

           ON the sidewalk in front of Mel's, as the man and woman 
           leave the store, the security guard right behind.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Sir... saw you put some socks in your 
                        pocket you ain't pay for.

                                 MAN
                        Fuck off, pig.

           The security guard grabs the man's wrist-- the man's free 
           hand yanking a .45 from his waistband and both men hit the 
           cement in an animal clinch,

           ON the Volkswagen Bus,

           The woman in the Afro wig-- oblivious to the hassle-- 
           digging Andy Capp--

           BACK TO the sidewalk-- the white woman riding the guard like 
           he's a bareback bronc-- the guard knocking the .45 from the 
           man's hand as-- 

           A few store employees pile on-- one of them plonking the 
           white woman with an wiffle-ball bat, crazy free-for-all as 

           MACHINE GUN FIRE shatters Mel's windows-- 
           The woman in the VW Bus-- BLASTING-- not exactly Jimmy 
           Cagney, the Tommy Gun's recoil too much for her, sunglasses 
           going sideways-- wig flopping down over her face, lead 

           Splintering the concrete boulevard divider-- sparking and 
           pinging cars and street-signs -- people on the sidewalk 
           bounding for cover like ring-tailed lemurs and

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS -- MOVING -- MOMENTS LATER

           The man-- jamming the VW into fourth-- 

           The white woman in the passenger seat-- 

           Mel's getting smaller in the rear-view-- 

           From the back of the van--

                                 WOMAN IN AFRO WIG
                                 (ball of adrenaline)
                        Did I do right?

           The van whipping around a corner on two wheels-- 

           Slamming the woman in the Afro wig against the panel-- 

           A pile of submachine guns and ammo flying all over the place-- 

           The man straightening the van onto Crenshaw, slows hard, 
           blending in with traffic,

                                 WHITE WOMAN IN PASSENGER SEAT
                        For some socks?! You idiot! Now we
                        can't get back to the house!

                                 MAN
                        Cool it... just cool it...

           The man and the woman up front low-key it-- just a hippie 
           couple out for a ride-- the man fiddling with the radio dial,

           Eddie Kendricks' Boogie Down pumping from the AM-- the van 
           crossing Florence now,

           Passing them, in the opposite lane,

           A green, 1972 Citroen SM Coupe purrs by,
           And we switch off, INSIDE THE COUPE NOW, as the DRIVER, 
           black, 30, sun setting in his Aviators, Boogie Down jamming 
           on his radio too, slides into fifth. From ABOVE, the vehicles 
           stretch away from each other and we

           TITLE CARD OVER BLACK

           May, 1974. Three months after kidnapping socialite heiress 
           Patty Hearst, the anarchist group the Symbionese Liberation 
           Army-- the SLA-- lands in Los Angeles. 

           In South Central. 

           In the 77th precinct.

                                 VOICE OVER BLACK
                        I thought niggers were supposed to 
                        have huge cocks?

           FADE IN:

           INT. POLICE STATION LOCKER ROOM -- EVENING

           Shift-change. Lots of white cops -- in towels, skivvies-- 
           getting in and out of uniforms and street clothes.

           The vibe: Bustle, strut, swagger, and smack-talk.

           OFFICER BILLY BURDETTE-- the cat from the Citroen-- one of 
           the only black men in the room-- zips his uniform's trousers.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Myth... your moms has a couple inches 
                        on me, easy.

                                 RANDOM COP
                        Whoa! There we go!

           Hoots and hollers and you gonna let him get away with that?

                                 WHITE COP
                                 (the guy who started 
                                  all this, to 
                                  Burdette)
                        You fuckin' jig... my mother died six 
                        months ago...

           He puts his hand on his holster, a COUPLE OF COPS try to 
           chill him out,
                                 WHITE COP
                                 (shrugging them off)
                        ... Goddamned cancer... I held her in 
                        my arms while she...

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (cool)
                        No sweat, Franz... sorry... I didn't 
                        know about your moms... 

           DETECTIVE VIC FRANZ, mid-30's, stands down. 

           Awkward silence. CLANG of a locker. HISS of aerosol 
           deodorant. 

           Burdette sticks a .25 Beretta into his ankle holster.

           SGT. DONNY MILLER, uniformed, doughy, 40's, tries for a 
           tension-breaker,

                                 DONNY MILLER
                                 (to Burdette)
                        Pool's up to a buck-fifty for whoever 
                        collars Patty Hearst... 

           Miller slides a chunky Rolex off his wrist and sticks it in 
           his locker.

           There's a WANTED POSTER for PATRICIA HEARST taped to the 
           inside of the door, and

           Maybe we recognize her as the woman in the VW with the Afro 
           wig-- or maybe we don't-- what with the monster

           Cartoon dick drawn in front of her mouth.

                                 RANDOM COP
                        A deuce if you fuck her...

                                 BURDETTE
                        I'm out... gotta T.O. a transfer from 
                        NHD... Some faggot named Lindsay...
                             (beat, sigh)
                        You ready, Lindsay?

           ON A UNIFORMED WHITE COP, a hard case, maybe 30, tying his 
           laces,

                                 LYNLEY
                        It's Lynley, Bwana.

           Franz adjusts his tie-- checks out Lynley-- in the mirror of 
           his locker door.
                                 FRANZ
                                 (a nod toward 
                                  Burdette)
                        Watch that jig... he'll sell you down 
                        the river for a chicken wing.

                                 (shaking it)
                        Chuck Lynley... hey... lost my mom to 
                        cancer in sixty-five... 
                                 (sensitive beat)
                        What kind'd she have?

           ON Franz-- a quick, wicked flash toward Burdette, some of 
           the men already turning away,

                                 FRANZ
                                 (somber)
                        Testicular.

           And the room EXPLODES.

           ON Lynley for a sheepish beat,

           Welcome to the 77th fucking precinct.

           EXT. PATROL CAR -- DUSK

           Burdette and Lynley cruise Watts. Lynley, riding shotgun, 
           takes in the passing scene:

           Sidewalk crap games; ho’s on the stroll; brothers swigging 
           forty-ounces; black kids playing double-dutch,

           A billboard emblazoned with a crouching Black Panther and the 
           words-- Move on over, or we'll move on over you.

           Burdette fish-eyes his new partner.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Shit's new jazz to you, huh?

                                 LYNLEY
                        We had niggers in Studio city.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (unfazed)
                        Somebody had to fuck your old lady.
           Lynley skims a folder of WANTED POSTERS.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Mickey Mouse motherfuckers.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (begs to differ)
                        Robbed a bank in Frisco two weeks
                        ago, scored 10 Gs... top the Most 
                        Wanted for the last 3 months.  
                        Managed to hit Mel's Sporting Goods 
                        at 1600 hours.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You impressed? 'Symbionese Liberation 
                        Army?' I never met a Symbionese, and 
                        I been some places. These guys are 
                        amateurs. First clue is the spook 
                        running the show--

           Dismissive narration as he skims each pic, starting with 
           DONALD ‘CINQUE’ DEFREEZE--

                                 LYNLEY
                        Looks like Rodney Allen Rippy...

           PATTY HEARST (minus the Afro wig)--

                                 LYNLEY
                        Rich cunt, turned out on some black 
                        dick...

           BILL HARRIS (man from Mel's)--

                                 LYNLEY
                        Queer...

           EMILY HARRIS (woman from Mel's)--

                                 LYNLEY
                        Dyke...

           WILLIE 'KOJO' WOLFE--

                                 BURDETTE
                        Lemme guess...

           He pulls the patrol car over to the curb.

           A BLACK GIRL, maybe 11, lounges in a lawn chair in front of 
           DEAKIN'S LAUN-DO-MAT. A plastic tub and some cups at her 
           feet. 

           She scowls at the sight of Lynley, then beams as she sees
                                 BURDETTE
                                 (calling out)
                        Janelle, I know you better get me 
                        some of that lemonade!

           JANELLE DEAKINS bounds over with a pitcher and a plastic cup. 
           She pours a cup, hands it across Lynley to Burdette.

           Off Burdette's nod, the girl walks back-- slooow-- to get 
           another cup for Lynley.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Burdette)
                        Real hard-charger, huh? The SLA 
                        prolly holed up around the corner and 
                        we're sipping lemonade.

           Janelle's back, pouring a lemonade for Lynley. As she hands 
           it to him, he growls and mock bites her arm. She squeals a 
           half-giggle, half-scream.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (amused, despite 
                                  himself)
                        Fools been acting crazy round here, 
                        huh?

                                 JANELLE
                        The SLA and them was shootin' in 
                        Inglewood!

                                 BURDETTE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 JANELLE
                        You ain't hear?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Nah... I just rolled by... say hi to 
                        you...
                                 (beat, sip)
                        Whassup?

           Lynley, invisible, watches Burdette. The easy way he Q&A's.

                                 JANELLE
                        Well... I had heard that Cinque and 
                        Patty Hearst and them had machine 
                        guns and grenades--

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (faux wide-eyed 
                                  wonder)
                        Grenades? Man!
                                 JANELLE
                        Uh-huh... Cinque had the honkies 
                        wearing makeup so they'd look like 
                        niggas and they shot...
                                 (calculating)
                        ... 'bout five or six people up in 
                        there, and now they in a house 
                        somewhere round here... with bazookas 
                        and time-bombs and they just waiting 
                        for some pigs to come on in.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Wheeew. That Cinque a bad mamajama 
                        huh?

                                 JANELLE
                        Yup.

           Lynley, impatient, grabs Cinque's Wanted Poster, sticks it in 
           her face.

                                 LYNLEY
                        But you ain't seen him?

                                 JANELLE
                                 (suddenly stiff)
                        Naw.

           She tunes them out. A look back over her shoulder into the 
           Laun-Do-Mat, and a MAN, 30's-- her father-- waving her 
           inside.

                                 JANELLE
                        I gotta cash in some coins for my 
                        daddy...

           Burdette-- pissed-- puts the car in drive,

                                 BURDETTE
                        Allright, baby-girl... you take it
                        light.

           She steps away from the car as it pulls off.

           INT. PATROL CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Burdette and Lynley cruise residential ghetto streets. The 
           houses are squat cinder-block cubes covered with graffiti.

                                 BURDETTE
                        I'm lead. Your S-A is for shit.

           Lynley gives him a "yeah-right" grunt. He sniffs his 
           lemonade. Tosses the cup out the window.
                                 BURDETTE
                        Offend your palate? 

           Lynley stares off.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Dink bodies... smell like... 
                        sweets... you don't get 'em in the 
                        ground quick enough... can't even eat 
                        a fuckin' Hershey Bar anymore.

           Lynley catches Burdette looking at his tattoo.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You do a bid?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Nah... college.

           Beat.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fuck you, then.

           They spot Officer Donny Miller house-to house knocking.

           Miller hard-rousts a black woman on her porch, waving flyers 
           of Cinque and Patty Hearst at her.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Miller's an asshole.

           Lynley sticks his head out the window.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Don't take any shit, Miller!

           Burdette looks at Lynley like he'd love to kick his ass.

                                 LYNLEY
                        How's he rate a one-man car?

                                 BURDETTE
                        He's the day-car floater. Been in 77 
                        'bout 15 years.

                                 LYNLEY
                        And the hump's still in a uniform?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Plans, have we?

           Burdette pulls the car over, grabs a clipboard jammed with 
           paper-- canvassing sheets. Both men get out.
                                 LYNLEY 
                        I'm detective inside six months.

                                 BURDETTE
                        I copped your exam scores, baby...
                        in six months you're shining my 
                        badge.

           They walk up to a shabby rancher with a rusted Olds 98 in 
           the yard.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        Scores? You take a good look around 
                        at roll-call? A spade's got as much 
                        chance of making detective as we got 
                        of finding Cinque behind door number 
                        three here.

           Burdette ignores him. Just as he's about to knock, Lynley 
           POUNDS on the door. No answer.

           Lynley makes a jacking off motion with his hand.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You po-lice or selling girl-scout 
                        cookies?

           Lynley peers into the window, as a FUCKING MONSTER GERMAN 
           SHEPHERD lunges toward the glass, SNARLING and BARKING.

           Lynley jumps back, his .38-- blink and you'll miss it-- 
           cleared and covering the window.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fuckin' A!

           Burdette laughs. Dumb-ass white boy.

           DOOR TO DOOR MONTAGE, NIGHT:

           Burdette and Lynley talking to black residents on lawns, in 
           doorways. Burdette doing the Q&A's, a somewhat chastened 
           Lynley hanging back.

           EXT. PATROL CAR-- ALLEY -- NIGHT

           Lynley and Burdette slow cruise an alley. Lynley swings the 
           floodlight into the backs of the houses.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Told you it was a jackoff.

                                 BURDETTE
                        They're here. Cinque thinks the 
                        brothers won't sell him out.
           Beat.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What's the difference between a 
                        nigger and a brother?

                                 BURDETTE
                        A brother would write you up to I-AD 
                        for asking that... a nigga would put 
                        a cap in you.

                                 LYNLEY
                        So which one are you?

                                 BURDETTE
                        I'm police.
                                 (beat)
                        But I got niggerish tendencies. 

           Lynley smiles.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Pull over. I gotta drain the vein.

           They pull over. Lynley gets out, sidles up to a tangle of 
           overgrown bushes. Burdette gets out. Scans the alley.

                                 LYNLEY
                        How long you been at the 77th?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Three years. Since I left school.

                                 LYNLEY
                        How fuckin' old are you?

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (hesitates)
                        Law school.

           Lynley double-takes him.

                                 LYNLEY
                        The fuck are you doing here?

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (beat)
                        Slumming.

           Lynley turns his attention back to the bush, mulls over this 
           new bit of information.

           The SPLASH of his stream against the dirt.
           Burdette walks up the alley, playing his flashlight beam into 
           backyards. Nothing.

           Lynley zips up.

           Burdette heads back to the car-- a glint catching his eye... 
           on the ground: a dime ... and another... and another...

           Burdette squats, the trail leading to a patch of bushes... 
           something there... a pile of rags? No...

           Horror on his face now--

           as he scrambles into the bushes,

           Janelle Deakins-- bloodied, panties around her ankles,

                                 BURDETTE
                        Baby girl, you're okay, you're 
                        okay...

           Janelle barely conscious, pushing Burdette away--

                                 JANELLE
                        Don't... don't...get offa me...

           Burdette hugs her closer,

                                 BURDETTE
                        Naw, you okay... you see me? You
                        know me... You okay, we got you, we
                        got you...

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. 77TH PRECINCT PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

           Lynley and Burdette in the lot. In their civvies. Lynley 
           reaches into his primer grey 1970 Duster and pulls a flask 
           from the glove box. Takes a hit. Passes it. They're rattled.

           Donny Miller exits the station, ambles toward the car.

           He passes some photostats to Lynley.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        She ID'd the Dineen brothers... 
                        hypes... both done bids at 
                        Vacaville... Quentin.

                                 BURDETTE
                        For rolls of dimes? You rape 
                        somebody?
                                 DONNY MILLER
                        Ever heard the expression, 'romance 
                        without finance has no chance?' Drink 
                        down the Cozy Nook? Little five-card?

                                 BURDETTE
                        RHD's on this... right Miller?

                                 DONNY MILLER
                                 (a nod to Lynley's 
                                  car)
                        What you got under there? Three-
                        forty?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Hey! I asked you a question, man.

           Miller shrugs, gets into his flashy '73 Barracuda hardtop.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        Franz and Keefer'll give it a pro-
                        forma in the morning.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (seething)
                        The Dineen brothers could be in TJ by 
                        morning.

           Donny Miller starts his car. Guns the engine.

                                 DONNY MILLER 
                        So could Patty Hearst.
                                 (sarcastic)
                        ... tough choice.

           He PEELS out in a pointless rubber burn.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fuckin' junkies are geezin' it up 
                        somewhere right now...

           The men lock eyes.

           EXT. LYNLEY'S DUSTER -- MOVING-- NIGHT

           Lynley driving. South Central in the full bloom of decay. 
           Apex Liquors. Chico's Bail Bonds. Bursts of cut-rate strip 
           malls straddle low-slung subsidized housing.

           Craaaazy shit goes on in every quadrant of the screen: 
           squabbles; public urination; wino confrontations; parking lot-
           layabouts grabbing their crotches when women pass by.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Slow up...
           On the sidewalk ahead of them, a loooong, leggy BLACK WOMAN 
           twitches her ass down West Manchester Ave. She's got a 
           flowing blond wig, six-inch heels and a mini-skirt hiked up 
           both cheeks. She's gotta be six-four.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Nigga, you better slow down...

           And the woman turns, only it's a DRAG QUEEN-- hard-used and 
           all-business:  GENE THE QUEEN.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Lips, hips, or fingertips? 
                                 (making Burdette)
                        Shiiit... you find Patty and make 
                        detective, Billy?

           The Duster creeps alongside,

                                 BURDETTE
                        You know where the Dineens at?

           Gene stops, taps the inside of both arms,

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I'm addicted to dick. I don't fuck 
                        with no hare-on. Check this out, 
                        Billy...

           He smiles big, revealing a gold front-tooth etched with a 
           champagne glass

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Your daddy hooked me up with this 
                        last week...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Man asked you a question.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                                 (a nod at Lynley)
                        Who's that trick?

           Lynley stops the car in the middle of the lane. Gets out.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Hey, man... cool it...

           Lynley goes up to Gene, kicks his legs from under him.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                                 (on his ass)
                        What? You want a taste?
           Burdette-- pissed at how this is going down-- they're off 
           duty, out of uniform.

           Lynley tosses the contents of Gene's sequined purse onto the 
           sidewalk. A comb. Lipstick. Vaseline. A straight-razor. He 
           slides the razor into his back pocket.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        I got you for carrying... 
                        solicitation...

           He opens a foil packet with some pills in it. He pockets it.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (posing a 
                                  hypothetical)
                        I'm a scumbag jigaboo... need to fix, 
                        on the q-t... where I be at?

           Some STREET LOWLIFES gather on the scene.

           Lynley KICKS Gene in the face.

                                 STREET LOWLIFE
                        Honky... you lost your mind?!

           The lowlifes move in,

                                 BURDETTE
                        Think about it!

           He's out of the car, covering Lynley with his backup .25.

           The crowd edges away.

           Lynley checks his back. Burdette's got it. A wordless thanks 
           as he looms over the bleeding Gene the Queen,

                                 LYNLEY
                        I'm dying to get well...
                                 (mock Junkie-vibe)
                        I'm hurting real bad... gimme a place 
                        to get straight.

           EXT. THE L.A. RAILWAYS TRACKS -- NIGHT

           Abandoned since the '40's. Busted old streetcars pepper the 
           dead-end tracks.

           There's nothing here but the forgotten, or people who want to 
           be forgotten.
           INT. DUSTER -- SAME TIME

           Lynley pops one of the pills-- benzedrine-- he got off Gene 
           the Queen.

           Offers one to Burdette. Off his head shake, Lynley scarfs 
           that one, too.

           Lynley reaches into his glove compartment. There are three or 
           four unopened decks of playing cards. Peels the cellophane 
           from a pack and riffles until he finds the Ace of Spades. 
           Does the same with another pack and tucks both cards into his 
           shirt pocket.

           Burdette watches. Who the fuck is this guy?

           Lynley gets out. Burdette follows.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (low)
                        We get a visual, and we call it in.

           They cross the tracks. Notice how Lynley moves on the balls 
           of his feet. The gravel barely registering his footfalls.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (low)
                        You got a sister?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Yeah. You?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Dead.
                                 (beat)
                        Just like these humps.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Bull-shit. We get paper on these 
                        motherfuckers. A collar's a collar. 

           Lynley is silent.

           Up ahead, there's four or five cars parked in the shadows 
           under the overpass.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I'll see if I can put eyes on them. 
                        Hang back... make sure nothing bites 
                        me on the ass.

           Burdette offers his .25 Beretta,

                                 BURDETTE
                        She ain't got much on her, but...
                                 LYNLEY
                        Nah... this is just a pro-forma, 
                        right?

           Lynley duck-walks in a low crouch toward a beat-up '59 
           Skylark. Inside, a family of four Mexicans asleep-- mom and 
           dad in the front seat, two kids spread out under blankets in 
           back.

           Lynley moves toward another car when he sees a flash of light 
           illuminate the inside of a '61 Desoto Adventurer, maybe 25 
           yards ahead.

           ON Burdette-- trying to keep Lynley in sight. It's fucking 
           dark.

           ON Lynley-- creeping toward the Desoto,

           INSIDE the Desoto,

           The DINEEN BROTHERS. One of them nods-out against the 
           passenger side door. A lit Kool cigarette burnt to its filter 
           hanging from his lips,

           The other Dineen waves a zippo under a caved-in Royal Crown 
           Cola can, where a reservoir of heroin is pooled,

           ON Lynley-- the straight-razor FLICKED OPEN, held low,

           ON Burdette-- he's lost sight of Lynley, creeping forward now 
           to get a better view, shocked by the SNARL and glowing eyes 
           of a coyote loping across his path,

           ON Lynley, pressed close below the driver's open window, the 
           razor up in a flash and DRAWN EAR TO EAR across one Dineen's 
           throat, the gurgle and mist of blood,

           ON Burdette-- catching sight of Lynley as Lynley walks calmly 
           around to the passenger side,

           ON Lynley, at the passenger side door,

           ON the other Dineen, as the spray of his brother's blood hits 
           his cheek, wakes him from his high,

                                 DINEEN
                                 (irritated, stupor)
                        Goddamn, nigga...

           Lynley leans in, grits his teeth,

                                 LYNLEY
                        That's right.

           Beat.
           ON the front seat, as two Ace of Spades cards float onto the 
           Dineen Brothers' laps.

           EXT. L.A. RAILWAYS TRACKS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lynley emerges from the darkness.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Well?

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (cooooool)
                        Dead end.

           Lynley walks toward the car.

           EXT./INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- DAY

           Lynley, in civilian clothes, walks in the front door carrying 
           a fresh uniform in a cellophane wrapper.

           The DESK SERGEANT looks up.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        How you doing, 'boot?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Great.

           Vic Franz and his partner-- 40'S, severe-- DENNIS KEEFER, 
           emerge from the back. Stone-faced.

                                 FRANZ
                        Let's talk.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (evasive)
                        Roll's in five minutes.

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                                 (to Franz and Keefer)
                        Fuck the dance... take this hump in 
                        back and show him something.

           Franz jerks his head toward the hallway. Follow us.

           ON the front door-- Burdette, behind his Ray-Bans, enters.

                                 BURDETTE
                        What's up?

           Franz pulls Lynley by the arm down the hallway, Keefer 
           follows.
                                 DESK SERGEANT
                                 (pointedly, to 
                                  Burdette)
                        Roll's in a few minutes, officer... 
                        better get a move on.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           A BLACK MAN, dignified, 30's-- we recognize him as Janelle 
           Deakins' father from the Laun-Do-Mat-- seated at the metal 
           desk.

           Lynley and Franz and Keefer enter.

                                 FRANZ
                        This is Gerald Deakins. Father of 
                        Janelle Deakins.

           Deakins-- eyes rimmed with red-- looks from man to man.

                                 FRANZ
                        You got something to say?

           Deakins rises unsteadily.

                                 DEAKINS
                                 (to Lynley)
                        It's up to Jesus to judge them men...
                        and now he can.

           Deakins hugs him. Lynley stiffens on human contact.

           Keefer opens the door,

                                 KEEFER
                        This stays in this room. 

           Deakins nods. Leaves.

           Franz pulls a plastic baggie with two BLOODY ACE OF SPADES 
           cards inside from his blazer pocket.

                                 FRANZ
                        Left a few of these on some VC 
                        myself. Cute, but sloppy.

                                 KEEFER
                        It's all taken care of.

                                 FRANZ
                        Burdette get wet?

           Lynley shakes his head.
                                 KEEFER
                        Didn't think it was his style.

                                 FRANZ
                        This is how it works: you're white, 
                        pushing thirty, got an okay collar 
                        record from NOHO--

                                 KEEFER
                        -- You take the exam... some friends
                        backing you up...

                                 FRANZ
                        ... You're third-grade before 
                        Christmas. Fuckin' sport coat and 
                        chinos.

                                 LYNLEY
                        That's all there is to it?

                                 FRANZ
                        Nobody's gonna cry for those boofers 
                        you wasted. We caught the case, and 
                        it's cold...

                                 KEEFER
                        For as long as we say.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (a thumb toward 
                                  Keefer)
                        This geriatric pulls his twenty 
                        soon... he's in Catalina, angling
                        for Pike... I'm gonna need a new
                        partner with stones.

                                 KEEFER
                        You wanna ride around with that jig, 
                        rousting hypes for the next two 
                        years?

                                 FRANZ
                        Cream rises to the top... you're 
                        Robbery Homicide... we vouch for you.

           Franz sticks out his hand... deal?

           Lynley smiles, pumps it hard.

                                 FRANZ
                        I'm your rabbi... you need anything, 
                        you come to me.
           INT. PATROL CAR -- MOVING -- DAY

           Burdette and Lynley cruise past 84th and Hoover.

           They pass a METER MAID-- 20's-- slapping a TICKET ONTO A '63 
           CHEVY NOVA STATION WAGON. The meter maid nods as they pass, 
           gets back on her Harley trike and zips off.

           STAY ON the Chevy Nova as A WHITE WOMAN, 20's, comes out of a 
           dilapidated rancher, pulls the ticket off the window, stuffs 
           it into her army jacket pocket, and gets in.

           BACK TO

                                 LYNLEY
                        If these SLA fucks are here... couple 
                        of bright boys should be able to make 
                        a name on this.

                                 BURDETTE
                        We're a bright boy short.

           Lynley ignores the dig.

                                 LYNLEY
                        It's not gonna be off door-to-doors.

                                 BURDETTE
                        You wanna kick the shit out of some 
                        locals? Like you did Gene the 
                        Queen...?

           ON the dashboard, PHOTOSTATS OF THE SLA, taped in a row.

           Maaaybe we recognize NANCY LING PERRY as the woman who just 
           got into the Chevy Nova station wagon.

           INT. THE COZY NOOK BAR -- EVENING

           Burdette and Lynley-- canvassing sheets in hand-- at a dumpy 
           ghetto bar with delusions of slick.

           A SEXY BLACK GIRL, 20's vamps into the microphone for the few 
           black juiceheads lounging in booths.

           The girl is good. Better than the band. Better than the room.

           A funky, junkie, JAZZY TRIO backs her up on a cover of Chaka 
           Khan's You've got the love.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (to bartender)
                        You seen any brothers... with white 
                        women?
           THE BARTENDER, biiig, 30'S, gives him a chilly vibe,

                                 BARTENDER
                        Your boy Miller already been around.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Do I look like Miller, motherfucker?

                                 BARTENDER
                        All pigs are grey in the dark.

           The girl finishes her set to lame applause, comes over. 
           Lynley checks her out.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Tammy... why Rudy gotta do me like 
                        this?

                                 TAMMY
                        My brother don't like fuzz.

           Lynley leans in,

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Tammy)
                        I liked your show. You seen any 
                        hippies hanging around splibs?

           She ignores him. Rudy-- the bartender-- hands her a glass of 
           water.

           Burdette leans into Lynley,

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (sotto voce)
                        Do me a favor? Shut the fuck up.

           Lynley eye-fucks him.

                                 TAMMY
                        Cinque ain't coming in here.

           Tammy turns her face to Burdette. Jesus: she's got a black 
           eye, and her lip is busted. Somebody's been at her.

                                 BURDETTE
                        The fuck you got into, girl?

           She looks away. Catches Lynley's eye. Practically flinches.

                                 RUDY
                        Po-po already been around, I told 
                        you.
                                 BURDETTE
                                 (to Tammy)
                        You got nothing to say? 'Bout 
                        anything?

                                 TAMMY
                        I'm just some nigga bitch shaking it 
                        for nickels... what do I know?

           EXT. 84TH AND SOUTH HOOVER -- LATER

           Burdette and Lynley's squad car comes abreast of Miller's 
           Barracuda going the opposite way.

           They stop window-to-window in the middle of the street.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        I already wrapped 79th through 85th 
                        St.... this is all clear.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Yeah... we wrapped South Central 
                        Ave...

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        You make sure to hit The Beacon... 
                        The Cozy Nook?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Yeah.

           Miller cracks a crooked smile,

                                 DONNY MILLER
                                 (conspiratorial)
                        That Tammy's got a tail on her, huh?
                                 (misreading Burdette's 
                                  chill)
                        Hey, but there's enough meat on that 
                        bone to go around-- I ain't stingy...
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Hey, killer. Buy you a drink?

           Lynley shrugs at Burdette, gets out. Gets into Miller's car. 
           They split.

           STAY on Burdette. As he watches them. His attention drawn now 
           to the sound of James Brown’s Mother Popcorn pumping from a 
           house. Inside, some folks having a party. Burdette looks like 
           he wouldn't mind joining them.

           He pulls off.
           EXT. HOUSE ON 84TH -- SAME TIME

           ON THE WINDOW, as a BLACK MAN with an Afro, and an M-1 
           carbine, disappears behind the parted curtain. If he looks a 
           lot like CINQUE DEFREEZE, that's 'cause you been paying 
           attention.

           EXT. MILLER'S BARRACUDA-- MOVING -- LATER

           Donny Miller is wolfing an In'N'Out burger and dripping sauce 
           all over himself. He really is a pig.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        Let's go here... boofers are due for 
                        an audit.

           Can't find his napkin, so he grabs A PARKING TICKET from a 
           jumble on the front seat and wipes his mouth on it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Think you got enough parking tickets, 
                        Miller?

           INT. RUMPUS ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Beat-down South Central 'lounge.' You can smell the piss and 
           malt liquor funk. 

           Lynley and Miller at the bar, the black patrons avoid them 
           like the white plague.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        Let's say you're Patty Hearst's
                        daddy...

           Miller leans over the bar, pulls a bottle of rye. Bartender 
           fumes.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        ...or worse... the poor lame she was 
                        banging before Cinque and them guys 
                        ran a nigger train on her...

           Miller pours them three fingers.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                        Her cooze' prolly stretched from here 
                        to Gardena... lips flapping
                        like a whoopee-cushion when she sits 
                        down.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (sorry he came)
                        Good thing you're on the case.
                                         (MORE)
                                         LYNLEY (CONT'D)
                                 (beat)
                        You done alright for yourself here, 
                        huh?

           Miller winks.

                                 DONNY MILLER 
                                 (to the bartender)
                        L'addicion, s'il vous plait.
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Lynley... Lynley... you keep a 
                        secret? You like tug-flicks?

           The bartender, disgusted, resigned, hits 'no sale' on the 
           register. Pulls out a stack of fives, tens. Slides them to 
           Miller.

                                 DONNY MILLER
                                 (counting, displeased)
                        Little light this week, Clyde. Might 
                        wanna get a chick with some low 
                        hangers to work the floor. 

           Lynley glares stone contempt.

           EXT. PATROL CAR -- DAY

           Early morning.

           The sun throws gold light onto deserted South Central Avenue.

           Faded pink and yellow and white Spanish style houses squat 
           next to empty parking lots and Baptist churches and auto body 
           shops with beaters up on lifts.

           Burdette and Lynley's black and white cruises.

                                 LYNLEY
                        SLA'll be the only thing in this 
                        neighborhood up before noon.

           OFF Burdette's look,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Mostly white outfit.

           We pass Mex laborers trudging to work by foot and bicycle,

           Groggy pimps in boat-length rides heading home after a long 
           night's macking,

           Stopped at a light,

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (incredulous)
                        The fuck...?
           OFF his look,

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (adamant)
                        Hell, no.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fuck you. First lead we've got. 

           REVEAL Burdette and Lynley's POV:

           A formation of A DOZEN BLACK PANTHERS running Karate drills 
           in an empty parking lot.

           A line of black kids stretches out the doorway to a run-down 
           storefront.

           Lynley gets out, slides his billy-club into his belt-loop, 
           walks toward the building.

           Burdette burns. Jams the cruiser into park and gets out.

           INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Burdette and Lynley, being led down a narrow hallway by a 
           steely black man, COCHESE PIERCE.

           They move through the line of kids snaking into the building.

           At the front of the line, we see that the kids are filing 
           into a makeshift cafeteria.

                                 COCHESE
                        Army fights on its stomach... we give 
                        out a hundred breakfasts a day... 
                        What don't you see in here?

           Burdette taps his canvassing sheet,

                                 BURDETTE
                        Brother, all we wanna know is--

                                 COCHESE
                        -- What you don't see here is a bunch 
                        of honkies and bitches in blackface 
                        playing revolutionary. When we 
                        dismantle the system you trying to 
                        maintain... won't hear nothing... 
                        won't see it coming... like sundown: 
                        one minute shit'll just be dark.

           Cochese leads them further into the building,

                                 BURDETTE 
                        So you ain't seen Cinque, or any SLA--
                                 COCHESE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        -- Pig... 'brother' Cinque is of no 
                        more concern to us than your presence 
                        here, right now.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Far as I can tell... only difference 
                        between you and the SLA is a 
                        continental breakfast.

           The trio entering a small, bare room outfitted with gymnasium 
           mats and a heavy bag hanging from the ceiling.

           A few Panthers work self-defense moves on the mats.

           Off in a corner, some Panthers lift weights, jump rope.

           Lynley lobs a pointed yawn Cochese's way: he's not impressed.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        Well... thanks for your time...
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Let's roll.

           Cochese holds Lynley's stare. Smiles

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (more insistent)
                        Officer Lynley... let's go.

                                 COCHESE
                                 (a nod to Lynley's 
                                  service revolver)
                        SLA uses M-1's... .45 autos... why
                        the department still issues .38's 
                        I'll never know... some people say 
                        .45's got a jamming problem.

           Cochese pulls a .45 auto from behind his back.

           Burdette and Lynley's hands go to their sidearms.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Easy... don't make a mistake.

                                 COCHESE
                                 (unconcerned)
                        But that's just with the old 
                        Brownings... this here's the 
                        officer's Colt...

           Lynley backs up,
                                 LYNLEY
                        I'm gonna need you to put that weapon 
                        on the deck...

           Cochese ejects the magazine, pops it back in,

                                 COCHESE
                        See... eight rounds, 'stead of six
                        like they give the LAPD...

                                 BURDETTE
                        Everybody nice and easy...

           Cochese calls out to A PANTHER doing bench-presses across the 
           room,

                                 COCHESE
                        What's the magazine on the HK?

           The Panther rips a Heckler & Koch MP5 machine-pistol from its 
           duct-taped hiding space beneath the weight bench.

                                 PANTHER
                                 (racking the sliding 
                                  pin)
                        Thirty...

                                 COCHESE
                        See what I mean? Kinda sent you boys 
                        out unprepared.

           Lynley takes in the room:

           The Panthers so unfazed by Police presence that they've gone 
           back to working out, shooting the shit.

           Burdette catches his eye: let it go.

           Lynley eases up-- hip to the fact that he has no power here.

           Cochese slips his .45 back into his waistband.

                                 COCHESE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Pig... I think your partner mentioned 
                        you had other engagements?

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- DAY

           Burdette and Lynley sit in the 77th Street Watch Commander's 
           office.
           Across a battered desk from them: grizzled Robbery/Homicide 
           LT. MURCOTT, and the station's Vice-Squad boss, SGT. HUBER.

                                 MURCOTT
                                 (to Burdette)
                        You did okay on your sergeant's 
                        exam...

                                 HUBER
                        Lots of guys do okay.

                                 MURCOTT
                        But you got a thin collar sheet.
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Franz and Keefer seem to think you 
                        could do some damage... nobody knows 
                        your face yet, you're young...

                        You're gonna listen, 'cause we're 
                        gonna tell you something.

           Beat.

                        I want you guys to rotate into night-
                        watch vice for a few weeks, 
                        overtime's already okayed. You 
                        float... work fruits, whores, 
                        bookies, dope and card games, you can 
                        play up the Oreo hippie revolutionary 
                        bit, maybe get a line on Cinque and 
                        his crew.

           Lynley looks at Burdette: I'm game if you are.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (not game)
                        If we split up... I could work the

           EXT. CADDY ELDO -- MOVING -- DUSK

           A pimpy, maroon and primer-flaked '54 Eldorado with fins for 
           miles cruises toward Baldwin Hills-- the upscale South LA 
           neighborhood known as the Black Beverly Hills.

           The boys work up their covers.

                                 BURDETTE
                        ... No... dig: we met at the honor
                        farm... in for stick-ups, paper-
                        passing...

           Lynley nods, sounds good.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I can rap Bakersfield out the 
                        yinyang... got a cousin in Chino.

           Stopped at the light on Coliseum and La Brea. Cream 
           Lamborghini Espada next to them. Lynley drools. FOXY BLACK 
           CHICK at the wheel half-glances him. Double-takes Burdette. 
           HONKS her horn.

                                 BURDETTE 
                                 (sticks his head out 
                                  the window)
                        Don't even start... it ain't mine!
           The light changes,

                                 FOXY BLACK CHICK
                                 (smirking)
                        Sure thing, Billy.

           Pulling away.

                                 FOXY BLACK CHICK
                        Say hi to your daddy.

           Beat.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Billy?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Huh?

                                 LYNLEY
                        That was fucking Diana Ross.

                                 BURDETTE
                        She's fine, right? Live right up 
                        there.

           Lynley. Sensory overload. Baldwin Hills like Mars to him.

           Mansions perched on the hills above, well-tended Spanish 
           Tudors below. And BLACK PEOPLE everywhere. Behind the wheels 
           of luxury rides. Walking exotic breed dogs. Money and class 
           and community here. This ain't South Central.

           EXT. SPANISH TUDOR -- NIGHT

           An elegant two-story Tudor nestled in a cul-de-sac at the 
           foot of Baldwin Hills.

           Burdette's Citroen at the curb. The Eldo fins jut from the 
           porte cochere.

           INT. SPANISH TUDOR LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Lynley, wide-eyed and uncomfortable in such luxe digs, hovers 
           by the sideboard. He's got on faded bell-bottoms and an army 
           jacket with 'King Kong Company 1968' stenciled on back. He 
           examines the top-shelf stuff: Pinch, Louis Treize, Tanqueray.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
                        They're marked, you know.

           JANE BURDETTE, 30, in the doorway. Her pin-striped suit fits 
           the way it's supposed to. A luxurious Afro crowns her head. 

           Lynley. Rocked. Plays it off.
                                 LYNLEY
                        ... would you like a drink?

           She crosses the room, plopping a leather valise on the couch.

                                 JANE
                        I don't drink with strangers--

                                 LYNLEY
                        -- I'm Chuck--

                                 JANE
                        -- and that's sweet of you... asking 
                        me to have a drink in my own home.

           Pause. Lynley has no idea what to say next. Where the fuck is 
           Burdette?

           Jane comes over and pours two tumblers of Pinch.

                                 JANE
                        I just fill the bottle back up with 
                        water, which is perfect, since I like 
                        it with water anyway...

           Lynley reaches out for what he assumes is his drink, but she

           Hands it off to

           Burdette, coming in wearing funky street-threads.

                                 BURDETTE
                        How was work?

                                 JANE
                        Ugh, once you've heard one fiduciary-
                        duty horror story, you've heard them 
                        all...
                                 (re: his threads)
                        Are the Soul Train auditions today?

           Lynley buries a laugh into his palm.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Jane, this is my partner, Chuck 
                        Lynley... Lynley, my sister, Jane.

           Jane and Lynley nod. Burdette tosses him an oversized knit 
           cap.

                                 JANE
                        I can't stay the whole weekend.
                                 BURDETTE
                        Just 'til tomorrow. He'll be in bed 
                        after Marcus Welby and you can groove 
                        the hi-fi as loud as you want. I got 
                        the new O'Jays-- just make sure you 
                        hold it by the edges.

                                 JANE
                                 (resigned)
                        You sure know how to spice up a 
                        girl's Friday night.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Cock the hat a bit... you look like 
                        you going on a hay-ride.

           Lynley cocks it. He and Burdette vibe fried and ghettofied.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (off his drink)
                        Why is pop's stuff always watery?

           Jane shoots Lynley a conspiratorial smile.

                                 JANE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        That green thing out there yours?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Ride's part of our cover.

           Jane takes the two 'players' in.

                                 JANE
                        You're undercover? As what? Cops?

           INT. HOUSE ON 84TH STREET -- NIGHT

           Flop-house.

           Sly and the Family bubble from the turntable. A BLACK MAN 
           with stringy brown hair dances with a BLACK WOMAN. 

           In the corner, an old black lady is asleep under a ratty 
           blanket.

                                 CINQUE (O.C.)
                        That supposed to be the funky 
                        chicken?

           On Cinque Defreeze-- lounging in a bean-bag chair.
           A .45 peeking out of his waistband, he's wearing sunglasses, 
           an army fatigue jacket, and green velvet "Fred Astaire's" on 
           his feet.

           He's hardly impressed with the black couple's moves.

           But hold on a sec...

           CLOSE ON the couple, as we notice they're in BLACKFACE.

           The man is SLA MEMBER WILLIE 'KOJO' WOLFE, white, 20's.

           The woman is SLA MEMBER ANGELA ATWOOD, 20's.

                                 CINQUE
                        Looks more like the fried chicken...

           The couple laughs.

           Cinque gets up, shows some smooooth dance moves to the pair.

           Wiping a bit of the blackface off Angela's face,

                                 CINQUE
                        Can't fake the funk, comrades.

           ON an edgy, DYKED OUT WOMAN-- 30's, white-- rummaging through 
           a couple of army footlockers on the floor. She's got an Uzi 
           slung across her back:  SLA'er CAMILLA HALL.

           She's not amused by all the festivities.

                                 CAMILLA
                        That pig shorted us two carbines...

           She waves a gas-mask in the dancers' direction--

                                 CAMILLA
                        And there's no charcoal in this 
                        one...
                                 (exasperated)
                        ...it's no good being split up like 
                        this...

           Cinque, Angela, and Willie keep dancing.

                                 CAMILLA
                        Patty and them haven't checked in 
                        since they shot up that store...
                                 (losing patience)
                        Cinque-- anybody could see in from 
                        the street.
                                 CINQUE
                        Sister, somebody once said, "If I 
                        can't dance, I don't wanna be part of 
                        your revolution."

           INT. JORDAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- NIGHT

           The rec center of David Starr Jordan Elementary, smack dab in 
           the middle of Watts.

           A mind-bending scene. Bikini-clad black women serve drinks. 
           Roulette wheels and card games float. Reefer smoke in the 
           air.

           Pictures of Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, look down 
           on the mob.

           Burdette and Lynley swagger in.

           A SKINNY BLACK DUDE walks up to Lynley. Scrutinizes him.

                                 SKINNY DUDE
                        Only way a honky get in here is to 
                        rob the place, so you either a pig or 
                        a convict.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (cool)
                        Chino, Lompoc, or Vacaville? Probably 
                        Vacaville, cause that's where they 
                        send dings like you.

           Lynley lifts his shirt, shows an ugly, jagged scar along his 
           right side. He makes sure the dude clocks the straight-razor 
           stashed in his waistband, too.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Lompoc Brotherhood gave me this... 

           The skinny dude whistles.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I ain't suckin' nobody's dick.

                                 SKINNY DUDE
                        I heard that...

           Lynley sticks out his hand. The skinny dude twists it up to 
           a hi-five soul-phisticated shake.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Bones running hot, brother? 

           Burdette soul-shakes him, too.
                                 SKINNY DUDE
                        Man, I had a square pair and 
                        boxcars... now a nigga tapped out...
                                 (hustling)
                        Y'all brothers fade me?

           Burdette pulls out a fat roll of money, peels off a couple 
           fives, teases the beat--

                                 BURDETTE 
                                 (dubious, to Lynley)
                        What you think, Whitey?

                                 LYNLEY
                        I was hoping for something with some 
                        juice.

                                 SKINNY DUDE
                        Naw, man... you fade me... I can hip 
                        you to some high-stakes shit...

                                 BURDETTE
                        You show us the real action, I'll 
                        fade you for a few throws.

                                 SKINNY DUDE
                                 (slapping him five)
                        Solid. Leotis King.

           Leotis whips out a hash pipe filled with noxious-looking 
           shit, takes a hit and passes the pipe to Burdette.  Burdette 
           sucks in a huge lungful; Lynley follows suit.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (re: Lynley)
                        This my padner 'Whitey,' and I'm 
                        Malik.

                                 LEOTIS
                                 (a test)
                        A-salaam-alaikum...

                                 BURDETTE
                        A-laikum-a-salaam.

           The men edge up to the craps table. Leotis makes a bet.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (sotto voce)
                        Jesus... there must be fifteen large 
                        passing through here...

           Lynley's the only white boy for miiiles.
                                 LYNLEY
                                 (impressed)
                        Malik, huh?

           Leotis craps out.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (a nod toward Lynley's 
                                  side)
                        When'd you get your appendix out?

                                 LYNLEY
                        You like that? Came right to me.

           Leotis craps out again.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Leotis)
                        This is bullshit, homes... you gonna 
                        get that game for us, or not?

                                 LEOTIS
                        Slow your roll... just got here and 
                        think you the head nigga in charge?

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (plowing ahead)
                        I feel lucky, Leotis, and when I feel 
                        lucky, motherfuckers go home without 
                        the rent.

                                 LEOTIS
                        I got a game for you, Whitey... 
                        seeing as how you pressed for time.

           He motions to Lynley and Burdette: follow me.

           Move with them, through the rec room, down a corridor, and 
           into

           INT. CLASSROOM -- SAME TIME

           And if the rec-room was Sodom, this is fucking Gomorrah. 
           Thick smoke clouds the air, HOS dispense blow jobs to PLAYAS 
           AND GANGSTAS around a card-table.

           A few junkies tie-off and nod-off on the mats kids use for 
           quiet-time in the corner.

           Lynley and Burdette stand at the periphery.

           The door closes behind them.

                                 LEOTIS
                        Ya'll wanna let these fools play?
                                 GANGSTA
                                 (quick appraisal)
                        Nah... they cops.

           Lynley laughs.

           A COUPLE OF G'S flank the door. Only way out.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Playas)
                        Shit, man... you boofers gonna let us 
                        take your money... get some of that 
                        head making the rounds, or what?

           Playas turn to reappraise them. Beat of hard stares.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN (O.C.)
                        Who wants some head?

           Oh, shit: Gene the Queen. High. On a mat with a spike in his 
           forearm and a tube tourniquet tied to his biceps.

           Burdette and Lynley-- coooool-- turn their backs to him -- 
           he can I.D. them as fuzz.

                                 LEOTIS
                        You fellas gotta check this nigga 
                        out... he think he Betty Grable...
                                 (a wink to Lynley)
                        Close your eyes, it all feel the 
                        same...

           Gene rises-- hasn't seen the boys yet-- but in a second he 
           will,

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I got what you need...

           Gene stumbles toward them-- Burdette, thinking fast.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Leotis thinks you a faggot, Whitey.

           Lynley-- picking up the improv-- razor flicked open against 
           Leotis' neck,

                                 LYNLEY
                        That what you think? I told you-- I 
                        ain't suckin' nobody's dick!

           He pushes Leotis across the room

           Onto the card table-- pinning Leotis there-- players now on 
           their feet, place going APESHIT,
           Burdette-- the straight man, fake-trying to pull Lynley off,

                                 BURDETTE
                        Cool it, Whitey, he ain't mean 
                        nothin'--

           Plan working: they've put distance and a crowd of onlookers 
           between themselves and Gene the Queen,

                                 LEOTIS
                        You better get this honky off a me!

           Leotis-- wide-eyed-terrified, squirming snow angels on the 
           table, chips and cards swirling,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Cut you from asshole to appetite...

           One of the GANGSTAS at the table puts a .38 Special to 
           Lynley's temple,

                                 GANGSTA
                                 (calm, to Lynley)
                        Get this nigga off my chips.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Leotis)
                        I told you-- I'm not a faggot!

           Gene, roused by the commotion, catches a glimpse of Lynley,

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Hey... I know--

                                 LEOTIS
                                 (re: Gene)
                        -- Get that nigga outta here!

                                 GANGSTA
                                 (cocking his .38)
                        Get... off... my chips--

                                 LYNLEY
                        -- I'll get off... you tell him to 
                        get that faggot away from--

                                 BURDETTE
                        -- My boy is crazy, you better--

                                 LEOTIS
                        -- Get him outta here!

           Gene getting closer, his eyes focusing on Burdette-- he's 
           made him--
                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Bur--

           Lynley ELBOWS the Gangsta with the gun in the cheek-- BLAM-- 
           as the Gangsta squeezes an involuntary round into the table 
           and PANDEMONIUM-- DIG IT!

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. JORDAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -- NIGHT

           LAPD choppers hover overhead-- they're shooting infrared film 
           and flashing their belly lights, looking for possible 
           sightings of the SLA,

           FREEZE RANDOM INFRARED SHOTS OF the exodus:

           Pimps, players, and Gangstas run craazily down 86th Street.

           Burdette and Lynley cut down an alley and scale a fence.

           Dropping down onto the cement, Lynley flashes a shit-eating 
           grin Burdette's way.

           Burdette grabs him and shoves him against the chain link.

                                 BURDETTE
                        That...? Back there...? Was stupid.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Yeah, well... we'd a been playing 
                        Crazy-Eights all night if I'd left it 
                        to--

           Burdette lets Lynley go. He walks off in disgust.

           INT. BURDETTE HOUSE -- MORNING

           Burdette and Jane in the kitchen of the Burdette family's 
           house. Jane is whipping pancake batter, Burdette is making 
           himself coffee.

           Lynley walks into the room. He's barefoot, unshaven, still in 
           his hustler's clothes from the night before.

                                 JANE
                        Who are you boys today?

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (polite grunt)
                        Morning.
                                 (re: coffee)
                        May I?
                                 JANE
                        Sure.

           He pours a cup. Sits down across from Burdette.

           Tense silence. The clank of spoon against saucer. The sizzle 
           of butter in the pan. Jane ignores them until she can't.

                                 JANE
                                 (incredulous)
                        Did you really think you'd just walk 
                        in there and find Patty Hearst
                        shooting craps?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Leave it alone. 

           Beat. Lynley tests the waters.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You asking me? If you're asking me, I 
                        think Patty and the rest of 'em are 
                        in Mexico... Jesus, those smell good.

                                 BURDETTE
                        She wasn't asking you. It was a 
                        rhetorical question. And they're 
                        here. We've got eyewitnesses' put 
                        them here.

                                 JANE
                        Whatever you guys are doing, keep it 
                        up, it's good for business. Firm's 
                        gotten six referrals for excessive 
                        force in the last week...

           She piles some pancakes onto a plate.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You're prosecuting cops?

                                 JANE
                        If only. I'm in corporate.

                                 BURDETTE 
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Half those dockets probably have your 
                        name on 'em.

                                 JANE
                        That right, Lynley? You a tough guy?
                                 LYNLEY
                        Me? Nah...
                                 (loaded)
                        I mean... compared to some... maybe.

           Burdette: the fuck's that supposed to mean?

                                 JANE
                        So what's your turn-on, Lynley?
                        Rousting Commies? Putting the 
                        nightstick to degenerates?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Shoulda seen him brace the Panthers 
                        yesterday.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        I'd had some backup it woulda been a 
                        different story.

                                 BURDETTE
                        I hadn't been there, the story woulda 
                        been, 'Mongoloid Honky Cop Missing, 
                        Presumed Dead.'

                                 JANE
                                 (incredulous, to 
                                  Burdette)
                        Black Panthers? The Feds won't even 
                        go in there... And you went with him?

                                 BURDETTE
                        I wasn't gonna let him just--

                                 JANE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        -- The Panthers being mixed up with 
                        the SLA makes about as much sense as 
                        the SLA out shooting craps, which I 
                        guess makes about as much sense as
                        someone mistaking you two for 
                        anything but cops.

           Jane brings the stack of flapjacks over to the table.

           The boys scooch in, mouths watering, as she

           Pulls up a chair and digs into the whole stack.

                                 BURDETTE
                        You're kidding me.

           Jane eats silently.
           Lynley takes Burdette's fork and reaches tentatively toward 
           the stack-- Burdette grabs his arm, shakes his head-- I 
           wouldn't if I were you.

                                 JANE
                                 (let's make a deal: to 
                                  Burdette)
                        You do the dishes... and at least 
                        think about taking the bar...

                                 BURDETTE
                        Cool.

           He's waved in. He grabs a few flapjacks.

                                 JANE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        You gonna get my brother killed?

                                 LYNLEY
                        No ma'am.

           He reaches for a pancake-- she stays him.

                                 JANE
                        You gonna take a shower?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Yes ma'am.

           She waves him in.

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

           Lynley finishes dressing. Franz and Keefer enter. Check to 
           make sure no one else is around.

                                 FRANZ
                        Hey, killer. Less than a week in, 
                        you're undercover.

           Keefer kicks Lynley's shoes,

                                 KEEFER
                        Fuckin' Thorogoods ain't even scuffed 
                        yet.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Thanks for reccing us to Huber and 
                        Murcott... I mean it.

                                 KEEFER
                        'Us?' You.
                                 FRANZ
                        Get anything outta that game?

                                 LYNLEY
                        No SLA angle... just some spade 
                        game...

                                 KEEFER
                        You get a taste?

                                 LYNLEY
                        What? Nah... like Fort Knox... musta 
                        clocked ten or fifteen Gs in there.

           Franz and Keefer share a look. Franz grins big.

                                 KEEFER 
                                 (gotta admit, to 
                                  Franz)
                        I know... you told me this was the 
                        guy... and fuck if this isn't the 
                        guy.

           EXT. SOMEWHERE ON THE BEAT -- DAY

           Burdette and Lynley on a front yard, talking to an OLD LADY.

                                 OLD LADY
                        SLA ain't never busted down my door, 
                        or put no leather to me...

                                 BURDETTE
                        But you know they ain't right... the 
                        way they do... they're not your 
                        friends.

                                 LYNLEY
                        C'mon granny...

           Burdette shoots him a disgusted look.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Cinque and them nice white folks 
                        gonna take over South Central... all 
                        y'all crooked-ass cops be locked up.
                                 (pause)
                        Besides... my boyfriend had heard 
                        that Cinque and them moved to 
                        Newton... they giving away hams.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (incredulous)
                        Your boyfriend, huh?
                                 OLD LADY
                        Yes... he was a extra in "Dark
                        Manhattan." Had the same size shoes 
                        as George Raft...

                                 BURDETTE
                        Where in Newton?

           She tries to remember. Memory the first thing to go.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Now hold on...

           Not coming to her.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (waste of his time)
                        Yeah, well if Harry Belafonte gets 
                        another tip, you call us.

           She lifts the rear of her skirt, sashays off,

                                 OLD LADY
                        And you kiss my ass, honky.

           EXT. ANOTHER STREET IN SOUTH CENTRAL -- LATER

           Lynley and Burdette doing more door knocks. Sullen, 
           mistrustful faces behind every door.

           NOW AT THE HOUSE ON 84TH STREET. The one where we saw Cinque 
           and the SLA crew funking it up.

           They go to a ramshackle garage off the back. Padlocked.

           They walk back to the yard.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I mean... I know I'm just po' white 
                        trash... but are you allergic to 
                        money?

           Burdette scouts the house.

                                 LYNLEY
                        That crib... free ride to college--

                                 BURDETTE
                        My pop worked hard for everything 
                        we've got.

                                 LYNLEY
                        But still... dad's a dentist, 
                        sister's a shit-hot lawyer... 
                                         (MORE)
                                         LYNLEY (CONT'D)
                        ...and you're in the jungle pulling 
                        down sixteen a year.

                                 BURDETTE
                        You can't think of somebody doing
                        something for a reason besides money?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Only somebody with money would do
                        something for a reason besides money.

           Burdette kneels, pokes at an empty metal disk on the 
           sunburnt lawn.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You flunk out?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Fuck you.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (smells blood)
                        Aaah... sis is the star of the 
                        family, Billy couldn't cut it, gets 
                        stuck walking a beat.

                                 BURDETTE
                        I didn't get stuck, motherfucker. I 
                        get some stripes, take the bar... 
                        then city council--

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (faux encouraging)
                        -- Mayor?

           Burdette shrugs.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Hey, maybe even Prez-oh-dent. 

           Burdette picks up the tin.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What's that?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Shoe-polish...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Now you've got it...

           He sticks his shoe in front of Burdette.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I wanna see my face in 'em, boy.
           Burdette rises. Suddenly serious.

                                 BURDETTE
                        The honkies in the SLA are supposedly 
                        blacking up so they blend-in...

           The joking and the bullshit stop. Both men look at the house 
           a little more intently.

           ON Burdette and Lynley, hands on holsters, each checking the 
           side windows.

           Can't see in. Ratty curtains obscure the view.

                                 LYNLEY
                        We knock once, then take the door off 
                        the hinges.

                                 BURDETTE
                        A can of shoe-polish... it's awful 
                        thin...

           Beat. Gotta do something.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (deferring to 
                                  Burdette)
                        Your call.

           ON the front door. Burdette is lead. Lynley off to the side, 
           gun held low.

           INT. HOUSE -- DAY

           Cinque, Angela Atwood, Camilla, and Willie 'Kojo' Wolfe, 
           hunched over a cache of automatic weapons. Willie and Angela 
           are still in blackface. They look ridiculous. Everyone's 
           checking magazines, loading clips, etc.

                                 CAMILLA
                                 (cocking her head)
                        You hear something?

           Camilla swings her Uzi round to her front.

           Cinque makes the "sssh" sign, slides the action back on his 
           .45 semi-auto, goes to the door,

           EXT. HOUSE ON 84TH -- DAY

           Burdette goes to knock on the door.

           Lynley pushes him aside-- KICKS the door off the hinges.
           INT. HOUSE -- DAY

           As Cinque steps out onto the porch of a gone-to-seed rancher, 
           his .45 behind his back, out of sight.

           Coast is clear. Just sun and smog and L.A. ghetto.

           ANGLE ON the house. One we've never seen before. A different 
           part of town. The SLA has picked up and moved stakes.

           INT. HOUSE ON 84TH -- SAME TIME

           Burdette and Lynley, pretty much holding their dicks in the 
           now-abandoned house.

           INT. PATROL CAR -- DAY

           The boys cruise the neighborhood: Shitsville L.A., soul 
           style. Listless in the heat.

           At South Vermont and 79th, looking down at us now, a 
           billboard with a jumbo cartoon molar and the logo: Burdette 
           Family Dentistry: your smile connection!

           Lynley peeps the sign, taps Burdette.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Sorry Lynley... my pop don't do 
                        layaway.

           They turn onto a side street.

           Various patrol cars creep-- part of the manhunt for the SLA--
           the 77th precinct now occupied territory.

           Burdette stops the car in the middle of the street, hits the 
           flashers and gets out.

           Lynley's POV: As Burdette walks up the driveway of a well-
           kept bungalow, where Tammy-- the pretty singer from The Cozy 
           Nook-- is getting into her Datsun 1200.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Hold up.

                                 TAMMY
                        Hey, Officer Burdette.

                                 BURDETTE
                        What's the word?

                                 TAMMY
                        Nothing much... going to work.
                                 BURDETTE
                        Yeah? Gotta rehearse I bet... keep 
                        the set fresh...

           Burdette feels Lynley watching him. Shifts a little. If we 
           didn't know better we'd think the cat was nervous.

                                 TAMMY
                        Them fools only know six songs.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (laughs)
                        Sound good though.

                                 TAMMY
                        Thanks--

                                 BURDETTE
                        I mean your voice... you could be on 
                        a record.

                                 TAMMY
                        I don't know.

                                 BURDETTE
                        You could... You think about maybe 
                        playing some spots in Hollywood? They 
                        discover a lot of people... you play 
                        the right room... the right person 
                        hears you...

                                 TAMMY
                        I don't know.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Then maybe even get into the 
                        movies...

                                 TAMMY
                                 (firmly)
                        No.
                                 (softening)
                        I feel safe at the Nook... you 
                        know... my brother looking out for 
                        me.

           Her hand unconsciously adjusts her sunglasses.

                                 BURDETTE
                        No... it looks like it went down 
                        some. Lemme see...

           She takes off her glasses. Black eye or no, she's lovely.
                                 TAMMY
                        It was just...

                                 BURDETTE
                        Anybody you want me to rap a taste 
                        to?

           Tammy-- on the verge of saying something-- checks herself.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Be happy to do more than rap to 'em.

                                 TAMMY
                                 (deflecting)
                        Nah... you got fugitives to catch, 
                        right?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Tammy... you say the word and I can
                        swing by later... make sure no harm
                        befalls you.

           She laughs.

                                 TAMMY
                        I might be okay.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Cause you see on that car? Where it 
                        says 'Protect and Serve?'

           She laughs. Puts her shades back on.

                                 BURDETTE
                        But I guess you're sick of all these 
                        police.

                                 TAMMY
                        Some of them... Yeah.

           She moves to get into her car. Burdette holds the door for 
           her.

           She smiles, turns the engine, backs out and away.

           Burdette watches for a beat. Crosses back to the cruiser, 
           gets in.

                                 BURDETTE 
                                 (preemptively)
                        Fuck you.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What?

                                         (MORE)
                                         LYNLEY (CONT'D)
                                 (pause)
                        You forgot the board is all I'm 
                        saying. But I took notes... 

           Lynley pretends to read from their canvassing clipboard,

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (stuttery, mock 
                                  teenager voice)
                        Umm... I... was... wondering if... 
                        Umm... if maybe you...

           FROM NOWHERE

           a score of police cars blaze by, squealers and flashers 
           going, fast, toward Compton Ave.

           Burdette-- firing the engine-- the roar and screech of the 
           cruiser as it fishtails onto Compton,

           Joining the caravan of black and whites, a herd of charging 
           Detroit zebras,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Hold on, Patty... daddy's coming! 

           Lynley, amped-- finally, some juice,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Gas is on the right, Billy, ain't 
                        gonna bite ya.

           Stream of squad cars blowing through alleys,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fuckin' A... Move this thing!

           Blur of streets... 82nd... 83rd... streets looking familiar 
           now. Real familiar.

           A dozen squad cars and some unmarked cars parked at hard 
           angles jam 84th street.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Ain't no way.

           On their faces: no... no fucking way... it can't be. It is.

           EXT. HOUSE ON 84TH -- SAME TIME

           The house they checked earlier. Empty hole where they kicked 
           in the door. 

           Burdette and Lynley lay rubber at the curb and bail.
                                 BURDETTE
                        We were just here...

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (pissed)
                        Don't do me like this, Patty.

           They push their way through twenty-odd plainclothes and 
           uniformed cops and see

           Officer Donny Miller,

           Dead on the garage floor. 

           His pants and Jockey shorts have been pulled down to his 
           knees; there’s a bullet wound in the back of his head; his 
           LAPD badge has been pinned through his nose.

           Spray-painted on the wall, THE SLA KILLS PIGS DEAD.

           TECHNICIANS dust for prints; a CORONER kneels by Miller's 
           body and sticks a thermometer in his ass.

           The assembled cops mutter in shock; the garage is a welter of 
           overlapping voices.

           Burdette and Lynley share a look:

           If it weren't for bad luck, they wouldn't have no luck at 
           all.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. MUSTER ROOM AT 77TH STREET STATION -- NIGHT

           It's packed; uniformed cops line the walls; Lieutenant 
           Murcott stands at the podium.

           The stage in back of him lined with plainclothesmen in chairs 
           -- there's Sergeants Vic Franz and Ted Keefer, along with 
           Vice's Sergeant Dick Huber.

           Burdette and Lynley sit together in the sea of uniforms.

                                 MURCOTT
                        You know why we're here. I'm handing 
                        it over to Lieutenant Rick Beddoes 
                        from RHD. He'll explain what we've 
                        got so far.

           Murcott retreats. LIEUTENANT RICK BEDDOES, a tall white man, 
           walks to the lectern. He taps the mike, raises static and 
           speaks.
                                 BEDDOES
                        Miller was the daywatch floater.
                        He always worked alone, and he always 
                        drove a Department F-car days, then 
                        switched to his civilian wheels at 
                        night. His F-car is back in the lot, 
                        pristine, and none of Miller's shit 
                        is in it. His civilian car's missing, 
                        along with all of Miller's canvassing 
                        sheets on the SLA.

           A COP raises his hand.

                                 COP
                        Have you checked Miller's recent 
                        arrests? Old arrests? Guys he sent to 
                        the joint?

                                 BEDDOES
                        Miller didn't make many arrests, so I 
                        don't buy that angle. Whatever the 
                        motive, he was tortured before he was 
                        shot. All his fingers and toes were 
                        broken.

           The muster room rumbles. Beddoes taps the mic.

                                 BEDDOES
                        The SLA or black-guerilla fucks like 
                        that are our number one suspects, but 
                        we're staying open on our leads. 
                        We've got three teams from RHD to 
                        handle the black radical angle. 
                        Questions?

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (raising his hand)
                        You thought about a personal angle? 
                        Miller was a scrounger and a freak.

           The room freezes. Lynley grins. Partner's got balls.

                                 BEDDOES
                        Keep your character assessments to 
                        yourself, Burdette.
                                 (to the room)
                        Miller was a brother officer. Don't 
                        be timid out there.

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT OFFICE -- DAY

           Burdette and Lynley stand in front of Lieutenant Murcott's 
           desk.
                                 MURCOTT
                                 (brusque)
                        You're on Miller's car. Hit the chop 
                        shops and check the auto dumps and 
                        abandoned garages.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Let us toss Miller's apartment.

                                 MURCOTT
                        Nope.

                                 BURDETTE
                        You said it's not personal... we'll 
                        inventory all his crap, free up 
                        manpower so you guys can work the SLA 
                        angle.

           Murcott considers. He's heard worse ideas.

                                 MURCOTT
                        Okay. But keep working your Oreo 
                        cover, and you come up with any SLA 
                        stuff you keep your dick in your 
                        pants and file asap.
                                 (to Lynley 
                                  specifically)
                        We want a strong presence out there. 
                        That means take no shit from God on 
                        down.

           EXT./INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER

           Burdette, Lynley, and THE SUPER enter Donny Miller's low-
           rent apartment in North Hollywood. It's a small second-story 
           unit.

                                 SUPER
                        Real shame. Real shame.
                                 (to Lynley)
                        You know anybody who's renting, lemme 
                        know. Long as they're quiet... 
                        white... a steady paycheck.
                                 (to Burdette)
                        No offense, you understand.

           The Super leaves.

           It's a tidy, one-bedroom crib. Taped on horse-race posters 
           line the living room walls.

           Burdette and Lynley open drawers, check closets, rummage 
           cabinets. They find a dozen cheap handguns in a drawer.
                                 BURDETTE
                        Lot of guns...

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (scornful)
                        Throw-down guns. Not that that lazy 
                        fuck ever shot anyone. 

           Burdette finds a milk-crate full of cheapo work-lights, the 
           kind with tin scoop-domes.

           Lynley pulls an 8 millimeter camera from a drawer stuffed 
           with nudie mags.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        Hey-oh!

           Lynley clicks the trigger... nothing.

           Burdette takes the camera, peels his shirt off his back and 
           wraps it around the camera so no light can get in.

           We hear a CLICK as he pops the magazine open. He feels 
           around for a spool of film. He shakes his head, puts his 
           shirt back on.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Lost reel of Birth of a Nation, no 
                        doubt...

           He dumps the empty camera, and

           They walk into the bedroom. They toss more drawers. Nothing.

           Burdette-- in the bathroom-- lifts the tank lid-- something 
           taped there. Wrapped in plastic.

           He joins Lynley in the bedroom. Unwraps a small black ledger 
           from the plastic.

           They thumb through it. We SEE: a row of dated, numbered 
           entries.

           Penny-ante shit, pluses and minuses of fifty bucks here, ten 
           bucks there, until:

           AN ENTRY FOR 28,918.00.

                                 LYNLEY 
                                 (what they're both 
                                  wondering)
                        Say what?
           INT. RUMPUS ROOM -- LATER

           Burdette and Lynley at the Rumpus Room. The dive is near 
           empty.

           Burdette braces Clyde, the barman.

                                 BURDETTE
                        We know Miller was taxin' you, 
                        brother.

                                 CLYDE
                        Motherfucker taxed everybody on the 
                        ave... so? You taking his place?

           Clyde turns his back on Burdette. Lynley moves in but 
           Burdette grabs the man's collar and lobs a wobbly left-hook, 
           hitting the guy in the ear. 'Bad Cop' a bad fit for Burdette.

           Clyde starts to react-- Lynley burns a You do not wanna fuck 
           with me hole into him.

                                 CLYDE
                        Real sorry that pig is dead, but I 
                        don't know jack.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Then think of somebody who does,
                        nigga.

           Lynley scans the near-empty bar. Sees several wires caulked 
           to the ceiling.

           Follows them to a heavy doorway adjoining the toilets. Puts a 
           shoulder to the door, snaps it and enters a 30-desk bookie 
           phone-room.

           The black phone men burn their flash paper and head for the 
           windows. Lynley runs over and hauls two men down by the seat 
           of their pants.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. RUMPUS ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           The TWO busted-up BOOKIES sit at the bar nursing their 
           wounds.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What about the SLA?

                                 CLYDE
                        SLA? This a book-joint, not no
                        Communist cell.

           EXT. ELDO -- MOVING -- LATER

           Burdette and Lynley drive south on Vermont Avenue. Their 
           radio is on. LAPD Chief Ed Davis speaks.

                                 DAVIS (O.S.)
                        ... Officer Donald J. Miller was a 
                        policeman of exemplary morals, and 
                        his death smacks of a left-wing 
                        ritualistic killing.

                                 BURDETTE
                        They've already made up their minds. 
                        Brass won't let the papers know 
                        Miller was dirty. They want it to be 
                        the SLA...

                                 LYNLEY
                        It might be.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (considers)
                        We give it one week. Work our own 
                        evidence and turn it over. One fat 
                        summary report could get us out of 
                        bluesuits forever.
           Burdette reaches into the glove box, pulls out the Motorola.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (into Mic)
                        X-Ray twelve, over.

                                 POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        Go ahead, X-Ray twelve... over

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (into Mic)
                        Need a ten-twenty-nine on a King, 
                        Leotis... over.

           EXT. ELDO -- MOVING -- LATER

           They pull off Vermont. Drive east on 74th Street. Pull over.

           EXT. 74TH STREET -- SAME TIME

           They get out, survey the block. Low rent residential. 
           Boatsized cars in driveways. Rusted Pink-Flamingos in patchy 
           yards.

           They walk up the driveway next to a stucco box. Burdette 
           squats. Fresh skid marks.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Wide-base performance tires... maybe 
                        Pirelli's...

                                 BURDETTE
                        You see a performance car around 
                        here?

                                 LYNLEY
                        You mean like a Barracuda?
                                 (with meaning)
                        Not like we know anybody with one, 
                        either.

           They unsnap their holsters. Lynley jiggles the doorknob. 
           Locked.

           The SOUND OF AM RADIO pumps from inside the apartment: Kool & 
           the Gang's Hollywood Swinging.

           They go around to the side. There's an open window with a 
           screen in it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You smell that?

                                                                   CUT TO:
           INT. LEOTIS' CRIB -- MOMENTS LATER

           On their faces: horror, disbelief.

           Leotis King,

           Hanging by his hands from a ceiling beam. Naked. Mouth 
           stuffed with socks and wrapped with duct tape. Dead.

           DEATH TO THE OPPRESSORS, spray-painted on the wall.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- LATER

           Burdette riffles the phone-book.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (voice of reason for 
                                  once)
                        That crime scene's gonna go to shit,
                        the longer we wait to call it in...

                                 BURDETTE
                        Soon as we I-D the car as Miller's, 

           He tears the entire Auto Body section from the yellow-pages.

                                 BURDETTE
                        RHD'll take over... and squash 
                        whatever we could've found out.

                                 LYNLEY 
                                 (with pride)
                        Billy... I'm beginning to think I'm a 
                        bad influence.

           EXT. -- NICK'S AUTO BODY -- LATER

           Many stops later. The Eldo pulls through the open gate of 
           Nick's Auto Body. The dump is deserted. Junk cars piled in 
           heaps.

           They scan the metal landscape with their high beams.

           ON Lynley-- suddenly heartsick--

                                 LYNLEY
                        This... is not right. Miller was an 
                        asshole... but this...

           They exit their car and walk over to the BURNED OUT WRECK OF 
           DONNY MILLER'S BARRACUDA.

                                 LYNLEY
                        ... What those fucks did to Leotis 
                        was one thing...
                                         (MORE)
                                         LYNLEY (CONT'D)
                                 (genuinely bummed)
                        look at this... Who does something 
                        like this, Billy?

           Lynley nearly burns his hand on the door handle, uses his 
           shirt sleeve to jerk it open.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Asshole had so many parking tickets, 
                        everything went up like the 
                        Hindenburg...

           They play their beams around the smoldering insides.

           Burdette peels the corner of an unscathed parking ticket off 
           the floorboard.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Not everything.

           INT. SPANISH TUDOR -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Burdette's bedroom. He goes over the scorched ticket with a 
           magnifying glass. Lynley loafs on the bed, flipping through a 
           copy of Jet.

           The ticket's mostly charred, but the top and the first few 
           numbers of the citation-- 1423-- are still visible.

           Burdette's evidence kit open on the desk. He dabs ninhydrin 
           on the ticket and a partial fingerprint glows purple.

           Burdette compares the swirls to the print cards on Leotis 
           King and the at-large SLA members.

                                 LYNLEY
                        That thing's toast... you ain't gonna
                        find a print.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (undeterred, a fucking 
                                  pro)
                        ... maybe someone picked it up...
                        moves it over... even just to sit
                        down...

           Lynley pauses. Looks up from his magazine. A thought:

                                 LYNLEY
                        We could check it against the carbons 
                        down at dispatch... maybe the ticket 
                        puts his car somewhere...

           Burdette looks over at Lynley: impressed.
                                 LYNLEY
                                 (waves the magazine)
                        Sometimes I get my best ideas, just 
                        sitting on the crapper.

           Burdette laughs. Looks exhausted.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Fuck it, let's code seven.

           The THWACK of a golf ball, and

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. BALDWIN HILLS -- NIGHT

           On a scenic overlook, with the Burdette house in the 
           background, and the oil-fields down in Ladera Heights pumping 
           in the distance.

           Burdette lines up another shot. Lynley swigs from a bottle of 
           beer and feeds him balls from a bucket.

                                 BURDETTE
                        I thought all honkies knew how to 
                        golf.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Shit... you got a half-court, I could 
                        show you something.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Come by next Sunday... the Stilt and 
                        me and some boys have a pickup game.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Aw, c'mon: Wilt? I suppose Diana Ross 
                        and Lola Falana are cheerleaders.
                                 (overt jealousy)
                        You got some life, Billy.

           Lynley gets up, takes the Five-Wood from Billy.

           He tosses a ball into the air, swings the club like a 
           baseball bat, connects a long drive into the valley.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        Not bad.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Played half-a-season double-A out of 
                        Reseda.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Wash-out?
                                 LYNLEY
                        Nope.

           Lynley's silence filling it in: life got in the way. Lynley 
           tosses another ball, smacks it into the dark.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (almost apologetic)
                        I was Four-A... otherwise... I would 
                        have served--

           The CLINK of glasses behind them, as Jane pads over in her 
           bare feet.

           She's got a martini shaker and three glasses.

                                 JANE
                                 (re: Lynley's swing)
                        Crude, but effective.

           Billy takes the Five back, lines up a shot.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Back up, son... this one's crossin' 
                        Slausen.

           Lynley edges back. Closer to Jane.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Hey.

                                 JANE
                        Hey, Lynley.

           She pours them each a drink.

           Lynley watches Burdette fiddle with his stance. If he wants 
           to say something, he's not gonna get another chance,

                                 LYNLEY 
                                 (rushed)
                        So I was thinking we could go out 
                        some time.

           Burdette swings... misses.

                                 JANE
                                 (sweetly)
                        Where...? To a Klan rally?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Yeah, but before that, maybe dinner.

           Burdette tees up.
                                 JANE
                        You're not my type.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You got me wrong.

                                 JANE
                        I do?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Yup. I'm one-eighteenth black on my 
                        step-father's side.

           Jane smiles.

                                 JANE
                                 (calling out, to 
                                  Burdette)
                        Didja remember to address the ball!?

           Obviously a schtick they've been doing since they were kids: 
           Billy tips an imaginary cap,

                                 JANE/BILLY (STEREO)
                                 (Art Carney Vibe)
                        Hellooo, ball!

           Laughs all around.

                                 JANE
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Think he's got a shot?

           Meaning Billy. But not really.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (considers)
                        Could surprise you.

           Burdette nails the drive, admires the shot, turns to Jane and 
           Lynley and

           Spins the club with an elegant Fred Astaire style heel-kick.

           EXT. METER MAID PARKING BAY -- DAY

           Burdette and Lynley wend their way through the lot of three- 
           wheeled meter-maid trikes, dyked-out meter maids coming and 
           going.

                                 LYNLEY
                        M-E makes Leotis dead less than 
                        twelve hours when we found him.
                                 BURDETTE
                        So run it down.

           FOLLOW THEM into

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- DISPATCH -- MORNING

                                 LYNLEY
                        Okay... so RHD has it figured the SLA 
                        nabs Miller and King together at 
                        King's... they string King up, kill 
                        Miller, and dump him in the garage on 
                        eighty-fourth street... then they 
                        dump the car, torch it... how's that 
                        sound?

           They get to the Dispatch counter,

                                 BURDETTE
                        King had sixteen pimp and four
                        weapons beefs which makes him a thug, 
                        not a lefty.
                                 (to the DISPATCHER)
                        Mama... where are the carbons for 
                        parking citations?

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. FILE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Burdette finger walks through a file,

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (reading the scorched 
                                  ticket)
                        One, four, two, three, are the first--

                                 BURDETTE
                        -- No citations on Miller's plates. 
                        Donut.

           He slams the file cabinet.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (re: the ticket)
                        Then what's this?

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET -- DAY

           Burdette and Lynley cruise the 77th, coming abreast of

           A METER-MAID chalking a tire at the curb.
                                 LYNLEY
                        Hey sweet-tits... your name Karen 
                        Cordova?

           KAREN CORDOVA ignores him, makes a note in her pad, gets on 
           her Harley trike.

                                 KAREN
                        Who wants to know?

                                 LYNLEY
                        We got a sequence of tickets traced 
                        back to you, with no carbons filed 
                        for 'em.

           Beat. Karen side eyes them.

                                 KAREN
                        This about Donny?

           Lynley and Burdette share a look.

                                 KAREN
                        It ain't what you think.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What do we think?

                                 KAREN
                        We were friends... I'd spot his 
                        car... leave him a note... you 
                        know... "meet me for a drink"... 
                        stuff like that...

           Lynley watches her closely.

           ON the crucifix-choker around her neck. CLOSER... Sooo
           subtle: Her carotid artery pulsing, making Jesus dance.

                                 KAREN
                        I didn't file any carbons, on account 
                        of... you know... it was personal.

           She starts her trike,

                                 KAREN
                                 (shrugs, with 
                                  finality)
                        So...

           She rumbles off.
           EXT. HOT DOG STAND -- MOMENTS LATER

           Leon's Pig Pen-- a bustling hot dog stand on 103rd and Lew 
           Dillon.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (to cashier)
                        Two with everything...

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Burdette)
                        No onions on mine...

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (to cashier)
                        No onions on his...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Bitch is lying.

                                 BURDETTE
                        How do you know?

                                 LYNLEY
                        You see her necklace? You're lying, 
                        your carotid artery goes crazy... 
                        that's why they make dog tags so 
                        long... case you get questioned.

                                 BURDETTE
                        So Cordova was fucking Miller?

           They wince.

                                 BURDETTE
                        We'll have to brace her.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I'll do it.

           Off Burdette's silence,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Unless you wanna do it?

           The cashier hands them their dogs. Burdette makes a 
           halfhearted wallet grab, she waves him off.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        I was thinking she might be more 
                        scared of a black man.

           Lynley shrugs. They sit on the edge of the cruiser and eat.
                                 BURDETTE
                                 (re: the dogs)
                        Two more?

           Lynley stands up, sniffs the air. A smell he recognizes.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Cordite.

           Dimly, a SIREN can be heard.

           Then: ANOTHER SIREN. And another, and another.

           A CACOPHONY.

           Then: smoke in the air, due northeast.

           A black and white pulls to the curb beside them. The 
           passenger cop leans out his window and jabs a finger 
           northeast.

                                 PASSENGER COP
                                 (excited)
                        SLA!

                                 LYNLEY
                        Where?

                                 PASSENGER COP
                        54th and something. Some lady called 
                        the Newton desk.

           The black and white peels rubber.

           INT. SQUAD CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Burdette and Lynley cut over to Compton Avenue. Heavy traffic 
           runs northbound: black and whites and unmarked felony cars, 
           sirens blasting.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fuck. That old lady said Newton.

           68th Street, 67th Street -- a huge cop aggregation looms.

           66th Street straight up to 58th -- parked cop cars make 
           street progress impossible.

           Burdette brakes the car to a halt.

           He makes stirrups out of his hands and boosts Lynley up to 
           eight feet. Lynley braces his legs against the car and makes 
           binoculars from his hands.

           Lynley's POV:
           There's the house: we recognize it as the one where we last 
           saw Cinque and company.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (yelling at Burdette)
                        That's gotta be it.

           They fast-walk to a sea of cops standing behind a final 
           barricade. They push into it.

           Snatches of cop talk: Loot's gonna smoke 'em out...Looks like 
           a Patty melt...

           BULLHORN in the distance SQUAWKING: ... you will not be 
           harmed... if you do not comply, we will be forced to...

           INT. SLA HOUSE -- SAME TIME

           Animal panic. Willie Wolfe-- pulling guns from a footlocker--

                                 WILLIE WOLFE
                        Get away from the window!

           HISSS! TEAR GAS explodes through the window,

           EXT. SLA HOUSE -- SAME TIME

           A Swat Lieutenant hand signals to his men, they edge forward.

           INT. SLA HOUSE -- SAME TIME

           Angela Atwood-- choking on the fumes-- Willie fitting a mask 
           over her head--

                                 ANGELA
                                 (melting down)
                        I don't like it here anymore-- let's 
                        go, Willie, nobody has to know...

           ON Cinque in the bathroom-- tub overflowing-- now turning 
           the faucets on the sink full blast--

                                 CINQUE
                        Flood the kitchen! They gonna smoke 
                        us out!

           Camilla Hall, M-16 held in front of her-- rushing in--

                                 CAMILLA
                        Cinque! Pigs everywh--

           Slipping on the wet floor-- M-16 GOING OFF-- shattering the 
           toilet bowl-- the shot all it takes and
           EXT. SLA HOUSE -- SAME TIME

           COPS and SWAT RAIN BULLETS AND TEAR GAS toward the house.

           Cops evacuate residents-- one drags an OLD LADY in her 
           nightie away from her clapboard house,

                                 OLD LADY
                        My dog in there! My dog! ... you 
                        gotta get my dog!

           COPS UNLOAD ARMAGEDDON into the SLA house-- WHOOSH!-- one 
           side catches fire,

           TV REPORTERS duck and point and jabber into bulky remote 
           video cameras,

                                 BLONDE TV REPORTER
                                 (into camera)

           REVEAL

           INT. THE COZY NOOK BAR -- SAME TIME

           Tammy-- the foxy singer-- her brother Rudy and practically 
           half of South Central gathered under the TV, the images 
           choppy and breathless, GUNSHOTS everywhere,

                                 ANOTHER TV REPORTER
                                 (running and ducking)
                        ... The absolute mayhem at what is 
                        believed to be the hideout of the
                        SLA, and only KABC is in the thick
                        of the action folks...

           A bugged-out LOCAL sticks his face into the camera,

                                 LOCAL
                        Whatc'all fools doin?! They 
                        shooting!!

           The local haul-asses away from camera,

           BACK TO Burdette and Lynley on the perimeter. The house 
           ablaze. 

           Burdette. Sickened.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (digging the show)
                        It's a Cinque barbecue!
           Burdette's had enough. He walks away.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Hey! Stick around... it's just 
                        getting good... Billy!

           Burdette disappears in the swarm of cops, Lynley pushing in 
           closer, happy as a pig in shit.

           INT. SLA HOUSE -- SAME TIME

           The basement. Fire and smoke everywhere. Bullets sieve the 
           windows.

           Cinque. Alone. Sitting against the wall. No way to survive 
           this. Fuck it. He sticks his .45 under his chin. 

           An AERIAL SHOT reveals hundreds of cops and cop cars deep, as

           The house at 1466 East 54th Street EXPLODES into flames.

           INT. THE LITTLE BOY MOTEL -- ROOM -- SAME TIME

           ON A WOMAN'S HEAD, from behind, topped with a pair of Mickey 
           Mouse Ears.

           Out the window, the Disneyland castle's spires in the Anaheim 
           distance.

           ANGLE ON the TV-- tuned to the fiery carnage.

           The woman with the Mouse Ears gets on all fours, crawls in 
           shock toward the TV.

           We recognize her as the woman in the Afro wig from the 
           shootout at Mel's Sporting Goods.

           PATTY HEARST reaches out, touches the screen.

           BILL and EMILY HARRIS, the last of the SLA fugitives, 
           collapse next to Patty.

           Emily holds her close, puts her hand over her mouth to muffle 
           the screams.

           EXT. SHITTY APARTMENT COMPLEX -- DAY

           A plume of smoke in the distance. The smoldering fire at the 
           SLA house misting ash for miles. Cars and lawns dusted with 
           the remnants of wood and fiber.

           Burdette and Lynley, walking up the stairwell to Karen 
           Cordova's.

                        And then it was like Tet, man, that 
                        was the last time I saw something 
                        like that.

                                 BURDETTE
                        For what? The SLA didn't kill Miller.

                                 LYNLEY
                        For what? They got 'em, man. Next 
                        stop those Panther assholes and 
                        anybody else thinks they can break 
                        bad.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        Panthers'd have you pissing your 
                        pants you try that shit with them.

           Burdette knocks on a door.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY -- SAME TIME

           Karen Cordova opens her door, sees the two cops and tries to 
           slam it shut. Lynley's too fast -- he wedges a foot in and 
           Burdette shoves the door open.

           INT. KAREN CORDOVA'S PAD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cordova, nursing a drink in a bean-bag chair. 

           Burdette flips through a stack of bills on a table.

           Lynley and Cordova stare at him.

                                 KAREN
                        You gonna pay 'em? Otherwise leave me 
                        alone.

           Burdette smiles. Pulls out his notepad... cross-references.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (scanning the papers)
                        Phone bills. Called Miller and Leotis 
                        King at least 30 times in the past... 
                        two months.

           Karen flips Burdette the bird. He pours her another shot. She 
           downs it quicksville.

                                 KAREN
                        You guys are just humps... since when 
                        do uniforms do homicide 
                        investigations?
                                 LYNLEY
                        We're in the gifted and talented 
                        program.

                                 BURDETTE
                        You can tell us, or Homicide. There's 
                        a guy named Vic Franz I could call.

                                 CORDOVA
                        Let it go. The SLA's good for it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        So you were fucking him.

                                 CORDOVA
                        Nah... I'd see foxy women, and I'd 
                        run their plates for Donny. He'd get 
                        their numbers, call them, tell them 
                        he was a producer, said he could get 
                        'em into movies... so he could ball 
                        them... that kind of thing.
                                 (beat)
                        Everybody wants to be in the movies.

                                 BURDETTE
                        What'd you get out of it?

           She's silent.

           Burdette moves to stand over her.

           Cordova holds her glass out. Burdette pours her a shot. She 
           drains it ultra-quicksville.

                                 KAREN 
                        Nothing heavy... bennies, goofers...

                                 BURDETTE
                        So he copped for you, in exchange for 
                        phone numbers... and you called him 
                        and King thirty times?
                                 (to Lynley)
                        How's that smell to you, padner?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fishier than a sardine's cunt. 

           Pause.

                                 KAREN
                                 (fuck it, here goes)
                        Donny and Leotis had a jones for this 
                        high-stakes crap game. Supposedly it 
                        was sanctioned by brass... long as 
                        they got a taste... 
                                         (MORE)
                                         KAREN (CONT'D)
                        it floated around the projects, in 
                        the basements. I was in and out of 
                        the Nickerson Gardens giving 
                        citations, so I had a pretty good 
                        idea how the game rotated.

                                 BURDETTE
                        So you know the guys who ran the 
                        game.
                                 (a pause)
                        Ran all their plates, too, didn't 
                        you?

           Lynley makes a fork-it-over gesture.

           INT. ELDO -- MOMENTS LATER

           Burdette and Lynley check the files Karen Cordova gave them.

           OFF their various mugshots:

                                 BURDETTE
                        Shondell McCline. Three stat rapes, 
                        two 211's, fourteen dope and gambling 
                        busts. Pimped sissies in Soledad.

           A pause.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Jack-- "Fat Jack"-- Jimmerson... Six 
                        wienie wagger beefs, four 211's, 
                        attempted manslaughter...

           A pause.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Montell Maurice Tubbs. Four 
                        aggravated assaults, shitload of B 
                        and E's... manslaughter... Winners, 
                        all...

                                 LYNLEY
                        So Miller won twenty-eight large at 
                        their game... and the brothers were 
                        none too happy.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Or the brass was none too happy.

                                 LYNLEY
                        But Miller was a stone-loser... how 
                        does Lady Luck sit on his face one 
                        day out of a thousand?

           Beat, as Burdette and Lynley both get hip at the same time:
                                 BURDETTE
                        Miller and Leotis took down the game.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. SPANISH TUDOR -- NIGHT

           Burdette leans over Lynley, watching intently. Lynley has a 
           box of Remington .38 Caliber short rounds open next to him. 
           He holds a bullet in the jaws of a pair of pliers, and waves 
           a butter knife over a candle.

           Once the blade is hot, he presses an "x" into the slug.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Secret to dum-dumming is not to 
                        spread the slug... especially in your 
                        semi... it'll jam.... let the heat do 
                        the work...

           He looks at Burdette: see?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Shit spreads on impact like the 
                        clap... You do some for the 
                        speedloaders and for your twenty-
                        five... I'm gonna wash up.

           He switches places with Burdette, stretches, we

           Follow him as he walks by the sliding glass doors which face 
           the swimming pool, where

           Jane-- a one-piece clinging to her-- dives in, her body 
           disappearing into the glowing blue. 

           Lynley keeps going until he gets to the master bathroom.

           He peels off his civvies, steps into the marble and glass 
           shower stall.

           He turns on the water, first very hot, then very cold, 
           bracing himself against the extremes, pounding his fist 
           against the tile as he makes himself take it.

           He gets out, on his way to the towel rack, as

           Jane walks in.

                                 JANE
                                 (averting her eyes)
                        Sorry... forgot you lived here.

           He's totally exposed. No choice but to brave the few feet to 
           the towel rack with feigned nonchalance, head held high.
                                 LYNLEY
                                 (re: the shower, but 
                                  coool)
                        All yours.

           She studies him. Drying himself. Not even looking her way. 

           This won't do: she's not gonna be out-cooled.

           She steps out of her swimsuit.

                                 JANE
                        Hope you didn't use all the hot 
                        water.

           She passes him and goes to the shower while he dries off. 

           She turns on the faucet-- but instead of getting in, she 
           holds just her arm inside the stall to gauge the 
           temperature.

                                 JANE 
                        Jesus, Lynley... is that the only 
                        towel?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Huh?
                                 (purposefully not 
                                  looking at her)
                        Geez, sorry.

           Toying with him now, teaching the cocky bastard a lesson,

                                 JANE
                        Don't be sorry, just don't get it all 
                        wet.

           OFF a tattoo on his shoulder,

                                 JANE
                        "Fuck the World?" How far've you 
                        gotten with that grand scheme?

           Lynley gives a brave smirk, but he's outgunned.

           She gets into the shower,

                                 JANE
                        You can't even make any headway in 
                        this room...
                                 LYNLEY
                                 (braver now that she's 
                                  out of sight)
                        Don't flatter yourself little girl. I 
                        can take it or leave it. 

           She sticks her head out of the shower,

                                 JANE
                        Silly Lynley... I'm a lawyer...
                                 (a coy glance below 
                                  his waist)
                        ... And look at how you lie.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. NICKERSON GARDENS PROJECTS -- NIGHT

           Burdette and Lynley in Burdette's Citroen. Tense silence.

                                 LYNLEY
                        We look like Interpol in this thing.

                                 BURDETTE
                        I wasn't about to sign out the 
                        Eldo... I trust no one at the 77th 
                        except me and you and I'm only partly 
                        sure about you.
                                 (serious)
                        We cannot fuck this up...

                                 LYNLEY
                        We won't.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        Like we did Newton...

                                 LYNLEY
                        And 84th street.

           They case the projects. A couple of PEE-WEES on bikes ride 
           by.

           Burdette fishes a ten from his wallet, dangles it out the 
           window. The pee-wees clock it. Loop back.

                                 PEE-WEE
                        What ya'll pigs want?

                                 BURDETTE
                        Want that game.

           The pee-wees shrug. Money's money.
           EXT. CITROEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Burdette and Lynley over the open hatchback.

           Lynley empties the contents of a paper sack. Brass knucks. 
           Beavertail sap. Rubber hose.

                                 LYNLEY
                        How is it everybody knows we're fuzz?

                                 BURDETTE
                        You're a honky, and I'm not kicking 
                        your ass.

           Each man loads up with gear.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I'm primary.

           Before Burdette can protest,

                                 LYNLEY
                        We got jack unless they confess.

                                 BURDETTE
                        If it don't stick, we got jack 
                        anyway.

           OFF the SLAM of the trunk,

           We follow the boys into Nickerson Gardens. Deserted.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        We go in strong... black-glove until 
                        we get what we want.

                                 BURDETTE
                        Ain't you learned nothing? That hard-
                        charging shit don't work.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Billy? We're not knocking-- we're 
                        kicking down doors... and we're not 
                        Mirandizing until after these 
                        cocksuckers are pissing blood and 
                        telling us what we wanna know.

           They cross a playground filled with empty wine-bottles. 

           Coming to a back entrance,

                                 BURDETTE 
                        We use our heads, Chuck. People walk 
                        otherwise... and we stay in blue.
                                 LYNLEY
                        People don't walk unless you let 'em. 
                        And I'm not carrying you on this one.

           Pause.

                                 BURDETTE
                        What the fuck's that mean?

           A couple of figures move in the shadows. Lynley spots them,

                                 LYNLEY 
                        Look alive, man. Two of 'em... eight 
                        o'clock... put eyes on everything 
                        that moves.

                                 BURDETTE
                                 (clocks them)
                        I got 'em. Winos. You carrying me?
                        Shit... every lead we've gotten has 
                        been off me...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Like the Dineens?

           They enter the rear of the Nickerson Gardens. The men speak 
           low-- hoarse whispers in the night quiet.

                                 BURDETTE 
                        Coulda worked that case if you'd
                        laid back and policed it.

           Lynley turns on Burdette,

                                 LYNLEY
                        I did work that case. I killed those 
                        fucks while you were pissing your 
                        panty-shields. I'm half-way to a 
                        detective on the back of that... this
                        puts me over the top. You can keep up 
                        or get left behind.

           He moves forward,

                                 LYNLEY
                        So don't tell me about who walks and 
                        who doesn't. We make the rules.

           ON Burdette-- rocked.

           He follows Lynley down the hall and down a flight of basement 
           stairs.

           They stop at a door. Lynley puts his ear to the door. We hear 
           the rumble of voices and MUSIC PLAYING.
           He nods at Burdette. Burdette puts his ear to the door. They 
           back off, Lynley squaring off to kick it in,

           But BURDETTE CUTS IN FRONT, KICKS the door off the hinges.

           INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

           As Tubbs, Jimmerson, and Mcline sit around a card table in 
           the aftermath of a poker game.

           Burdette kicks Tubbs off his chair, swings his gun around on 
           Jimmerson.

           Lynley's got his back, his .38 levelled at Mcline.

                                 JIMMERSON
                                 (panic)
                        You got it! You got it!

                                 BURDETTE
                        Donny Miller and Leotis King... start 
                        talking, homes...

                                 JIMMERSON
                                 (melting down)
                        I told them niggas... I told them... 
                        'you know who's game this is?' But 
                        they ain't listen... oh Jesus, sweet 
                        merciful Jesus, you know what they 
                        told me? You know what they told me 
                        officer, when I said that?

                                 BURDETTE
                        What?

           Jimmerson weeps and sniffles, and

           SHOOTS BURDETTE FROM UNDER THE TABLE, bursting his eye socket 
           in a bloom of blood.

           The three bolt through the door--

           Lynley stunned, dropping to his knees--

           Burdette-- legs and feet twitching--

           Lynley cradling his head-- he's choking--

           Lynley turns Burdette's head to the side-- scoops pink fluid 
           from his mouth-- nothing's helping,

                                 LYNLEY
                        I got you... I got you...
           Burdette's body wracked as his lungs fill-- Lynley-- 
           desperate, impotent,

           He touches his partner's face... and knows.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (asking permission)
                        Okay, Billy? Okay?!

           Lynley presses Burdette's windpipe closed. Time stands still.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Okay... okay... it's okay. 

           Burdette's gone.

           Lynley screams. He pounds the floor with his fist, pulls 
           Burdette's backup .25 from the dead man's ankle and

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. NICKERSON GARDENS HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lynley-- running hard-- a glimpse of the killers up ahead,

           He FIRES TWICE-- ricochets chip and bounce back, nearly 
           hitting him --

           The chase extends through a labyrinth of corridors and up 
           stairwells;

           Lynley takes a corner too fast, his feet slide from under him-
           - he goes down hard,

           The killers gain ground,

           On the second floor, they clock a 5 1/2 foot wall below an 
           open window-- an easy vault to freedom.

           They jam their guns into their waistbands-- line up to jump. 

           In the doorway--

           Lynley-- heaving, drenched with sweat-- hand full of gun--

           They all slooowly put their guns on the floor. They assume 
           the position, spread out against the wall.

           Lynley walks up and

           Shoots all three men point-blank in the head.

                                                                 FADE OUT:
           OVER BLACK

           The sound of children's LAUGHTER.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. PARK -- DAY

           Sun blazing through the smog. Mex kids play frisbee on the 
           withered grass.

           A mangy stray intercepts the disc mid-flight. The chase is on-
           - pinchi mayate, dog!-- AS

           GUNSHOTS crack the sky, AND

           REVEAL

           the northern-most Griffith Park edge of Forest Lawn Cemetery. 

           Further back, an Honor Guard fires off another eight-gun 
           salute.

           We see dozens of police vehicles draped with black bunting; 

           At the gravesite, a sea of cops. Black armbands and stony 
           faces.

           On a platform reserved for family and top brass-- MAYOR TOM 
           BRADLEY standing with Jane and her father-- 70, handsome, 
           some steel to him-- BILLY BURDETTE, SR.

           Milling about in the back rows: Vic Franz and Ted Keefer, 
           Sgt. Huber, Lieutenants Beddoes and Murcott.

           CHIEF OF POLICE ED DAVIS leans in to the Mayor, Jane and 
           Billy's dad-- points out some bit of the protocol to them,

           AS six patrol cars creep slowly toward the gravesite, 
           parting the throng of cops. Their doors open.

           OFF a nod from Chief Davis, the SERGEANT AT ARMS reaches 
           into one of the cruisers, picks up the radio.

                                 SERGEANT AT ARMS
                                 (through radio)
                        Seventy-seven-L, badge number 
                        elevenzero-eight... come in... 

           The transmission magnified a hundred times: every cruiser and 
           undercover unit has their radio tuned in and cranked up,
                                 SERGEANT AT ARMS
                                 (through radio)
                        Seventy-seven-L, badge number 
                        elevenzero-eight... come in...

           AS the Black Watch drum muted rolls on their black crepe 
           muffled snares between every transmission,

                                 SERGEANT AT ARMS
                                 (through radio)
                        All units be advised... officer not 
                        responding... this is the final call 
                        for Officer William Grady Burdette, 
                        Jr., badge number eleven- zero- 
                        eight...

           Every hand flies up in a salute,

                                 SERGEANT AT ARMS
                                 (choking up, through 
                                  radio)
                        ... end of watch, brother... gone,
                        but never forgotten.

           The Mayor leans close to Billy's dad, gives his shoulder a 
           squeeze, as

           Six LAPD helicopters pass in a tight cluster overhead, one 
           veering off in the missing-man formation.

           The WHINE OF BAGPIPES.

           ON Lynley-- watching from afar-- in uniform, standing next to 
           a cruiser.

           Lynley's POV: Jane-- face hidden behind massive sunglasses. 
           Her dad-- faltering as she helps him into a folding chair. 
           She feels eyes on her. Catches Lynley's stare. Holds it.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Somewhere inside the Parker Building-- the LAPD's 
           administrative center.

           Lieutenant Rick Beddoes is behind a desk. Murcott and Huber 
           flank him, butts on the window-sills.

           Lynley leans forward in his chair opposite, eyes on the 
           floor.

           Beddoes tosses a two-day old Herald Examiner onto the desk.
           The headline reads: "Southside Leaders Deplore SLA Shootout." 
           Below the fold: a pic of Lynley, captioned: "Medal of Valor 
           for Young Officer?"

                                 MURCOTT
                        I don't know it was you... or 
                        Burdette, thought you were detective 
                        grade, but that's all done now. 
                        You're back in uniform, working A.M. 
                        watch--

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (uncomprehending)
                        -- What? Me and Billy took down
                        those assholes, solved the--

                                 HUBER
                        -- You and Burdette solved shit. 
                        McCline and Tubbs were in Sheriff's 
                        custody the night Miller was killed.

           Lynley shakes his head. Can't believe this. Won't.

                                 MURCOTT
                        The coroner found their release 
                        papers in their fucking pockets, 
                        Deputy Fife.

                                 HUBER
                        You're lucky that nip didn't know 
                        what he was looking at.

                                 BEDDOES
                        We could hand you up for killing the 
                        wrong guys, but we won't.

           Lynley laces his hands to keep them from shaking.

                                 BEDDOES
                                 (softening)
                        Son, here's how you do something like 
                        this. First, you tell your superiors.
                        Then we get the three fucks alone, 
                        and pop them with phone books until 
                        they give it up. None of it comes 
                        within a mile of the criminal justice 
                        system.

                                 MURCOTT
                        This is one fucking epic snafu you 
                        created. And we’ll crucify you if we 
                        see you around the Miller job again.

           Lynley. Drained of color. Nothing making sense.
                                 HUBER 
                        Look at him... he's falling apart.

                                 BEDDOES
                        No, he's not. Lynley... look at me... 
                        that was a righteous shoot... but the 
                        end of the day: you killed three guys 
                        had nothing to do with the Miller one-
                        eight-seven.

           Lynley looks up.

                                 BEDDOES
                        Starting tomorrow, T-O probationers 
                        ... make sure they come out hard-
                        chargers.

                                 MURCOTT
                        Try to do a better job with those 
                        'boots than Burdette did with you.

           INT. LYNLEY'S APT -- NIGHT

           A shitty bachelor pad in Studio City. Lynley. In shock. 
           Staring over his balcony at the blur of the Ventura Freeway.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. THE BURDETTE HOUSE -- EARLIER

           A big wake at the Burdette house. A sedate mob scene. Police 
           vehicles, cops in dress blues and well-dressed civilians.

           Cops erect barricades at Cloverdale Avenue and Sanchez Drive.

           Lynley sits in his Duster. He watches, stone-faced. An animal 
           outside the warm fires of the humans.

           A cop walks up to Lynley's car -- the junker out of place 
           here.

           Lynley holds his badge up. The cop nods and keeps walking.

                                                                  BACK TO:

           INT. LYNLEY'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           ON grey walls, sparsely adorned.

           A Grand Funk Railroad poster. A faded picture of a heavyset 
           woman we assume to be Lynley's mother.

           A few 8x10's of Lynley in the jungles of Vietnam. Younger, 
           wild-eyed and lean, posing with some of his platoon.
           In one of the shots, Lynley leans on the butt of his M-16, 
           his hands clasped under his chin, batting his lashes and 
           making an exaggerated pouty-face.

           Tilting down, we see that his bayonet is lodged in the chest 
           of a dead VC.

           MOVING TO

           EXT. LYNLEY'S BALCONY -- SAME TIME

           Lynley. Where we left him. He hasn't slept. Hard sunlight 
           slams off the sliding glass door of his living room.

           INT. 77TH STREET STATION -- MORNING

           Lynley walks through the entrance foyer of the 77th, past the 
           civilian worker placing portraits of Donny Miller and Billy 
           Burdette, Jr. on the "Honor Wall" of previously slain 
           officers. He turns left and enters the muster room.

           The entire morning watch -- 24 strong -- stands in one long 
           line and applauds loudly in unison.

           Franz and Keefer pat an empty chair between them. Lynley 
           slides in.

           Keefer clasps an arm around Lynley's shoulder.

                                 KEEFER
                        You good? How you doing, killer?

                                 FRANZ
                                 (leaning in)
                        I'm your Rabbi... you're working some 
                        angles without telling me... you see 
                        what happens? We can't help you... 
                        listen to me... we can't help you, 
                        you're out there on your own--

                                 KEEFER
                        -- the fuck were you doing at that 
                        game without telling us?

                                 FRANZ 
                        We're your partners... you got 
                        something... you wanna talk... run 
                        through some things...

           Lynley gives a half-nod.

           OFF Keefer's skeptical look,
                                 FRANZ
                                 (appraisingly)
                        He's good... he's okay...

           AS the roll-call sergeant reads muster:

                                 ROLL-CALL SERGEANT
                        Patty Hearst and some SLA stragglers 
                        are still at large, so stay sharp. 
                        They could be up to anything. On that 
                        count, RHD's running the Miller 
                        investigation out of that unused 
                        conference room down the hall from 
                        the D.B. That room is off limits to 
                        anyone without a key, which means you 
                        don't have a polyester suit and hash 
                        marks, stay the fuck away... okey-
                        doke... we've got three 'boots today. 
                        Crawford goes with Sanchez, McAthie 
                        goes with Lynley, Lutz goes with 
                        Horan. You make sure the natives know 
                        Bwana's back in charge.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. PATROL CAR-- MOVING

           Lynley and MCATHIE-- his new partner, a scuzz-head 'boot-- 
           cruise Watts.

           The LAPD out in force. Pimp rousts; ho rousts; cars full of 
           black citizens proned out on the street.

           White cops give black motorists field sobriety tests -- they 
           make them raise their arms and scratch their armpits like 
           apes.

           McAthie is just as wide-eyed as Lynley was on his first tour.

                                 MCATHIE
                                 (musing)
                        I don't have hate for no one... a 
                        coon's just the same to me as a 
                        normal man...

           Lynley ignores him.

                                 MCATHIE
                        ... would you lookie at this...

           OFF his look: we see Gene the Queen crossing Avalon, 
           stopping traffic with a Diana Ross-style outstretched palm.

           Gene leans into Lynley's driver's side window.
                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Hey, pig... I was sorry to hear about 
                        Billy.

           Lynley nods.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        That wasn't no way right what they 
                        did to my man Leotis, neither. I'm 
                        glad you taxed them fools.

           Lynley leans away from McAthie,

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Gene, sotto voce)
                        You holding?

           A car honks as it passes, a gang of cholos screaming 
           obscenities at Gene.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                                 (to car)
                        Fuck you, you Ricky Ricardo 
                        mothafuckas!
                                 (back to Lynley)
                        Nah... I'm not messing with none of 
                        that shit no more... I'm right now 
                        saving up... maybe get my GED and go 
                        to nursing school.

                                 MCATHIE
                        Uumm... You don't mind my asking: but 
                        are you a dude or a chick?

                                 GENE THE QUEEN 
                        Well... you could suck my dick and 
                        find out...

           Weak laugh from Lynley.

           EXT. BURDETTE HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Lynley's Duster in the driveway.

           INT. BURDETTE LIVING ROOM -- SAME TIME

           Lynley sits on the couch across from Billy Burdette, Sr. 
           Billy's dad-- elegant, proud-- looks weakened from strain. 

           Both men nurse drinks.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        I mark the bottles... my children 
                        know this.
                                 LYNLEY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                                 (beat)
                        It was a fine service.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Yes, sir.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        I don't recall seeing you there.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I was there.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                                 (keeping it together)
                        And when my... when Billy...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Yes. I was there, sir. He wouldn't 
                        have known what...

           Billy's father nods. Takes a sip of his drink.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        You know... I could smell the liquor 
                        on you when you came into my house. 
                        Are you a drunk, officer?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Sometimes, sir.

           Pause.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        1963...I had just opened my third 
                        practice, down on La Brea... thought 
                        it was time-- wife thought it was 
                        time, mind you... buy a place 
                        befitting our new... station. I 
                        wasn't aware we had a station. When I 
                        opened my first office, right down on 
                        Rodeo and La Cienega, I kept three 
                        shifts a week as a pullman porter on 
                        the City of Las Vegas-- left on a 
                        Friday, back Monday morning-- in case 
                        things didn't pan out. I was as 
                        surprised as anyone when all these 
                        bucktoothed negroes started lining up 
                        at my offices. They didn't just come 
                        there to get their teeth fixed. You 
                        know what they wanted, officer?
           Lynley shakes his head.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        They wanted to be taken care of by
                        someone who looked like them, for a 
                        change.

           Lynley nods.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        But you know the saying, 'if you
                        want to make God laugh, tell him
                        your plans?' Two days after we moved 
                        in, the reservoir splits wide open, 
                        floods everything...

           Billy Burdette, Sr. leans forward.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                        ... when that reservoir cracked, the 
                        rest of these bougie fools stood 
                        there and watched... waited... just 
                        knew that God or the white man was 
                        going to pluck them from disaster. 
                        While they were on their knees, Billy 
                        and I were digging a trench... from 
                        nine at night until dawn the next 
                        morning, we gouged a channel on each 
                        side of this house with shovels... 
                        and then with pots, and pans... and 
                        then with our bare hands. You see, 
                        nobody-- not even God-- was going to 
                        tell me what I was allowed to have... 
                        to become... If God wanted everything 
                        I'd worked for... he'd have to take
                        it. 

           The older man rises. Leaves the room. Suddenly turns.

                                 BILLY BURDETTE, SR.
                                 (pointedly)
                        Do you understand what I'm telling 
                        you, officer?

           He leaves. Lynley stares after.

           A door SLAMS. Lynley faces the sound.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (rising)
                        Hello, Jane.

           If she's shocked to see him she doesn't let on.
                                 JANE
                        Why are you here, Lynley?

                                 LYNLEY
                        I didn't, um... have...

                                 JANE
                        What?

           She wants an answer. Willing to wait. A terrible pause.

                                 JANE
                        What?

           Lynley-- not exactly Longfellow on a good day-- struggles.

                                 JANE
                        You wanna hit some golf balls?

           She comes toward him.

                                 JANE
                        Whaddya say? For old time's sake? 
                        Billy's clubs are in his room...

                                 LYNLEY
                        I just thought...

           Getting right into his space,

                                 JANE
                        Maybe you just wanted to fuck your 
                        partner's sister? Be easier now...
                        without big brother watching, right?

                                 LYNLEY
                        No... why are you?--

                                 JANE
                        -- C'mon... you're a cowboy, right? 
                        Take it any way you can get it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        No.

           She presses into him, an ugly caricature of seduction,

                                 JANE
                        This is what you wanted, right?

           Lynley grabs her shoulders-- needs her to know,

                                 LYNLEY
                        What I want? I want to say, fuck you, 
                        Billy, I'm first through the door--
                                 JANE
                        -- And why didn't you?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Because he wanted... he wanted--

                                 JANE
                        -- What? What did he want, Lynley?
                                 (breaking)
                        They had to use... clay... where
                        part of his face... is that what you 
                        think he wanted?

                                 LYNLEY
                        No...

                                 JANE
                        -- Maybe he wanted to be like you?
                        More balls than brains. Billy was 
                        smart... and kind... and something 
                        changed in him when he was around 
                        you.

           Lynley-- can't think of what else to do-- pulls her close. 
           She shoves him away,

                                 JANE
                        Liar!

           She slaps him, hard. Again and again. Lynley takes it.

                                 JANE
                        You told me... you wouldn't let
                        anything happen to him! You goddamned 
                        liar! You promised... me!

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (amidst the barrage)
                        I know.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. THE 77TH PARKING LOT -- DAWN

           A Galaxie 500 unmarked car enters the lot.

           Franz and Keefer get out. Each man hauls an evidence box 
           inside.

           Lynley. In Billy Burdette's Citroen. Watching.

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- LATER

           Lynley dawdles upstairs, near the room the RHD cops are using 
           for the Miller investigation.
           He jiggles the handle. Locked.

           He hears somebody coming-- pulls out his keys, pretends he's 
           just locking up as

           A civilican CLERK, carrying an envelope, walks toward the 
           room.

           Lynley plays it off,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Fucking day...

           He pockets his keys and fake wiggles the knob like he's just 
           locked it.

                                 CLERK
                                 (slight pause)
                        You on the Miller job?

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (improvising)
                        Yeah. They just brought me in. What 
                        have you got?

                                 CLERK
                        Routine infrareds. Useless, prolly.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (casual)
                        I should take a look.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. LYNLEY'S APARTMENT -- LATER

           Lynley's examining the infrared shots under a table lamp, 
           squinting into a magnifying glass.

           Most of the shots reveal blurs, hazy cars and stick figures. 

           He gets to a roll taken the night he and Burdette bugged out 
           of the crazy card game, while they were undercover.

           Aerial shots of: Gene the Queen; Leotis King...

           Lynley smiles when he gets to the pix of him and Burdette in 
           their hustler clothes, hauling it down the street with the 
           rest of the G's and Playas. A lifetime ago.

           He moves on, nothing catching his eye until--

           A shot, buried mid-way through a roll:

           Leotis King and a black man we know.
           Lynley double takes his wall, where he's got an impromptu 
           evidence board going.

           Scan the pix... Patty Hearst ... Willie Wolfe... Donald 
           Cinque Defreeze.

           Back to the infrared... that's him: Cinque.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to himself)
                        Motherfucker.

           Back to the infrared: Leotis handing Cinque a gun.

           A box on the hood of the car next to them. Lynley squints and 
           reads: “M11911.45 cal Colt/Cosmoline."

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- NIGHT

           Franz and Keefer amble toward the locked evidence room. Franz 
           carries a couple of Fat-Burger bags and sucks a cup of soda 
           through a straw.

           Franz nods at the same civilian clerk we saw hand off the 
           infrareds to Lynley.

           Keefer fishes his keys out of his pocket,

                                 CLERK
                        Hang on, got some...

           He grabs an accordion folder, tucks it under Franz's wing.

           The clerk splits... oops, almost forgot--

                                 CLERK
                        --Oh yeah... the other detective has 
                        the infrareds, so ignore the req...

           Keefer pauses at the door--

                                 KEEFER
                        What other detective?

                                 CLERK
                                 (searching)
                        I dunno... big... kinda intense?

           Keefer looks at Franz. Franz sucks the ice in the bottom of 
           his cup.

           EXT. HOUSE ON 54TH STREET -- DAY

           Lynley drives up to the still-smoldering rubble of the SLA 
           safehouse.
           Uniformed cops guard the perimeter; local soul brothers, 
           sipping tallboy cans of malt liquor, scowl at the fuzz.

           Lynley parks Billy's Citroen and gets out. The brothers see 
           him and start making "oink, oink" sounds.

           Some cops wave to Lynley. Lynley walks over to them. He's 
           carrying Burdette's previously seen evidence kit.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (preemptively)
                        Scalp hunting. I took a few in 
                        'Nam... thought I'd try for some 
                        hippie scalps, round out the set. 

           The cops laugh.

                                 BALDING YOUNG COP
                                 (touching his head)
                        You find some, let me know. I'm 
                        losing it on top.

           POP! POP! GUNFIRE erupts and Lynley flinches, going into a 
           crouch.

           The brothers on the corner crack the fuck up, the cops don't 
           even blink.

                                 BALDING YOUNG COP
                        Happens every once in a while... lot 
                        of rounds we haven't been able to 
                        clear...

           Lynley walks into the rubble; nuclear heat and sun.

           He pokes in the ruins -- finds scorched left-wing posters and 
           pamphlets, burned clothes and canned goods.

           Hours pass. The sun dips.

           He kicks through the wreckage and takes the back cement steps 
           down to the house's basement.

           It's a mass of melted pipes and foundation steel.

           But there's something else:

           He shines his light on the twisted metal and sees odd shapes 
           of metal fused to the pipe.

           Getting closer, he makes out

           Scorched barrels, slides, and molten grips of Colt .45s.

           Using his sport coat sleeve like an oven-mitt,
           He leans on the hot pipe and snaps a piece off.

           He brushes off soot,

           And a row of serial numbers stare back at him.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- NIGHT

           Lynley walks through the upstairs hallway.

           The Miller task-force door is open; Lynley pokes his head in 
           and sees the six Homicide detectives making phone calls and 
           digging through file boxes.

           Vic Franz-- on the phone-- double takes Lynley. A be off in a 
           sec-- motion. Lynley mimes-- don't worry about it-- continues 
           down the hall.

           ON Vic Franz. Face says: what the fuck is Lynley doing here?

           INT. SQUADROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lynley-- forced nonchalance-- walking into the RHD squadroom. 
           THREE DETECTIVES lounge at their desks.

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        How's it hanging, killer?

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (faux-cool)
                        A hard yard.
                                 (casual)
                        You got any loose 459's? Say, going 
                        back three or four months?

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                                 (typing)
                        Check the boxes by the water cooler.

           Lynley-- coool-- walks to the back wall, feels eyes on him,

           Time slowed,

           A dozing cop stirs and shoots him with a finger-gun POP,

           Lynley squats and finger-walks through the top box. He reads 
           names on folders;

           We see:

           04. 16. 74. INCIDENT TYPE: 459

           ADDRESS OF OCCURRENCE: B&B Gunshop/79 & Grape.
           A detective COUGHS-- Lynley almost jumps out of his skin. 

           We see:

           Stolen: Army Colt .45's/1 40-unit box.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (in doorway)
                        You don't belong here, Lynley. 

           Lynley tenses. Turns.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (smiling)
                        This room is for lifers, clock-
                        jockeys and paper pushers.

                                 RANDOM DETECTIVE
                                 (to Franz)
                        Fuuuck you.

                                 FRANZ
                        Maybe... you shave your tits.

           Lynley-- using their banter as cover-- snatches a look at the 
           bottom of the report:

           REPORTING OFFICER: DONALD MILLER

           STATUS: UNSOLVED.

                                 FRANZ 
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Whatcha got?

           Lynley casually stuffs the report back in the box.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (arctic kool)
                        Nothin'... figured I might as well 
                        brush up on some 77 incident stats... 
                        have something to tell these 'boots 
                        about the job.

                                 FRANZ
                        Tough break, kid.

           Lynley shrugs, sighs.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Hey... I fucked up, right?

           He leaves.
           INT. LYNLEY'S APARTMENT -- LATER

           Lynley's got some gun sections he copped from the rubble and 
           Burdette's evidence kit spread out on his coffee table.

           Beside them: the previously seen fingerprint cards of Donny 
           Miller and Leotis King.

           Lynley brushes the sections of steel for prints and brings up 
           a series of smudges.

           The sound of a car downstairs at the curb. He stiffens. A 
           DOOR SLAMS.

           Breathless beat. Nothing. Back to work.

           He picks up Donny Miller's card. Squints. Eyes straining. He 
           counts comparison points,

           Lips moving as he counts: 1, 2, 3, 4... 5... 6.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (ecstatic)
                        Donny Miller, you sticky-fingered 
                        motherfucker...

           His doorbell BUZZES.

           EXT. LYNLEY'S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

           Typical Studio City street. Maaaybe we notice the Ford 
           Galaxie 500 parked at the curb.

           INT. LYNLEY'S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

           Lynley opens the door. Jane there.

                                 JANE
                        Hi.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Hi.

           Lynley just stands there. Stunned that she's here.

                                 JANE 
                        I don't mean to intrude...

           Lynley blocks her view into the apartment. Evidence strewn 
           about. The place a low-rent mess. Ashamed maybe.

                                 LYNLEY
                        No, no... I'm working on a case right
                        now... things are kind of everywhere--
                                 JANE
                        -- I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

                                 LYNLEY
                        No. No need.

           She nods.

                                 LYNLEY
                        How'd you find me?

                                 JANE
                        There's only five Lynley's in greater 
                        Los Angeles.
                                 (smiles)
                        You're number five.

           She's gone to all this trouble. Fuck pride. He lets her in.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        Would you like something?

                                 JANE
                        Water. Please.

           He rinses out a jelly jar and fills it from the tap.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        I been using Billy's car... I can 
                        bring it to your place, you want...

           She shakes her head. Not why she came. Her eyes drift to the 
           grisly war photos on the wall.

           Lynley winces.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Oh...those are just...

           He moves, obscuring the pictures with his body.

                                 JANE
                        I had no right to say those things to 
                        you.

                                 LYNLEY
                        No. You were right.
                                 (pause)
                        Billy was good police and he made me 
                        think I was better than what I am.
                                 JANE
                        My brother was pretty smart, Lynley.
                        If he saw something, it's because it 
                        was there. Maybe you're better than 
                        you let yourself be.

           Lynley shakes his head. Can't even meet her eye.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        I know what I am. I'm a tool... like 
                        a... a... fist... so people don't 
                        have to get their hands dirty.

           Jane goes to the table. Evidence laid out everywhere.

                                 JANE
                        So they use you like a beast of the 
                        field, just like they used my 
                        brother. He talked himself into 
                        believing that the police department 
                        was like the rest of the world. Maybe 
                        the game was rigged, but you had a 
                        chance if you played... but the 
                        police department isn't the real 
                        world... is it Lynley? Billy was a 
                        tool... a smiling darkie to help calm 
                        the natives.
                                 (beat)
                        He was better than all of them, and 
                        they treated him like a house-nigger.

           Lynley stands behind her.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (anything to comfort 
                                  her)
                        They were bringing him along... he 
                        was in line for detective... they put 
                        him in plainclothes... like an 
                        audition... I'da been shining his 
                        shield six months from now.

           Jane shakes her head. Knows better.

                                 JANE
                        You should quit.

                                 LYNLEY
                        And do what?

                                 JANE
                        I don't know. Whatever people do. 
                        Fall in love. Get married. Let 
                        somebody show you all that stuff 
                        about you you can't see.
           Lynley is silent.

                                 JANE
                                 (resigned)
                        But you won't.
                                 (a nod at all the 
                                  evidence)
                        You'll keep going.

           Lynley won't answer.

                                 JANE
                        And... and what if the same thing 
                        happens to you?

           She lets her head rest against his shoulder.

                                 JANE
                        You're kind of alone now.

           EXT. PATROL CAR -- DAY

           Lynley and McAthie cruise Watts. Lynley scans the street, 
           looking for something or someone.

           McAthie's still trying-- and failing-- to impress.

                                 MCATHIE
                        I'm just saying: whatever it is, I'll 
                        do it. I'm hip to how it works. I 
                        woulda done the same as you, wasted 
                        those perps... I know we've only been 
                        partnered a couple days, but if the 
                        shit goes down... I'll do it, no 
                        hesitation. We both walk in, we both 
                        walk out. No disrespect to your 
                        partner, but me...? I woulda--

                                 LYNLEY
                        --You ever been primary?

                                 MCATHIE
                        No, sir, but--

                                 LYNLEY
                        Then shut up.

           Pause.

                                 MCATHIE
                        I just want you to know you can count 
                        on me.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Jesus. You wanna be useful?
                                 MCATHIE
                        Absolutely.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Then get on the horn and get me an 
                        LKA on a Gene the Queen McCoover--

           McAthie's on it, the Motorola already in his hand,

                                 MCATHIE 
                        12A48, over.

                                 DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        Go ahead 12A48, over...

                                 MCATHIE
                        Request a ten-twenty-nine on a Gene 
                        McQueen--

                                 LYNLEY
                        Gene the Queen, dipshit--

                                 MCATHIE
                        That's Gene the Queen--

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (rolls his eyes)
                        McCoover...

           Lynley sees something up ahead, he brodies the car at the 
           intersection and gets out.

           McAthies's POV, as Lynley walks over to a METER MAID writing 
           a ticket.

                                 DISPATCH (O.S.)
                        Hold for LKA, for a Eugene Demond 
                        McCoover...

           ON Lynley and the meter maid.

                                 METER MAID
                        She’s drying out at Queen of 
                        Angels...

           ON McAthie,

                                 MCATHIE
                                 (scribbling)
                        Copy that... over.

           He hooks the receiver back into its cradle.

           A quick glance at Lynley-- still grilling the meter maid-- as 
           McAthie furtively grabs the radio, again.
                                 MCATHIE
                                 (urgent)
                        12A48 over...

           ON Lynley and the meter maid,

                                 METER MAID
                        Why? You got a red-hot thing for 
                        Karen? I thought killing jigs was 
                        your bag.

           He laughs, walks back to the patrol car.

           As he gets in,

                                 MCATHIE
                                 (furtively, into 
                                  radio)
                        ... make sure he gets it... over.
                                 (to Lynley)
                        Last known on a Gene McCoover... AKA 
                        Gene the Queen. We rollin'?

           Lynley wordlessly tears the page from McAthie's pad, pockets 
           it, and pulls back into traffic.

           EXT. THE 77TH PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

           Lynley. In the Citroen. Exhausted, his head drifts back 
           against the headrest.

           There's a RAP on the windshield--

                                 FRANZ
                        Come on, killer. I'll buy you 
                        breakfast.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. DINER -- LATER

           Lynley and Franz sit in a booth at Piper's Coffee Shop at 
           Beverly and Western. Franz has just snarfed a big plate of 
           steak and eggs and lights a cigarette. Lynley has only coffee 
           in front of him.

                                 FRANZ
                        You want in so bad you sit out in the 
                        lot every morning like fucking Stage 
                        Door Johnny scrounging autographs...

           Big drag, jets of smoke steam from his nostrils.
                                 FRANZ
                        ... So: you and Billy go all Warren 
                        Commission, follow your half-assed
                        leads into darktown-- with no backup-- 
                        and instead of finding out who iced 
                        that numb-nuts Miller, you wind up 
                        with your dick in one hand and your 
                        partner's brains in the other. You 
                        killed the three jigs who killed your 
                        partner, but who certifiably didn't
                        kill Miller. 'Course, they wouldn't a 
                        killed Billy, you hadn't a been there 
                        in the first place. You closed a case 
                        that never existed before you walked 
                        in the room, and got nowheresville on 
                        the one you was assigned.

           Lynley twirls his coffee cup.

                                 LYNLEY
                        It won't happen like that again.

                                 FRANZ
                        Fuckin'-A right.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Where's Keefer?

                                 FRANZ
                        Don't you fucking worry about where. 
                        You know where he is? He's working 
                        cases.
                                 (disgusted beat)
                        Whaddya got?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Nothing.

           Franz scopes him. Hard.

                                 FRANZ 
                        Bullshit, nothing. C'mon... c'mon...

           Lynley shakes his head. Then,

                                 LYNLEY
                        I mean... Billy thought maybe there 
                        was some other angle...

                                 FRANZ
                        Like what?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Like maybe Miller had some score set 
                        up with the SLA...
           Franz puts his cigarette out in a puddle of yolk.

                                 FRANZ
                        Give it a name... dope?

           Lynley shrugs.

                                 FRANZ
                        Guns?

           Lynley's in-fucking-scrutable. Franz leans back in the booth.

                                 FRANZ
                        That game you busted at Nickerson 
                        Gardens... those coons give up 
                        anything before you wasted 'em?

           Lynley shakes his head.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (spitballing)
                        I could buy it. Miller's out 
                        canvassing... scrounging pussy...
                        skims, whatever he can... we're 
                        pretty sure Leotis King was in his 
                        pocket, so he's got a grapevine to 
                        the neighborhood... King comes across 
                        the SLA, figures he and Miller can 
                        grift them... maybe roust them for 
                        cash in exchange for keeping quiet... 
                        maybe Miller gets them to do some of 
                        his heavy lifting...

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (faux clueless)
                        How do you mean?

                                 FRANZ
                        You hear things. A month ago, there 
                        was some rumblings in darktown that a 
                        crew went in strong, took down a 
                        floating game. Almost thirty Gs goes 
                        DB Cooper... Maybe Miller gives 
                        Cinque and company an address, 
                        they're already loaded for bear... be 
                        like having your own private army.

                                 LYNLEY
                        But what would they get out of it?

                                 FRANZ
                        Maybe he gives 'em a slice... maybe 
                        he made sure their safe house stays 
                        off the canvassing sheets, they do 
                        the thing... I don't know. 
                                         (MORE)
                                         FRANZ (CONT'D)
                        Miller's dead... King's dead... but 
                        every tree's got branches: just gotta 
                        find the right nigger swinging from 
                        one.
                                 (casual)
                        Did you talk to Karen Cordova?

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (blankly)
                        Who?

                                 FRANZ
                        Meter maid Miller was tight with... 
                        she's sleeping it off at Queen of 
                        Angel's.

           Lynley shrugs: Never heard of her.

           Both men poker face it for a beat.

           Franz takes some money out of his pocket.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (almost to himself)
                        A hump like Donny couldn't spend 
                        thirty Gs in a month... so we find 
                        the money... maybe that leads us to 
                        the rest of those SLA fucks... maybe 
                        even that cunt Patty.
                                 (out of his reverie)
                        Jesus, killer. Billy's better police 
                        dead than you are alive...

           He pays the bill.

                                 FRANZ
                        Let's go, you got work to do.

           Lynley blinks.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I'm in?

           Franz rises.

                                 FRANZ
                        You're in.

           EXT. ROAD NEAR GRIFFITH PARK -- LATER

           Lynley follows Franz's Galaxie 500 up the road that separates 
           the newer L.A. Police Academy buildings from the old, disused 
           gymnasium.
           EXT. POLICE ACADEMY -- MOMENTS LATER

           The men crunch the gravel on the side-path up to the old 
           gymnasium.

           INT. GYM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lynley follows Franz into the gym and the locker room and 
           back to the showers.

           ON a man with his back to us, hunched over something in the 
           middle of the abandoned showers.

           Turning now, and it's Keefer, a smile on his face and brass 
           knucks in his fist.

           To his right-- a small folding table with: a thermos, a 
           couple of styrofoam cups, sugar, Carnation Instant Creamer,

           And a phone book. A beavertail sap. A stack of neatly folded 
           towels.

           Handcuffed to a folding chair in front of Keefer,

           Gene the Queen. Battered and bloody. Ripped stocking cap 
           pulled tight against his cornrows.

           Blond wig sprawled in a tangle over the drain a few feet 
           away.

           The walls are streaked with blood. A pile of crimson towels, 
           soaked through, lie at his feet.

           Keefer stretches, yawns.

                                 KEEFER
                                 (squeezing his lower 
                                  back)
                        It's spasm-ing all through here... 
                        young man's work...

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (dubious)
                        You like him for Miller?

           Gene raises his head, through bloodied eyes,

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Lynley? Lynley?

                                 KEEFER
                        We got a tip this fruit was one of 
                        King's LKA's... we also know he was 
                        at that first card game you boys 
                        rousted... there's your opportunity.
                                 LYNLEY
                        And motive?

                                 FRANZ
                        You need us to hold it for you when 
                        you pee, killer

           Lynley sets his jaw, grabs the phone book and hits Gene in 
           the ribs. Gene dribbles blood.

           Keefer grabs himself a cup of coffee.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Lynley...

           Gene catches his eye. A pleading look. Franz and Keefer watch 
           intently.

           Lynley tosses the phone-book. Rolls up his sleeves. Crashes a 
           backhand into Gene's face.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Why'd you do it?

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I didn't kill that man...

           Lynley hits him again.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I liked Leotis...

                                 LYNLEY
                        You like Miller, too?

                                 FRANZ
                        Ask him about the money.

           Gene sobs. His eye is swelling shut. His Tina Turner-style 
           gown splattered.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I'm just out trickin', I'm not no--

                                 LYNLEY
                        --Gene, so fuckin' help me... you 
                        killed King and Miller, helped 
                        yourself to the money--

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I got nothing. I told you about the 
                        nursing school... and how I--
                                 LYNLEY
                        --they fucked you out of your cut, so 
                        you--

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        No.

           Lynley hits him again.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (unimpressed)
                        Didn't figure you for such a light 
                        touch, killer.

           Franz goes to the table, picks up a beavertail sap.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Gene)
                        Gimme something, you faggot.

           On the word 'something'-- we hear, and Gene hears it, too-- 
           a plea.

           Lynley knows-- and now Gene knows it, too: if Franz and 
           Keefer take over,

           They will kill him.

           Gene and Lynley lock eyes-- a flash of understanding passes 
           in an instant.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        You want the usual? Or you want me to 
                        suck your dick this time?

           Lynley cracks Gene in the face.

           Franz and Keefer share a look: now this is more like it.

           Franz puts down the sap.

           Gene spits blood, laughs.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Aww... but I know it won't be half as 
                        good as Billy used to do you...

           Keefer starts singing the theme song to The Prime of Miss 
           Jean Brodie.

                                 KEEFER
                        Jean, Jean, roses are red, all the 
                        leaves have gone green...

           Lynley kicks Gene in the chest, sends the chair flying,
                                 KEEFER
                                 (swelling with the 
                                  action)
                        ... And the clouds are so low you can 
                        touch them, and so come out to the 
                        meadow....

           Lynley jerks the chair upright again.

                                 FRANZ
                        Give us that alibi again, faggot.

                                 KEEFER
                                 (to Lynley)
                        The coroner made Miller dead 12 hours 
                        when the wino found him. M-E gives us 
                        a 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. time of death. 
                        Sambo here's got no alibi up to then.

           Lynley's winded from the exertion, his hands on his knees. 

           Franz goes behind Gene with a rolled towel, wraps it around 
           his windpipe. Gene chokes, his eyelids fluttering.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (casual)
                        He didn't do it.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (pause)
                        Meaning what?

           Gene blacks out.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Meaning, Billy and I braced this 
                        faggot around 11... 11:30 that night 
                        on Avalon...

                                 KEEFER
                                 (softly)
                        Bullshit.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (softly)
                        Bullshit.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You guys not read our reports? It's 
                        fuckin' noted.
                                 (just a bit of 
                                  urgency)
                        He's a streetwalker... how's he gonna 
                        cross the Harbor Freeway... 
                                         (MORE)
                                         LYNLEY (CONT'D)
                        all the way to Newton and back, at 
                        the same time I'm putting boots to 
                        him?

                                 KEEFER
                                 (with regret)
                        Come on, he's good for it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Until Murcott or a review board scope 
                        the reports and the math don't work.

           Lynley walks over, smacks Gene hard. It works: Gene flutters, 
           comes to, sucks huge swallows of air.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (getting out his 
                                  handcuff keys)
                        The luck of the Irish. You Irish, 
                        Gene?

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. CITROEN-- MOVING -- NIGHT

           Lynley and Gene drive deserted Westlake Park. Gene's wig is 
           crooked, his face a pulp.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Buy a nigga a drink, will you, 
                        Lynley? Come on, just a short dog.

           Lynley checks his rear-view.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        I'm not saying be seen with me...

           Lynley hangs an abrupt U-turn and pulls up in front of a 
           cheezy liquor store.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. CITROEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           ON Gene. Some G's walk by the car. From habit, Gene starts to 
           clock them, then touches his face and turns away in shame.

           He angles the rear-view to get a look at himself, as

           Lynley climbs in and passes him a bottle of T-Bird.

           Lynley moves the mirror back before Gene gets a look.

           Gene's hands are shaking bad, so
           Lynley opens the bottle for him. Gene puts it to his lips and 
           moans as the alcohol burns his open wounds.

           Lynley winces.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Why they think I offed that pig?

                                 LYNLEY
                        You knew King, King knew Miller... 
                        anybody tied to those two is gonna 
                        get the same until they get what they 
                        want.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        They ain't gonna find that money.

           Beat.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What?

           Gene swigs T-Bird.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Their game that got took. Leotis told 
                        me--

                                 LYNLEY
                        -- It was their fucking game got
                        took down? Franz and Keefer? Don't 
                        make no fucking mistake, Gene.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        That's what Leotis said some pig told 
                        him...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Miller? The pig's name Miller?

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        He ain't say.

           Lynley takes it all in.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                                 (facing him)
                        You level with me, Lynley?

           Lynley nods.

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        How I...?
                                 (touches his face)
                        They do me bad?
           Lynley takes the bottle, swallows a pull.

           He tugs an end of Gene's wig, leveling it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You remember that spade chick on that 
                        show? Played a nurse or--

                                 GENE THE QUEEN
                        Julia?
                                 (dubious)
                        Really? I look like Julia?

                                 LYNLEY
                        You kinda do...

           Beat.

                        Bitch wishes she had my ass.

           INT. QUEEN OF ANGELS -- NIGHT

           The women's dipso ward at Queen of Angels Hospital.

           Lynley drags Karen Cordova down the hall by her elbow. She's 
           ashen. Still coming down off whatever put her here.

                                 LYNLEY
                        One foot in front of the other, 
                        Karen...

           A DOCTOR catches up to him-- thrusting release papers--

                                 DOCTOR
                        -- Excuse me... the detective I spoke 
                        to on the phone told me he was on his 
                        way over an hour ago--

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (not slowing down)
                        Which detective?

                                 DOCTOR
                                 (checks his clipboard)
                        A Detective Franz--

           Lynley double-times it-- Karen barely upright--

                                 LYNLEY 
                        Yeah, I'm his partner...
                                 DOCTOR
                        Yes, well, we still need a 
                        signature...

           Lynley slows just enough to sign the sheet. Takes off.

                                 DOCTOR
                                 (to Lynley's back)
                        Without protocol, all you have is 
                        anarchy, Detective...
                                 (studies the sheet)
                        Keefer.

           INT. CITROEN -- NIGHT

           Harbor Freeway. Karen Cordova in a fetal position in the 
           passenger seat. In and out of it.

                                 KAREN
                        I'm sick...

                                 LYNLEY
                        We all got problems. What did Donny 
                        do with the money from the game?

           Karen moans.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Answer me.

                                 KAREN
                        All I did was run those plates for 
                        him...

           The car lurches a bit as he downshifts. She looks green.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Don't you puke in this car.

                                 KAREN
                        Then learn how to drive a stick.
                                 (beat)
                        You got anything, help me get
                        straight, Lynley? I'm not picky... 
                        Mad-Dog... Boone's... Cepacol... I 
                        was drinking Aqua Velva there at the 
                        end...

                                 LYNLEY
                        Play hurt, Karen.

           He checks his mirrors. Wary as hell.
                                 LYNLEY
                        They killed your friend because he
                        took down their game, you know that, 
                        right?

                                 KAREN
                        Let it go, man.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        I let it go, that means Billy got 
                        killed for nothing.

           Lynley jerks the wheel hard, skidding to a stop right 
           outside the 77th precinct house.

           He reaches across her and opens the door.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Get the fuck out.

           She clutches her hospital gown around her. Doesn't move.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You're not gonna talk to me, you can 
                        talk to Franz and Keefer, and I 
                        promise they will run a nigger train 
                        on you and turn you out, and make 
                        what they did to Donny look like he 
                        passed in his sleep.

                                 KAREN
                                 (clinging to any 
                                  thread)
                        The SLA killed Donny.

           He starts to shove her out. She jerks the door closed.

                                 KAREN
                        Figueroa and Florence.

           EXT. APT. BUILDING OFF FIGUEROA -- LATER

           Lynley hustles Karen up a flight of stairs. She rummages 
           through her purse for a key ring. Lynley draws his .38, 
           shoves her aside.

           INT. APT. -- MOMENTS LATER

           The door creaks open. Lynley covers the place with his gun. 
           It's clear.

           A drab studio apartment. A console TV and a formica mini-bar. 
           A bed juts from the wall. He drags Karen into the room.
                                 LYNLEY
                        This Donny’s fuck pad?

           She nods.

                                 KAREN
                        If he was on duty and I needed to dry 
                        out, sometimes he'd let me crash... 
                        He wouldn't even make me ball him.

                                 LYNLEY
                        He was a charmer that way. Where'd he 
                        keep his shit?

           She motions to a makeshift coffee table. It's a foot-locker 
           topped with a slab of formica.

           He slides the formica off.

                                 KAREN
                        Donny always said people never look 
                        for things right in front of their 
                        face.

           Lynley squats. The thing's padlocked.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I don't suppose Donny felt the same 
                        way about keys.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. FUCK PAD -- DAWN

           Lynley, covered in sweat, in his T-shirt. He's taken all the 
           backing screws from the footlocker with a kitchen knife and 
           disassembled the frame.

           He wrenches the top. A black duffel bag stares back at him.

           He looks over at Karen. Passed out on the floor. He picks her 
           up and carries her to the bathroom.

           He sets her down in the tub, shuts the door.

           He goes back to the footlocker and opens the bag. Crumpled 
           stacks of bills. Don't need to count it to know.

           He closes the bag and hoists it out.

           Something METAL clangs against the floor.

           An 8MM film canister.
           INT. 77TH PRECINCT MUSTER ROOM -- MORNING

           Lynley in uniform, bug-eyed from sleep deprivation and 
           adrenaline. He side-eyes the cops trickling into roll call.

           The MORNING ROLL-CALL SERGEANT stands behind the lectern, 
           bangs his gavel for silence.

                                 ROLL-CALL SERGEANT

           The room erupts hoots and catcalls. Lynley. Stricken.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. CORNER OF 78TH AND LEW DILLON -- DAY

           Lynley leaves some tire behind as he stops his black and 
           white hard at the corner and gets out.

           Kids jumping up and down and trying to peek into the 
           dumpster; an ice-cream truck sells popsicles.

           Uniformed and plainclothes cops joke and jive.

           Closer still, but we NEVER SEE what's in the dumpster.

                                 KEEFER (O.C.)
                        He really does look like a chick,
                        until you get him in direct sunlight 
                        like this.

           Sergeant Ted Keefer, over Lynley's shoulder. Munching a Good 
           Humor bar.

                                 KEEFER
                        Any leads, killer? Banging Billy's 
                        sister enhancing your detecting 
                        skills?

           Lynley, sickened, turns his back on the scene.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Where's Franz?

           Keefer ogles the contents of the dumpster.
                                 KEEFER
                        Be in later...
                                 (slight smile)
                        ... he had a rough night last night.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (loaded)
                        How about you? You have a rough 
                        night, Keefer?

                                 KEEFER
                        I leave the legwork to Franz.

           Beat.

                                 KEEFER
                        Found something interesting in your 
                        reports, killer.

           Lynley stiffens.

                                 KEEFER
                        The date of the Miller homicide? 
                        Remember how you said you braced The 
                        Queen that night? No mention of that.

           A beat.

                                 LYNLEY
                        That's because I lied.

           Everything different now. Both men know it.

                                 KEEFER
                        You lie to your partners... people 
                        get hurt without that trust, Lynley.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I never lied to my partner. Only to 
                        you fucks.

           Lynley puts his hat on.

                                 KEEFER 
                        Don't make a fucking mistake, Lynley.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Besides... if I didn't lie to you...
                                 (conspiratorial)
                        ... how else was I gonna steal your 
                        money?

           He walks away.
           EXT. PUSSYCAT THEATRE -- DAY

           A porno theater off Western Avenue. "Flesh Gordon" on the 
           marquee.

           INT. PUSSYCAT THEATRE -- SAME TIME

           Lynley-- startling the SEEDY GUY behind the counter.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (flashing his badge)
                        You got something'll play this?

           Hands him the 8MM reel.

                                 SEEDY GUY
                        Yeah.

           The guy leads him into the projection room. Cramped. Rickety 
           projectors-- mostly 16mm but a few 8mm as well.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           A BLANK WALL

           A grainy image flickers. We see:

           CINQUE DEFREEZE. He's forcing A BLACK WOMAN with her back to 
           the camera to give him head, while

           LEOTIS KING fucks her from behind, yanking a choke chain 
           around her throat.

           Lynley winces. The scene changes.

           We see DONNY MILLER, naked except for sweatsocks, pounding 
           away on top of the same woman. LEOTIS KING holds her hands 
           down. She's struggling. Donny elbows her in the face.

           ON Lynley. Disgust turning to outright horror as Donny's bulk 
           shifts enough for us to see the bruised, terrified look on 

           TAMMY'S face. Her eyes sear into the lens, right through us.

           He staggers back. Sickened to the bottom of his soul.

                                 SEEDY GUY
                        Wow. I never seen this one, before. 
                        She's good.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Get out of here before I kill you.
           The film end slaps against the projector as the reel ends.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. CENTURY CITY OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

           Lynley, focused on the entryway to a building. Waiting.

           Professionals spilling out for lunch.

           ON Jane. With a small group of suits.

                                   LYNLEY
                        Hey...

           The group-- mostly men-- puzzled by the uniformed cop in 
           their midst.

                                 JANE
                                 (off guard)
                        Lynley...

           She motions to the group-- gimme a sec.

                                 LYNLEY
                        What are you doing right now?

                                 JANE
                        I'm at wor--

                                 LYNLEY 
                        Yeah? Well... let's get out of 
                        here... Tonight.

                                 JANE
                        Slow down... you're not making--

                                 LYNLEY
                        -- I do this one last thing and it's 
                        over... Fuck all this. Just go. You 
                        and me.

           Jane. Stunned.

                                 JANE
                        Lynley...

           Lynley catches a MALE COLLEAGUE of Jane's looking at him.

                                 LYNLEY 
                                 (territorial paranoia)
                        What?

           Jane recoils.
                                 LYNLEY
                        But we're gonna go, we gotta go 
                        tonight. I'm dead I stay here.

                                 JANE
                        What have you done, Lynley?

                                 LYNLEY
                        We took it to them, me and Billy... 
                        got some payback...

                                 JANE
                        Billy's dead, Lynley.

           He grabs her arm.

                                 LYNLEY
                        We can start over. Like you said you 
                        wanted...

           Looks from passersby. She blanches. He lets her go.

                                 JANE
                        I don't need to start over, Lynley. I 
                        have a life here. And a family.

           Or did: the unspoken sentiment.

                                 LYNLEY
                        But you said... we could be like 
                        normal people. Fall in love... get 
                        married... remember you said that? 
                        That could be us.

           From down the sidewalk, a low-key jab at his watch,

                                 COLLEAGUE
                                 (delicately)
                        Jane?

           Her other world calling.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You said that... remember? We could 
                        be those people.

           Something firm and sad moves across her face.

                                 JANE
                        No, Chuck...

           She turns to leave.
                                 JANE
                        ... I was talking about you and 
                        someone else.

           EXT. THE 77TH PRECINCT -- DAY

           Shift change. Cruisers glide in and out of the lot. The sun 
           dips.

           Lynley's POV: Vic Franz trudges up the stairs.

           Lynley, in the Citroen. Duffel of money next to him.

           He gets out.

           INT. 77TH PRECINCT -- HALLWAY-- MOMENTS LATER

           Lynley-- hard, silent stride. A predator. Franz down the 
           hallway. Oblivious.

           Franz scratches his ass, ambles into the Men's Room outside 
           the RHD Task Force office.

           Lynley following. Suddenly Lt. Murcott and Sgt. Huber exiting 
           an office-- blocking his path.

                                 MURCOTT
                        You're five hours AWOL, son.

                                 HUBER
                        And you look like shit would look, if 
                        shit took a shit.

                                 BEDDOES
                        We're thinking you're a little ahead 
                        of us. We need to know what you know.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Sir, all I got was a tip on Gene 
                        McCoover. I shared it with Sergeant 
                        Franz and Sergeant Keefer, and I 
                        interceded on Mr. McCoover's behalf 
                        with an honest eyeball alibi, and Mr. 
                        McCoover's dead now.

           Lynley goes to move past them. Nothing gonna stop him.

                                 BEDDOES
                        You're lying. You were made at Queen 
                        of Angels, and the night-watch clerk 
                        says he handed off two folders of 
                        infrareds to you.

           Lynley sighs. They've got him and he knows it.
                                 LYNLEY
                        I'll come find you in a few...

           A nod to the bathroom.

                                 LYNLEY
                        ... Nature calls.

           INT. MEN'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lynley enters. Eyes scan the bottom of the stalls. Nothing.

           He walks-- quietly-- toward the line of urinals around the 
           corner,

           SLAMMED hard into the tile wall, Franz's forearm around his 
           throat--

                                 FRANZ
                        The fuck you following me for?

           Lynley pushes Franz off,

                                 LYNLEY
                        Why'd you kill Gene?

           Both men-- squared off, primed, won't take much--

                                 FRANZ
                                 (rolling his eyes)
                        He was a seven-foot butch queen.  
                        Tell me he didn't owe rent money, 
                        booze money and dope money to half 
                        the Mau-Maus in this coal chute.  
                        Tell me his life expectancy wasn't 
                        fucking next week. You had your 
                        choice: a nigger drag queen or your 
                        partners. You made the wrong choice, 
                        and you won't do it again.

           Aware of their voices in the space-- hoarse shouts.

                                 LYNLEY
                        And Billy? What choice did he have?

                                 FRANZ
                        Who told you humps you were cops? You 
                        had one assignment, you decided to go 
                        off and do this other thing.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You didn't give a shit about the 
                        SLA... you had us out looking for 
                        your money... you got Billy killed.
           Franz backs up. Hands on his hips. Gun an easy reach.

                                 FRANZ
                        You saying I killed a brother 
                        officer... for money, Lynley?

           Hard stares.

                                 FRANZ
                        Say it.

           Lynley says nothing. Franz stands down, goes to the sink.

                                 FRANZ
                                 (washing his hands)
                        I’m sixteen years on and I've never 
                        killed in the line of duty.  You've 
                        killed five jigs since the first of 
                        the month and Uncle Vic let you walk 
                        on all of it.
                                 (pause)
                        You didn’t exist until I found you.

           Franz grabs a wad of towels and dries.

                                 FRANZ
                        And that money? It's in my hands by 
                        morning. You wise up, maybe we give 
                        you a taste.

                                 LYNLEY
                        So I'm you in twenty years.

                                 FRANZ
                        You're me if you're lucky, killer.

           Lynley SMASHES Franz's face into the mirror. Franz's hand 
           goes for his gun-- Lynley snatches it-- barrel against 
           Franz's throat--

           Shoving Franz's bloodied face into the shattered mirror--

                                 LYNLEY 
                        You see that? You're Donny Miller. 
                        They'll find you bare-assed in an 
                        alley with your shield pinned through 
                        your nose.

           Franz struggles-- Lynley slams his face into the mirror 
           again.

           EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL L.A. -- DUSK

           Montage of looong, steel Detroit whales cruising South 
           Broadway.
           Pink and white and stucco houses rebel against decay, lawns 
           tended with dignity, cars buffed in driveways.

           Brothers stroll the ave with fiiine sisters, Afros tight and 
           clothes right. Nose to nose at the tables outside Papa Shad's 
           Lake Trout, splitting some fries and shakes.

           And the 77th. Block long and squat and imposing. Maybe even 
           regal. Flags manning the crenelated front-- Old Glory and the 
           Brown Bear curling in the breeze.

           All the old haunts:

           Jordan Davis Elementary. School out and nothing doing. 

           The Rumpus Room. Neon buzzing and fog on the windows. 

           The Cozy Nook. Glow from inside warm and inviting.

           Hang here. Slow the roll, and we're

           INT. THE COZY NOOK -- SAME TIME

           Lynley, at the bar. He scopes the place:

           A few lone drinkers in booths.

           The band's gear covered with tablecloths on the dark stage.

           A BARTENDER we've never seen before slides Lynley a drink. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Looks like you could use this. 

           Lynley nods. He sure as hell could. He downs the drink.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Beat night, huh?

           The bartender shrugs. Lynley leaves.

           EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

           Residential street. Edge of the ghetto, neighborhood holding 
           on, but just barely.

           The Citroen rumbles up to a house we know.

           The headlights flash off.

           Lynley. In Billy's car.

                                                                   CUT TO:
           EXT. HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Knocking on the door to the house. Waiting.

           JUMP CUT and

           Lynley on a couch. Faded lace curtains behind him. Cup of 
           tea balanced on his lap.

           Tammy-- bruises fading-- across from him.

           Radio playing Marley's I Shot the Sheriff in the background.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (re: the song)
                        This guy covering Clapton?

                                 TAMMY
                        Who's Clapton?

                                 LYNLEY
                        The guy who wrote this.

                                 TAMMY
                        Bob Marley wrote this.

           Lynley shrugs-- never heard of him. He sips his tea.

                                 LYNLEY 
                        Billy woulda kicked my ass for 
                        telling you this, but he stone dug 
                        you.

           Tammy smiles. Not news to her but nice to hear it.

                                 TAMMY
                        He was a cool brother. For a pig. 

           Little smile. Not a dig.

           Tammy nods at the DUFFEL at Lynley's feet.

                                 TAMMY
                        Where you going?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Got it narrowed down to east, north 
                        or south.

           Lame-o joke but she smiles. Lynley looks at his watch.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Where's your brother?

           She shrugs. Beats me. Awkward pause.
                                 LYNLEY
                        You know what?
                                 (a nod to the radio)
                        This one's better than the Clapton 
                        one...

                                 TAMMY
                                 (gentle rib)
                        You dig the lyrics?

                                 LYNLEY
                        Best part.

           Pause. Marley preaches and the Wailers wail.

                                 TAMMY 
                        So you ain't gonna be police no more? 
                        Decided to do something honorable 
                        with your life?

           He half-smiles.

                                 TAMMY
                        You got people’s anywhere, Lynley?

           Lynley shakes his head.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Long as it's not L.A., I'm not much 
                        picky about where I land.

                                 TAMMY
                        I heard that.
                                 (beat)
                        But wherever you go, Lynley, for 
                        everybody's sake: make sure they got, 
                        like... three niggas there... tops.

           He laughs.

                                 LYNLEY
                        And where would you go?

                                 TAMMY 
                        Me? I always wanted to check out 
                        Frisco. They got a good music school 
                        up there... nice clubs.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You should... that'd be groovy.

                                 TAMMY
                        I know! I could write some of my own 
                        stuff... get a hot little group 
                        together... 
                                         (MORE)
                                         TAMMY (CONT'D)
                        ...get me some Pips of my own, show 
                        Gladys and them something...

           Trails off.

           The SOUND of the door opening. Lynley looks up.

                                 RUDY
                        What you doing here?

           Rudy-- the bartender from the Cozy Nook-- enters. Not used 
           to pigs in his home.

                                 TAMMY
                        He said he wanted to say goodbye.

                                 RUDY 
                        Phone broke?

                                 TAMMY
                        Don't be like that, Rudy.

                                 RUDY
                        You said goodbye... so goodbye.

           Tammy locks eyes with her brother: be nice.

                                 LYNLEY
                        No... I'm going...
                                 (hates to be a bother)
                        ... if I could just grab a top off... 
                        for the road?

           Rudy sighs.

                                 RUDY
                                 (to Tammy)
                        You mind getting me some Quik?

           She nods. Goes into the kitchen.

           The big man sits in a Barco-Lounger opposite Lynley. Just 
           stares.

                                 RUDY
                                 (calling out)
                        Strawberry!

           Lynley edges forward.

                                 LYNLEY
                        For what it's worth: I woulda killed 
                        Donny Miller too.

           The truth cold and plain and right there.
                                 LYNLEY
                        And Billy woulda helped, man, he'd 
                        known what Miller did to your 
                        sister... you gotta know that.

           The SOUND of a spoon clinking in the kitchen.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (not much time)
                        All the department cared about was 
                        protecting their own... you got 
                        yourself some justice and you pawned 
                        it off on the SLA pretty good, man... 
                        but if I figured it out, somebody 
                        else will, too... there's better cops 
                        than me and they won't stop.

                                 RUDY
                                 (level)
                        They can come with it.

                                 LYNLEY
                        You don't get it. I burned the movie, 
                        but I don't know if there's another 
                        copy.

           Rudy's eyes narrow. The truth of it hits him.

                                 LYNLEY
                        And they tie you to the movie? 
                        They're not gonna give a shit about 
                        what happened to Tammy. You're a cop 
                        killer and you're going down and 
                        they'll pass the flick around on 
                        poker night while your sister's on 
                        the streets. Rudy... listen to me:
                                 (urgent)
                        You gotta fucking get outta here.

           Tammy. Back now with a Strawberry Quik for her brother.

           She sits next to Lynley on the couch. Tops off his tea.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Was telling Rudy about how you wanted 
                        to check out Frisco.
                                 (to Rudy)
                        They got bars in Frisco, Rudy. 

           Tammy raises an eyebrow.

                                 TAMMY
                        And what'd he say?

           Rudy rises. A signal Lynley should be going.
                                 RUDY
                        I told officer Lynley that we ain't 
                        got time to dream about what could 
                        be... this...

           With a nod to their surroundings, to South Central,

                                 RUDY
                        ... is what is.

           Tammy shares a look with Lynley.

           He rises. Took a shot. Done all he can do.

                                 LYNLEY
                        I guess... I gotta go.

           Goes to the door.

                                 LYNLEY
                        Look out for each other.

                                 RUDY
                        We will.

                                 LYNLEY
                                 (to Tammy)
                        Keep singing, yeah?

           She nods.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. CITROEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           The key turning in the ignition. Clutch. Gas. First gear.

                                                                   CUT TO:

           INT. TAMMY AND RUDY'S -- SAME TIME

           Tammy. Sad and quiet and picking up the cups and saucers. A 
           look at Rudy on the couch. Head in his hands. Hates to see 
           him this way.

           Lowers her eyes-- going wide now as she sees--

                                                                   CUT TO:

           EXT. CITROEN -- SAME TIME

           Lynley pulling out,

                                 TAMMY
                        Officer Lynley!
           She's holding the duffel bag. On the porch.

                                 TAMMY
                        Officer Lynley! You forgot your bag!

           Stepping out onto the sidewalk, under the streetlight.

           Lynley stops. Watches her for half a beat in his side view.

           She catches his eye in the mirror, knows he sees her,

                                 TAMMY
                        You forgot your...

           He revs the engine. Hand on the shifter.

           ON Lynley.

           Slow, deep smile as he pops the clutch, the beautiful brown 
           girl with the duffel bag getting smaller,

           The Citroen rumbling down 79th st., left on South Vermont,

           FROM ABOVE,

           We see him slide into traffic, joining a stream of lights 
           heading away from South Central, away from the 77th.

                                                                 FADE OUT:

           TITLE CARDS OVER BLACK

           Fifteen months later, Patty Hearst and what was left of the 
           SLA were arrested in San Francisco.

           To this day, the only unsolved cop killing in LAPD history is 
           the murder of Donny Miller.

           Scrounging motherfucker.
