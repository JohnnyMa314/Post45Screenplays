                                   JANE GOT A GUN

                                         by
                                   Brian Duffield
           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           Long grass.

           The slow clip-clop of a horse.

           Speckles of bloody rain as it passes. Like a storm cloud. 

           EXT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           A small, typical prairie home. Wooden. A porch. A chair. All 
           handmade. It sits at the bottom of a mountain, ringed in on 
           both sides by a wooden fence. A horse tied to it.

           JANE, pretty and tired, sits in the long grass in front of 
           her home with her youngest daughter KATE (6) on her lap. She 
           nuzzles the back of her neck, tickling the child, who can’t 
           stop laughing.

           Jane’s elder daughter ALMA (11) plays with their muscular 
           bulldog PIG. 

           Pig starts barking at the horizon. 

           The horse coming towards them. Clip-clop. 

           The dog hops the gate and goes after it. The girls watch.

           Jane scoops Kate up and sets her on the ground. Stands.

           Sees the horse coming.

           Sees the mound of a man on the horse’s back.

           And takes off running towards it.

           EXT. THE GATE - CONTINUOUS

           Jane guides the horse through their wooden gate.

           With great difficulty, she pulls the large man from the 
           horse’s back.

           Kate begins to cry.

           It takes all of her strength to drag her husband into the 
           house. 

           BLACK
                                            I

                                        8 Bullets.
           Tink.

           Tink.

           Tink.

           INT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           A metal pan. Tink. A FOURTH bloody bullet gets dropped in. 

           And there are more to go.

           The large man lays on his stomach as Jane practically has to 
           scoop the bullets out of potholes in his fat back.

           There are explosions of bruises around each hole.

           Eight holes, if you’re counting.

           Alma sits by the bed with her mother, holding a tin cup of 
           steaming water, her hands wrapped in a towel.

           Jane presses a knife into one of the holes. Digging. She 
           nods, and Alma pours some water into the wound.

           It fills, and overflows. Alma wipes it dry. 

           The bullet comes up with the knife. With her fingers, Jane 
           pulls it out and Tink. 

           Kate sits on her tiny bed, watching. Distraught.

           The home is one room. Two beds. A tiny stove. And that’s 
           about it. 

           Jane sticks the knife into another hole and the big man 
           whimpers like a fucking baby.

           Kate starts to cry again.

                                 JANE
                             (quietly)
                        Unless those tears can heal bullet 
                        wounds like a saint I suggest you 
                        lock ‘em up. 

           Kate clenches her jaw shut. Smart enough to obey. 

           The bullet’s in much too deep. She digs harder.

           The big man yelps in his fever. 
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Easy, Ham.

           She takes a break. Puts her hands on his sweat soaked head. 
           Thin hair. He’s pushing fifty. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Alma, bring some cold water. 

           Alma sets the hot water down and scoops a tin cup from a 
           bucket of water. Brings it to her mother.

           Jane sees her hands are trembling. Smiles at her daughter.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Brave girl. 

           Alma gives as much of a smile as she can. 

           Jane pours the cold water over his head. Massages it into his 
           scalp. 

                                 ALMA
                        Is he gonna die?

           Jane strokes her husband’s hair. He wheezes like an accordion 
           that’s been shot with eight bullets.

                                 JANE
                        That poker ready?

           They all look over to the stove. A fire poker is stuck in the 
           flames. 

                                 ALMA
                             (mouth dry)
                        I think so. 

                                 JANE
                        If you girls wanna run outside with 
                        Pig, that’d be fine. 

           The girls look at each other. 

                                 KATE
                        If he dies will he go to heaven or 
                        hell?

                                 JANE
                        Well. He ain’t dead yet.

           Tink. 

           Tink. 
           Tink.

           EXT. THE HOME - THE NEXT MORNING

           Jane steps out of the house. Looks like shit.

           Her dress is covered in almost-black stains. Hasn’t noticed 
           yet. 

           She breathes in the morning. Looks over on the porch.

           The girls are curled up together on a rocking chair, a 
           blanket covering them, sound asleep. 

           Pig the dog is at their feet. He looks up at Jane. 

           EXT. THE FENCE - MORNING

           Jane inspects her husband’s horse. A huge, muscular horse. 
           The kind of horse needed to transport a fat man. 

           Notices a cut on the horse. A bullet graze. 

           She pats its neck and gives it a carrot. 

           INT. THE HOME - MORNING

           He continues to sound like he should be dead. But he isn’t.

           Jane sits on the floor beside their bed. Holds the bowl of 
           bullets. Lets them roll around. 

           His hand is draped over the side of the bed.

           His finger moves. Then again. Then again.

           Jane notices. Looks at his hand. His finger moves. Like it 
           weighs a ton.

           She looks at him.

           He has an eye open. It’s almost completely filled with blood.

                                 JANE
                        Ham?

           She leans close to him. Holds water to his lips. It doesn’t 
           take.

           She pours a trickle in to wet his tongue. 
           His lips move. Like he’s trying to say something.

           She leans close to him. Ear to mouth.

           And he whispers something almost completely incomprehensible.

           But she understands. 

           Her eyes widen. 

           She looks at him.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                             (almost a whisper)
                        They comin’?

           He can’t answer.

           It’s impossible to tell if she’s about to start weeping or 
           start stabbing him. 

           And in the end, she does neither.

           She makes a sack out of cloth and fills it with some of the 
           girl’s clothes. Fills a large flask with water. Puts some 
           cornbread together. 

           EXT. THE HOME - MORNING

           She wakes the girls on the rocking chair gently. Urgent but 
           calm.

                                 JANE
                        Girls.

           They come to. Slowly at first, but fast as the memories hit.

                                 KATE
                        Did he die?

                                 JANE
                        No. Your Pa sounds like the devil 
                        moved into his throat, but he ain’t 
                        dead yet. 

                                 KATE
                        Can we see him?

           Jane presses her lips.
                                 JANE
                        I need you to do me a favor. I need 
                        you to ride off to Sally’s and stay 
                        with her until I come get you. 
                        Alma, do you remember the way?

                                 ALMA
                        Um-

                                 JANE
                        You ride straight thatterway until 
                        you hit that little road, remember? 
                        And then you turn left... show me 
                        your lefts, girls.

           Both girls raise their left hands. Jane smiles.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Perfect. You go left on the road 
                        and you’ll see her cabin bout five 
                        miles down. Remember it?

                                 ALMA
                        Why do we have to go?

           Jane forces a smile.

                                 JANE
                        Cuz I need you to. Badly. As a 
                        favor to your Pa and me. 

                                 KATE
                        But is he gonna die?

                                 ALMA
                        What if we get lost?

                                 JANE
                        You won’t get lost long as you 
                        listen to me, and you’re much too 
                        smart to forget what I said, right?

                                 ALMA
                        Yes’m. 

           Kate starts to cry. Again.

                                 KATE
                        But-is-he-gon’-die!

           Jane cups Kate’s chubby wet cheeks in her hands lovingly.
                                 JANE
                        Katie, I love you to pieces, but I 
                        swear sometimes you can be 
                        blubbering fool. 

           INT. THE HOME - MORNING

           Jane watches as her daughters kiss their father goodbye.

           EXT. THE FENCE - MORNING

           The girls are on their father’s horse. Jane hands the sack up 
           to Katie, who grips it in her tiny hands. A small doll is 
           stuffed in the front of her dress safely. 

                                 JANE
                        You hold onto this tight. Tight!

           She holds her arms to her chest like a big hug. Kate smiles 
           and obeys, gripping the sack to her tightly. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Good girl. Show me your lefts.

           They do and it’s true. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t stop for nothing. Soon as 
                        your Pa’s better we’ll come fetch 
                        you.

           Leans up to Alma. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        And you tell Sally she mustn’t send 
                        no doctor. One’s already coming and 
                        he’s gonna fix your Pa up real 
                        quick. 

           She smiles at her girls again. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        My Pa died with one bullet right 
                        away, and yours is still breathing 
                        with eight. 

           Jane fixes some stray strands in her hair. Making herself 
           more presentable. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Now git on. I’ll fetch ya in a 
                        couple days. 
           She slaps the horse and it giddyups. Pig follows them for a 
           while.

           She watches them go.

           And go. 

           And go.

           And when they are far enough away, she begins to sob. 

           INT. THE HOME - MORNING

           She lifts a floor board where TWO ROLLS OF MONEY sit. She 
           takes them both.

           Pig stands at the edge of his master’s bed. He will not move.

           Roots through his things. His blood drenched shirt and vest. 
           His pants. His hat. Casts them aside.

           His pistol belt. His pistol. Opens the chamber. Empty.

           She finds bullets and fills the gun. 

           She changes out of her blood stained dress into a fresh one.

           Looks at him.

           His eye is open. She continues to change.

                                 JANE
                        Bill Hammond, eight bullets in and 
                        you’re still a horny idiot. 

           He has no retort.

           She takes his pistol belt. Puts it on over her dress.

           She looks fucking ridiculous. And she knows it. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        It goes without saying that if the 
                        bullets don’t kill you, and the 
                        shit-show you somehow brought on 
                        yourself don’t kill you-

           She holsters the pistol. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna kill you. 

           She kneels at his bed. Pours water to his lips. It takes.
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        But I reckon you may just be 
                        immortal. 

           It’s almost as if he laughs. 

           She kisses his head and drags herself away from him, as he 
           lays there alone, wheezing and full of holes. 

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           Jane gallops into frame atop her horse. She heads off to the 
           left.

           Stops short. Grimaces. Left is a bad idea. 

           Turns and gallops off to the right.

           Stops short. Groans painfully.

                                 JANE
                             (under her breath)
                        fuck

           And turns again and blasts to the left, galloping as fast as 
           she can.

           WIDE

           Jane and her horse a tiny spec in open America. 

           The horse never slows.

           EXT. THE FROST RESIDENCE - DAY

           A tiny cabin sits several hundred yards away. There are a 
           couple trees here, a stark difference to the long grass plain 
           of Jane’s house. 

           The horse and Jane tread quietly, slowly to the place. 

           Jane looks as if she may turn back at any second. 

           But instead, she dismounts. Takes off the gun belt and leaves 
           it on the horse. Leaves the gun. 

                                 JANE
                        Stay.

           The horse obeys. 
           Jane walks towards the house and when-

                                 VOICE
                        Hi.

           She turns back and sees a LITTLE BOY of maybe four sitting 
           against the tree, twirling a stick. 

           It takes Jane a second, looking at the little boy, before she 
           can speak.

                                 JANE
                        Hello. 

           They say nothing more to each other for a beat. Jane kneels 
           to the boy, a safe distance. Takes him in.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Is your Pa Dan Frost? 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Who’s asking?

           Jane turns and looks at the cabin door. 

           A COWBOY stands with a RIFLE POINTED STRAIGHT AT HER. Not 
           with an intention to kill. But with an intention to convey 
           the message that he’s not here to fuck around. 

                                 JANE
                        I am. 

           The cowboy steps forward and lowers the gun. 

           He’s a handsome man, probably her age. Longer blonde hair and 
           a beard. 

           And he’s shocked to see Jane. 

                                 DAN
                        Jane. Been a while. 

           Jane shrugs. 

                                 JANE
                        I need words, Dan. 

           Dan can’t help but laugh.

                                 DAN
                        Girl, ain’t that the truth. 
           EXT. STABLE - DAY

           Dan sets a bucket of water in front of Jane’s horse. 

           Jane leans her head against the body of Dan’s white horse 
           ALABASTER.

           Jane’s eyes are closed as her head lifts and falls with his 
           breathing. 

                                 DAN
                        Eight?

                                 JANE
                        Unless there are more I couldn’t 
                        find. Which is entirely possible. 

                                 DAN
                        And he’s still alive?

                                 JANE
                        He’s a very big man.

           She moves from the horse. Sees the little boy watching them 
           sketpically, still twirling that stick.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        He yours?

                                 DAN
                        No, Jane, I stole ‘im. 

                                 JANE
                        What’s his name?

           Dan considers this hesitantly. Then, to his boy:

                                 DAN
                        Go play inside. 

           The little boy doesn’t move.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, ‘fore I use that twig on your 
                        backside.

           The boy moves quick. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        His mother’s dead. Got sick a few 
                        years back in the winter. 
                                 JANE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 DAN
                        I didn’t tell you for your 
                        sympathy, I told you cuz I know it 
                        was the next thing you was gonna 
                        ask.

                                 JANE
                        Well, you were wrong.

                                 DAN
                        Wouldn’t be the first time. 

                                 JANE
                        The next thing I was gonna ask is 
                        for help.

           Dan leans back and laughs to himself.

                                 DAN
                        First words, then help. I ain’t no 
                        doctor.

                                 JANE
                             (incredulous)
                        I don’t need no doctor. I pulled 
                        eight bullets and then burned the 
                        holes clean on a bucking three 
                        hundred pound man! Doctors need me 
                        more than vice versa, Dan Frost. 

           Dan chuckles, starts walking away with the empty water 
           bucket.

                                 DAN
                        They need you like a gun needs a 
                        drink a’water. You want your fat 
                        man to live? Then you need a 
                        doctor. 

                                 JANE
                        I don’t need no doctor, I need a 
                        gunslinger. 

           Dan stops. Looks back at her. 

                                 DAN
                        Please tell me I misheard.

           She doesn’t answer.
                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        The fuck he do?

                                 JANE
                        I don’t know. But it was bad enough 
                        that he got shot to hell and back. 
                        I imagine he put down every poor 
                        bastard that owned those bullets.

                                 DAN
                        You imagine that why?

                                 JANE
                        You aim to kill someone, you don’t 
                        let their horse take their living 
                        body all the way home from God-
                        knows-where.

                                 DAN
                        So if he laid ‘em all down why do 
                        you need a gunslinger?

           Jane looks at Dan like he’s an idiot. 

                                 JANE
                        I don’t reckon he laid all the gang 
                        down. He’s hard to kill but he 
                        ain’t no great shot. 

                                 DAN
                        That’s it?

                                 JANE
                        That.
                             (beat)
                        And he told me they were comin’. 

                                 DAN
                        He did? The not-dead-fat-man-with-
                        eight-burned-out-holes told you The 
                        Bishop Boys was comin’?

           Jane doesn’t answer.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        He could’ve meant Jesus Christ 
                        himself was on his merry way to 
                        trade him off to Lucifer for all 
                        you kno-

                                 JANE
                        I need help and if you won’t give 
                        it to me then I need to go and find 
                        someone who will.
           Dan laughs again. 

                                 DAN
                        Hammond have a bounty?

           She doesn’t answer. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        You go into town and you blab and 
                        say you’re Fat Bill Hammond’s wife, 
                        and you need a gunslinger because 
                        The Bishop Boys are comin’ after 
                        him, you know what’ll happen?

                                 JANE
                        The gunslinger’ll take my money and 
                        then shoot him to collect the 
                        bounty?

                                 DAN
                        No, you’ll got laughed at and then 
                        they’ll take your money and shoot 
                        him to collect the bounty. 

           He walks towards her.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        If I were you, I’d go home, sling 
                        that fat sack of shit on your horse 
                        and take him into town yourself. 
                        They’ll hang him quick, the gang’ll 
                        be sated and you’ll be alive. 
                        Anything else you choose to do is 
                        fucking ignorant.

           He spits. Like it’s a punctuation.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        And no, you do not have my help, 
                        because I am not fucking ignorant.  

           He turns to leave. Turns back fast.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        And maybe you have forgotten this 
                        key fact in the light of your fat 
                        sack of shit husband being eight 
                        bullet holes lighter lately or 
                        maybe in the fact that it has been 
                        years since you or I saw each other 
                        last, but I strongly dislike you 
                        and your company and your fat sack 
                        of shit husband.  
           Jane starts walking to her horse. No time for this shit.

                                 JANE
                        I thank you for the hospitality you 
                        showed my horse and granting me the 
                        words I asked for. 

                                 DAN
                        My pleasure, darling.

                                 JANE
                        As for whether I am forgetful, I am 
                        not in the slightest, but I am 
                        desperate and frightened, though I 
                        realize my calm demeanor may not 
                        portray those facts. 

                                 DAN
                        The desperate I got. The frightened 
                        you hid well.

           She mounts her horse. 

                                 JANE
                        Your boy looks like the best parts 
                        of you. 

                                 DAN
                             (hesitantly curious)
                        You got kids?

                                 JANE
                        Two girls. Sent ‘em off to Sally’s.

                                 DAN
                        That old spinster still kicking?

                                 JANE
                        And hard, last I heard. 

                                 DAN
                        Damn. 

           She begins her trot. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Jane.

           She looks back.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not worth your life. 
                                 JANE
                        My life’s worth ain’t your concern 
                        anymore, and hasn’t been for years. 

           She nods her goodbye and rides off. 

           The Gunslinger Dan Frost watches her go. 

           EXT. PRAIRIE - DAY

           Jane and her horse gallop through the fields. Hard and fast 
           and true and-

           EXT. LITTLE WOOD - DAY

           Jane walks through the dusty and depressing town of LITTLE 
           WOOD. 

           A town made of blood and splinters. The only way to survive 
           it is by drinking through it. 

           A couple buildings on each side. People milling about. A few 
           horses. 

           The gun belt is around her waist. No way to hide it, and no 
           way she’s going through here without it. 

           She stands out like a sore thumb wearing a gun belt. 

           She feels eyes on her. She keeps her head high and straight 
           and walks calmly, much more calmly than she wishes she could.  

           A WHORE passes by. Ugly teeth and big tits. Jane stops her 
           politely. 

                                 JANE
                        Excuse me, ma’am, but where could I 
                        find myself some-

                                 WHORE
                        I don’t fuck women. 

           And the whore walks.

           Jane swallows fast. Takes it in stride. Skips beside the 
           whore.

                                 JANE
                        Coincidentally, neither do I, but 
                        I’m looking to fuck some men with 
                        my gun, if you get me, and need the 
                        proper tools. 
           The Whore looks Jane up and down. Humored.

                                 WHORE
                        You’re a pretty one.

                                 JANE
                        I’m a pretty married one. 

                                 WHORE
                             (laughs)
                        Sweetheart, everyone’s married. 
                             (waves her hand)
                        Go to Bucks. He’ll sort you. 

           Jane nods her thanks.

                                 JANE
                        Obliged. 

           She heads off to BUCKS. Designated by the sign that says 
           BUCKS. She keeps her head high and straight and-

           That’s when TWO LARGE HANDS grab her and toss her-

           INT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

           Jane hits the ground hard.

           She flips on her back faster then you’d expect and pulls her 
           gun out-

           Points it up at a MAN. 

           An ugly son of a bitch. His head twitches involuntarily. 
           Nerve damage from a chunk of his neck missing where a bullet 
           slipped through. There are scars on his face in unflattering 
           places. 

           FITCHUM.

           And he has his gun pointed at her face. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        How bout you scoot on back there?

                                 JANE
                        You’d shoot a woman in a-

                                 FITCHUM
                        Do I look like I’d have a problem 
                        shooting you? 

           The answer is FUCK NO. Head twitch. 
           Jane begins scooting towards the back of the alley. Tries to 
           keep her gun on him. 

           When he talks, it’s in a sing-song kind of way. Like it’s 
           impossible for him to keep his voice monotone. 

                                 FITCHUM (CONT’D)
                        How is it that no one in this town 
                        knows where Ham lives?

                                 JANE
                        Who?

                                 FITCHUM
                        You’d think just one drunk sumbitch 
                        would know where he lives. But 
                        nope. Not a one. 

           She stops scooting. The main street a good space away now. 
           She holds the gun with two hands. He holds his with one. 

           She sweats despite herself.

                                 JANE
                        Listen, sir, I don’t know wh-

                                 FITCHUM
                        I was with him when we got you 
                        back, Jane Hammond. You can cut 
                        that shit promptly. 

           And this is more than enough to make Jane cut that shit 
           promptly.

                                 JANE
                        I ain’t seen Ham in four weeks. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        You always come into town wearing a 
                        gun?

                                 JANE
                        It’s a rough town and I’m generally 
                        opposed to getting raped. 

           Fitchum laughs. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        Where you live, girl?

           Jane tries to regain her breath. 

                                 JANE
                        Why you looking for him?
                                 FITCHUM
                        Let’s say I have something he 
                        needs.

                                 JANE
                        And what’s that?

                                 FITCHUM
                        A bullet from my fucking gun.

           He laughs again. It sounds like a cat having sex. 

                                 JANE
                        Honestly, sir, that’s not the 
                        incentive I would need to tell you 
                        where my husband is. If I knew. 
                        Which I don’t. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        Ya know, lady, I could believe you. 
                        I could. I would not be remotely 
                        surprised if he was dead in some 
                        riverbank with a vulture picking at 
                        his eyes. But I’d like to be sure 
                        that he’s not at your house or in 
                        your whereabouts. And if you take 
                        me there, and he ain’t there, I 
                        give you my word, I probably ain’t 
                        gon’ kill ya.

           Jane can’t help but laugh at this tremendous deal.

                                 JANE
                        I’m not taking you to my house.

                                 FITCHUM
                        Cuz he’s there?

           Head twitch. We hear his neck pop. 

                                 JANE
                        Cuz like I said prior, I’m 
                        generally opposed to rape, most of 
                        all in my own home.

           Fitchum laughs. Like he thinks women who are opposed to 
           getting raped are funny because they are delusional. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        You even know how to use that gun?

           The answer is probably not. Jane’s answer is: 
                                 JANE
                        How bout you put your mouth on it 
                        and we’ll find out. 

           He pulls a knife from his belt. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        How bout I cut your tits off?

           He absolutely will. And Jane knows it. Her arms instinctively 
           get tighter to her chest.

                                 JANE
                        No, thank you. 

           He laughs again.

                                 FITCHUM
                        This goes two ways. You stand up 
                        and take me home, or I slice you up 
                        until you beg me to come back to 
                        your home. Both ways end with me in 
                        your home.

           And in the brief silence, we HEAR A GUN COCK-

           Fitchum swings a SECOND PISTOL towards the street-

           Where a COWBOY stands holding a pistol at him. 

                                 FITCHUM (CONT’D)
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 VOICE
                        Up, Jane. 

           Jane, pointing the gun at Fitchum, rises to her feet. 

           The cowboy advances. 

           DAN FROST.

           He never takes his eyes or gun off Fitchum.

                                 DAN
                        Ya alright?

                                 JANE
                        He threatened to cut my tits off!

           Dan looks at Fitchum in shock.
                                 DAN
                        What’s wrong with you? You don’t 
                        take a knife to tits, you sick 
                        fucker. 

                                 JANE
                        Especially my tits.

                                 DAN
                        Especially her tits. I think she’s 
                        a self-centered bitch most days but 
                        even I can’t argue that she’s got a 
                        chest on her. 

           They close in on Fitchum, who looks like a cornered dog. But 
           a rabid dog nonetheless. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        I ain’t alone-

                                 DAN
                        Yeah y’are, I watched you go in and 
                        I waited to see if anyone even 
                        noticed and the answer, my sick-
                        fucker-friend, was no. 

                                 JANE
                        What did Ham do?

           Fitchum’s eyes dart to Jane, but only briefly. He’s much more 
           concerned with Dan. 

           Head Twitch. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        He killed four of us. 

                                 JANE
                        Why would he do that?

                                 FITCHUM
                        Maybe you should go home and ask 
                        him. 

                                 JANE
                        You think he’s dumb enough to go 
                        home?

           Fitchum’s eyes dart to her again. He shrugs.

                                 FITCHUM
                        Yeah, I think he’s dumb enough! He 
                        shot four of us!
           Head twitch.

                                 FITCHUM (CONT’D)
                        What’s your stake in this, cowboy?

                                 DAN
                        I’m not sure yet. But I know I 
                        don’t want her to die in an alley 
                        way like a used up whore. 

                                 JANE
                        Thanks Dan .

                                 DAN
                        Shut up Jane.

                                 FITCHUM
                        We’ll split with ya.

                                 DAN
                        How’re you gonna get the bounty on 
                        Hammond without getting hung 
                        yourself?

                                 FITCHUM
                        We got a kid. He ain’t done as much 
                        as shot a bird. 
                             (twitch)
                        You help us find him, we cut you 
                        in. 

           Dan is quiet. Then:

                                 DAN
                        How much?

                                 FITCHUM
                        Three.

                                 DAN
                        Three?

                                 JANE
                        Three?!

           Dan is quiet. Jane tries to not look as panicked as she is.

           Dan spits, like it’s a punctuation.

                                 DAN
                        Ah. I can’t. Damn. 

           Head twitch. Neck pop. Fitchum laughs skittishly. 
                                 FITCHUM
                        Bishop’s gonna get him.

                                 DAN
                        I’ve no doubt he’ll try. 

                                 FITCHUM
                        And after he gets ‘em, he’ll kill 
                        you. And her. And their wee gir-

           BAM!

           Jane BLOWS A CHUNK OF FITCHUM’S FOREHEAD CLEAN OFF.

           Fitchum DROPS.

           Dan STOMPS ON ONE OF FITCHUM’S GUN-GRIPPED HANDS.

           Fitchum’s nerves spasm and he FIRES BOTH OF HIS GUNS. BAM! 
           BAM! BAM!

           Jane leaps into the air as his stray gun flops as it fires. 

           And then, at last, it stops.

           Jane and Dan stand there, motionless, for a still, quiet 
           moment.

                                 DAN
                        YOU STUPID GIRL!

           Dan grabs Fitchum by the collar and DRAGS him to the back of 
           the alley.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!

           Jane just stands there, holding her gun. 

           Sees the chunk of head on the ground, and the bits lodged in 
           the wooden wall. 

           She looks at Dan.

                                 JANE
                        I thought I would feel sad-

                                 DAN
                             (growls)
                        Great. Good for fuckin’ you. 

           She thinks about it. Can’t really figure it out. 

           Dan props Fitchum’s body against a wall.
                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Ya know his stray shots coulda 
                        killed both of us?

                                 JANE
                        But they didn’t. 

           Jane walks towards him.

                                 DAN
                        People in this town heard shots, 
                        Jane. You can bet your ass there’s 
                        a group of people at the edge of 
                        that alley waiting to see what 
                        comes out. And if they see a man 
                        with no fucking head, they’ll hang 
                        you. 

           He looks at her. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Dirty up your knees.

                                 JANE
                        What?

                                 DAN
                        Just do it!

           She gets on her knees. Scruffs them up. 

           Dan undoes his belt and zip.

                                 JANE
                        What are you doing?!

           He reaches to her dress and PULLS DOWN HER CLEAVAGE.

           She gasps. Swats him away. He grabs her hands. Hard.

                                 DAN
                        You listen to me. 

           She looks him up and down. And obeys. She fixes her cleavage 
           low. 

           She nods to Fitchum.

                                 JANE
                        Put your hat on him.

                                 DAN
                        What?
                                 JANE
                        Put your hat on him, Dan.

           He sighs. Knows she’s right. Takes it off. Sets it on what’s 
           left of Fitchum’s head. Covers the wound completely.

                                 DAN
                        I like this hat. 

           EXT. LITTLE WOOD - CONTINUOUS

           A group of patrons stand by the alley way. Some have their 
           hands on their holstered guns and-

           They hear laughter.

           And out stumbles Dan and Jane. Dan, his pants low on his 
           waist. Jane, her knees dirty and her cleavage low. 

           Dan’s flask is in one hand, his gun in his other. 

           They laugh hysterically, apparently drunk as skunks.

           The group begins to disperse, disappointed.

           As they keep their act up-

                                 JANE
                        I need to go to Bucks.

                                 DAN
                        Why?

                                 JANE
                        I got a shopping list. 

           Dan laughs riotously, and stumbles. She helps him up. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You’re good at pretending to be 
                        drunk, with whores.

                                 DAN
                        Well I been drunk with you before, 
                        haven’t I?

           She shoots him a fuck you look. He smirks at her. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re welcome, by the way.

           Jane leans an appreciative shoulder into him as they stumble 
           towards Bucks. 
           Outside the store, is a billboard where the posters of WANTED 
           MEN are plastered. 

           Ham is there. So are others, faces that will be familiar in 
           time.

           Most curious, the largest WANTED poster has NO FACE on it. It 
           offers $5,000 for the delivery of JOHN BISHOP. Dead or Alive. 

           Jane stops and stares at the poster. 

                                 JANE
                        Where’s his face?

                                 DAN
                        If John Bishop introduces himself 
                        to you, he’s introducing yourself 
                        to your end. Ain’t your fat man 
                        told you that?

                                 JANE
                        He don’t talk much. 

           And she walks into the store. 

           INT. BUCKS - DAY

           BUCK, an older gentleman who’s probably a grand pervert, 
           stares at the list in his hand. It’s long. 

           He looks up at Dan, hatless and dirty and no longer 
           pretending to be drunk, and Jane, cleavage out, hair a mess 
           and knees brown. 

                                 BUCK
                        This here’s a long list.

           Jane pulls out a roll of dollars.

                                 JANE
                        This here’s my answer to that. 

           Buck and Dan look at her. Buck reaches for the money and Dan 
           stays his hand.

                                 DAN
                        How bout we get everything first.

           Buck stares Dan down, and relents.

           Goes to fill the list when-
                                 JANE
                        Also, I’m gonna need some pants. 

           Buck and Dan slowly look at her like she’s fucking lost her 
           mind. 
                                            II

                                     Fortification. 
           INT. SALOON - NIGHT

           Years ago. 

           Dan Frost, a mess of a human being, is half asleep by a shot 
           glass when a MAN enters frame.

                                 MAN
                        Dan Frost?

           Dan looks up without moving his head.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        May I?

           The Man sits. Handsome. Spectacled. A nervous gentleman.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        My name is Colin Oaks and I was 
                        hoping to speak with you regarding 
                        an opportunity for employment that 
                        would not necessarily have to 
                        hinder your lack of sobriety. 

           Dan does not move his head from the table.

                                 COLIN
                        I represent a gentleman and his 
                        organization that are fans of your 
                        work.
                             (quieter)
                        With a gun.

           Dan, still not moving his head, draws lightning quick and 
           points his gun at Colin’s head. Colin pushes up his glasses 
           nervously. No one in the saloon gives a fuck. 

                                 DAN
                        This gun?

                                 COLIN
                        I believe the arms in general. 

                                 DAN
                        Who sent you?

                                 COLIN
                        John Bishop sent me.

           Dan moves his head slowly from the table. Rolls a hand 
           through his hair.

           Slacks the gun. 
           As Colin talks, Dan surveys the bar a little more closely.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        John Bishop is looking at... 
                        expanding his options in his 
                        occupational capacity and believes 
                        you and your skills would make a 
                        fine addition to his team. His 
                        offer is an even share of the 
                        profits and the camaraderie and 
                        protection of a fine group of men.

                                 DAN
                        These men?

           Dan swings his gunned hand through the bar. No one is paying 
           attention to them, it would seem.

                                 COLIN
                        Truthfully, some. 

           Dan takes another swig from his empty shot glass.

           Colin reaches over and refills the shot glass from a pocket 
           flask. Dan salutes. 

                                 DAN
                        Colin, right?

                                 COLIN
                        Correct.

                                 DAN
                        Tell me. Does John Bishop still 
                        have an inordinately large man by 
                        the name of Bill Hammond in his 
                        company of merry men?

                                 COLIN
                        I’m not sure. It’s entirely-

                                 DAN
                        You relay the following to John 
                        Bishop. He can have me if he wants 
                        me, but my terms are that Bill 
                        Hammond must die. Don’t much care 
                        if it’s my bullet or not.

           Colin is forced to suppress a smile.

                                 COLIN
                        Who’s this Bill Hammond to you?

           Dan laughs.
                                 DAN
                        How much liquor you got?

                                 COLIN
                        Well, we are in a saloon. 

           Then, Colin does something strange.

           He lays his hand on Dan’s gun and calmly lowers it to the 
           table. Dan doesn’t resist. The gun is still pointed at Colin, 
           after all. He leaves his hand there.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        John Bishop is not a man used to 
                        hearing terms and conditions to 
                        getting what he wants. He’s a man 
                        whose used to getting what he 
                        wants. 

                                 DAN
                        You mistake me for a man that gives 
                        a shit. 
                             (drinks)
                        Tell me, my bespectacled friend, 
                        where is the famous John Bishop if 
                        he wants my services so badly?

           Colin smiles. Removes his hand from the gun and stands up. 

                                 COLIN
                        I’ll pass on your message, but I’d 
                        wager you will be declined. 

           Dan shrugs as Colin leaves the saloon.

           And then, one by one, spaced apart by a few seconds each, 
           other patrons file out. 

           Dan watches them go. Suspicious. He struggles to stand and 
           stumbles out of the bar as-

           INT. THE HOME - EVENING

           Now. 

           Jane bursts into her home and sees her husband almost exactly 
           where she left him and in almost exactly the same condition.

           Pig has not moved. 

           She exhales and rushes to his bedside. Props his head on her 
           lap and begins pouring water into his mouth, onto his scalp.
           EXT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Dan Frost ties Alabaster beside Jane’s horse at the gate.

           Looks at her tiny home, the mountain behind it. 

           And it hurts. 

           INT. THE HOME - EVENING

           Jane is washing the bullet holes in Ham’s back. They are 
           scarlet and blistered and look like hell. 

                                 JANE
                        Were you pals with that feller with 
                        the neck scar? 

           Ham doesn’t answer. Obviously. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to add worry to your 
                        mind, but I hope his death is not 
                        something you will cry over. 

           She looks up and sees Dan standing in the door frame. He’s 
           looking at Ham, his exposed back.

           Pig growls threateningly. Dan pays him no heed.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Hush up, Piglet!

           Pig obeys. Dan takes a step forward. Stares at Ham. 

                                 DAN
                        Shit.

                                 JANE
                        Yep.

                                 DAN
                        That there’s eight bullets.

                                 JANE
                        Yep.

           Dan takes a step in. The spurs of his boots jangle. He 
           doesn’t take his eyes off of Ham.

                                 DAN
                        He’s fatter than I recall.
                                 JANE
                        Age has not been kind to his 
                        figure, no.

                                 DAN
                        Nor have you.

                                 JANE
                        Evidently. 

           Ham groans in his sleep. Jane soothes him. Dan watches.

           Jane reaches into her dress and tosses Dan the second roll of 
           dollars. It lands well short of him and rolls uselessly. He 
           stares at it.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        That fair?

                                 DAN
                        Jane.

                                 JANE
                        What?

           He sighs.

                                 DAN
                        You gotta start with that part! You 
                        come to a man and beg for help in a 
                        shit-situation, you throw a roll of 
                        dollars at him before he can even 
                        say no!

                                 JANE
                        You still woulda said no at first!

                                 DAN
                        That is besides the point I’m 
                        making right now!

           Jane laughs. Dan bottles the desire to smile with her.

                                 JANE
                        Why’d you change your mind?

           Dan looks out to the front.

                                 DAN
                        We best get working.

                                 JANE
                        Answer me, Dan.
           He looks at her. She looks at him. It’s hard.

                                 DAN
                        If Ham and I were in each other’s 
                        boots, I’da hoped he helped my 
                        wife.

                                 JANE
                        He wouldn’t’ve. 

                                 DAN
                        Well dammit I know that Jane. 
                        That’s the difference between him 
                        and I. 

           He leaves, as she has no argument. 

           EXT. THE HOME - SUNSET

           Jane follows Dan as he walks around the side of the house. 
           There is a vegetable garden. 

                                 DAN
                             (re: the house)
                        You build this?

                                 JANE
                        Ham and me, yeah. 

           She holds up her hands. Worn. Dan notices. Says nothing. 

           At the back of the home is about a dozen feet of space 
           between the house and the rock wall. Dan checks it out.

           Thinks to himself. Jane watches him. Waits. And waits.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Whatcha thinking?

                                 DAN
                        I’m thinking God help us if we ever 
                        get cornered back here. 

                                 JANE
                        That all?

                                 DAN
                        Also how much I’d hate to die back 
                        here.

                                 JANE
                        Dan Frost, you are a ray of 
                        sunshine.
           Dan spits.

           EXT. THE GATE - DAY

           Jane unloads the last of her purchases from her horse. Has 
           them all set out on the ground at Dan’s booted feet.

           She moves around them and stands beside Dan. 

                                 JANE
                        Think it’ll be enough?

                                 DAN
                        It’ll be loud enough, that’s for 
                        sure. How many sticks you get?

                                 JANE
                        ...three. 

                                 DAN
                        Yeah, it’ll be loud enough. 

           He points to the fence. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you break a log off here?

           She doesn’t understand.

                                 JANE
                        ...Yeah. Why?

                                 DAN
                        I need a shovel. 

           EXT. THE HOME - SUNSET

           Dan is shirtless, digging a hole between the fence and the 
           house.

           Jane is sharpening the end of one of the logs from the fence 
           into a point with a knife.

           (NOTE: Jane and Dan never discuss what they’re doing, as odd 
           as it may seem.)

           Jane looks full on exhausted. Takes a break. Breathes.

                                 DAN
                        When’s the last time you ate?
                                 JANE
                        I don’t remember.

                                 DAN
                        When’s the last time you slept?

                                 JANE
                             (laughs)
                        You’re just trying to get me to 
                        sound repetitive. 

           Dan keeps digging.

                                 DAN
                        You ain’t no use to anyone bleary 
                        eyed. 

                                 JANE
                        But if they come-

                                 DAN
                        I’ll wake you, or the hail of 
                        bullets will wake you. Either way, 
                        you’ll be awake.

           She looks back at him. He doesn’t look at her. Just keeps 
           digging.

           Jane sets the shovel down, and walks past him inside the 
           house. 

           Stops.

                                 JANE
                        If I asked ya if we were digging a 
                        grave right now, would you answer 
                        me honestly?

                                 DAN
                        I would.

           He keeps digging. She waits for an answer, but one is not 
           forthcoming.

           She shuts the door.

           INT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           Jane crawls into her daughter’s bed. She breathes in their 
           blanket. And for a moment, she looks like a little girl 
           herself. 

           She stares at her wheezing husband, and shuts her eyes. 
           Pig has not moved. 

           EXT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           Clear night. Silent. 

           Dan Frost finishes digging and tosses the shovel on the 
           ground. 

           He washes his face and hands from a water basin. Towels up. 

           Looks into the night’s horizon. Clear and empty.

           He reaches into the supplies Jane brought back and pulls out 
           GUNS AND BULLET. 

           He takes a handful of each and moves to the

           EXT. BACK OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Where he sets guns beside and under rocks. Hides them. 

           EXT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           He returns to the porch and suddenly stops-

           Turns slowly-

           And SEES A MAN STANDING AT THE FENCE.

           Frost is completely unarmed. A dead man. 

           The Man in the dark does not move. 

           For a long time. 

           Dan thinks about going inside the house-

           But instead he raises his arms slowly into the air-

           And sits on the rocking chair. 

           After a beat-

           The man runs forward. Awkwardly.

           He stops again in front of the house. Waits.

           Dan has not moved. He sets his leg against his knee. Hands in 
           the air calmly.
           The man moves up to the porch. Dan sees him clearly for the 
           first time.

           HE is clearly mentally disabled in some severe capacity. He 
           has paint over his face. 

           Hope it’s paint.

           He smiles crooked at Dan. Raises a finger to his lips, asking 
           for silence.

           Dan smiles back. Raises a finger to his lips in response-

           But it’s not his finger.

           It’s a KNIFE.

           The Man realizes too late-

           Dan THROWS THE KNIFE-

           It slices clean through the Man’s throat and sticks into a 
           wooden post.

           Before the Man can even react, Dan’s grabbed him by the back 
           of his shirt.

           He drags the dying man away.

           Picks the shovel up.

           Drags him past the fence.

           Into the distance. Never stopping. 

           INT. THE HOME - MORNING

           Jane opens her eyes to see Dan STANDING OVER HAM. The sun is 
           pouring in from the front door.

                                 DAN
                        Ya know what the funniest thing is? 
                        Ain’t no reason I shouldn’t put a 
                        bullet in his head. God knows he’s 
                        earned it.

           Jane watches him, quietly. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        I remember I was with you first 
                        time I heard about Fat Bill 
                        Hammond. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Ol’ Jim told us about this outlaw 
                        that got in a fight with some 
                        injun. The red had cut him in the 
                        shoulder-

           Dan turns Ham’s arm gently and there, sure enough, is a long 
           scar. 

           Pig growls. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        And Fat Bill Hammond had responded 
                        by stabbing him in the gut. Killing 
                        him. But he wasn’t done. He cut him 
                        from navel to rib, reached in with 
                        two hands and pulled the poor 
                        bastard inside out. Cuz Fat Bill 
                        Hammond ain’t no killer. He’s a 
                        fuckin’ destroyer. 

           Dan pulls his hair over his ear. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        I should have you over his body.

           Jane is still quiet. 

           And then, suddenly, Dan leaves.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        I made bacon. 

           EXT. THE HOME - MORNING

           Jane walks out, dressed, and surveys the front yard. She’s 
           impressed.

                                 JANE
                        You sleep at all last night?

                                 DAN
                        I did. Slept in the chair on the 
                        porch.

           He hands her a plate.

           She notices specks of dried blood on his hands. Says nothing.

           She sits beside him.

                                 JANE
                        My girls love that chair.
           Dan chews. Reluctance loses to curiosity. 

                                 DAN
                        They got names?

                                 JANE
                        Alma’s the older, Kate the younger. 
                        Yours?

           Dan is quiet for a moment.

                                 DAN
                        Will. 

                                 JANE
                        He at Sally’s too?

                                 DAN
                        No.

           And that’s that.

           Jane picks at her plate.

                                 JANE
                        You kill Ham, I kill you. 

           Dan looks at her. Nods.

                                 DAN
                        That mountain. Any way a man get a 
                        shot off from up there?

           Jane laughs.

                                 JANE
                        No siree. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

           She sighs. Wrong. 

                                 DAN
                        Jane, this is a prime location for 
                        firing!

                                 JANE
                        You have to be a helluva shot to 
                        hit from here!

           Faster than you can imagine, Dan whips out his pistol and 
           FIRES TWO SHOTS at the house below.
           The two plates they ate breakfast on explode into pieces.

           Dan looks at her as he holsters the gun.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit Dan, they were good plates!

                                 DAN
                        I’ll buy you new ones.

           He walks away.

           Jane stares down at her house. At the horizon, clear and 
           clean.

                                 JANE
                        Nothing coming yet.

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Nope.

                                 JANE
                        Well what’s the plan?

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        I got it covered.

           She follows after him, annoyed. 

                                 JANE
                        Like that does me a lick of good!

           EXT. THE HOME - DAY

           Dan sticks the shovel in the ground, finished. Points down, 
           off screen. 

                                 DAN
                        What ya got to cover this?

           She looks at him. Gets it. Smiles. 

                                 JANE
                        A blanket?

           Dan spits.

                                 DAN
                        Best hope they come at night then.  

           Later, they weigh the blanket down with dirt, covering it 
           completely with a light coat.
           Jane is not impressed.

                                 JANE
                        They’ll see through it! Or they’ll 
                        think, hey, why’s there a patch a 
                        dirt in the middle of their grass. 
                        Let’s trod on it. 

                                 DAN
                        Maybe, or maybe their eyes will be 
                        on the house and the gun round your 
                        waist instead. Either ways, this is 
                        the best we can do. Put some grass 
                        on it from the back. I just dug you 
                        a damn hole, don’t go bitchin’ bout 
                        it. 

           She regards the dirt covered sheet in the middle of her yard.

                                 JANE
                        Let’s put one in the house.

                                 DAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        And ruin your beautiful floors?

           She smiles and heads inside. 

           INT. THE HOME - DAY

           Dan and Jane smash the floor by the front door, breaking the 
           wood, and digging below it.

           Pig is miserable about this.

           Ham wheezes. 

                                 JANE
                        How many you reckon’re coming?

                                 DAN
                        If any, ya mean?

                                 JANE
                        Naturally.

                                 DAN
                        More than ten. Less than twenty. 

                                 JANE
                        Based on what?
                                 DAN
                        Based on the fact they don’t seem 
                        to know how bad he’s hurt, so 
                        they’ll judge him a threat. So at 
                        least ten. Under twenty based on 
                        the fact that the law is after 
                        Bishop’s boys in a bad way. We know 
                        Ham’s killed four, and you killed 
                        yourself one, so hell I’m not sure 
                        they even got twenty left.

                                 JANE
                        Holy shit.

                                 DAN
                        What?

                                 JANE
                        ...I forgot I killed him.

                                 DAN
                        You did?

                                 JANE
                        Holy shit.

           Jane sits on her wooden floor. Her legs dangle in the pit 
           they’ve made. There’s dirt piles around her. Dan keeps 
           digging below her.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        His whole life led to a moment 
                        where I put a bullet in his 
                        forehead.

                                 DAN
                        It did. We can stack the dirt 
                        around Ham-

                                 JANE
                        He survived bullets only to be 
                        felled by mine. He had a name. And 
                        now he’s dead.
                             (beat)
                        I put him in hell. 

                                 DAN
                        Darling I doubt you had any say in 
                        the location of his final resting 
                        place. You just got him there on 
                        time. 
                                 JANE
                        Ya know fireworks? His forehead 
                        looked like a firework. 

           She takes a deep breath in. And a deep breath out.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Man had a name. And I never knew 
                        it. 

                                 DAN
                        If you’re fixing to puke, you best 
                        remember you already gave my hat 
                        away so you aim somewhere else. 

                                 JANE
                        How old were you when you first 
                        killed a man?

           Dan stops digging. Looks up at her, in her filthy dress.

                                 DAN
                        You know damn well how old I was, 
                        Hammond. 

           She does. 

                                 JANE
                        You cried.

                                 DAN
                        Everyone cries. 

                                 JANE
                        I haven’t. 

                                 DAN
                        Not in front of me, no. 

           Jane looks out her front door. 

                                 JANE
                        Ham is gonna be mighty pissed when 
                        he sees what we’ve done.

                                 DAN
                        He ever hit ya?

                                 JANE
                        Sometimes.

                                 DAN
                        It ever take?
           She smirks.

                                 JANE
                        Seldom. 

           Dan spits.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t spit in my house!

           Dan, five feet deep in dirt in a hole in the middle of her 
           house, looks up at her silently. She understands the 
           predicament.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Fine. 

           Dan smiles proudly and holds a hand up to her.

                                 DAN
                        Give me a hand out-

           She takes his hand, and he pulls her into the pit in her 
           floor. She laughs. He smiles.

           They stare at each other for a moment. His smile fades.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        My wife looked not a thing like 
                        you. 

           He pulls himself out. The pit is a good five, six feet deep. 
           Jane Hammond looks out the top. 

                                 JANE
                        You gonna pull me out?

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Nope. 

           Jane sighs.

                                 JANE
                        Son of a bitch. 

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Heard ya.

                                 JANE
                             (yells)
                        It was not meant to be no secret! 
                        Son of a bitch! 

           We hear him laugh. She smiles. 
           EXT. THE FENCE - AFTERNOON

           Dan and Jane stand at opposite ends of Jane’s wooden fence, 
           painting it BLACK. Jane scrunches up her nose in disgust.

                                 JANE
                        This is wretched.

                                 DAN
                        Hush. 

           She obeys. For a spell.

                                 JANE
                        You think-

                                 DAN
                        I think you ask me another 
                        question, Imma light a match. 

           She laughs. Dan looks over at her, in the sunlight, in her 
           dress, painting a fence and laughing. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Jane.

                                 JANE
                        Yes, Dan?

           He sighs. 

                                 DAN
                        Tell me something I missed over the 
                        last ten years or so.

                                 JANE
                        More than ten years.

                                 DAN
                        You are not making my desire to 
                        light a match subside, girl. 

           Jane scrunches up her nose again. Both from the smell and 
           from thought. A long time thinking.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Well. Glad I ain’t missed much.

                                 JANE
                        Oh? Then you go?

                                 DAN
                        I saw both oceans. West and east. 
                                 JANE
                        Why?

                                 DAN
                        My wandering foot gets to itching.

           She stops. Looks at him.

                                 JANE
                        One day, we was all just sitting 
                        right back there, and on the 
                        horizon, we see an elephant, calm 
                        as you like, just walking. No man. 
                        No chains. Just an elephant. None 
                        of us had ever seen one before. Ham 
                        rode out, had pleasant interactions 
                        with it, and then came and brought 
                        us all out to it. And for a good 
                        hour or two, til it was dark, we 
                        all played with this elephant. I 
                        remember I looked at my girls and 
                        saw the looks in their eyes and 
                        thought, aye, I can go now. 

                                 DAN
                        All that over an elephant?

                                 JANE
                        Ayep. And when we were done, she 
                        kept on going. 

           She tips the rest of her paint on the fence. Sits tired and 
           sadly on the ground. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You miss your kid?

           Dan laughs.

                                 DAN
                        The fuck kinda question’s that?

                                 JANE
                        I dunno. I miss mine fiercely. 

           Dan finishes his paint and looks at her.

                                 DAN
                        I think you’re the first adult I’ve 
                        spoken to in a couple years. 

           Jane smiles up at Dan. 
                                 JANE
                        Whiskey?

           INT. THE HOME - AFTERNOON

           Dan rests on the floor of the home, downing a shot.

           Jane treats Ham. 

           Dan stands and walks over towards Ham’s belongings. Reaches 
           for a hat.

           Pig snarls. Dan raises a hand and kneels to the dog.

                                 DAN
                        Name’s Pig?

           Jane shrugs.

                                 JANE
                        I got two daughters. 

           Dan turns his eyes back to Pig.

           Pig snarls again.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, he’s not gonna like you.

                                 DAN
                        I’m really gonna go through this 
                        whole fucking thing without a hat?

           Jane smiles to herself. Ham wheezes.

           EXT. THE HOME - EVENING

           The day is getting old. 

           There are MOUNDS OF DIRT by the sides of the house. Dan lays 
           behind one, aims with his pistol over the side of the 
           barrier. Satisfied. 

           He leaves the pistol under a rock and moves to the other side 
           of the house, where Jane is also aiming her gun. But much 
           more awkwardly.

                                 DAN
                        How good are you with a gun?

                                 JANE
                        Y’already saw me kill a man.
                                 DAN
                        Inches away.

                                 JANE
                        Well, I’m guessing we both know how 
                        good I am then.

                                 DAN
                        Oh, the confidence you fill me 
                        with. 

           Jane nods to the two horses at the fence. 

                                 JANE
                        What we gon’ do with the horses?

                                 DAN
                        Alabaster’s gonna run on for the 
                        night. Your horse needs to stay.

                                 JANE
                        She’ll get killed!

                                 DAN
                        Yep. But for a few minutes she’ll 
                        give the illusion that you are 
                        alone and unsuspecting, and those 
                        few minutes are all we got. 

           Dan is drenched in sweat. Takes off his shirt. 

           She watches. His body is full of scars.

                                 JANE
                        Lotta them are new.

                                 DAN
                        Lotta them are none-your-fucking-
                        business. 

                                 JANE
                        How’d you meet your wife?

           Dan stops short. Stares at Jane for a second.

                                 DAN
                        I swear, you ever get a clue to 
                        shut your mouth.

                                 JANE
                        All the time, but it runs away 
                        frequent. 

           Jane smiles. She’s a pest.
           Dan sits and begins attaching a BAYONET to his WINCHESTER. 

           It will FUCK YOU UP. 

                                 DAN
                        I was a drinker for a while. Usin’ 
                        the bottle as a grave-shovel.

                                 JANE
                        When was that?

           He looks at her. She understands. 

           He sharpens the musket blade on a cutting stone. 

                                 DAN
                        Cleaned up ‘ventually. Based on 
                        some advice, be it sound or not, I 
                        put out an advertisement looking 
                        for a woman. 
                             (beat)
                        She was a French girl. 

                                 JANE
                        She speak English?

                                 DAN
                        Not really, not well at least. 
                        Suited me fine. Everyone always 
                        said I was quiet to the point of 
                        being handsome. 

                                 JANE
                        I was never one of them.

                                 DAN
                        Shit, I know that well. You ask too 
                        many questions for me to be 
                        handsome. 

           She laughs. Dan doesn’t quite appreciate this, or this topic.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        She got better at words though. 
                        We’d converse and the like. My boy 
                        can speak both languages. Which I 
                        reckon will do him no benefits in 
                        this life. 

           He attaches the blade to the rifle. Aims it to the horizon 
           where the sun is setting. 

                                 JANE
                        How’d she die?
           Dan ignores this for a spell. Practically mumbles.

                                 DAN
                        This’n that.

                                 JANE
                        Dan.

                                 DAN
                        The Pneu-monia. 

           Jane lets this sink in. Looks away. Dan looks up at her. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        You-

                                 JANE
                        I’m fine. 

           She force a smile. Dan returns his eyes to the horizon.

                                 DAN
                        I used to read to her. Anything she 
                        could find. She would just sit and 
                        listen with her eyes closed. Don’t 
                        know how much she understood. But 
                        she loved it. 

                                 JANE
                        You used to read to me. 

           He glares at her and it is fucking terrifying. 

                                 DAN
                             (growls)
                        That’s the last you say to me about 
                        that, you understand me?

           She’s quiet.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        It ain’t kind and it ain’t 
                        appreciated. I ain’t here to have 
                        you fix what you did or have you 
                        fill the void I gotta go into town 
                        to get now days. I’m here because 
                        you went and married the wrong man 
                        and that choice has led you down a 
                        road that’ll probably kill all of 
                        us-

                                 JANE
                        Then why you even here? So you can 
                        add to your lore?
                                 DAN
                        Nah, Jane. I don’t give a shit bout 
                        my lore. I’m here partly because 
                        you’re payin’. 

           He stands and walks to Alabaster at the fence. Unties and 
           nuzzles him. 

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Mostly I’m here cuz I’ll be damned 
                        if my son knows his father turned 
                        down a woman in need. 

           He whispers to the horse and with the gentlest of taps, she 
           TAKES OFF, galloping away. He watches her go, his gun at his 
           side.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Even if she’s an indisputable cunt. 

                                 JANE
                        Oh, pretty words, Dan! 

           Jane steps in front of him angrily, facing the house-

           Dan stares at her, and in the horizon behind her, far off 
           like a star in the sky, he sees a RIDER. 

           And he makes NO MENTION OF THIS. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know the first damn thing 
                        about why I’ve done the things I’ve 
                        done!

                                 DAN
                        I gave up caring about why you do 
                        the selfish shit you do. The reason 
                        you came to me was because you were 
                        hopin’ I was different than the man 
                        you married. I don’t think for one 
                        second you ever thought of me 
                        before you needed me. 

                                 JANE
                        You think I don’t miss you? Fuck 
                        you. I oughta put a fuckin’ bullet 
                        in you. 

                                 DAN
                        Bullets are actions, girl. You can 
                        wish ‘em back, but after you let 
                        ‘em loose they’re loose for good. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAN (CONT'D)
                        And what you got in that homemade 
                        house of yours is a bullet you 
                        can’t ever take back. 

           He steps towards her, a calm fury.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        You keep your tears and you cry for 
                        your fat sack-of-shit husband, and 
                        you get in that house before I 
                        unleash on you. 

           Jane is ready to explode but doesn’t quite know how. She 
           turns and storms off into the house.

                                 JANE
                        Fuck you, Dan!

                                 DAN
                        Aye, you said that already.

                                 JANE
                        I meant it every time!

           She slams her door closed.

           Dan stands, the sun burning the horizons behind, his 
           bayoneted rifle over his shoulder like the weight of the 
           whole world. 

           And the Rider leaves.
                                           III

                                The Siege of Bill Hammond.
           EXT. THE PORCH - NIGHT

           Dan sits on the porch, his spurred feet on the rail. He plays 
           his harmonica. 

           His eyes open. His hair flicking in the night wind. 

           Fireflies. 

           Jane opens the door. With difficulty she steps over the pit 
           and onto the porch. 

           She holds a LANTERN. 

           Closes the door. 

           He acknowledges her presence politely. 

           Jane has changed. Bathed. She wears her prettiest dress. It’s 
           not lost on Dan.

           She sits in her rocking chair. And they are quiet together.

           Dan plays on. 

                                 JANE
                        I am so scared. 

           He stops and looks at her. Beat.

                                 DAN
                        There’s still time.

                                 JANE
                        Dan.

                                 DAN
                        Go to your girls. These men coming, 
                        they have no quarrel with you.

           Jane smiles at Dan sadly.

                                 JANE
                        I killed their man.

                                 DAN
                        I killed their man, and I hardly 
                        doubt they’re gonna wanna fuck with 
                        me over him. 

           He leans forward. Defiantly serious.
                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        That man in there isn’t dead yet, 
                        but Jane, he will be. We could cut 
                        down fifty men tonight and that 
                        ain’t gonna bring him back. 

                                 JANE
                        He brought me back. 

           Dan doesn’t follow. 

           And Jane tells him something he missed in the last ten years 
           or so.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        My daughter-

                                 DAN
                        Alma or Katie?

                                 JANE
                             (smiles)
                        You remembered.

                                 DAN
                        Remember everything.

                                 JANE
                        Mary. 

           They are quiet together. Dan gives her the space she needs.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You ‘membered how he killed that 
                        indian. He killed more than that 
                        one, plenty of times over. And one 
                        day it was bound to catch up to 
                        him, and it did... but he wasn’t 
                        home. It was me and my girl, in our 
                        house, a different one than this. 
                        And they came. She giggled at 
                        first. She was two. And I turned 
                        and I saw and I screamed and next I 
                        knew I was naked and tied up and 
                        wishing more than anything I be 
                        killed. 

           Dan stares at her hard. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        And he brought me back.
           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT, YEARS AGO

           BILL HAMMOND stands, younger and stronger and the meanest 
           sumbitch you ever did see. He is dressed in a hearty coat, 
           and it is winter.

           He is not alone. There are ten with him. 

           One is FITCHUM. His neck is fine. Still an ugly fucker.

           The rest are as follows:

           THE TRIPLETS. Three blonde identical triplets in their early 
           twenties. Individually, they may be beautiful. Together, they 
           are discomforting. 

           COLIN. Different then when Frost met him. No spectacles. More 
           calm. 

           VIC. A man more refined than his action’s reflect.

           MONTGOMERY. A negro. He dies tonight. As does SMITH, a yank 
           good with a blade. As does O’CALLAHREN, a man whose only home 
           has been in the low ranks of gangs.

           And lastly, a man known only as DOWD. He is a complete 
           psychopath. 

           Bill stares out at the colony.

           And pulls out two pistols. 

           He is the God of Death, and he is outside AN APACHE CAMP. 

           (The entire sequence takes place in silence but for the 
           score, and is filmed in one take.) 

           There is no sneak attack.

           This is a full annihilation. 

           We follow ONLY BILL HAMMOND, as he fires through any Indian 
           he sees.

           The camp instantly COMES ALIVE.

           FIGHTS BACK.

           Smith throws a knife and for once, it misses, and he takes an 
           arrow in the throat behind Ham.

           Ham takes an ARROW INTO HIS SHOULDER.
           He points his pistol straight up at the archer and sends a 
           hole clean through his eye.

           He pulls out the arrow and, when another Indian comes at him 
           with a blade, Ham dodges and lodges the arrow into the base 
           of the young Apache’s neck. 

           He enters a TENT.

           Finds TWO OLD WOMEN. 

           He leaves.

           The winter air is nothing but stray bullets and flying 
           arrows. Snow falls oblivious to both.

           Ham aims to kill another Apache. His gun is empty. He 
           holsters it.

           The Apache slits Montgomery’s throat.

           And Ham snaps his neck in his hands.

           He enters another tent.

           And this time, HE SEES SOMETHING.

           Whatever it is.

           It is THE WORST THING HE WILL EVER SEE. 

           He falls to his knees. Eyes well up.

           An Apache enters the tent and STABS HAM IN THE BACK.

           And for a moment.

           It’s like Ham hasn’t even noticed.

           The Apache sees what Ham is looking at.

           And is equally horrified. Takes a step back.

           Ham barely moves.

           Points his gun at the Indian, and ENDS HIM.

           With all the strength in the world, Bill Hammond rises to his 
           feet, and leaves the tent.

           The knife is still in his back.

           O’Callahren is dead at his feet. A sword in his hand. A wound 
           across his face.
           Bill picks up the sword, and uses it for its intended 
           purpose. 

           He enters another tent.

           Finds TWO TRIBAL ELDERS.

           Kills them both. 

           Leaves.

           Enters another tent.

           And THERE SHE IS.

           JANE. 

           BARELY CLOTHED.

           TIED ROUND THE CENTER POST.

           Drugged, or unconscious, or both, or neither.

           He stops.

           Sticks the sword in the dirt.

           Drops to his knees beside her.

           And holds her face in his hands.

           His giant hands.

           Her eyes open. And she sees him. 

           She starts to cry.

           He kisses her cheeks.

           And in this one moment, everything becomes clear about how 
           Bill and Jane Hammond feel about each other.

           They adore each other completely.  

           He takes off his hearty winter coat and helps her into it.

           He cuts the ropes that bind her.

           Her wrists are swollen blistered bloody. 

           He scoops her up in his humongous arms. Her head leans 
           against his chest, and he holds it there with his hand. 
           Shielding her as best he can.
           He grabs his sword.

           And leaves the tent. 

           The massacre is still underway.

           COLIN sees Bill and Jane.

           Whistles.

           The remainders of the gang begin collecting.

           Surrounding BILL as he carries JANE.

           Some take arrows or bullets.

           But they help each other move on.

           A FAMILY.

           They reach the edge of the forest.

           Where Bill kneels, cradling Jane.

           The wounded of the gang take a knee. 

           Those not wounded launch back into it.

           But Bill stays with Jane.

           He cups her face in his hands. 

           He kisses her forehead as the Bishop Boys burn the Apache 
           teepees to the ground. 

           She looks up at him.

                                 JANE
                        Mary?

           INT. JANE AND HAM’S OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jane is screaming weeping at Ham, who stands there quietly 
           and takes it.

           She holds a doll. 

           He does not cry.

           Jane is hysterical. She attacks Ham and he lets her hit at 
           him until she gets tired and falls to the floor. 
           EXT. PRAIRIE - NIGHT

           A different night. 

           Jane rides in the distance, only to be caught up to by Ham. 
           He grabs her from her horse and takes her home.

           Even in the dark, we see her hitting him.

           EXT. JANE AND HAM’S OLD HOUSE - DAY

           Jane has a pistol aimed at Ham. Who simply stares her down.

           She looks like hell.

           He walks towards her calmly and disarms her. 

           She cries in his arms. 

           EXT. THE HOME - DAY

           Ham and Jane ride up to the spot where their home will be. By 
           the wall. 

           He smiles warmly at her and dismounts. 

           She does not.

           EXT. THE HOME - A DIFFERENT DAY

           The house is about half built.

           Ham is working alone.

           Until he sees Jane begin helping on her own.

           He smiles to himself.

           EXT. THE HOME - A DIFFERENT DAY

           Jane is working beside Ham now. Does not look at him. 

           INT. THE HOME - A DIFFERENT DAY

           Together they finish the floor of the house. He touches her 
           swollen hand. She doesn’t flinch.
           INT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           They make love in the dark.

           LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jane awakes alone in bed. Hearing something outside. 

           She wraps a blanket around her and grabs Ham’s coat. 

           EXT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Ham, butt naked, sits on the porch. Lost in his mind.

           She puts his coat over his giant back, and sits beside him.

           Leans her head on his arm.

           EXT. THE PORCH - NIGHT 

           Now.

           Jane and Dan sit in silence. Jane stares at her feet. Dan the 
           distance. 

           Jane takes all the time in the world to start speaking again. 
           And when she does, her voice is dry. But firm. 

                                 JANE
                        Way Ham tells it, a stray bullet 
                        went through the Indian tent and 
                        hit her. 

                                 DAN
                        I’m sorry-

                                 JANE
                        He built me a house with God’s wall 
                        at the back of it so I could see 
                        what was coming. But some days, all 
                        you see coming is your husband 
                        slumped over the back of his horse 
                        and you realize that safety don’t 
                        mean shit.

           She looks at Dan, as he stares into the distance.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I don’t remember what 
                        people look like. My parents. You. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Her. You have any idea how pretty 
                        she was?

           Dan looks at her.

                                 DAN
                        I can imagine that. 

           She smiles softly at him. He smiles at her. She opens her 
           mouth to speak-

           And he raises a finger to his lips.

           She listens.

           And through the cicadas and sounds of the night, we begin to 
           hear it too.

           The gallop of horses. 

           Dan and Jane look out to the night sky. Too dark to see much 
           yet. But the sound is unmistakable. 

                                 JANE
                        Is it now?

           He nods.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. 

                                 DAN
                        You remember what to do?

           She looks at him. The answer is most definitely no. 

           He smiles at her. As kind a smile as he’s ever given her.

           He picks up his bayoneted rifle, and without much fan fare, 
           walks off the porch.

           But Jane remains. She stares out to the horizon, as the 
           horses get closer and closer.

           And she begins to rock back and forth in her chair.
                                            IV

                                     The Bishop Boys.
           EXT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           At least TEN HORSEMEN wait in a line a distance from the 
           house, while TWO RIDERS come towards the gate slowly.

           Jane Hammond walks past her gate and meets them halfway. 
           Holds her lantern. 

           Unarmed.

           She does her best to control her breathing. In and out. In 
           and out. 

           Before she can see the lead rider’s face, she hears his 
           voice.

                                 RIDER
                        Jane Hammond, starlight suits 
                        you... just fine.

           And then she sees him. 

           COLIN.

           He grins at her from atop his horse. Takes off his hat 
           politely.

                                 COLIN
                        You remember me?

           Jane looks up at him. Nods, but the man tells her anyway.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        John Bishop, ma’am. 

           JOHN BISHOP. Leader of The Bishop Boys. A legend in a world 
           full of them. 

           NOTHING like the man who interviewed Frost. 

           Jane hides her surprise and fear well enough.

                                 JANE
                        John Bishop. Face as pretty as 
                        yours and it’s not on a one of your 
                        posters?

           Bishop laughs. Loudly. A man without fear. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Ham always said you had a good way 
                        with the words.
                                 JANE
                        He with you?

                                 BISHOP
                        He is not, sadly, though he’s why 
                        I’ve come.

           Jane feigns a calm worry.

                                 JANE
                        You and more.

                                 BISHOP
                        Ayup. Me and more. This is Vic. 

           VIC tips his hat. Age has not been his friend. A dark beard 
           with flecks of grey. Doll eyes. 

                                 VIC
                        Ma’am. 

                                 JANE
                        Sir.
                             (then)
                        What happened, John.

           Bishop takes caution when choosing his words.

                                 BISHOP
                        I was actually hopin’ he was here 
                        so we could discuss some 
                        particulars.

                                 JANE
                        He ain’t. I haven’t seen him in 
                        four weeks. 

           Bishop nods. Accepts.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What happened, John.

           He sighs, weary-hearted. 

                                 BISHOP
                        From what I can gather, Ham was 
                        looking to loose the price on his 
                        head by turning in some of us. 

                                 JANE
                        That sounds decidedly un-Ham-like. 
                                 BISHOP
                        I’d agree. But you know he has the 
                        cancer-

           Jane does not react one way or another to this.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        So I’m figurin’ he was lookin’ to 
                        cash out so you and the girls were 
                        set.

                                 JANE
                        He’s a loyal man, John.

                                 BISHOP
                        Not a fellow here would fight you 
                        on that. But everyone knows he’d 
                        slit his throat for you and yours.

           Jane is quiet. Bishop sighs a second time. Leans forward on 
           his horse.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        May I level with you, ma’am?

                                 JANE
                        You may.

                                 BISHOP
                        We had a devil of a time finding 
                        this place. Hell... Think we lost a 
                        couple fellows who got close.

                                 JANE
                        I told you, John Bishop, I ain’t 
                        seen Ham and the first man I’ve 
                        seen looking for him is in this 
                        conversation. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Yeah? A pretty boy. Name of 
                        Fitchum.

                                 JANE
                        Nope.

                                 BISHOP
                        Huh. He was with us when we got ya 
                        back from the Apaches. 

           Jane is quiet.

           And that’s when Bishop reaches in to a satchel on his horse.
           EXT. SIDE OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Dan quietly cocks his rifle at Bishop. Aimed dead. 

           EXT. THE FENCE - CONTINUOUS

           Jane’s hand tightens around the lantern.

           But Bishop doesn’t pull out a weapon. 

           He pulls out DAN FROST’S HAT. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

                                 DAN
                        Son of a bitch...

           EXT. THE FENCE - CONTINUOUS

           Bishop holds the hat quietly, looking at Jane. He smiles. 
           Asks almost sheepishly.

                                 BISHOP
                        Can I level with you again, ma’am?

                                 JANE
                        Don’t have to ask, John.

                                 BISHOP
                        Well in that case, let’s say we 
                        found our boy Fitchum back in 
                        Little Wood with his forehead 
                        missing and wearing this hat that 
                        neither belongs to him nor fits 
                        him. And let’s say Vic here was 
                        looking for this very house and 
                        sure enough not but six hours ago 
                        he found it. And ya know what was 
                        curious about that incident? 

                                 JANE
                        Besides the stalkin’?

                                 BISHOP
                        Besides. Vic, tell her what you 
                        saw.

           Vic takes a moment to speak. Almost as if he has to wind 
           himself up for every sentence. 
                                 VIC
                        ...I saw two people.

                                 BISHOP
                        He saw a woman and a man outside 
                        the house! Now the woman, I imagine 
                        I am correct in assuming, was you. 
                        The man, though... well. Two things 
                        come to mind. The first is that, 
                        and I don’t mean to pry, but you 
                        have been having yourself a little 
                        bit of a side serving and-
                             (raises hands 
                              understanding)
                        I say good for you. Sincerely. 
                        Pretty girl like you should not be 
                        alone at nights. I am not what you 
                        might call an ethical man, so you 
                        will see no judgment from me. But, 
                        the second thing come ta mind, is 
                        that Bill Hammond came home. 

           He sighs again, like he hates being a burden. There’s a 
           theatricality to his sympathy. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Now Jane, I’m more’n willing to 
                        play cordial with Ham-

                                 JANE
                        If I told you once I’ve told you 
                        enough, Ham is not here-

                                 BISHOP
                        Regardless of your strong tone, I  
                        need to be sure of that. 

           Jane glares at him. 

                                 JANE
                        You mean to come inside my home?

                                 BISHOP
                        Good Lord, no. That would be 
                        entirely too rude, without an 
                        invitation. I hope you think better 
                        of me than that.

                                 JANE
                        Apologies, John.

                                 BISHOP
                        Accepted, Jane. But Vic’s gonna 
                        have to go in. 
           Jane looks at Vic. Vic has no expression. 

                                 JANE
                        And you brought a posse to ensure 
                        it?

                                 BISHOP
                        Of course not. I brought a posse 
                        because Ham is a very big man. 

                                 JANE
                        I have two wee girls, John Bishop. 
                        And if he pulls a stunt-

           Bishop almost gasps, places his hand affectionately over his 
           heart.

                                 BISHOP
                        Jane, no stunts will be pulled. I 
                        swear to Christ if Vic so much as 
                        looks wrong at those girls I will 
                        put him in the ground myself. 

           Jane takes a pause, then nods her okay.

           She takes the horse rein from Vic and leads him towards the 
           house. 

           Bishop stays motionless. Watching.

           And towards the dark blanket covered in dirt.

           Jane stares at it. She can’t help it.

           Clip-Clop. Clip-Clop.

                                 VIC
                        A fine house you have here, ma’am. 

                                 JANE
                        Thank you. 

           Clip-Clop.

           Clip-Clop.

                                 VIC
                        I knew your Pa, back when.

                                 JANE
                        That would be a statement only one 
                        of us can make without lying then.

           They keep on in silence.
                                 VIC
                        Met your ma once too. Pretty lady.

                                 JANE
                        Dead lady.

                                 VIC
                        How long now?

                                 JANE
                        Long. 

           Clip. 

           Clop.

           Closer.

                                 VIC
                        How old were you?

                                 JANE
                        Two when he got shot, seven when 
                        she got sick. 

                                 VIC
                        Who looked out for ya then?

                                 JANE
                        I looked out for me then. 

           And HE STOPS THE HORSE. Feet from the blanket.

           It’s impossible to tell if he’s seen or suspected it yet.

           Jane sweats. 

                                 VIC
                        ...When John suggested you may be 
                        straying from your vows, you made 
                        no argument. ...I find that 
                        curious.

           Jane stares up at him. Quiet. He smiles at her.

                                 JANE
                        He said he was an unethical man so 
                        I deemed any excuse or explanation 
                        unnecessary. Was I wrong?

                                 VIC
                        No ma’am. 

           And the horse begins walking again.
           CLIP.CLOP.ALMOST.

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        ...Ham would kill you though.

           Jane looks at him. He does not look at her. 

                                 JANE
                        Are you calling me a fool?

                                 VIC
                        No ma’-

           THE HORSE COLLAPSES INTO THE PIT!

           Jane yelps, drops the lantern.

           Picks it up fast. Pulls something from her dress.

           Vic begins screaming.

           John Bishop does not move in the distance.

           Jane looks inside.

           The horse is dead. Jane’s wooden spike shoved through its 
           neck, its legs broken from the fall. It lays in a horrible 
           disfigurement.

           The spike is cut straight through the horse up through the 
           center of Vic’s leg. He is wedged between the horse and the 
           wall of dirt, unable to reach his gun or remove himself from 
           the spike. 

                                 VIC (CONT’D)
                        WHAT IN THE HELL-

           Jane tries to regain her breath.

                                 JANE
                        Yo-you listen to me and you listen 
                        fast!

           He tries getting his gun. With great difficulty. Cries.

           The riders begin approaching. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Bill Hammond is in that house with 
                        eight bullet holes in his back and 
                        I want you to know this because he 
                        is not the one to do what’s about 
                        to happen. 
                                 VIC
                        WHAT IS IN MY LEG?!

                                 JANE
                        You all come to my home, and the 
                        home of my daughters, and you 
                        expect a smile and a welcome in the 
                        aid of you and your boys murdering 
                        my dying husband? You know what I 
                        say to you?

           Jane opens the lantern.

           And now we see what she pulled out of her dress:

           IT’S A FUCKING STICK OF DYNAMITE.

           And SHE LIGHTS IT.

           His eyes widen. Almost at his gun-

                                 VIC
                        WHAT THE-

                                 JANE
                        I say you’re the fool.

           She turns to run and-

           Tosses in the dynamite-

           Vic breathes in to scream-

           A bullet flies by Jane Hammond’s head-

           And for a split second-

           Nothing happens. 

           Until THE PIT EXPLODES.

           Jane is thrown from her feet. 

           The riders stop short.

           And then, it starts RAINING MEAT. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Ugh!

           Jane gets to her feet fast. Grabs the lantern again. Still 
           lit.

           The riders CHARGE again. 
           John Bishop doesn’t move as the riders pass him. 

           He simply watches.

           Jane’s horse is freaking out, still tied to the fence. 

           The riders begin firing, too far still to be too accurate. 

           But not too far for Dan Frost.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Who FIRES his first shot.

           In the distance, we see A HORSE COLLAPSE FROM A HEADSHOT. 

           Dan sees Jane running, bizarrely, TOWARDS the fence.

                                 DAN
                        FUCKIN’ NOW JANE!

           EXT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jane sees the Riders coming as she HURLS THE LANTERN AT HER 
           FENCE WITH ALL HER MIGHT.

           When it SMASHES-

           THE ENTIRE FENCE IGNITES IN GASOLINE-DRENCHED FLAME.

           The riders all stop short. Have to back up from the heat.

           The fire burns through the rope that ties Jane’s horse. It 
           runs away frantically. 

           Jane stares at the inferno for a moment. Dumb-founded.

                                 DAN
                        JANE!

           Jane comes to, and RUNS. 

           EXT. DAN’S SIDE OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Dan aims through the flames. Like shooting demons in hell. 
           Impossible to see anything. 

           Pig is barking but has not moved. 

           Dan can hear the Bishop Boys yelling. 
           Organizing. 

           And every time Dan hears a different voice-

           HE FIRES.

           And that voice never speaks again. 

           He’s not even shooting by sight. 

           Just sound. 

           He fires again and again. Every bullet a kill. 

           Dan re-aims for his fourth-

           When a couple pebbles trickle down of his shoulder. 

           He looks at them quietly.

           AND SPINS ONTO HIS BACK-

           A BULLET HITS THE SPOT WHERE HE WAS-

           DAN FIRES STRAIGHT UP-

           Lodges a bullet straight into the forehead of a GUNMAN. 

           He falls forward, and Dan rolls out of the way as the dead 
           gang member crashes into the ground. 

           Dan does not seem impressed. 

                                 DAN
                        Told her. 

           He takes the gun from the shooter-

           And sees the dead man’s hat on the ground a few feet away.

           The Gunslinger Dan Frost smiles. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jane pulls off her dress, revealing PANTS. 

           She lifts a rock by the wall of her house, revealing THE GUN 
           BELT.

           She puts it on. And this time, she looks ICONIC.

           She turns to face the fire-
           And sees A STICK OF DYNAMITE FLYING THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS 
           HER.

           She scrambles for her gun when-

           BAM!

           It EXPLODES MID-AIR!

           Jane gets thrown back-

           And lands at a pair of boots.

           She looks up.

           DAN FROST.

           His gun still smoking.

                                 JANE
                        You got a hat.

                                 DAN
                        You got pants.

           She offers her hand to get pulled up.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        Not now. 

           He creeps forward. She pulls herself to her feet and follows 
           him. 

           He presses his body against the rocks. Studies the fire.

           Jane copies him. Terrified. 

                                 JANE
                        What are they doing?

                                 DAN
                        Stop talking.

                                 JANE
                        They threw a stick of dynamite at 
                        me!

                                 DAN
                        Stop talking. 

                                 JANE
                        How long until the fence burns-

           Then Dan sees it-
           The spark of a second stick of dynamite getting lit. 

                                 DAN
                        Boom.

           He fires repeatedly at the stick with his pistol-

           IT EXPLODES-

           BLOWING UP THE WIELDER-

           AND A CHUNK OF THE FENCE-

           Flaming wood falls from the sky.

           Dan instinctively covers Jane with his body-

           She looks up at him, and the fire in the sky. 

           Wood lands around them, but they are fine.

           Dan looks back.

           The opening in the fence hasn’t been filled yet. 

           He loads his RIFLE. 

                                 JANE
                        How many are left?

                                 DAN
                        How bout you count ‘em while I kill 
                        ‘em.

           He runs towards the opening like a mad man.

                                 JANE
                        DAN!

           And before he even gets to the opening-

           A BULLET RIPS HIM IN THE ARM. 

           Spinning him around completely. He crashes to the ground in a 
           heap.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        DAN!

           Jane runs towards him-

           But before she goes to take care of him-
                                 DAN
                        Jane-

           She runs right past him-

                                 JANE
                        NOT NOW.

           Dan, grabbing his arm, grins up at her.

           She pulls out her gun-

           A MAN appears in the opening and starts firing at her-

           He misses-

           She unloads FIVE BULLETS AT HIM.

           Only two stick. Both in his legs. 

           He falls to his knees in agony.

           Raises his gun at her-

           But before he can fire-

           She PUNCHES him in the face with her gun, FIRING at the same 
           time.

           Half of his face is OBLITERATED. 

           Before she can reload, another shooter comes running at her 
           with his gun.

           One of the TRIPLETS from earlier.

           His BROTHER behind him. 

           The Triplet goes to stab her when-

           Dan Frost throws his bayoneted rifle through the air like a 
           spear-

           Where it sinks into the Triplet’s throat.

           He gurgles. 

                                 TRIPLET TWO
                        NO!

           He runs towards his brother.

           Dan leaps for his rifle.
           AND FIRES-

           SENDING THE BULLET THROUGH ONE’S NECK AND INTO THE BROTHER’S 
           MOUTH. 

           Dan pulls his rifle out and the triplet drops dead.

           He looks at the two boys as he helps Jane to her feet.

                                 DAN
                        Fucking twins?

           Jane reaches over Dan’s shoulder and FIRES-

           Blowing out his ear-drum-

                                 JANE
                        Triplets.

           The THIRD TRIPLET falls into the flaming fence.

                                 DAN
                        JANE MY FUCKING EAR!

                                 JANE
                        STOP TALKING!

           They split up and run towards either side of the house. 

           The fence is almost completely destroyed. 

           There are six left. 

           EXT. BACK OF THE HOME - NIGHT

           They reload their weapons as fast as they can at their stash 
           behind the house.

           Dan looks up at Jane. 

           Her hands are trembling so hard she can barely load her gun.

           He takes her gun in his hands. Loads it.

           When he speaks, he doesn’t look at her.

                                 DAN
                        Let’s run.

                                 JANE
                        What?
                                 DAN
                        Your girls and my son. It could 
                        work. 

                                 JANE
                        I’m married.

                                 DAN
                        To a corpse. And I ain’t asking you 
                        to marry me. I’m asking you to stay 
                        alive. 

           He hands the gun back to her.

           And walks away. 

                                 JANE
                        Dan.

           He turns-

           And sees a shadow approaching Jane from behind-

                                 DAN
                        Jane!

           Jane sees a shadow approaching Dan from behind-

                                 JANE
                        Dan!

           They run towards either-

           Pull their guns-

           And FIRE

           Their faces inches apart.

           The two gunmen fall down fucking dead.

           And Dan and Jane stare at each other. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        How-

           And Dan Frost KISSES HER.

           She doesn’t resist. 

           It’s been over ten years coming.

           He pulls back. 
           They look at each other.

           She SMACKS HIM IN THE FACE.

           They look at each other.

           Laugh.

           And run opposite directions. 

           EXT. FRONT OF THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jane reaches the front of the house and sees a MUSCULAR MAN 
           about to walk through the door.

           DOWD.

           She aims her pistol with one hand and FIRES.

           She slams the hammer again and again and FIRES REPEATEDLY.

           Completely empties her chamber at him.

           And he remains unscathed.

           Stares at her. THICK Irish accent.

                                 DOWD
                        How the fock did ya miss?

           Jane is breathless. Swallows.

                                 JANE
                        I’m just a prairie wife. 

           Dowd grins and takes off after Jane.

           Jane reaches for her second gun but the Irishman is too damn 
           fast.

           Dan Frost aims his gun at the man from behind-

           But is TACKLED from off screen-

           Just as Jane gets her gun out of the holster-

           DOWD LEAPS at her with both of his feet. 

           Sends Jane FLYING. 

           She loses her gun-

           He pounces on her.
           She kicks him off of her body-

           He pulls a knife and SLICES AT THE INSIDE OF HER THIGH.

                                 DOWD
                        CUT-CUT-CUT-CUT-CUT!

           Jane screams and keeps kicking-

           Reaches for the gun she dropped-

           When he presses the knife on her crotch. A little too hard.

           She stiffens. Stills. 

           He grins and leaps up, sitting on her chest. 

                                 DOWD (CONT’D)
                             (gaelic)
                        Conas a ta tu, Jane?

           And PUNCHES her square in the jaw-

                                 JANE
                        UGH!

           Jane lays there, dazed. 

           The Irishman laughs at her. 

           Pulls out his gun and puts it IN HER MOUTH.

                                 DOWD
                        Know what happens when I pull the 
                        trigger?

           Jane nods her head violently. 

                                 DOWD (CONT’D)
                        Shall we find out, yeah? 

           HE PULLS THE TRIGGER.

           JANE YELPS-

           And nothing happens.

           DOWD pulls the gun out and gets low to her face.

           LAUGHING HIS ASS OFF. 

                                 DOWD (CONT’D)
                        You shoulda seen your focking face! 
           Jane leaps up and BITES HIS FOCKING FACE AS HARD AS SHE CAN.

           He instinctively leans off of her, trying to free his nose-

           As soon as she has enough room-

           Jane pushes him off of her and takes off running to Dan-

           Who’s in a painfully even matched brawl.

           He sees her coming to help.

                                 DAN
                             (screams)
                        GET IN THE FUCKING HOUSE! 

           She turns and SPRINTS for the house as Dowd gets to his feet. 
           Laughing. 

           Dan gets thrown on his back.

           His assailant has both hands around his neck, choking the 
           life out of him.

           Jane throws open her door-

           And is nearly bowled over by PIG-

           Who charges to Dan Frost’s aid.

           Jane turns and SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HER before we can see 
           what happens. 

           INT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           From Jane’s P.O.V.

           Staring UP at the front door.

           We hear Jane’s gun- Ca-CHUNK.

           We hear Pig barking. Growling. 

           We hear men yelling. Screaming.

           We hear a stick of dynamite EXPLODE. The house shakes. 

           Then for a moment-

           We hear nothing.

           Nothing.
           Until we hear footsteps on the wooden porch.

                                 DOWD
                        Jane-Jane-Jane-I can smell ya!

           The front door swings open!

           Dowd stands with two guns drawn!

           He doesn’t find Jane-

           Until he looks DOWN-

           And sees her IN THE PIT-

           A SHOTGUN aimed at his face.

           Jane FIRES.

           Dowd’s head completely explodes in a splash of red. 

           His headless body falls in the pit with her. 

                                 JANE
                        Eugh!

           She pushes the body off of her-

           And hears footsteps running towards the house-

           Ca-CHUNK. She aims and hears-

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        You shoot me Jane I swear to 
                        Christ!

           She lowers her rifle as Dan jumps over the pit, kicking the 
           door closed behind him.

                                 JANE
                        Is he still alive?

           Dan turns and looks towards the bed.

                                 DAN
                        They shot Pig. 

                                 JANE
                        Fuck!

                                 DAN
                        Pig tore his throat out first. 
                                 JANE
                        What was the explosion?

                                 DAN
                        That was the dynamite.

                                 JANE
                        Is it done?

                                 DAN
                        I don’t know.

                                 JANE
                        Is he still alive?

           Dan looks at the pit. Then at the bed.

           He stands and walks towards the bed.

           Blood DRIPS from his spurs as he walks.

           He stands over Ham.

           Still alive.

           Staring up at Dan. Who stares back.

                                 JANE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Dan Frost! Is he fucking alive!

           Dan PULLS out his pistol lightning fast and shoves it between 
           Ham’s eyes.

           Ham doesn’t blink. 

           Two big sad eyes staring up at Dan.

           Jane tries to climb out of the pit with great difficulty.

           Dan pulls the hammer on the gun. 

           His hand trembles as he tries to will himself to pull the 
           trigger.

           Tries so hard.

           And then-

           He holsters the gun.

                                 DAN
                             (quietly)
                        That’s the difference ‘tween you 
                        and I, Hammond. 
           Jane finally gets out of the pit. Covered in blood. 

           Sees Dan and Ham. 

           With great difficulty she stands and hobbles over to them. 
           Dan helps her.

           She looks past Dan at Ham.

                                 JANE
                        Is he alive?

                                 DAN
                        Are you shot?

                                 JANE
                        Cut. This is Irish blood. 

           She hobbles past Dan to Ham’s side.

           He watches them. 

           She strokes his head. He reacts not one way or the other at 
           her appearance.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Is it over Danny?

           Dan holds his rifle to the door. Waiting.

                                 DAN
                        I doubt it, girl. 

                                 JANE
                        How many bullets are in you right 
                        now?

                                 DAN
                        ...I haven’t the slightest. 

                                 JANE
                             (lovingly to Ham)
                        This is a regular shit show, and 
                        you’re missing it.

           Ham just gazes up at her. 

           Then.

           They hear a noise outside-

           Moving UP THE HOUSE.

           Dan and Jane stare AT THE ROOF.
           Footsteps up there. 

           Calm. 

           Quiet.

           Until BAM!

           A bullet hole pierces the ceiling, a yard from them!

           Jane aims her gun to the ceiling but Dan lowers it fast-

                                 DAN
                             (whispers)
                        If he has dynamite and we hit it...

           She gets it. 

           The footsteps move across the house-

           They move away from the sound, towards the door-

           BAM! 

           Another shot hits the floor, a few yards away from them-

                                 JANE
                             (whispers)
                        What do we do?

                                 DAN
                             (smiles, whispers)
                        You’re the boss.

           Jane smiles and-

           The front door is KICKED OPEN-

           A MAN WITH A RIFLE FIRES BEFORE DAN OR JANE REACT-

           The bullet rips through Jane’s stomach.

           Blood from her back splashes the wooden wall behind her a 
           second before she’s sent crashing into it, like a fist.

           BLACKNESS.
           Blackness for far too long. Sounds begin returning. Yelling. 
           Scrambling. Whimpering.

           But they sound far, far away.

           The sound gradually becomes more clear and focused, until 
           finally, the title card appears.
                                            V
           INT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           Dan is crouched behind Jane, his back against the bloody 
           wall. 

           He has his rifle furiously pointed straight ahead. It’s a 
           damn miracle he hasn’t fired yet.

           As best as he can, he protectively covers Jane, who sits 
           against him. Alive but very much fucked up. Her shirt is 
           crimson.

           She holds her hands tight against the gunshot. Uselessly.

           She stares with fire at the man who shot her.

           BISHOP.

           He kneels calmly by the bed, gun pointed at Dan and Jane. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Dan Frost. I’m not often surprised 
                        but consider yourself surprising. 
                        You and Ham under the same roof, 
                        alive, more or less. 

           Dan doesn’t say shit. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Time heals all wounds, right? 

           Dan doesn’t say shit. Bishop sighs. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        My gun’s pointed square into her 
                        forehead, and if I so much as think 
                        you’re gonna fire, I’m gonna fire, 
                        and we’re all gonna die. I’d prefer 
                        the way you don’t fire, I don’t 
                        fire, the Kid don’t fire, and we 
                        all leave here in an unchanged 
                        condition. That’s my dream and 
                        offer.  

           Jane grunts, heaves. Dan has limited options.

           A young boy, maybe not even fourteen yet, stands a few yards 
           back, his gun also pointed at Dan and Jane.

           THE KID.
                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        I’d take it, considering I’m not 
                        sure you even got a bullet in that 
                        gun.

                                 DAN
                        We can find out quick enough.

                                 BISHOP
                        You really want to be the quick 
                        tongued one right now?

           Dan’s quiet. 

           NOTE: This entire scene takes place with Dan and Bishop never 
           taking their eyes off of each other. No matter what.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Kid, what’s Mr. Hammond’s 
                        condition?

           Kid looks over at Ham. 

                                 KID
                        I’d say the fucker’s shot to shit. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Language.

                                 KID
                        What?

                                 BISHOP
                        Mind your language.

                                 KID
                        You guys all swear-

                                 BISHOP
                        Kid, you kill a man and you sleep 
                        with a girl, then you earn the 
                        right to use whatever words you 
                        want but until those both happen 
                        you speak like you’re talking to 
                        your mother.

           The Kid is quiet. Everyone is quiet. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        What am I not hearing?

                                 KID
                        Yes sir. Sorry sir. 
                                 BISHOP
                        Ahh. Music. 
                             (to Jane)
                        Where the girls?

                                 JANE
                        Go to hell!

                                 BISHOP
                        Jane, I mean not to find or harm 
                        them. I thank you for sending them 
                        from here, and this madness you was 
                        concocting. Last thing a man needs 
                        is finding a bullet of his in a wee 
                        girl’s face. We’ve had enough of 
                        that, ‘aven’t we.

                                 JANE
                        Imma-motherfuck-you-

                                 BISHOP
                        Have you been planning this? Wipe 
                        out all the men who could’ve owned 
                        wee Mary’s stray bullet? 

           Dan is quiet. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        How’d ya know it wasn’t Ham’s? Or 
                        did he bringing you two gals make 
                        up for it? Two’s better than one, 
                        mathematically speaking.

           Jane looks like she’s about to become the most violent 
           creature on the planet. 

           Dan knows better than to look at Jane. But damn if he don’t 
           look shocked. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        I was there when he kill’t their 
                        pa, who admittedly was a real ill 
                        character, and their ma was 
                        screaming when he put a bullet in 
                        her brain. 
                             (to himself. Honest.)
                        I have nightmares sometimes.
                             (taps Ham behind him)
                        I saw this very man, drenched in 
                        blood, pick up two wee babies and 
                        carry them like he was a hero. It 
                        fix you up? 
           Bishop, for all of his kind demeanor, is a real nasty son of 
           a bitch. 

                                 JANE
                        How many of you come?

                                 BISHOP
                        Eleven. Twelve? I barely count ‘em 
                        anymore.

                                 JANE
                        How many of you leav’n?

                                 BISHOP
                        Three, I’m hopin’. I, The Kid, and 
                        your husband. My goal coming 
                        tonight was three. Breaking even. 

           Jane smiles a mouth of blood. 

                                 JANE
                        I kill’d the Bishop Boys. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Seeing as there’s me and one other, 
                        I feel the urge to correct you. But 
                        I already shot you and frankly, I’m 
                        trying hard not to be too much of a 
                        dick. 
                             (he laughs)
                        You should join my brand new gang. 
                        Interested?

                                 JANE
                        -Shoulda started the night with 
                        that.

           Bishop laughs. Jane winces. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Kid, take care of Ham.

           Kid nods. Walks to the foot of Ham’s bed. Pulls out his 
           pistol and-

           BANG! BANG!

           Puts bullets in both of Ham’s feet. 

           Blood splashes onto The Kid’s face.

           He turns and vomits on the wall. 

           Bishop never turns around. Shocked.
           Jane turns her face away. Cries into Dan’s bleeding arm.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (to Dan)
                        What he do?

                                 DAN
                        He shot Ham’s feet off.

           Bishop roars with laughter. 

                                 BISHOP
                        I meant carry him out, not blow his 
                        feet off! That’s hilarious. 

           The Kid wipes his mouth. 

                                 KID
                        I thought, in case he tried to run-

                                 BISHOP
                        He’s already been pumped full of 
                        sky! Where’s he gonna run to? Hell?

                                 KID
                        I don’t know-

                                 BISHOP
                        How bout you get him out of here 
                        and up onto one of the horses 
                        that’s not in multiple pieces, 
                        alright? 

           The quiet stand off between Dan and Bishop continues. 

           The Kid is motionless.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Well!

                                 KID
                        He’s really heavy. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Son, I swear, you can either carry 
                        him out or you can change spots 
                        with me and I’d bet your life that 
                        this gentleman here ain’t half as 
                        scared of you as he is of me. Would 
                        I be right?

                                 DAN
                        No, by all means, switch places. 
                                 BISHOP
                        I’d get moving child. 

           With extreme difficulty, the Kid begins dragging Red off the 
           bed. 

           Ham’s body THUMPS onto the floor when it runs out of bed. A 
           tiny groan. 

           Jane watches her husband go. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Jane.

           She reverts her attention to Bishop. His gun pointed right 
           between her eyes, his eye staring straight into Dan’s.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you do it? The bounties?

           Jane looks at him and simply answers:

                                 JANE
                        This is my home. 

           Bishop nods like he understands. He stands, guns still 
           pointed.

           Begins backing up towards the door as The Kid struggles to 
           get Ham past the pit in the floor. 

                                 KID
                        I can’t-

                                 BISHOP
                        Fiiiiigure it out, boy. 

           Bishop’s gun pointed at Dan. Dan’s pointed at Bishop. 

           Bishop hops over the pit. Almost out of the line of vision. 
           To Jane.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (sincere)
                        I sincerely hope you recover from 
                        your bullet. 

           And he disappears from frame.

           Dan instantly covers Jane’s body with his. Gun still at the 
           door.

           Expecting dynamite. Or worse. But it never comes. 
           Jane points her gun weakly at the wall, where Bishop’s 
           opposite of.

           Dan tries to lower her arm.

           She persists.

           He wraps his arms around hers tightly.

           She struggles and runs out of steam. 

           He holds her there, like that, until the sound of horses 
           leaving fills the wet air. 

           He lets her go and tries to lay her on the floor, to look at 
           the wound-

                                 JANE
                        No! Stop!

                                 DAN
                        What?

           She pants. Winces. 

                                 JANE
                        I wanna sit in my chair.
                             (desperate)
                        Please Dan. 

           He reluctantly nods and scoops her up in his arms. She 
           cringes, and as he lifts her, she reaches and grabs her 
           daughter’s blanket.

           It drags on the floor as he carries her out. 

           EXT. THE HOME - NIGHT

           Dan carries Jane gently onto the front porch. Sets her in the 
           shot-to-shit rocking chair. She gasps and winces but doesn’t 
           complain.

                                 DAN
                        You good?

                                 JANE
                        I got a bullet in my gut that says 
                        no, but aside from that...

           The blackened remains of the fence still smoke. 

           There are bodies in her front yard. 
           The Bishop Boy’s horses eat grass in the distance as if 
           nothing happened.

           Jane looks out into the horizon. Vic and The Kid are almost 
           out of view.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        You gotta get him.

                                 DAN
                        Jane-

                                 JANE
                        You listen to me. You get that 
                        sumbitch and you fill him with 
                        holes. 
                             (gasps)
                        Then you take Ham’s body and you 
                        get that money. And you give it to 
                        my girls. Yeah?

           Dan kneels in front of her. 

                                 DAN
                        I’ll bring you the money and you 
                        can give it to ‘em.

           She winces. Touches the wound. Sees the blood.

                                 JANE
                        Dan?

                                 DAN
                        Yeah?

                                 JANE
                        If you can, would you bury him nice 
                        for me?

           Dan is quiet for a moment, and then honest.

                                 DAN
                        If I can, yeah. 

           She smiles up at him gratefully as he puts her daughter’s 
           blanket around her.

                                 JANE
                        I wished it was us sometimes.

           Dan tucks her stray hairs behind her ears. 

                                 DAN
                        Well. That’s your own damn fault.
           She laughs through the pain.

           He kisses her forehead. She smiles up at him.

           He takes HER PISTOL. Checks the chamber. 

                                 JANE
                        Whatchagot?

           Three bullets. 

           He slams it shut. Holsters it.

                                 DAN
                        Full chamber.
                             (taps pocket)
                        And change.

           He stands and hands her HIS WINCHESTER. She takes it. Proud.

           Weaker now.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        You better be breathing when I get 
                        back.

           He doubts she will be.

           She smiles for him. 

                                 JANE
                        Yessir. I got a house to clean up.

           He takes a beat to look at her. 

                                 DAN
                        Prettiest girl with a bullet I ever 
                        seen.

                                 JANE
                        You charming devil.

           He winks at her. Says goodbye as best he can.

           Then takes off SPRINTING. 

           She watches him go.

           EXT. PRAIRIE - CONTINUOUS

           He may never have run faster in his damn life. 

           He yells.
                                 DAN
                        ALABASTER!

           And in the distance, we hear the horse answer.

           WIDE: The white horse galloping towards Dan from behind.

           The orphaned horses of The Bishop Boys follow after Alabaster 
           and Dan like an alcoholic in search of a drink.

           Dan doesn’t slow down, and when the beautiful stallion is 
           beside him, he mounts and they take off.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        To the sun boy, straight into hell. 

           The horse has no time for answers and charges off. The house 
           disappearing in the dark behind them.

           EXT. THE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           She watches Dan and his horse crest the horizon. 

           The sun breaks through, just the tiniest of slivers. 

           She feels her blanket in her bloody fingers. Grips it 
           tightly. 

           In the morning breeze, as the sun rises, Jane Hammond rocks 
           in her chair.
