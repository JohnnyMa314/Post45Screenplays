           INT. HANGER BAR, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

           OLIVIA GEDDES (28) sits at a table next to her date, 
           JAKE, a tight pant wearing 20 something. She has long 
           hair, wears a dress and little make up.  Olivia drinks a 
           glass of wine, Jake’s wine is on the table. She is drunk.

                                 JAKE
                        You live around here, right?

           Olivia doesn’t answer but starts to eat french fries from 
           a half empty basket on the table.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Did you order those?

                                 OLIVIA
                        No, they were from the table 
                        before, but, it’s like, they left 
                        a lot.

                                 JAKE
                        Right...So small world, I think 
                        you know Kyle Berg?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah.  She’s what we call a crazy 
                        asshole.  

                                 JAKE
                        She’s my best friend.

           A waitress walks by and sets down two glasses of wine.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Thanks.

           Olivia drinks her entire glass.  Jake watches, surprised 
           by her speed.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Can you give me a sip of your wine 
                        that just winked at me?

           Olivia takes his wine glass out of his hand.

                                 JAKE
                        Kyle said you’re from Washington.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah, I don’t go home that often.  
                        Apparently I “ruined Christmas” 
                        last time.

           CONTINUED:

           Olivia does air quotes as she says this, Jake shifts 
           awkwardly.  Olivia stands up, swaying a bit.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you want another drink?

                                 JAKE
                        No, I think I’m okay with - 

           Olivia interrupts Jake, pointing at his face

                                 OLIVIA
                        One vodka soda coming up for you 
                        Sir.

           She backs out of the room, hits the door, stumbles and 
           exits.

           INT. HANGER BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jake and Olivia sloppily make out on the couch.  She 
           pulls back for a moment and burps loudly.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Sorry, I thought I was going to 
                        throw up but it just turned out to 
                        be a burp.

           They go back to making out.  Then Olivia leads Dave into 
           the bathroom, the door shuts behind them.

           EXT.  HANGER BAR - TWO HOURS LATER

           Olivia lies down on the ground in front of the bar.  The 
           BOUNCER gives her a look.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m just resting.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Why don’t you “rest” in your bed.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maybe your bed.

                                 BOUNCER
                        You need to go home.  Now.

           Olivia falls asleep on the sidewalk.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           A COP approaches Olivia asleep on the ground.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 COP
                        Miss?  You need to get up.

           Olivia wakes up confused, the cop takes her arm and pulls 
           her up.  He looks to the bouncer - 

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how much she had to 
                        drink?

                                 BOUNCER
                        No.  She was in there for a few 
                        hours though.  

           Olivia looks at the cop who is holding her up.  She tries 
           to kiss him.  He restrains her.  She slurs her speech.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m driving.

                                 COP.
                        No.  I’m driving.

           Olivia pulls the cop’s sunglasses out of his pocket and 
           puts them on.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well then I get to wear these.

                                 COP.
                        Give those to me.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I look like Baz Luhrman and I 
                        think we both know that.

           She jabs her finger into the cop’s chest.

                                 COP
                        Stop it and give them to me now.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No.  

           The cop grabs the glasses from her.

                                 COP
                        Get in the back.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Make me.

           The cop grabs Olivia and tries to put her in the back, 
           she struggles, spreading herself out so he can’t get her 
           legs or arms in the car. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The cop’s partner gets out of the car, when he gets close 
           to Olivia, she hits him.  After a scuffle and a bit of 
           yelling, Olivia is in the back.  

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Get over yourself, you little 
                        bitch.

           INT. 9TH PRECINCT POLICE STATION - VERY EARLY MORNING

           An ATTENDANT comes to the holding cell where Olivia is 
           asleep on a bench, wrapped in her scarf.  Two prostitutes 
           talk next to her.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Olivia Geddes?

           Olivia groggily gets up and walks out of the cell.  The 
           attendant walks her to the front desk where MAGGIE waits.  
           MAGGIE (34) is Olivia’s best and only married friend.  
           She is five months pregnant.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (to Maggie)
                        Thanks for coming.

           Maggie hands her a sweatshirt that she brought.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course.  Here, put this on.

           The attendant hands her a stack of papers.  She’s 
           impatient and doesn’t look at Olivia as she speaks.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Here’s one for public drunkenness, 
                        another for resisting arrest and a 
                        third for assaulting an officer.
                        Your bail is set at $1,500.  Your 
                        court date is set for the 3rd.  In 
                        the meantime, take a look at this 
                        pamphlet.

           The attendant hands Olivia an Alcoholics Anonymous 
           pamphlet.  On the front flap it says: “Is A.A. for me?”

                                 ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
                        If I were you, I’d become very 
                        familiar with one of these 
                        meetings.  If you have cash right 
                        now, you’ll avoid a fee.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Just take whatever’s in there.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The attendant holds up the Ziplock bag that has Olivia’s 
           things in it.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        You have four dollars and a 
                        scrunchie.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you take MasterCard?

                                 ATTENDANT
                                 (she looks up)
                        I’m glad that assaulting a 
                        policeman is earning you frequent 
                        flier miles.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Silver lining.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        What was that?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nothing.

           INT. WAVERLY DINER - MORNING

           It’s raining.  Olivia and Maggie sit across from each 
           other.  Olivia is a disheveled mess, Maggie is perfectly 
           put together in workout clothes.  They both have plates 
           of eggs and toast in front of them, Maggie eats, Olivia 
           doesn’t touch her food.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you sleep with him?

                                 OLIVIA
                        When you say “sleep with...”

                                 MAGGIE
                        Just answer.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Does it really matter?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Honestly, I don’t remember 
                        anything. 

           Beat.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh God Olivia.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (grimacing)
                        With my mouth.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well it sounds like it went great.  
                        Full of first date, demure charm.  
                        I’m sure he’ll call.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Please don’t be mean to me right 
                        now. 

           Olivia starts to cry.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m sorry.  Listen, the good thing 
                        is that you’re getting out there.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I can hear the judgement in your 
                        tone and word choice.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m “weighing in,” it’s not like 
                        you have to answer to me.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don’t people make mistakes?

                                 MAGGIE
                        A mistake?  Spilling milk is a 
                        mistake!  Did you trip and fall on 
                        his penis?

                                 OLIVIA
                        What if I did?!  You would feel 
                        pretty stupid right now.

           Olivia puts her head in her hands.  Maggie opens her 
           mouth to talk and Olivia puts up her hand to shush her.

           The WAITER comes by the table.  

                                 WAITER
                        Anything else?

           EXT. OLIVIA’S STREET - MORNING, THREE MONTHS LATER

           Olivia walks to work. 

           She stops at a deli, buys a large bottle of water and 
           drinks the whole thing on the street corner, holding a 
           cigarette in her other hand.

           A runner in a cute fitted workout outfit and perfect 
           ponytail runs by her listening to an IPod.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I hate you.

           The girl does not hear and continues running.  Olivia 
           smokes her cigarette and keeps walking.

           Olivia sits in her office at Convention magazine where 
           she works as an associate editor. Olivia is at her 
           computer, she types very fast, occasionally she 
           references her pile of notes.

           JERRY and CHARLIE walk into Olivia’s office mid-
           conversation.  Jerry (58), Olivia’s boss, wears a suit 
           and tie with running shoes.  Charlie (29), a columnist, 
           wears glasses and a sweater over a collared shirt.

                                 JERRY
                        Just read the rough draft Liv, 
                        fantastic stuff.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Thanks.

           Jerry notices a bottle of Alieve and a packet of Alka 
           Seltzer on her desk.

                                 JERRY
                        Rough night?

           Olivia clears both off her desk with a swipe of her hand.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What?  No.

           Jerry heads to the door.

                                 JERRY
                        My friend, Jim Hinkey, from the 
                        American Society of Magazine 
                        Editors is coming by tonight, I 
                        want you to meet him.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes!  Great.  I can’t - 

           Jerry walks out.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        ...wait.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Glad you’re going to Henry’s 
                        promotion party tonight.  Always 
                        better to have a “go to” dance 
                        partner.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah, definitely.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll pick you up at 7?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well, it’s in the office, right?  
                        I mean, I’m probably not going to 
                        go home first - 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, sorry that was a joke.  Like 
                        pick you up at your office or 
                        whatever.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh right!  Of course - sorry, I’m 
                        not even thinking, I just, hah... 
                        yup, sounds good!

           Olivia extends her arm to Charlie for a high five.

                                 CHARLIE
                        See you later.

           Charlie high fives Olivia and walks out.  By herself 
           again, she puts her hand on her forehead.  She quietly 
           mocks herself.

                        It’s at the office, right?  Jesus.

           INT. CONVENTION OFFICE KITCHEN - DAY

           Maggie walks in the kitchen to find Olivia staring off 
           into space while she waits for the coffee to be made.  
           Despite her pregnancy, Maggie still wears her daily 
           uniform of a black pantsuit.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s going on in that little 
                        little brain of yours?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m going to die fat and alone, 
                        but at least we had our laughs?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I see I’ve caught you at a dark 
                        moment...How was your night?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t know.  I hung my coat up 
                        in the bathtub.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nothing.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Scale of 1 to 10, how drunk were 
                        you?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I was being fun.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You have a weird definition of 
                        fun.

           Maggie looks through her phone.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Got your text.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What text?

                                 MAGGIE
                        “Side note: war on house tools.” 
                        What do we think that means?

                        I have no idea?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Wow.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I genuinely have no idea what I 
                        was - 

                                 MAGGIE
                                 (looking in her mug)
                        I just swallowed something chewy 
                        in my coffee?

                                 OLIVIA
                        The sound of your voice is giving 
                        me a headache.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Drink more.  How is the Miller 
                        piece coming?

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s almost done.  How was your 
                        night?

           Maggie absentmindedly flips through a Harper’s Bazaar 
           that sits on the counter.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I hate quotes like this - “I was 
                        made fun of for being skinny when 
                        I was young.”  

                                 OLIVIA
                        I ate a log of goat cheese when I 
                        got home last night and today my 
                        bra is  tight.  They should quote 
                        me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Limit yourself to seven shots 
                        tonight.  You want to appear 
                        respectable, but you should 
                        definitely fuck Charlie.

           Olivia gives her a look.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  You should make love 
                        to Charlie.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I have work to do.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Maggie looks at the mug she is drinking out of and then 
           points at it - it says “Dogs!” and has a picture of a dog 
           wearing a button down shirt and a tie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        This is Charlie’s mug, but I still 
                        think you should fuck him.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Leave.

           Maggie walks out.  Olivia turns to head back to her 
           cubicle, realizing that CARRIE, her coworker, witnessed 
           her conversation with Maggie.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Just workshopping some ideas with 
                        Maggie.  Great blouse.  

           Olivia walks out.

           INT.  CONVENTION OFFICE, HENRY’S PROMOTION PARTY - NIGHT

           Office coworkers mingle around and chat.  To the left of 
           the make-shift dance floor is a bar where Olivia talks to 
           Charlie.  Various conversations ensue.  

           INT.  CONVENTION OFFICE - SAME

           Olivia and Charlie take a shot.  Maggie drinks water.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll be right back.

           Charlie heads off towards the bathroom.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Woah, slow down.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I only drank that to be cool.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s going to take a lot more than 
                        that babe.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I told Charlie that I just broke 
                        up with my boyfriend.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You didn’t have a boyfriend.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I feel like there were probably a 
                        lot of other ways to communicate 
                        that.

           Maggie looks at their coworker, CARRIE, standing with her 
           boyfriend across the room.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Someone should tell Carrie that 
                        her boyfriend likes men.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I know.  But do you think he’s 
                        actually gay?

           Across the room, Carrie’s boyfriend wears a tight, low 
           cut v-neck and does lasso dance moves with both of his 
           arms to the music.

           Maggie waves goodbye to Charlie and Olivia from across 
           the room and walks out.

           INT. CONVENTION OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER

           Charlie and Olivia take another shot.  Olivia is starting 
           to sway back and forth.  She tries to hold a conversation 
           with Charlie but isn’t making much sense. The live band 
           starts to play a rendition of “When the Doves Cry.”

                                 OLIVIA
                        I love this song!

           QUICK SHOTS:

           - The band plays TLC’s “Waterfalls.”  Olivia dances in 
           the middle of the dance floor, doing the butterfly.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           - Charlie comes over to try and dance with her but she is 
           clearly too drunk.  He instead tries to walk her out, but 
           she won’t go.

                                 OLIVIA
                        This is so awesome!

           - Charlie finally decides to leave.  He tries to give 
           Olivia a hug, but she is dancing too intensely, it is an 
           awkward physical interaction and Charlie walks out.

           - There are about three people left at the party 
           including Jerry’s friend, JIM HINKEY (49).  Jim 
           approaches Olivia and they begin to dance.

           INT. OLIVIA’S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

           Olivia sits at her desk.  Cat Power’s “Lived in Bars” 
           plays on her computer.  She pulls out the bottle of 
           Alieve and takes two with an entire bottle of water.  She 
           is still drinking the bottle when Maggie comes in, she 
           doesn’t stop until she finishes.  She picks up her coffee 
           and drinks from that for another ten seconds.  When she 
           stops, they just look at each other silently.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                        Olivia, it’s too early for Cat 
                        Power.

                        Please.  I’ve been shame spiraling 
                        all morning.

                        You think?  Katie said your dance 
                        moves were “violent” and 
                        “threatening.”

                                 OLIVIA
                        Is it hot in here?  I feel like 
                        I’m sunburned.

                        I feel like the human incarnation 
                        of a chimichanga.

           Maggie notices Olivia’s computer screen.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Are you looking up one way tickets 
                        to Mexico?... Liv, Jerry wants to 
                        talk to you.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (horrified)
                        Oh my god.  No. Sorry, but no.  
                        How can he say anything? He can’t 
                        say anything, right?  It’s 
                        personal, right?

                        On work property.  You also took 
                        home the American Society of

                                 OLIVIA
                        That was him??

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah...How much did you have to 
                        drink Liv?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I had a few shots. And a few 
                        chasers...chased that personality 
                        right away...but nothing happened.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hmm...

                                 OLIVIA
                        He sat in his underwear and cried 
                        and I listened.   

           Olivia looks like she is sick.  

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know.  It wasn’t a big 
                        deal.  

           Maggie gives her a look - “that’s all?”  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Really?  Tell me the truth.

           Off of Maggie’s look, Olivia puts her head in her hands.  
           Maggie stands up.

                        waiting.

           Carrie walks by Olivia’s office.

                                 CARRIE
                        Hey Olivia, I just wanted to check 
                        in on you and see how you were 
                        doing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        She tried to buy a one way ticket 
                        to Mexico this morning so you do 
                        the math.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maggie!  I’m fine, thank you.

           Olivia follows Maggie out of the room to Jerry’s office, 
           leaving Carrie.  They walk down the hall. 

           When they pass Charlie’s desk, he looks up uneasily.  
           Maggie laughs at this as Olivia puts her head down and 
           walks faster. 

           Olivia hurries up next to Maggie and punches her in the 
           arm.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                                 (in an angry whisper)
                        It’s.  Not. Funny.  

           They round the corner.

           INT. CONVENTION HALLWAY - SAME

           Olivia takes a breath before she opens the door.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I should probably go in by myself.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I understand, I’ll come with you.

           They both walk in.

           INT. JERRY’S OFFICE - SAME

           It is raining outside.  JERRY is seated at his large desk 
           facing a floor to ceiling window with a huge view of the 
           city.

           When stressed or eating, he throws his tie over his left 
           shoulder.  His tie is over his left shoulder.

           As Maggie and Olivia walk in, Jerry turns to them in his 
           chair and motions for Olivia to sit.

                                 JERRY
                        Take a seat.

           Olivia sits, Maggie leans against the wall.  Olivia

                        It’s okay if she stays.

                                 JERRY
                        I don’t think we need to beat 
                        around the bush...Olivia, it comes 
                        down to this, I’m worried about 
                        you.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Jerry. What happened last night 
                        was not something I’m proud of.  
                        But it was not on work time and it 
                        will not happen again.

                        You cart-wheeled into the drummer 
                        Olivia.

           Olivia has a look of confusion for a moment - 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Olivia cartwheels into the drum set hitting it over, She 
           knocks down the drummer who hits the guitarist - general 
           chaos ensues.

                        wasn’t what you think, I just 
                        didn’t eat dinner and was overly

                        Look Jerry, I don’t want to give 
                        myself more credit than I deserve,

                        working people here and you know 
                        that.   Yes, I messed up, but this

                        Or one of a few isolated

                        That was a private moment...That I 
                        shared with Henry....and Tanya...

           Another long pause.

                        And Craig was there too I guess.  
                        Whatever!   That’s a bad example.

           INT. GOTHAM RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Nice restaurant.  There is general chatter going on.  
           Everyone eats their food and sips their drinks. CRAIG, a 
           columnist, sits at the head of the table wearing a 
           homemade birthday crown.  MARCIA, the type A receptionist 
           for the office begins her speech - 

                                 MARCIA

           Olivia knocks over her glass of red wine on to her white 
           blouse.

                                 MARCIA
                        Um...Anyway...Craig, from the 
                        moment I started here you’ve been 
                        such a wonderful friend and 
                        colleague.

           As Marcia speaks, Olivia takes her top off and starts to 
           rub the wine stain out with her napkin.  She sits in just 
           her bra.  Suddenly inspired, she grabs a Ketchup bottle.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Ketchup shots!  Ketchup shots!  
                        Ketchup shots!  Ketch - 

                                 MARCIA
                        Um... I’m so glad to be 
                        here...happy birthday.

           Olivia claps as the speech ends and squirts Ketchup in 
           her mouth.

           Everyone is silent, various “What the hell?”  “Jesus 
           Christ,”  “Olivia” come from her coworkers and Jerry.

                                                                 BACK TO:

           Olivia quietly reflects on what is happening.  She is on 
           the verge of tears.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t want to pat myself on the 
                        back here, but I’m one of the best 
                        writers that you have -

                        You’re an excellent writer, but 
                        you’re slipping.  You’ve got to 
                        get this under control.

           Olivia is desperate.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Then give me another chance.  I’ll 
                        cut back.  This isn’t a “thing.”

                        Thanks to your charming antics, 
                        Jim wanted to disqualify 
                        Convention from any ASME awards 
                        for this year.  Our general 
                        comradeship with ASME was put in 
                        jeopardy.  You’re a liability.  
                        Luckily I was able to talk him 
                        down -

                        he went home with me!  Wouldn’t 
                        that be considered a win for a 70 
                        year old?

                        assaulted him when he tried to get 
                        a glass of water from the kitchen. 
                        He has a black eye and a sprained 
                        wrist.

                                 OLVIIA
                        I thought he was stealing -

                        I don’t want to know. Look Olivia.  
                        I’m letting you go.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No.

                                 JERRY
                        It’s not a question.

                        Take a few months to relax and 
                        recover.  Get control of your 
                        life. If you can prove to me in 
                        three months that you’ve gotten 
                        sober, then we’ll talk about you 
                        coming back.  You need to get out 
                        of the city.  What about your 
                        parents?  Go home for awhile.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What?? God no.  I haven’t been 
                        home in three years.  You want a 
                        drunk?  Talk to my mother.

                                 JERRY
                        Olivia, this city is a toxic 
                        environment for you right now.  I 
                        took the liberty of looking up 
                        some rehab centers.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t need rehab!

                                 JERRY
                        You need to get sober and get out 
                        of this city.  I will pay for your 
                        treatment.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m not going to rehab.

                                 JERRY
                        Then go stay with your family.

                                 JERRY
                        You should have thought about the 
                        consequences before you had the 
                        bartender take a shot out of your 
                        boobs.

                                 OLIVIA
                        This is absurd!  Are you even 
                        allowed to say boobs to me?

                        Yes.  You’re a very smart girl 
                        with a very big future.  Don’t 
                        fuck that up because you like a

           Silence.  Olivia looks to Maggie.

                                 OLIVIA
                        This is illegal.

           She waits for a second and looks Jerry in the face then 
           walks out of the office, slamming the door behind her.  
           It doesn’t close fully, she opens it and slams it again.

           INT. OLIVIA’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Olivia walks in her house, walks straight to her bedroom 
           and gets in bed.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Olivia is in her bed.  It’s raining outside.  She wakes 
           up and rolls over to look at her clock.  It’s 6:00 pm.

           INT. OLIVIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It’s raining.  Olivia sits on her couch still half-
           dressed from work.  She drinks a glass of red wine as she 
           looks through the AA pamphlet.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           She holds the portable phone and tosses it back and forth 
           between her hands debating whether to make a phone call.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           Olivia sits on her bed with the phone next to her.  She 
           flips through the channels, “Crazy Heart” is on one 
           channel.  She changes it, “Postcards from the Edge” is on 
           the next.  She looks at the screen for a minute, then 
           puts the television on mute and leans over, grabs the 
           phone and dials.  She opens her bedside drawer while she 
           does this and takes out a cigarette.  Olivia coughs when 
           the other line picks up.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mom......I’m okay...Hi dad...Yup,

                        do one person on at a time...or 
                        this way is good too.

                        goodbye...Great...Bye.    

           Olivia hangs up the phone.  She unmutes the television 
           just as Suzanne Vale (Meryl Streep’s character in 
           ”Postcards from the Edge’) says - 

                                 SUZANNE VALE

           EXT. JFK AIRPORT CURB SIDE - DAY

           Olivia and Maggie stand together at the curb as Charlie 
           waits in the car.  Olivia has one large suitcase next to 
           her and a coffee in her hand.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Why did you have him take us??

                                 MAGGIE
                        He is the only person I knew with 
                        a car.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Shh! I would have taken a cab!  
                        Like a normal person!  Who gets a 
                        ride to JFK?  God damnit Maggie.  
                        It was too late to say anything 
                        when he drove up to my apartment.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know.  I knew you wouldn’t say 
                        anything then, that’s why I did 
                        it.  It’s going to be fine.

                                 OLIVIA
                        That’s very hopeful of you.  I’m 
                        28 and I’m moving in with my 
                        parents on the other side of the 
                        country.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s very Italian of you.

                                 OLIVIA
                        They’re wearing Renaissance 
                        outfits.

                        Fantasy is one category to me.

                                 OLIVIA
                        The Renaissance wasn’t a fantasy.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tell me less about that.  

           Olivia walks towards the car and leans her head in the 
           window.  Charlie sits inside awkwardly.  Maggie waits off 
           to the side.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey, thanks so much for driving me 
                        here.  I’m sorry, I don’t even 
                        know why Maggie asked you.

                        Really, no, it’s fine.  I’m more 
                        than happy to do it.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        I...uh..have a great...couple of

                        We’ll miss you around the office.

                        Have fun in Washington too.

           Olivia realizes her mistake, grimaces and steps away from 
           the car window giving Charlie a wave.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Go already.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gone.

           Maggie hands Olivia her bag, kisses her on the cheek and 
           waves goodbye to her.  Olivia walks inside the airport.  
           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Olivia sits in her seat.  She is very fidgety - she 
           unbuckles and re-buckles her seat belt, situates all of 
           her belongings, opens and closes the tray table and drums 
           on the armrest.  A stewardess walks by.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Excuse me?  Do you serve drinks 
                        before we take off?

                                 STEWARDESS
                        I can bring you a water.

                                 STEWARDESS 
                        You’ll have to wait for that.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Fantastic.

           Olivia closes her eyes and grips her armrests.

           EXT. WASHINGTON STATE AIRPORT (SEATAC) - DAY

           Olivia’s plane lands in Seattle, Washington. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON STATE AIRPORT (SEATAC) BUS TERMINAL - DAY

           Olivia boards a bus.

           EXT. ANACORTES FERRY LANDING - DAY

           Olivia gets off of the bus and walks on to a ferry.

           INT. ANACORTES FERRY CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON

           She sits in a booth outside of the cafeteria area that 
           has a view of the water.  Over the loudspeaker, a FERRY 
           OPERATOR makes an announcement.  

                                 FERRY OPERATOR
                        Orcas Island next.  Orcas Island 
                        next.
           EXT. ORCAS ISLAND FERRY LANDING - AFTERNOON

           The island is very wooded but filled with stretches of 
           open space, high grass and flowers.  The town is filled 
           with cafes, a bar, a market, a liquor store, antique 
           shops, and a library.  The harbor is filled with 
           sailboats and fishing boats along with a restaurant at 
           the end of the dock. 

           Olivia walks off of the ferry. Olivia’s mom, SOPHIE (58) 
           wears a lot of linen and silver jewelry, she always has 
           her glasses on or hanging on her neck on a beaded glasses 
           strap.  Her dad, ALEX (62) wears worn in jeans, paint 
           covered shoes and a flannel shirt.  He has a beard and 
           smells faintly of smoke.  They come to meet her, she 
           gives her mom a hug first and then her dad. Alex helps 
           her with her bags.

           They walk to the car, Alex has his arm around Olivia.

                                 ALEX

                        Thanks dad.

           Sophie puts her arm through Olivia’s.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh shut up Alex.  Let me look at 
                        you, Liv! Hi!

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi Mom.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m so happy you’re home.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah.  Been a long time.

                                 ALEX
                        There’s that enthusiasm.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’re just tired, right Liv?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah Mom, I’m just tired.

           They get in the car.
           EXT. GEDDES HOME - NIGHT

           Alex, Sophie and Olivia get out of the car. LEELEE, 
           Olivia’s grandmother, and GUS, her brother, come out of 
           the house.  They hug each other.

           Leelee (82) is dressed in an entire purple outfit: purple 
           hat, scarf, dress, tights and heels.  She holds a 
           cigarette and a vodka & milk.

           Gus (21) just graduated University of Puget Sound and 
           lives at home.

           They all head inside.

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - SAME 

           Olivia sets her stuff down in her room and shuts the 
           door.  She picks up a stack of photos that lie on her 
           desk.  They are photos from when Olivia was in high 
           school - She was forty pounds heavier.  As she goes 
           through them, she finds a gift certificate to Weight 
           Watchers, on the back a note is written: “This could be 
           fun?  Love, Mom.”  She sets the stack down.

           Olivia picks up a copy of “Bright Lights, Big City” (by 
           Jay McInerney), a note falls out.  It reads “Have fun at 
           NYU Biggens. Don’t turn into this.  Love Gus.”

           Olivia smiles and sets the note and the book down.  She 
           looks in her closet and finds an old white cotton 
           nightgown, puts it on and gets in bed.  As soon as she 
           gets in, she gets out and grabs a water bottle from her 
           bag and drinks the whole thing quickly.

                                 OLIVIA
                        First night’s the hardest...First 
                        night’s the hardest...First 
                        night’s the hardest...First 
                        night’s the hardest...

           EXT. ORCAS ISLAND TOWN STREET - NEXT DAY

           Olivia and Gus walk down the street.  They pass their 
           next door neighbor, KATHERINE (16), dressed in soccer 
           shorts and a t-shirt.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi Katherine  How’s it going?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Great!  How are you?  I haven’t 
                        seen you in like five years.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OLIVIA
                        Three years, but yeah.  Been a 
                        while.  You should come over some 
                        time, my mom would love it.

                                 GUS
                        Yeah, you should.  We’ll make 
                        dinner and just hang out, or do 
                        whatever.  Watch a movie, you 
                        know, whatever you want.  Or like 
                        take a walk after dinner.

           Olivia looks at Gus who is trying all too hard.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Sounds great!  I have to run to 
                        soccer practice, but I’ll see you 
                        soon!

           Olivia and Gus continue to walk towards the West Sound 
           Cafe. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        She’s sixteen Gus.

                                 GUS
                        I’m not interested in hearing your 
                        monologue on that.  Thank you 
                        though.

           Olivia pushes Gus off the sidewalk.

           INT. WEST SOUND CAFE - DAY

           West Sound Cafe is a local cafe that has been around 
           since the 70’s. The owner and chef, CHARLOTTE (70) is a 
           chain smoking, chubby, short-haired, sexually ambiguous 
           woman.  She wears long acrylic nails and has to use a pen 
           when she pushes the buttons on the cash register.  She 
           turns to Olivia and Gus as they enter.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Gus! Olivia!

                                 GUS
                        Hi Charlotte.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi Charlotte, how are you?

           Olivia leans in and gives Charlotte a kiss on the cheek.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well, I’m great now!  We needed a 
                        dose of you around here.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Ohh Charlotte, I don’t know about 
                        that.

           GABE (28) walks in from the swinging door to the kitchen.  
           He wears pocketed cargo shorts, a bowling shirt and 
           Simples shoes.  His hair, longer in the back, closely 
           borders a mullet.  Gabe has practiced Jujitsu since he 
           was ten, which has given him an oddly strong sense of 
           confidence.  

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Gabe, look who’s here.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gabe!  How are you?  I haven’t 
                        seen you in so long!  

           Gabe walks over towards Olivia and Gus.  

                                 GABE
                                 (to Gus)
                        Hey, what’s up, you weasel?

           Gus is slightly taken aback by Gabe’s over familiarity 
           but covers.  

                                 GUS
                        Not much dude. Happy to have 
                        Biggens home.

           Olivia elbows Gus for his use of “Biggens.”  It’s clear 
           that Gabe is only interested in seeing Olivia.

                                 GABE
                        Hey Olivia, how are you?  Needed a 
                        break from Manhattan?  Must be a 
                        real drag having to deal with that 
                        World Trade Center shit.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah.  I guess... That was like 
                        over ten years ago - 

                                 GABE
                        Never forget, right?  Well it’s 
                        awesome to see you, I hope you 
                        visit a lot while you’re here.

           Olivia smiles, so does Charlotte.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 OLIVIA
                        I will.  

                                 GABE
                        What can I get you?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Two turkey sandwiches on 
                        sourdough.

           Olivia looks at Gus, he nods.  As Gabe walks to the 
           kitchen -

                                 GABE
                        Two turkey sandwiches coming up 
                        for the young ladies.

           Gus gives a look to Olivia.

           EXT. ORCAS ISLAND TOWN STREET - SAME

           Olivia and Gus walk down the street.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don’t call me Biggens.  That’s 
                        such a dick thing to say.  I’m not 
                        even fat anymore.  

                                 GUS
                        I can’t promise that.

                                 OLIVIA
                        So how is being home?

                                 GUS
                        Mom tells a lot of long circular 
                        stories.  And leaves unemployment 
                        articles on my desk.  She also has 
                        somehow gotten me to go to the 
                        farmer’s market with her every 
                        week.

                                 OLIVIA
                        That doesn’t sound bad.

                                 GUS
                        Yeah, but she makes me carry this 
                        weird canvas bag with a cat on it.  
                        And sometimes she makes me pay for 
                        my groceries because she wants to 
                        make a point about being 
                        financially independent.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Wow.

                                 GUS
                        Dad chain smokes in the woods like 
                        a sad goth teenager and Mom 
                        funnels wine.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I guess thirty years does that to 
                        you.

                                 GUS
                        Almost thirty years. Mom’s been 
                        talking about their anniversary a 
                        lot.

                                 OLIVIA
                        She’ll probably throw glitter in 
                        dad’s face and then tell him to 
                        clean it up.  

                                 GUS
                        I hope there’s a cake.

           INT. GEDDES HOME - MORNING

           Olivia and Gus walk in the front door and to the kitchen.  
           The house is filled with Alex’s paintings.  In addition 
           to the walls, many are stacked around and leaning against 
           various surfaces.  Gus immediately goes to the 
           refrigerator, Olivia looks through the mail.  She goes to 
           pour herself a glass of wine but thinks better of it as 
           she uncorks the bottle.  Instead she eats an apple.

                                 OLIVIA
                        (yells to upstairs)
                        Mom, what’s for dinner?

                                 SOPHIE (O.C.)
                        I don’t know, what are you making?

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (to Gus)
                        I didn’t hear that. 

           Leelee enters the kitchen dressed in a glittery dress, 
           smoking a cigarette and holding a vodka & milk.  Sophie 
           follows her, holding a glass of wine.

                                 LEELEE
                        No!  You can’t change this God 
                        damn mind.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 SOPHIE
                        Mom, it’s three miles away.

                                 LEELEE
                        I’m walking there.  Just like I 
                        walked to Broadway.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Mom.  You weren’t on Broadway.  A 
                        stint at a Portland community 
                        theatre does not an acting career 
                        make.

                                 LEELEE
                        Tell that to Chekhov.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I don’t have his number.

                                 LEELEE
                        I wish I had a son.

           Leelee pours more vodka & milk into her glass as the 
           family watches silently and then walks back upstairs.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who wants a glass of wine?

           Sophie uncorks a bottle and fills up her half full glass 
           to the very top.  Olivia immediately grabs the keys on 
           the table and starts to walk out the front door.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m going to take a drive, okay to 
                        use your car?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yeah, where are you going?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Where am I going?

                                 SOPHIE
                        No, my other daughter.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh me...I’m going to pick up some 
                        toiletries I forgot.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Let’s pick up your rental car

                        Alex was supposed to get it, I 
                        guess I should have made that more 
                        of a command and less of a 
                        request.  Bye honey. 

           Sophie kisses her on the cheek and takes a sip of wine.

           EXT. ORCAS COMMUNITY CENTER - MORNING

           Olivia pulls up to the community center AA meeting and 
           gets out of her car.  She walks towards the entrance 
           where she sees about ten people ranging in age standing 
           out front.  Most of them are smoking

           Olivia walks further towards them.  When she gets close 
           enough to start a conversation, she turns around and 
           walks back to the car.

           EXT.  GEDDES OUTDOOR PORCH - NIGHT

           Sophie, Alex, Gus, Olivia and Leelee sit around the table 
           eating dinner.  

           Leelee is wearing a hat with a veil covering and gloves.  
           She smokes a cigarette at the table and sips her vodka & 
           milk through a straw.

                                 GUS
                        Leelee do you want some pasta?

                                 LEELEE
                        A moment on the lips, a lifetime 
                        on the hips.

                        girl #2 for the rest of my life, 
                        I’m not eating.

           Alex and Gus laugh, Sophie gives them a look while 
           stirring a Bloody Mary with a large celery stalk.

                                 GUS  
                        I’ll take that as a “no.”

                        Good idea.  So Liv, tell us more 
                        about what happened with the job.

                        There just isn’t enough money.  
                        Circulation is bad.  They’ve been 
                        doing cutbacks since last 
                        February, I think everyone just 
                        thought it was tapering off.

                                 GUS
                        Biggens got fired.

                        That was ten years ago!  When you 
                        were fat!

                        Well, I think it could be nice to 
                        take a class while you’re here. 
                        Maybe you could do a singing class 
                        at the community center.  I so 
                        wish you would.

                        One sec, I’ll be right back.

           Olivia heads into the living room and dials Maggie from 
           her phone.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Maggie, I’m taking your advice and 
                        trying not to trust my instincts.  
                        Things are going really great!

                        Call me back when you take a break 
                        from your functioning, domestic, 
                        normal, happy life that I don’t

           INT.  EAST SOUND LIBRARY - DAY

           Olivia sits at a table, she wears her glasses and reads 
           the Big Book, 1st Edition in hardback - she is midway 
           through the first chapter: Bill’s Story.

           Her phone rings, she gets looks from people sitting near 
           her, and presses ignore.

           She closes the book and goes to the check out counter.

           EXT. EAST SOUND LIBRARY - SAME

           Olivia walks out the front door to her rental car, a 
           Nissan Cube.  She sees a good looking man roller blade 
           by.  It is STEPHEN BLACK (38), her high school history 
           teacher.  He wears wrist guards, a helmet and a messenger 
           bag and is dressed in a white collared shirt with a 
           sweater and jeans, his left ear is pierced.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mr. Black?

           Stephen is caught off guard, tries to stop, awkwardly 
           blades past her and then swerves around.  He comes over 
           to Olivia and takes off his helmet.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hello?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mr. Black, it’s Olivia Geddes.  
                        Remember me?  I was in your class 
                        about ten years ago.

           He doesn’t recognize her.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Olivia!  Of course!...Wow, hi, 
                        really nice to see you.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you living here now?

                                 OLIVIA
                        God no...  I’m sorry, I didn’t 
                        mean it like that.

                        parents.  So no, just for a 
                        little.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What are you doing these days 
                        in...?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I live in New York, I work for 
                        Convention magazine.  I’m on a 
                        kind of travelling hiatus, so 
                        decided to come here for a little.  
                        Are you still teaching at 
                        Prescott?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Yeah.  I’m still there.  Teaching 
                        tenth grade.  Convention?  Major 
                        props to you...Is this your car?

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s all they had at the rental 
                        place.  It’s awful.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        I have one too.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (recovering)
                        It drives really well.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You look so different and older.  
                        You were a little... You know 
                        like...

                                 OLIVIA
                        I lost some weight.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh did you?  I didn’t mean that, 
                        No no, I didn’t mean that in that 
                        way, I just mean you look great. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Thank you. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Not that you didn’t look great.  
                        You were just sweet and young 
                        and...

           Olivia’s phone rings, she ignores it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well... my point in saying that to 
                        you was that you look good.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        No...Thank you.

                        Sorry, it’s my mom.

           She answers, turning away slightly.

                        Hey mom, what’s up?...This 
                        morning, she was there...no I’m 
                        sure she is....alright, it’s fine 
                        don’t worry...coming right now.

           Olivia hangs up the phone.

                        I have to go find my grandma who’s

                                 STEPHEN
                        I hope she’s okay.

                                 OLIVIA
                        She’ll be fine, she’s probably 
                        just topless at the gas station 
                        again or something.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well if you want to grab coffee or 
                        dinner or something - how long are 
                        you here for again?

                                 OLIVIA
                        A few months.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well, let me know.  

           Olivia pulls a pen out from her bag and a scrap piece of 
           paper - it is the AA pamphlet. Without realizing this, 
           she writes her number on it and hands it to him.

           Once she notices, she immediately grabs it back, 
           awkwardly rips off the small corner with her number on it 
           and hands it back.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Sorry... it just was a lot of 
                        paper for such a little number.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Okay...Great to see you.  Bye 
                        Olivia.

           Stephen blades off, Olivia walks over to her car.

           INT. GEDDES HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

           Olivia walks in the door to find Sophie and Leelee 
           sitting in the living room reading.  Sophie drinks a 
           Bloody Mary, Leelee drinks a vodka & milk.  Leelee is 
           wearing garish stage makeup.

           Olivia stands there.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Guess you found her?

                        forgot to tell you, but I’m glad 
                        you’re home.  Want to go on a 
                        hike?

                                 LEELEE
                        Good idea.  Maybe you can finally 
                        lose that baby weight.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Leelee!  Don’t talk to her like 
                        that.

                                 LEELEE

                        Don’t talk to her like that.

           Sophie downs her drink.

                        Curing that hangover with a 
                        morning cocktail?

                        being gone so you could get me to 
                        go on a hike?

                        Fine, we don’t have to go.

           They walk for a moment in silence.

                        Listen, I don’t want to beat a 
                        dead horse, but if you want to

                        career path I chose, right?...I’ll 
                        think about it.

                        So what’s going on with boys in 
                        New York.  Are you going with 
                        anyone?

                        I mean yeah.  No one who I really

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mom!

                                 SOPHIE
                        Olivia!  Have an open mind.  Come 
                        on.  Weird?  No, he’s a great boy.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mom, you can not do this.  I’m not 
                        a child.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You sound just like your dad.  
                        Maybe he won’t call.

                                 OLIVIA
                        When did you give him my number?

           Sophie doesn’t say anything.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        When?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Today.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I literally have no words.  Great.  
                        I can’t say “no” now, can I?
                        Just don’t talk to me for a 
                        minute.

                                 SOPHIE
                        How could it hurt?

                                 OLIVIA
                        You don’t listen to me at all, do 
                        you?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Okay, okay.  I’m sorry.  I just 
                        want you to be happy!  Maybe I 
                        shouldn’t have done that. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maybe?  I’m almost 30!  You can’t 
                        do this.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Alright, alright.  Let’s not let 
                        it ruin the hike.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay.  I’ll just let it ruin my 
                        life.

           Sophie puts her arm around Olivia and kisses her 
           forehead.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You are so dramatic.  
           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Olivia sits down at her computer, a blank Word document 
           is open.  She types “I” and erases it.  She types “The 
           thing is” and erases it.  She types “I don’t want to do 
           this” and closes her computer.

           Sophie comes by her room and leans her head in.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Are you around for dinner?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh...No...I have to go to get 
                        ...gear. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        You already got all of your 
                        toiletries?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I mean...camping...gear...for Gus.  
                        Because he’s thinking about doing 
                        that trip.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What trip?  What are you talking 
                        about?

                                 OLIVIA
                        With the...boys, to that...place.  
                        He hasn’t told you because he’s 
                        not sure if he’s doing it.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Okay, well I’ll leave food out in 
                        case you want it later.

           Sophie heads downstairs.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (to herself)
                        A simple “no” would have sufficed.

           EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

           Olivia pulls up to the meeting and gets out of her car.  
           She’s on her phone.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maggie, I’ve got to go, I’ll call 
                        you later if I haven’t drowned 
                        myself at the community pool.

           CONTINUED:

           She hangs up and walks towards a crowd of smokers and 
           again when she gets close enough to start a conversation 
           walks away from the meeting and heads back to her car.  
           Then thinks better of it, turns around again and walks 
           back to the center.  She walks past the crowd and goes 
           inside.  

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME

           She finds a seat in a folded chair at the back of the 
           space.  People walk in and the meeting begins.  Olivia 
           can’t stop looking around, feeling very out of place.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME

           Olivia stands, holding hands with the people next to her 
           on either side.  In unison - 

                                 AA GROUP
                        Keep coming back.  It works if you 
                        work it.

           Olivia quickly drops the hands of her neighbors, gathers 
           her things and heads towards the door. 

           She grabs a cookie from the snack table.  Then thinks 
           again and grabs another cookie and a brownie.

           She hands a form to the AA VOLUNTEER.  She needs a 
           signature as these are court-appointed AA meetings.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Can you sign this?

           The VOLUNTEER takes it, signs it, and hands it back to 
           her.

                                 VOLUNTEER
                        Have a good night.

           Olivia walks out.

           EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME

           Olivia spots Charlotte across the street carrying food 
           from the market to her car.  She runs and hides behind a 
           bush in front of the church.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Charlotte gets in her car and drives away.  Olivia sits 
           down where she is hiding behind the bush and lights a 
           cigarette while eating her baked goods.  She takes a few 
           deep breaths and then her phone rings.

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Olivia is in her room that looks out on to the dock and 
           the water.  She can see several islands in the distance, 
           a garden directly below.  She sits cross-legged in a 
           chair at her desk that looks out the window and smokes a 
           cigarette.  She flips through the Big Book and comes 
           across the “Women Suffer Too” chapter.  Her computer is 
           open next to her, a blank Word document on the screen.

                                 OLIVIA
                        So I’m not alone.

           There is a knock and then Sophie tries to open Olivia’s 
           door, Olivia drops her cigarette on the ground and 
           hurriedly tries to pick it up.

                                 SOPHIE (O.C.)
                        Olivia?  Come on, everyone’s in 
                        the car.

           Panicked, she starts to wave her hands to get the smoke 
           away from her.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m changing, be down in a second 
                        Mom.

                                 SOPHIE (O.C.)
                        No, I’m not wearing a vest.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What?  I didn’t say that mom.  
                        Just go down, I’m coming!

           Olivia waves her hands frantically to get the smoke out 
           of the room.

           EXT. GEDDES HOME - NIGHT, CONTINUOUS

           Alex and Gus wait in the car.  Olivia walks out the front 
           door, followed by Sophie.  They both walk towards the 
           car, Sophie gets in, Olivia talks to her dad through the 
           window.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mom was yelling at me and Leelee 
                        isn’t even ready?

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Your mother’s drunk.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        I am not Alex!

                        Just get in the God damn car.  You 
                        take forever.  This isn’t New 
                        York, you don’t have to impress 
                        anyone.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Dad, three people know about this 
                        restaurant and six people live 
                        here, I think we’ll get in.

                                 ALEX
                        Get.  In the car.

           Olivia gets in the car as Leelee walks out of the house 
           wearing an outfit that resembles Heidi/a Swedish school 
           girl, her short wispy hair is in braids.  It’s just 
           awful. 

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you wearing?

                                 LEELEE
                        Sorry, you wouldn’t get it. 

           She signals at Sophie while still talking to Alex

                                 LEELEE (CONT’D)
                        At least I don’t look like a 
                        downtrodden prostitute.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Thanks Mom.

           Leelee gets in the car.

           INT. CORA’S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The Geddes walk inside the restaurant as Gabe and 
           Charlotte walk out.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well hello!

                        Charlotte!  This is quite a 
                        surprise.

           CONTINUED:

           Sophie, tipsy, hugs Charlotte for an inappropriately long 
           amount of time.  Olivia stands off to the side, Gabe 
           approaches her as the others talk.

                                 GABE
                        Hey!  I left you a message.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey, yeah, I’m sorry, I’ve just 
                        been so busy with being back.  I 
                        was going to call.

                                 GABE
                        How does dinner on Thursday night 
                        sound?

           Olivia is trapped.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It sounds great.

           Charlotte walks over to Olivia and Gabe.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Gabe, you’ve got to get this old 
                        whale to bed.

                                 GABE

                        You used to be a whale, now you’re 
                        a dolphin.  And quite a pretty 
                        one.

                                 OLIVIA

                        I’ll pick you up at 7?

                        Looking forward to it.

           Gabe and Charlotte leave, Olivia walks towards her 
           family. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Gabe is just about as cute as he 
                        can be.

                                 LEELEE
                        I’d give him a bobo.

                        Please just...No.

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - EVENING, A FEW DAYS LATER

           Olivia gets dressed and puts on make up. Standing in 
           front of the mirror she purses her lips and does a few 
           subtle poses to herself.  She doesn’t realize that Gus 
           has come in her room and is watching her.  Suddenly she 
           sees that he is there, he stares at her critically.

                                 GUS
                        Change who you are.

           Gus walks out of the room.  Olivia is left to feel like 
           an idiot.  

           INT. GEDDES KITCHEN - EVENING

           Olivia sees a corked wine bottle on the table.  Without 
           thinking, she grabs a glass and pours herself wine.  She 
           takes a sip and then snaps out of it and realizes what 
           she is doing.

           She runs to the sink and spits it out.  She puts her 
           hands to her head and quietly berates herself.

                                 OLIVIA
                        How?  How do you forget that?

           The doorbell rings.

           EXT. GEDDES HOME - EVENING

           Olivia goes to the door and opens it to Gabe, he is 
           standing very close to the front door. Their faces are 
           very close to each other.  She closes the door behind her 
           and steps out on to the porch.  He reaches out his hand, 
           she goes for a hug, awkward physical misinterpretation 
           which somehow ends up in a high five.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey, what’s up?

                                 GABE
                        So glad we got to do this.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Me too.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GABE
                        Alright, so are you good with 
                        dinner?  That cool?

                                 OLIVIA
                        That cool.

           They walk down the steps and get in to Gabe’s truck.  
           They both put on their seat belts in silence.  As soon as 
           Jake turns on the car, “Walking on Broken Glass” by Annie 
           Lennox plays very loudly.  Gabe turns down the music 
           immediately. 

           He drives haphazardly.  Olivia grips the seat.  

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        So...New York, the Big A.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yup.

           Long silence.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        So, what have you been up to?

                                 GABE
                        Well I’m working at West Sound 
                        Cafe and  then a little on the 
                        boats at Deer Harbor and then 
                        illustrating.

                                 OLIVIA
                        How is work at the dock?

                                 GABE
                        The sound of my boss’s voice 
                        literally gives me diarrhea.

           Olivia is visibly uncomfortable.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Wow...  Well, what are you 
                        illustrating?

                                 GABE
                        A children’s book my aunt wrote.  
                        It’s about Mikey, he is a 
                        frustrated photographer.

                                 OLIVIA
                        How old is Mikey?

                                 GABE
                        Eight.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well it’s a tough profession at 
                        that age.

                                 GABE
                        You’re telling me.  He’s pretty 
                        fed up.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’d love to see it.

                                 GABE
                        When I get the drawings down, I’ll 
                        let you take a look.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What’s wrong with the drawings?

                                 GABE
                        I want them to look like a kid 
                        drew them.  They don’t really. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        You’re right-handed?  

                                 GABE
                        Yes.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You should try using your left 
                        hand?

                                 GABE
                        You’re so cool.  That answer was 
                        very “New York.”

           Olivia grimaces.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay.

                                 GABE
                        So... I’m surprised your mom said 
                        that you wanted to go on a date 
                        with me.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well I haven’t seen you in a long 
                        time Gabe, it’s nice to get a 
                        chance to catch up.

                                 GABE
                        I made a reservation at 
                        Portofino’s if that sounds okay?

                                 GABE
                        No, anywhere you want.

                                 OLIVIA
                        That’s where I want Gabe.

                                 GABE
                        Then we’ll go there.  God you’re 
                        pushy!

           Gabe loves his joke.

           EXT. PORTOFINO’S PIZZA RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Gabe pulls up to the restaurant and parks the car.  He 
           insists on getting the door for Olivia and they head 
           inside.

           INT. PORTOFINO’S PIZZA RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Olivia and Gabe walk towards the hostess stand, no one is 
           there.  Gabe rings the bell that sits on the stand.  

           A HOSTESS approaches them.

                                 GABE
                        I have a reservation under Gabe.

           The restaurant is virtually empty except for one couple 
           in the corner.  The hostess stares at Gabe and at the 
           table across the room with a large reserved sign on it.   
           She walks towards it carrying two menus, Gabe and Olivia 
           follow.

           They silently peruse the menus.  Then both put their 
           menus down and look around.

           A WAITRESS (30’s) walks in front of their table two 
           times, they both try to get her attention to no avail.

           Finally - 

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        (yelling)
                        A little help here?

           Gabe is too loud, Olivia looks down with embarrassment. A 
           waitress walks over. Off her look - 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                 (joking)
                        I didn’t think you would get the 
                        full effect of my desperation if I 
                        didn’t yell.  Me need pizza!!  

           The waitress and Gabe stare at each other.  He laughs, 
           she scours.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’ll just have a plain cheese 
                        slice.

           The waitress stares at Olivia.

                                 GABE
                        Same.

                                 WAITRESS
                        To drink?

                                 OLIVIA
                        A Diet Coke please.

                                 GABE
                        I’m fine with water.

           The waitress is still staring at Olivia, Gabe picks up 
           the menus, hands them to her.  She walks off.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        Grah-see-as.

                                 OLIVIA
                        She seemed like she was really 
                        warming up to me.

                                 GABE
                        Don’t worry about her.  She’s an 
                        asshole, I know her sister...
                        Hey I thought I saw your dad the 
                        other day.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You did?

                                 GABE
                        Yeah, but it was Mrs. Garrett.  He 
                        looks exactly like a woman from 
                        behind.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’ll let him know.

                        It smells like the Pirates of the 
                        Caribbean ride in here.

           More silence.

                                 OLIVIA
                        So... do you see anyone from 
                        Prescott at all?

                                 GABE
                        There’s a lot of people still 
                        here, kind of scattered around.  
                        Remember Joe Landies?  He runs the 
                        skate park.  And Alison Clements 
                        works at Karen’s health food 
                        store.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Have you thought about leaving?

                                 GABE
                        I’ve got to take care of my aunt.  
                        She’s getting older.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well it’s great she has you... oh 
                        my God, you know who I saw the 
                        other day?

                                 GABE
                        Who?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mr. Black!

                        Stephen?  He’s a douchey tool.

                                 OLIVIA
                        He seemed great to me.

                                 GABE
                        Let me guess, you think he’s hot?

                        Well I don’t think he’s ugly.

                                 GABE
                        Whatever.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well are you seeing anyone now?

                        Let’s just say, I found out we 
                        weren’t on the same page about 
                        cats.

                        I didn’t either...

           Olivia is confused but decides not to ask anything

                        Why don’t you dye your hair, I

           INT. GABE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Gabe speeds through a red light.

                                 OLIVIA
                        (softly)
                        That was a red light.

           Gabe doesn’t hear her, she is visibly uncomfortable.  He 
           swerves to a stop in front of her house.

                                 GABE
                        This is you.

           Olivia jolts forward.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Thanks for dinner Gabe.

           He leans in for a kiss.  Olivia leans back.

                                 GABE
                        Wow.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 GABE
                        Yeah, no.  It’s all good.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You sure?

                                 GABE
                        I mean you totally misled me but 
                        it’s fine.

           Olivia looks at him, not knowing what to say.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t laugh at me with your eyes.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I wasn’t laughing at you...with my 
                        eyes.  I just thought we were 
                        catching up.

           Silence, Gabe will not look at her.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Alright, I’m going to go Gabe.  
                        Thank you again.  

           Olivia opens the door and gets out.  Gabe screeches off.

           INT. GEDDES KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sophie and Gus are sitting in the kitchen.  Olivia walks 
           in the room.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        How was it?

           Olivia stares at her for a long moment and walks 
           upstairs.

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Olivia is on the phone.

                        not to have it and why I shouldn’t

                        don’t want to find a meeting

                        sponsor!!  I could sue you.

           Olivia hangs up the phone and throw it across the room.

                                 SOPHIE (O.C.)
                        Who are you yelling at?

                                 OLIVIA
                        My bank!

           Olivia takes a breath.  She gets out a cigarette and 
           lights it near the window.  

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - DAY

           Olivia is sitting in the back.  The AA LEADER is at the 
           podium introducing the evening.  He reads the “AA 
           Preamble.”

                                                                  CUT TO:

           The Leader points at JULIE CHANDLER, she heads up to the 
           podium and immediately launches into her speech.

                        Easter 1998, I find myself 
                        bottomless on the roof of my 
                        neighbor’s car.

           EXT. GEDDES HOME - DAY

           Olivia sits outside at a table, she holds a legal pad and 
           looks over her “Moral Inventory,” and then turns the 
           page.  At the top it says “Amends” and has a list of 
           names written below.  She circles one of the names.   

           Olivia stands up, picks up the portable phone and dials, 
           pacing back and forth.  

           As soon as it starts ringing, Olivia hangs up, and puts 
           the phone down.  She turns and walks inside.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Going to need a few more weeks for 
                        that call.

           INT. GEDDES HOME - KITCHEN

           Olivia watches “Cast Away” on TV while her dad eats a 
           bagel with cream cheese and reads the paper.  Gus walks 
           into the kitchen.

                                 GUS
                        Percentage wise, how much of that 
                        do you think will end up in your 
                        beard?

           Alex doesn’t respond.  Olivia gestures to the TV.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It just sucks for him.  Because he 
                        gets blonde and thin when no one 
                        can see him.  

                                 GUS

           Olivia’s cell phone rings.  Gus grabs it.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Give it to me.

           Gus runs around the kitchen island with Olivia’s phone.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)

                        You’re such a fucking baby.

           Gus throws her phone at Olivia.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You’re such an idiot asshole!

           Gus walks out, Olivia answers the phone.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?...yeah, nothing much.  
                        Good...You?..Okay...that 
                        works?...Perfect.  See you 
                        tomorrow.  

           She takes a deep breath.  Opens her computer and checks 
           her e-mail.  There is a new e-mail from Jerry: “Don’t 
           lose sight of what you need to do Geddes - Jerry.”

           Olivia types back: “Yes Master” and presses send.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Olivia jogs slowly while Alex walks next to her.  She is 
           in workout clothes, he is in his paint covered jeans and 
           shoes.  

           They pass West Sound Cafe, Alex loops back and heads 
           inside.  Olivia follows.

                                 ALEX

                        Sure they do.

           INT. WEST SOUND CAFE - DAY

           Olivia and Alex sit at a booth.  Gabe comes to the table 
           and immediately stiffens.  He sets down menus.

                                 GABE

           He doesn’t look at Olivia, while he talks.

                        got to be worthy.

           Alex sees Gabe animatedly talking to himself behind the 
           counter.

                        What is this?  With the freaking

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nothing.

                        Make you fat?  If you don’t want 
                        the milk shake, don’t drink it.  
                        But don’t involve me with your 
                        weird food issues.  You can talk 
                        to me Liv, I’m not your mother.  

           Olivia is silent.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?  Does this have 
                        to do with your job?  New York?  
                        Jake?  Your mother?  My mother?  
                        Am I getting close?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’ve got to tell you something.

                        Yes?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m not just home because I lost 
                        my job. 

                                 ALEX
                        Well that’s pretty obvious.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I was fired because I have a 
                        drinking problem and I can only 
                        get my job back when I’m sober. 

                                 ALEX
                        Well...wow.  

           Alex sits silently for a moment, Gabe comes by with the 
           two milk shakes and sets them down.

                                 GABE
                        Listen, you guys.  If you need 
                        help workshopping any of this 
                        stuff out, just let me know.

                        Fuck off?

           Olivia nods her head, Gabe walks away.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Please talk to me.

                                 ALEX
                        Okay.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well?

                        Don’t act like you told me that 
                        dinner was ready.  I don’t know 
                        what to say yet.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m sorry.

                        Are you okay?  I mean, are you 
                        going to be okay?  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes. In time.  I’m trying really 
                        hard.  I’m not ready to tell Mom 
                        yet.  She’ll think it’s her fault.

           Alex takes Olivia’s hand.

                                 ALEX
                        You know...you’re predisposed to 
                        this.

                        Why don’t you say something to 
                        her?

                                 ALEX
                        I have.  Many times.  She’s not 
                        ready to listen but she’s getting 
                        there.  You’ve missed a lot.  
                        Thanksgiving was like a Tennessee 
                        Williams play this year - 
                        everybody started crying at 10 am 
                        ...I...just...how did I not know 
                        anything?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I would have never let you know.

                                 ALEX
                        Don’t do that again.  Some secrets 
                        are pointless.

           Olivia takes her dad’s hand.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I want a drink.

           INT. DEER HARBOR COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

           Stephen and Olivia sit across from each other drinking 
           coffee mid-conversation.  Any trace of Olivia’s earlier 
           upset is gone.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’ve got to get out to New York.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You think you’ll stay?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Definitely...You seem like you’re 
                        doing really great.  How’s 
                        history?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It hasn’t changed much.

           Olivia laughs.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for laughing at that.

           A WAITRESS approaches.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Hi guys, I’m sorry but we’re 
                        closing up.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh no problem, thank you. (to 
                        Olivia) Do you want to come over?  
                        Maybe have a drink?  I mean, 
                        obviously no pressure.

           She laughs.

                                 OLIVIA
                        That sounds nice.  I’m going to 
                        run to the restroom, I’ll meet you 
                        at the car.

           Stephen walks out, Olivia walks towards the bathroom, 
           pulls out her phone and dials Maggie.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m messing it up.  I 
                        think I need a drink or this is 
                        going to be so stiff and weird.

                                 MAGGIE (O.C.)
                        No, you don’t.  Can you please not 
                        do the self pity act?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Maggie, I haven’t hooked up with 
                        someone sober since I was in camp. 
                        Like 16.

                        I really loved camp.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay, well it’s still enjoyable.  
                        And here’s the thing, if it 
                        doesn’t work out with him there 
                        are other people.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No!  I want it to work out with 
                        him!  I really like him!

                                 MAGGIE (O.C.)
                        You have to stop doing this.  
                        You’re going into this like you’re 
                        looking for a life partner.  Don’t 
                        do that.  You want a boyfriend?  
                        You want love?  Love is your 
                        husband never wanting to fuck 
                        another woman and it’s hard to 
                        find.  So just calm down, okay?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I have to go.  Thank you.

                                 MAGGIE (O.C.)
                        Maybe one of these phone calls 
                        will be about me and my life, my 
                        unborn child.  All of these are 
                        topics on the table.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes, definitely.  Love you.

           Olivia hangs up and walks out to Stephen’s car.

           INT. STEPHEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Stephen’s house is a craftsman house, very simple.  
           Stephen pours two glasses of white wine and hands one to 
           Olivia.  

           He swirls his wine glass and smells it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s Gavi.  Fruity, persistent, 
                        balanced.

           Olivia smells her glass too.

           She is mocking Stephen.  He’s oblivious and nods with 
           enthusiasm.  

           Olivia walks around the house looking at the walls.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        I love this house.

           She stops at a photo.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Where is this?

           Stephen walks over and looks at the picture.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Berlin.  Have you been there?

                                 OLIVIA
                        No. 

                                 STEPHEN
                        You have to go.  It’s amazing.  It 
                        looks like an unfinished tomorrow 
                        land.  Is the wine okay?

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s great.

           She browses his CD collection - UB40, Train, James Taylor 
           & Carole King: In Concert.

           Stephen and Olivia stand in the hallway, neither speak.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s getting late, I should 
                        probably go.

           Olivia gets her bag and walks to the front of the house.  
           Stephen is right behind her.  Olivia looks outside and 
           notices that it is raining.  

                                 STEPHEN
                        Let me get you an umbrella.

           Stephen starts to walk back in to the house, Olivia 
           follows him and before he grabs the umbrella, he turns 
           and kisses her.  

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re really pretty.

           Olivia kisses him in response, they head to the couch.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. - STEPHEN’S LIVING ROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Olivia and Stephen look a bit disheveled, she puts her 
           sweater back on, he buttons his pants.

           Olivia walks towards the front door.  She trips over his 
           helmet. She picks it up and hands it to Stephen.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Your helmet, Sir.

           He takes it and gives her a quick kiss, she walks out the 
           front door.

           INT. OLIVIA’S CAR - SAME

           Olivia talks on her cell phone to Maggie.  Maggie watches 
           TV with her husband.  Intercut between them.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You really don’t have to call me 
                        for every step of this.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I think I referred to myself as a 
                        cinefile at one point, I don’t 
                        know I’m trying to black out 
                        certain parts.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Shut up, it sounds like he’s a hot 
                        weird nature dude.

                        Kind of, he carries a Klean 
                        Kantine.  He’s really smart though 
                        and nice.

                        Oh God Olivia, don’t use the word 
                        nice.  It’s insulting, it doesn’t 
                        mean anything.

                                 OLIVIA
                        He’s interesting.  Okay, I just 
                        got home, going to bed.  

           Olivia pulls up to her house.

                        Next time, don’t wear a condom so 
                        you can get pregnant and we can 
                        have kids at the same time and 
                        they’ll grow up best friends like 
                        us!

                        Anyway, how are you?

                        Oh please.

           EXT. GEDDES HOUSE - NIGHT

           Olivia’s car pulls in the driveway at her house.  She 
           gets out of the car and walks in the front door.  

           INT. GEDDES KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Olivia doesn’t see Sophie sitting at the kitchen counter, 
           drinking a glass of wine.

                                 SOPHIE
                        How was the night?

           Olivia, surprised, drops her purse.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Jesus Christ mom!

                                 SOPHIE
                        You don’t have to bring him into 
                        this.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You scared me.  

           Olivia picks up her purse and looks at Sophie’s wine 
           glass.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you have a cut off point?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Give it a rest Olivia.

                        Um, it was good.  Actually, really 
                        fun.

           Sophie gets up to head upstairs.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m glad you had fun.

           Sophie walks by her and kisses the top of her head. 

           INT. GEDDES HOME - MORNING

           Olivia washes her hair.  Brushes her teeth.  Puts on a 
           sweatshirt, jeans and shoes.  No makeup.

           Her dad walks into her room.

                        Hey honey, you know if you ever 
                        want me to go to one of these 
                        meetings with you, I will.  
                        Really, any time.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Thanks Dad, I think I’m okay for 
                        now.

                                 ALEX

                        You’re the man now Dog.

           Olivia looks at him, confused.

                        Okay...Thanks Dad.

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - MORNING

           Olivia sits towards the front of an AA meeting. It is 
           raining outside.  Gabe sits in a row midway back, neither 
           Olivia nor Gabe can see each other.  The speaker is 
           winding up his speech.  

                                 AA SPEAKER
                        I used what we call an emergency 
                        God.  I was never religious.  Only 
                        when I was in trouble.

                        And then, God got a long, 
                        complicated phone call from me.  I 
                        always asked him to clean up the 
                        mess, kind of like a housekeeper. 
                        It was a lot of “Hi God, I know we 
                        haven’t talked in a little while 
                        but I crashed my girlfriend’s car 
                        while I was driving another girl 
                        in it, no, we’re totally just 
                        friends, but I need my girlfriend 
                        to accept my apology so she can 
                        pay my rent.”  Or “God, really 
                        need you to step in here, I showed 
                        up at the PTA meeting drunk and 
                        need a good old explanation out of 
                        this one.  Actually need two, one 
                        for my wife and one for my kid.”  
                        My disease taught me that a quick 
                        fix, can further the break.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           People mull around.  Olivia gets her jacket and walks to 
           the back table where she gets her court-ordered AA 
           attendance papers signed. There is a big cluster of 
           smokers outside, she walks further away from the church 
           and spots Gabe.  They both hold umbrellas. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gabe?  Hi!  I didn’t know that you 
                        went to these?

                                 GABE
                        I knew there was something wrong 
                        with you.

           Olivia starts to walk away and then turns around and 
           walks back over to Gabe.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Please don’t be mad at me.

                                 GABE
                        I just don’t know why you would 
                        ever go out with that tool.

                        He wears a cell phone clip and 
                        texts with his pointer fingers.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I have noticed that.

                                 GABE
                        He told me “Fried Green Tomatoes” 
                        was his favorite movie.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gabe...now you’re just lying.
                        Do you have anymore?  Or are you 
                        done?

           Gabe starts to say something and then stops himself - 

                                 GABE
                        Okay, I’m done.

                        I’m really done.  I just think you 
                        should be careful.  He’s not a 
                        good guy.

                        Technically, you shouldn’t be

                        Right, so I’ve heard.  It looks 
                        like we have a lot more in common 
                        than I thought.

                        about six years now.  You?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m fairly new.  I’ve officially

                        month.

                        It’s okay.  Something is wrong

           Gabe lights a cigarette and offers it to Oliva.

                        I’m sorry twice.

                                 GABE
                        It’s okay.  So how is this going 
                        for you?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m getting more used to it.  I’m 
                        not in love with all the God talk.

                        There are no atheists in

                                 GABE
                        It’s not about loving yourself, 
                        it’s about liking yourself.  Well, 
                        being able to stand yourself.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you need a ride?

           Gabe nods.  Olivia and Gabe walk to the car.

           INT. OLIVIA’S CAR - SAME

           Olivia drives down Gabe’s street.

                        Wait.  I have a question.  What do 
                        I do if I need to talk to someone 
                        but there isn’t a meeting or 
                        something.  I’ve had to literally 
                        lock myself in the bathroom so I 
                        don’t go have a drink. 

                                 GABE
                        You can call me.  I mean, if you 
                        want, you can call me and I’ll 
                        talk to you.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t want to tell you the 
                        embarrassing shit I do.

                        I crashed my dad’s tractor into a 
                        house.  Do you know how slow a 
                        tractor goes?  You have about 
                        fifteen minutes to stop before you 
                        hit something.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay.

                                 GABE
                        Want to watch Transformers 3 
                        tonight?  It will blow your balls 
                        off.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (laughing)
                        I can’t.

                                 GABE
                        Do you want to hook up about it?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do I want to hook up about- ? Gabe 
                        come on.

                                 GABE
                        Are you going to see him right 
                        now?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Good night Gabe.

                                 GABE
                        Ask him if he knew that getting 
                        his ear pierced was gay before he 
                        did it.

           Gabe gets out, Olivia drives off.

           EXT. ORCAS FINE ART GALLERY - EVENING

           Olivia walks into the gallery, Stephen is looking at a 
           framed inspirational posters.  He stands in front of one 
           that shows a man climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro and has the 
           word COURAGE below it.  Olivia walks up behind him and 
           whispers in his ear

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi.

           He turns around and kisses her.

           CONTINUED:

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hey.  How beautiful is this stuff?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yeah...How was your day?

                                 STEPHEN
                        Taught.  Graded papers.  Ate lunch 
                        by myself, cried in the bathroom.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey!  I used to cry in that 
                        bathroom too.  I can’t believe you 
                        have to revisit high school 
                        everyday.

           They walk around the gallery.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I had to grade a paper today that 
                        used “The Bridges of Madison 
                        County” to explore the history of 
                        Iowa.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I think you can divide the whole 
                        world into people who liked “The 
                        Bridges of Madison County” and 
                        people who didn’t.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You’re funny.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m overcompensating.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Try to make it through a whole ten 
                        minutes without a self-deprecating 
                        comment.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Okay, I’ll just stop talking.

           Stephen kisses her.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        That was your plan, wasn’t it?

           He kisses her again.
           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

           Olivia sits in the first row of the meeting.  MICHAEL, 
           the leader stands talking at the front.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hi, I’m Michael, I’m an alcoholic.

           Everyone claps.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are there any newcomers to this 
                        meeting?

           One man raises his hand.  Applause.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Do we have any birthdays to 
                        celebrate today?  Anyone in their 
                        first thirty days?

           Two people raise their hands.  Applause.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Sixty days?

           No one raises their hands.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Six months?

                        Well I have invited a wonderful 
                        man to join us here this evening.  
                        I’m proud to call him my sponsor. 
                        He has guided me and many others 
                        through some pretty weird times 
                        and I’m just so thrilled he could 
                        join our group tonight.  Let’s 
                        give a big welcome to Stanley -

           Stanley - an older, small man with glasses walks on 
           stage.

                        So I don’t know if Michael told 
                        you... I didn’t want to come.  But 
                        this bastard bribed me with a 
                        coin.  So, obviously I couldn’t 
                        turn him down.

           People laugh.  Michael interjects - 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Introduce yourself!

                                 STANLEY
                        Oh fuck off.

           The meeting laughs.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hi, I’m Stanley and I’m an 
                        alcoholic.

                                 GROUP
                        Hi Stanley!

                                 STANLEY
                        So I guess I’ll give you a quick 
                        rundown of the good things I did 
                        in my life. That feels like the 
                        right way to begin...  I went to 
                        college, I got a job at a 
                        newspaper, I met a woman, I met 
                        another woman, I met a third 
                        woman.  This one I married.  I 
                        bought a home, I had three boys, I 
                        had a girl, we got a dog...  Now 
                        here is a list of the bad.  I 
                        slept with four professors for 
                        grade inflation.  I lost my job at 
                        the newspaper when I showed up to 
                        work drunk three days in a row.  I 
                        cheated on the first woman I met.  
                        I cheated on the second woman I 
                        met, I married the third while I 
                        was drunk in Vegas.  I missed the 
                        birth of my first son, I missed 
                        the kindergarten graduation of my 
                        second and I accidentally killed 
                        the third’s rabbit. I crashed my 
                        daughter’s car at three o’clock in 
                        the morning on a Tuesday.  And, I 
                        ate the dog’s food.  On several, 
                        different, occasions... Moral: 
                        life is not what it seems.  Or 
                        some bullshit like that.

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Stanley shifts his position.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Life is really the stories that we 
                        don’t tell.  When I was an 
                        alcoholic, I never told.  I lied, 
                        I lied to keep everyone calm, to 
                        get out of things, to live with 
                        myself, to earn a living.  So I 
                        decided it was time to quit 
                        fucking with everything and I 
                        decided to never lie again...
                        This is the plot for the 1997 Jim 
                        Carrey film titled “Liar Liar.”

           The meeting is rapt, totally goes with it.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Literally, waiting for one fucking 
                        person to crack a smile in the 
                        room.  You all failed me. All of 
                        you.

           Olivia laughs.  

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I did things you can’t actually 
                        imagine.  I woke up naked on the 
                        front lawn.  I woke up naked only 
                        in women’s make-up in the middle 
                        of our street.  I got into a 
                        screaming fight with my wife, in 
                        front of my kids, at Hamburger 
                        Hamlet because I lifted the skirt 
                        of the waitress...
                        I don’t know what they were 
                        thinking.  But they stuck with me - 
                        my lovely wife is sitting in the 
                        front row - two of my sons are 
                        here too.  I guess these stories 
                        are funny now.  Too bad I had to 
                        be told all of them.  In a way I 
                        guess this could seem like a 
                        reason to get drunk for twenty 
                        years.  You wake up and you have a 
                        beautiful family? Well I guess 
                        that’s one way.  That is my story.  
                        I know it because I was told it.

                        Okay....I feel like this is easier 
                        than I thought.  Not easy, but not 
                        as hard.  Every day here feels

                        I know, I’m scared about going 
                        back to New York.  If I was there 
                        right now...  I mean sometimes I 
                        was fine, but when I wasn’t, I was 
                        awful.  I just don’t want people 
                        to think I’m a mess.

                        People, places and things.  Avoid 
                        the people, places and things that 
                        you identify with drinking.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well that’s impossible.

                                 GABE
                        It’s hard, but it’s doable.  It’s 
                        like cutting off contact with a 
                        really shitty friend who you have 
                        exciting sex with.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What?

                                 GABE
                        That was a weird example.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you still want to drink?

                                 GABE
                        Of course.  Listen, what was the 
                        worst thing that happened?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Tie between going to jail and 
                        going down on a stranger?

                                 GABE
                        Okay.  But that still might not 
                        have been your bottom.  Sometimes 
                        people have to try everything, do 
                        everything, until they’re 
                        convinced it doesn’t work.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Like keep drinking?

                                 GABE
                        Yeah.  Just take it one day at a 
                        time.  Don’t make the decision now 
                        that you’re cut off for life.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I wish I was a normal drinker.

                                 GABE
                        I would tuck that wish in bed and 
                        give it a bottle of Ambien.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        I just feel like I’m missing out 
                        on the party.

                                 GABE
                        Don’t worry about that.  You have 
                        a much better party with the 50 
                        year old lesbian that you’re 
                        dating.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gabe, that insult didn’t even make 
                        sense.

                                 GABE
                        Channel your “coolness” from high 
                        school.

           Olivia is surprised.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I wasn’t cool in high school?

                                 GABE
                        Yeah you were.  I thought you were 
                        cool.  What I’m saying is 
                        sometimes you just have to make 
                        some toast and spread a little bit 
                        of giggle butter on it.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Literally, what are you talking 
                        about?  Imagining you drinking 
                        gives me anxiety.

           INT.  WEST SOUND CAFE - AFTERNOON

           Olivia and Stephen walk into the cafe.  Gabe is behind 
           the counter with Charlotte.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Anywhere you’d like dear.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Thank you Charlotte.

           Olivia and Stephen walk to a table and sit.  Gabe comes 
           over to the table.

                                 GABE
                        So glad I can serve you today.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi Gabe.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hi Gabe.  How are you?

           Gabe does not respond.  Silence.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gabe.

                                 GABE
                        Yes?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Really?  

                                 GABE
                        Look, I’m busy.  Do you want me to 
                        come back or do you want to order 
                        now?

           Olivia looks at Stephen.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’ll order for both of us.  One 
                        coffee, one beer, two turkey 
                        sandwiches, one on Sourdough, one 
                        on rye.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Can you tell him, the one on rye 
                        is hopefully toasted.

                                 OLIVIA
                        The one on rye would ideally be 
                        toasted.

                                 GABE
                        Please tell your lunch partner 
                        that we don’t normally do that 
                        with that type of sandwich.

                                 OLIVIA
                        First of all, please don’t use the 
                        term “lunch partner.”  Secondly, 
                        I’ll let him know and I’ll also 
                        let him know that you just started 
                        doing it today.

           Gabe walks away.  Then comes back.

                                 GABE
                        I’m sorry Mr. Black.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Stephen.  Not a problem Gabe.  

           Gabe walks away.

                                 OLIVIA 
                        Well.  That was at least a step in 
                        the right direction.  I’m guessing 
                        it’s a grade issue?

                                 STEPHEN
                        I failed him junior year.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’d hate you too.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Well, you did all your work. I get 
                        the feeling that his grade isn’t 
                        the main reason why he dislikes 
                        me.

           Stephen and Olivia finish their meal.  
           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           They walk out of the restaurant and are quickly 
           intercepted by Gabe. They all stand silently looking at 
           each other.  Then Gabe hugs Stephen - very closely.  He 
           then brings in Olivia for a very uncomfortable group hug.  

           When it ends.  Olivia and Stephen step back.  Stephen 
           doesn’t know what to say.  Gabe squeezes both of 
           Stephen’s hands and then walks in the restaurant.  
           Stephen and Olivia walk down the street.

                                 STEPHEN
                        You attract a very interesting 
                        brand.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m not even going to address what 
                        just happened.

           INT. STEPHEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Olivia and Stephen walk in the front door and immediately 
           start kissing.  They put their things down while still 
           kissing.  Stephen takes off his jacket still holding onto 
           Olivia, she does the same and they head in to Stephen’s 
           bedroom.  

           Olivia takes off Stephen’s shirt, he takes off hers and 
           they get on the bed.

           Stephen goes to take off Olivia’s bra and his watch gets 
           caught in the lace.  

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hold on.  I can get it.  

           Stephen intensely focusses on fixing this.  They both 
           struggle to get it.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        If you just tug it.  Just tug it.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m trying.  Wait, it’s not - 

           Olivia rips her bra and pulls it off.

                                 OLIVIA
                        There we go.

           They continue to kiss.  He pulls away for a moment to 
           take off his watch and takes a sip of wine, offering the 
           glass to Olivia.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 STEPHEN
                        Want some?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Um...I’ll be right back.

           She jumps off the bed and heads into the other room.

           She heads into the kitchen, paces for a moment and then 
           grabs a wine glass and pours herself a glass of wine.  
           She stares at the glass, not moving for fifteen seconds.  
           Then she grabs her phone and heads out to the deck just 
           in her underwear.

           EXT. STEPHEN’S PORCH - NIGHT

           Olivia dials her phone, her other hand covering her 
           chest.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Gabe?...Hi...No no, I’m fine.  No 
                        he didn’t rape 
                        me!...Gabe..please...Not yet, but 
                        I want to...Can I make it until 
                        tomorrow?...I think so...No!  I’m 
                        not going to call you after I have 
                        sex!...Okay, I’ll call you in the 
                        morning.

           Stephen walks out on to the porch as Olivia hangs up her 
           phone.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 OLIVIA
                        What? 

                                 STEPHEN
                        My neighbors are getting a show.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Sorry, just making a call.

           Stephen opens the door for her. He slaps her on the butt 
           as she walks inside.

           INT. STEPHEN’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Olivia wakes up and turns to face Stephen.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Hi.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m pregnant.

           Olivia laughs.

                                 STEPHEN (CONT’D)
                        How did you sleep?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Very well.

           She feels his facial hair, that’s growing in like a 
           goatee.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t tell me that your beard 
                        grew in like D’artagnan’s.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s not something I can control.

                                 OLIVIA
                        My facial hair grows in that way 
                        too.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Are you doing a morning set right 
                        now?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Sorry.  Too early.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Let me just have coffee first.

           EXT. STEPHEN’S FRONT PORCH - MORNING

           Olivia and Stephen drink coffee on the front porch. 

           INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - FEW DAYS LATER

           Olivia and Stephen browse through an antique shop.  
           Olivia picks up a very old looking box and the clasp 
           flies off.  She sets it down.

                                 OLIVIA
                                 (whispering)
                        I think I just broke something?  
                        We need to go.

           CONTINUED:

           The SALES WOMAN comes out from the back.  Stephen tries 
           to hide the box and hits over a stack of plates.

                                 SALES WOMAN
                        Can I help you with anything?

           Olivia and Stephen look at each other and then Stephen 
           picks up the box and a remnant of a plate.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’d like to get these.

                                 STEPHEN
                        I’m really leaving now.

           Stephen walks away again.  He gets to his car, turns 
           around and walks back to Olivia.

           Stephen kisses Olivia and leads her inside, leaving his 
           bag and jacket on the front porch.

                        was out of the question.  Once I 
                        said okay to the unknown I could 
                        accept myself and do better....

           Everyone claps.

                                 AA SPEAKER (CONT’D)
                        Does anyone have any questions?

           A WOMAN in the back raises her hand.

                        I’m worried about the airplane.

                        If you find yourself in trouble.  
                        If you’re nervous.  If you want a

                        if there is a friend of Bill W.  
                        on board.  Bill W. is Bill Wilson, 
                        the founder of AA.  They’ll know 
                        what that means.  Okay?

                        Yes.  Thank you.

           Everyone stands up and grabs hands with the people next

                        God grant me the serenity

           EXT. GEDDES HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

           Olivia sits under the covering in the garden drinking 
           coffee.  She has her computer on her lap open to a blank 
           Word document.  Leelee sits next to her enjoying the 
           rain.  Leelee opens a piece of mail.  She speaks loudly 
           as she waves it around, wanting Olivia to notice that she 
           got mail from SAG.

                                 LEELEE
                        Oh God, another piece of SAG mail.  
                        What could they want now?... 
                        Olivia, will you drive me to the 
                        “Company” audition?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I won’t support someone who 
                        supports Stephen Sondheim.

                                 LEELEE
                        Your jealousy is nauseating.  Grow 
                        up.

           Olivia hears the phone ring inside.

           INT. GEDDES KITCHEN - EVENING

           Olivia’s walk in the kitchen as the phone rings.  Alex 
           gets to it before she can.

                                 ALEX
                        Hello...This is Olivia.

           Olivia walks over to him.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Dad.  Really?  Give me the phone.  

           Alex laughs and hands Olivia the phone and walks out of 
           the room.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Hey...well when you call the house 
                        line it’s kind of a comedy 
                        platform for whoever picks up, 
                        sorry, anyway...what’s up?  
                        Really?...no no that’s okay, it’s 
                        really not a big deal, don’t 
                        worry...that’s actually fine...I’m 
                        tired anyway...

           Olivia hangs up the phone. Sophie walks in.

           EXT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Olivia sits at her computer.  One word is written in a 
           word document - “I.”  She talks on the phone to Maggie 
           who shops at Whole Foods.  Intercut between them.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Jerry misses you.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I oddly miss him.  What are you 
                        doing?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Buying a sad middle-aged woman’s 
                        salad bar dinner of sauteed beets 
                        and smoked mozzarella pasta.  So, 
                        you told your dad?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes, but not my mom, she 
                        definitely knows something's up.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Stop being paranoid.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I can’t.  It’s my most consistent 
                        trait.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        You’re not seeing the teacher 
                        tonight?  You should fuck that

                        that?...How’s my niece doing?

           Maggie feels her stomach.

                                 MAGGIE 
                        She’s moving around a lot.  How’s

                        It’s going.

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Olivia sits at her computer but can’t concentrate.  She 
           paces back and forth in her room.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Olivia sits on her bed with the door shut.  Sophie knocks 
           and enters at the same time drinking a glass of white 
           wine.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Why is this door always shut?

                                 OLIVIA
                        To keep intruders out.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        I’m going to the market, want to 
                        come?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m okay.

                                 SOPHIE 
                        Please don’t just sit here and 
                        stew.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m not stewing.  I’m fine, what 
                        are you talking about?

                        doesn’t, he’s not worth it.

           She quickly adds.

                        In the future, if you don’t sleep 
                        with them right away, there’s a 
                        better chance they’ll call.  Bye!

           Sophie walks out before Olivia can say anything.

           INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Olivia spots Leelee’s leftover vodka & milk.  She picks 
           it up.  Puts it down.  Picks it up and stares at it.  
           Puts it down again.  Then puts it in a cabinet.  She 
           grabs her jacket and her keys and walks out the front 
           door.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Olivia walks down the road, a to go coffee in her hand.  
           She pulls out her phone and dials Stephen.  She gets his 
           machine.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey Stephen.  It’s Olivia.  Just

                        talked to you in a few days, so, 
                        just want to make sure

                        me when you can.

           INT. WHALE BAR - NIGHT

           Olivia sits at the counter with her jacket on.  She 
           hasn’t ordered yet, but is nervously eating olives and 
           bar mix very quickly.  The bartender refills both bowls 
           (from Costco sized containers) as she eats.

                        I think just another moment.

           Olivia stares into space.  The bartender walks away and 
           comes back about ten seconds later.

                                 BARTENDER
                        We close in about ten minutes.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s 5:45.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Again, we close in about ten 
                        minutes.

           The bartender looks at her, she looks back for a few 
           seconds not saying anything.  

           Olivia looks out the window and sees Stanley (the guest 
           AA speaker).  She immediately ducks down and squats under 
           the bar so that he doesn’t see her.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           After a few seconds, the bartender walks back over and 
           stands across from where Olivia is crouching. She slowly 
           gets up and faces the bartender.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’ll have....a...Diet Coke.

                                 BARTENDER
                        With?

           Moment of silence.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Ice.

           The bartender brings over the Diet Coke and sets it down.  
           Olivia finishes it without taking her mouth off the straw 
           and walks out.

           EXT. STEPHEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Olivia knocks on the door.  No answer.  She knocks again.  
           No answer.  She tries the door which is unlocked and 
           walks into the house.

           INT. STEPHEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A lamp is on in the front room.  Olivia sets down her 
           keys on the table.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Stephen?

           Olivia walks through the house slowly and finally into 
           the bedroom. 

           A moment later she walks out, her face is pale and she 
           rushes towards the door, grabbing her keys.

           Stephen runs out after her, wearing pants but no shirt.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Olivia, wait!  Wait!

           Stephen grabs her arm and turns her around.  Olivia 
           doesn’t know what to say.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don’t touch me!  Do not touch me.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s not anything.  It’s not what 
                        you’re thinking.

                        What is it?  You said you were 
                        grading papers.

                                 STEPHEN
                        It just happened and it doesn’t 
                        mean...I really care about you.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh fuck you! 

                                 STEPHEN
                        Please, we can talk about this.  
                        Just give me a second.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Talk about this?  Who is that?

                                 STEPHEN
                        You don’t know her.

                                 OLIVIA
                        And she’s too much of a fucking 
                        coward to come out here and show 
                        her face.

                                 STEPHEN
                        That’s not going to make anything 
                        better.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Why did you do this?  What  is 
                        wrong with me?!  Don’t answer 
                        that!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Nothing!  I’m an idiot.  I’m an 
                        asshole.  I just got nervous.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You got nervous?  That’s what you 
                        have to say?

           KATHERINE comes out of the bedroom, clothed, walking 
           towards the door.  

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                                 (shocked)
                        Katherine?

                        Olivia, I’m so sorry, I didn’t 
                        know.

                        Katherine.   Stephen, do you know 
                        that she’s 16?  She’s 16!  

           Silence.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know that she’s 16??

           Silence.  Olivia puts it together.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        She’s your student.

           Stephen can’t look at her.  Katherine doesn’t move.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Katherine, go home. Right now. 

           Katherine runs out the front door.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                                 (to Stephen)
                        You’re disgusting.  You could go 
                        to jail.  

           Olivia pushes him back.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        You are not even remotely who I 
                        thought you were.  

           She pushes him again.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Stay away from her.  And stay away 
                        from me.  Or I will make this 
                        incredibly public.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Olivia, please.

           Olivia heads towards the front door and trips over the 
           Stephen’s helmet.

                                 OLIVIA
                        And move your fucking helmet!  
                        What 40 year old man 
                        rollerblades?!

           She walks out.
           EXT. STREET, NIGHT

           Olivia walks to her car.

           INT. OLIVIA’S CAR

           Olivia is in shock.  She starts to drive down the street 
           and sees Katherine walking.  She pulls over to Katherine.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Let me drive you home.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Olivia I’m so sorry, I had no 
                        idea.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I know, come on.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Are you sure?

                                 OLIVIA
                        It’s better.  Every second I’m 
                        with you I’m not intravenously 
                        injecting vodka into my arm.

           Katherine gets in the car. They drive in silence, then - 

                                 KATHERINE
                        I really didn’t know.  You have to 
                        believe me.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I know.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I wouldn’t have - 

                                 OLIVIA
                        I know Katherine, it’s okay.  Are 
                        you alright?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes...please don’t tell my 
                        parents.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I won’t....listen, I’m not going 
                        to yell at you. I’m not your mom 
                        and I don’t exactly have the best 
                        moral compass in my pocket, but 
                        please stay away from him.

                        I can handle it myself.  I’m an

                                 OLIVIA
                        I know you can.  

           Olivia pulls up in front of her house.

                        Don’t forget your backpack.

           Katherine grabs her backpack and gets out and walks next 
           door to her home.  Alone, Olivia stares into space.  

           Then suddenly, she gets out of the car and heads into the 
           house.

           INT. GEDDES KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Everyone is asleep.  Olivia pulls a bottle of wine out of 
           the refrigerator and a wine glass, she pours herself a 
           drink and immediately downs it.  

                                                                  CUT TO:

           QUICK SHOTS:

           - She grabs a bottle of Maker’s Mark from the cabinet and 
           another glass.  She takes a shot.  Then another.  

           - She pours herself another glass of wine and drinks it.  

           - She takes a shot and drinks wine at the same time.

           - She leans against the counter.

           - She pulls out her cell phone and dials, squinting at 
           the keys.

           message is still recording.  She steadies herself on the 
           counter and then throws up in the sink.  

           QUICK SHOTS:

           - Olivia downs another drink.

           - Olivia stumbles down the street.

           - Olivia sits on the side of the road hiccuping.

           - Olivia makes her way to Gabe’s street.

           EXT. GABE’S HOUSE - NIGHT, CONTINUOUS

           Olivia loudly knocks on Gabe’s door.  She knocks until 
           Gabe answers.

                                 GABE
                                 (whispering)

           Olivia kisses him again, he stops her.

                        You don’t know how much I wish

           Gabe leads Olivia to the kitchen and gets her a glass of

                        Okay.  Let’s just leave that 
                        there.

           Gabe leads Olivia away from the throw up and to his room.

           INT. GABE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gabe pulls the blanket over Olivia and gets up to go 
           clean the kitchen.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 GABE
                        Stop saying you’re sorry.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Will you stay with me?

           Gabe lies down on top of the covers next to Olivia.

           INT. GABE’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           It’s raining outside.  Gabe wakes up as Olivia quietly 
           gathers her things and is about to leave.

                                 GABE
                        How are you feeling?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Really fantastic.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GABE
                        What happened?

                                 OLIVIA
                        He was with someone else.

           Long pause.  Then suddenly Gabe runs out of his room.  
           Olivia runs after him and tries to stop him.  He runs out 
           the front door, she gets a hold of his jacket, but ends 
           up pulling it off as he runs towards his car.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Gabe!  No!  You don’t even know 
                        where he is!

           Gabe gets in his car and drives away.  Olivia stands in 
           the street.

           INT. GEDDES KITCHEN - MORNING

           Olivia walks in the kitchen to find her mom cleaning up 
           the mess she made the night before.  Sophie is drinking a 
           Bloody Mary.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Olivia, what happened here?  I’ve 
                        been cleaning all morning.  You 
                        threw up? Are you okay?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Mom.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yes.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Sit down.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Okay.

           Alex walks in the kitchen.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I haven’t been very honest with 
                        you...Mom, I have a problem.  

                                 SOPHIE
                        Are you okay?  What do you mean?

           Sophie sloshes her drink on the counter.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Well...I mean, I have a problem 
                        with drinking.

                                 SOPHIE
                                 (tears up)
                        I don’t understand.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No crying.  This isn’t about you.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You just drop a bomb on me like 
                        this and I’m supposed to behave 
                        normally?

                                 OLIVIA
                        You can’t be that surprised.  The 
                        apple doesn’t fall that far from 
                        the tree.

           A yelling match begins.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hey!  I am still your Mom!  You 
                        can not talk to me like that.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I can say whatever I want!  

           Alex steps between them.

                                 ALEX
                        Hey, that’s enough guys!

                                 SOPHIE
                        What are you Alex?  My mother?  I 
                        bet you knew about this!  You two 
                        are always in cahoots!

                                 OLIVIA
                        I had to talk about it with 
                        someone!

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m someone!

                                 OLIVIA
                        When was I supposed to tell you?  
                        Post wine, pre-Blood Mary?

                                 ALEX
                        Olivia, stop it.  This is not her 
                        fault.

           Silence.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Let’s just calm down.  What 
                        happened?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I got fired...and I went to jail.

           The yelling begins again.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What?!

                                 OLIVIA
                        I knew this would happen.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Gosh darnit Olivia!  You’re smart 
                        enough to not be stupid!

                                 OLIVIA
                        What does that even mean??  

           Sophie begins to tear and takes a sip of her drink.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh no.  Mom, please don’t cry.  
                        I’m better.

                                 SOPHIE
                        This is better?

           Sophie takes another sip of her Bloody Mary and then 
           realizes what she is doing.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, that was incredibly 
                        insensitive.  

           Sophie takes another sip.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        What happened Liv?  You’re single?  
                        You lost your job?  You got 
                        arrested?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Funny that that’s the order those 
                        came in.  You would think job 
                        before being single.  

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been going to AA.

           Long pause.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You might...think about coming 
                        with me sometime?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Excuse me?  I’m not the one with 
                        the problem!  Alex?  Back me up?

                                 ALEX
                        It’s not an awful idea.

                                 SOPHIE
                        It’s an awful idea!  Are you 
                        saying I’m an alcoholic?  

           Sophie and Olivia looks at the half empty drink she holds 
           in her hand.  

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        This is a breakfast cocktail!  I’m 
                        not the one throwing up in the 
                        sink!  You are ridiculous! This is 
                        ridiculous!  As if I would need 
                        AA?   I - you - I - you wouldn’t!

           She swings the drink around as she wildly gesticulates 
           and spills the Blood Mary down her blouse.  She starts to 
           cry.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        My favorite linen blouse!

           She tries to wipe her blouse with a hand towel and drops 
           the glass which shatters.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        My favorite depression glassware!

           Sophie runs out of the room crying and dabbing her 
           blouse.  Olivia is left with Alex, they start to pick up 
           the broken glass.

                                 ALEX
                        Olivia.  I don’t want to know.  
                        But I will say this.  Don’t be a 
                        fuck up - it’s not cute.

           Gus walks in the room.

           Olivia and Alex laugh.  

           INT. EAST SOUND MARKET - NIGHT

           Gabe walks down the aisles talking on his phone and 
           putting items in his basket. 

                                 GABE
                        Charlotte, what else do we 
                        need...flour?  Okay...and ketchup.  
                        Okay, I’ll be back in ten minutes.

           Gabe turns the corner on to the frozen food aisle and 
           spots Stephen pushing a cart by himself. An old woman is 
           also in the same aisle with a shopping cart. Gabe sets 
           down the groceries he has on a shelf and walks towards 
           Stephen.

                                 GABE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 STEPHEN
                        It’s a market Gabe, I’m buying 
                        food.

                                 GABE
                        What is your problem man?

           Stephen is surprised, he turns around.

                                 STEPHEN
                        Oh god, she told you.  

                                 GABE
                        You better believe she did!

                                 STEPHEN
                        Calm down Gabe.  You are not 
                        involved in this.

                                 GABE
                        Yes I am you bitch.

           Gabe slaps Stephen in the face.

                                 STEPHEN
                        What the hell was that?

           Gabe slaps him again.

                        Stop doing that man.

           Gabe goes for a third slap and Stephen fights back.  They 
           break into what looks like a 3rd graders fight - 
           scratching, a lot of kicking, hitting food off the 
           shelves.  

           The old woman abandons her cart and runs down the aisle.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Help!  Oh no!

           A MANAGER and a BAGGER run over.

                                 MANAGER
                        Cut it out!  Get out of the store!

           The manager and the bagger try to break them up, they 
           continue to fight for a minute and finally break a part 
           from each other.

           Gabe reaches into what he thinks is Stephen’s shopping 
           cart, it is the old woman’s cart.  He pulls out an orange 
           juice and throws it on the ground - it explodes.  The old 
           woman yells at Gabe from the end of the aisle. 

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        That was my orange juice!

                                 MANAGER
                        That’s enough!

           Gabe looks at Stephen.  He picks up the remains of the 
           ruined orange juice, walks over and hands it to the 
           woman.

                                 GABE
                        I’m sorry about your juice ma’am.

           He turns to Stephen.

                        You are such a fuck.

           one there.  He has a cut on his cheek and a black eye. 
           Olivia touches Gabe’s face.

                                 GABE
                        I found him in the market.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You didn’t have to do that.

                                 GABE
                        I wanted to.  You are avenged.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I am.

                                 GABE
                        How are you?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I’m okay.  I told my Mom.  Now she 
                        knows it all.   

                                 GABE
                        How did that go?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Not amazingly.

                                 GABE
                        At least she cares. 

           Olivia nods her head.

                                 OLIVIA
                        At least I can stand myself...
                        I’m sorry Gabe.

                                 GABE
                        Stop saying you’re sor-

                                 OLIVIA
                        No, this time, I really mean 
                        it...You’re a good guy. 

           Gabe gets something from his bag.  He hands Olivia a 
           package wrapped in newspaper.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

           Olivia unwraps the package.  It’s Gabe’ illustrations to 
           the book.

                                 OLIVIA (CONT’D)
                        You finished the book.

           Olivia turns through the pages.

                                 GABE
                        I tried writing with my left hand.

           Gabe kisses Olivia.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don’t deserve you yet.

                                 GABE
                        I’ll be waiting.

           INT. OLIVIA’S ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Olivia sits at her computer, she leans back and reads 
           what she has written so far.

                                 OLIVIA
                        To be a good person, you have to 
                        do good things.  Something most 
                        people learn as a child but 
                        something I just learned as an 
                        adult. Sobriety is a weird thing. 
                        At the beginning, it meant missing 
                        out on the party.  As time went 
                        by, I realized I was just going to 
                        a different kind of party.  One 
                        where I remembered what happened 
                        the next day.  One where I spoke 
                        in full sentences.  One where my 
                        neighbors didn’t know what I 
                        looked like naked.  When I finally 
                        accepted my disease, I was able to 
                        move forward.  Arrested 
                        development refers to a halt in 
                        growth and advancement.  An 
                        inability to move forward. I 
                        arrested my development a long 
                        time ago.  Having lived by myself 
                        for seven years, I came home to 
                        live with my family for three 
                        months in an effort to recover 
                        from the impending doom of a bad 
                        alcohol habit.

                        When you’re forced to reexamine 
                        yourself in the setting of your 
                        childhood home, it’s easy (and was 
                        the case for me), to revert to 
                        adolescence...

           She leans forward and keeps typing.

           INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, NIGHT

           Olivia sits in the very front row, Sophie and Alex sit 
           next to her.  The leader speaks at the front.

                        Do we have anyone in their first 
                        30 days of sobriety?

           Olivia raises her hand.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hi.  I’m Olivia, I’m an alcoholic.

           Olivia laughs.  She turns to Sophie while Alex, Gus and 
           Leelee talk to each other.

                                 OLIVIA

                        deal with and - 

           Sophie puts her hand under Olivia’s chin.

                                 SOPHIE
                        As have I, dear one.

                        As a parting gift. I’ve let the

                        sing tonight.

           Maggie gives Olivia a hug and walks down the hallway.  
           She knocks on Jerry’s door and walks in.  Jerry sees it’s 
           her and comes around to the other side of the table.

                                 JERRY
                        Welcome back.  You look good.

                        lot of down time.  

           Olivia pulls an envelope out of her bag and hands it to
