           EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY (1906)

           OVER BLACK:

           MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening 
           and then a voice - male.

                                 TRAVERS (V.O.)
                             (singing)
                        Winds in the East 
                        Mist coming in--

           FADE IN:

           A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning, 
           spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst 
           white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella) 
           dances amongst the nimbus. 

                                 TRAVERS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --Like something is brewing, 
                        about to begin--

           The shadow’s direction becomes purposeful - taking us down 
           through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small 
           town in the distance.

                                 TRAVERS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --Can't put me finger on what lies 
                        in store--

           Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, 
           bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens. 

           There, a seven year old girl plays in the lush grass; she 
           puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the 
           large park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from 
           flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod. 
           She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face 
           to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her 
           concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we 
           will also know as GINTY.)

                                 TRAVERS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        --But I feel what's to happen, all 
                        happened before--

           Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of 
           a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind 
           becomes real.

           INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA’S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1959)

           P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position 
           as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the 
           sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of 
           stiff and steely determination. 
           Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha 
           smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the 
           walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with 
           men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit 
           on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding. 

           Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful, 
           white.

           Downstairs the doorbell rings.

           Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.

           It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up, 
           smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.

           INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

           Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of 
           sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.

           DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked 
           inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.

                                 DIARMUID
                        Mrs Travers. 

           She gestures for him to follow her through to the living 
           room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her, 
           she looks out of the window.

                         DIARMUID
                                                         PAMELA
           Would you like me to--?
                                              Like pink clouds on sticks.

                                 DIARMUID
                        Excuse me?

                                 PAMELA
                        The cherry blossoms 
                             (beat)
                        I was trying to think of what they--

           Diarmuid looks at his watch.

                                 DIARMUID
                        The car should be here, may I use--
                        (the phone)

                                 PAMELA
                             (over)
                        I cancelled it.
                                 DIARMUID
                        You--?
                             (panicked)
                        What? Pamela!

                                 PAMELA
                        Mrs Travers.

                                 DIARMUID
                        Mrs Travers, please, why--
                             (trying to stay calm)
                        Why would you cancel the car?

                                 PAMELA
                        I shan’t be going. 

           Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.

                                 DIARMUID
                        We’ve been through this--

                                 PAMELA
                        I’ve changed my mind.

                                 DIARMUID
                        You can’t.

                                 PAMELA
                        With all due respect Mr Russell I 
                        am on very good terms with my own 
                        faculty and exceedingly confident 
                        in it’s decision making 
                        capabilities.

           Diarmuid’s shoulders visibly sag, he let’s out a long 
           frustrated breath.

                                 DIARMUID
                        You signed a contract. Do you 
                        understand? 

                                 PAMELA
                        Why in the world are you speaking 
                        to me as if I am a neonate?

                                 DIARMUID
                        He’ll sue.

                                 PAMELA
                        He is most welcome to every penny I 
                        don’t have.

                                 DIARMUID
                        Look--
                             (he sighs)
                        --I’ve represented you for a long 
                        time. I like to think of you as a 
                        friend--
           Pamela snorts.

                                 DIARMUID (CONT’D)
                        I like to think of it, believe me I 
                        know it’s not reciprocated. 
                             (beat)
                        I would never suggest you do 
                        something that would cause you 
                        anguish but there’s no more money 
                        Pamela--

                                 PAMELA
                        Mrs Travers.

                                 DIARMUID
                        Mrs Travers. Simply no more. Sales 
                        have dried up, no more royalties. 
                        You refuse to write further books 
                        so-- 
                             (beat)
                        Do you understand? I’m frightened 
                        that you don’t understand what that 
                        means. 

           Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.

                                 DIARMUID (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been trying to do this deal 
                        for twenty years! He’s agreed to 
                        both your stipulations. No 
                        animation, script approval-- I-- 
                        script approval! He’s never granted 
                        anything like that before! I don’t 
                        know what else to-- 

           He looks around.

                                 DIARMUID (CONT’D)
                        Where is Polly?

                                 PAMELA
                        I fired her. 

           Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        It’s just as well. It seems I can’t 
                        afford her anymore anyway!

           Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes. 

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (momentarily soft)
                        You don’t know how much she means 
                        to me.

                                 DIARMUID
                        Polly?
                                 PAMELA
                        Of course not Polly!

           Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (it’s a filthy word)
                        Los Angeles.

                                 DIARMUID
                        You have only to go there and work 
                        for two weeks. Collaborate. That’s 
                        it. You haven’t signed the rights 
                        over, yet.

                                 PAMELA
                        Yet!

                                 DIARMUID
                        You must make it work Mrs Travers--

                                 PAMELA
                        Oh I must, must I?

                                 DIARMUID
                        You need the money. I don’t want to 
                        see you-- (broke).

                                 PAMELA
                             (over)
                        Stop saying money! It’s a filthy, 
                        disgusting word!

                                 DIARMUID
                        I am picking up the telephone Mrs 
                        Travers--

           Diarmuid gets up.

                                 PAMELA
                        I have final say?

                                 DIARMUID
                        You do.

                                 PAMELA
                             (to herself)
                        I have final say.
                             (to Diarmuid)
                        And if I don’t like what they are 
                        doing with her?

                                 DIARMUID
                        You don’t sign the papers. He 
                        cannot make the film unless you 
                        grant the rights. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s an exploratory trip-- 
           Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away 
           from the tree and sticks to her living room window.

                                 DIARMUID (CONT’D)
                        What do you say?

                                 PAMELA
                        I want to keep my house.

           She pierces Diarmuid with an icy stare, he looks away.

           EXT. MARYBROROUGH PARK - DAY

           A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and 
           smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild 
           poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Excuse me ma’am, have you seen my 
                        daughter? I was quite sure I had 
                        left her around here somewhere!

           Ginty giggles.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-
                        - goodness! I’ve quite forgotten! 
                        Could it be Prunella?

                                 GINTY
                        No!

                                 TRAVERS
                        Pamela? But no, still doesn’t sound 
                        quite right-- I’m sure I have a 
                        special name for her-- 

                                 GINTY
                        Ginty!

                                 TRAVERS
                        Why, thank you ma’am! Ginty it is 
                        of course! 
                             (beat)
                        Now, have you seen her?

                                 GINTY
                        It’s me!

           Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her 
           face.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Gosh! So it is! Well, thank 
                        goodness for that! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRAVERS (CONT'D)
                        I was positive I was going to be 
                        beheaded for losing Her Highness 
                        The Royal Princess Ginty Mc 
                        Featherfluffy!

           He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through 
           the park.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Hurry now! We mustn’t be late!

           INT. PLANE - DAY

           Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet 
           bag into an overhead locker.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Can I help you?

                                 PAMELA
                        I’m perfectly capable thank you.  

           The flight attendant tries to help anyway.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        They’ve used all the space; so 
                        greedy.

           She glares at the people around her.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I’ll take it Madam.  I can put it 
                        up here -

                                 PAMELA
                        I don’t want it up there. I want it 
                        here, in the corresponding holding 
                        area for my assigned seat!

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        The flight’s closing in just a few 
                        moments Ma'am. I’ll have to take 
                        it. 

           Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say ‘I dare 
           you.’ A woman, with an infant, stands up.

                                 WOMAN
                             (to attendant)
                        You can put my bag up front 
                        instead.

           The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the 
           woman’s bag with Pamela’s. 
                                 PAMELA
                             (to woman)
                        Will the child be a nuisance? It’s 
                        an eleven hour flight.

                                 WOMAN
                             (taken aback)
                        Er-- no, I--

                                 PAMELA
                        Jolly good.

           Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to 
           the window, she looks out at the tarmac.

           She closes her eyes. Takes a deep breath, opens her eyes 
           again and she is airborne - the view is now one of blue sky 
           and white fluffy clouds. 

           She tucks her feet tidily together, folds her hands neatly 
           into her lap.  And looks straight ahead.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        I hope we crash.

           The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!

           EXT. GOFF RESIDENCE - MARYBOROUGH - DAY (1906)

           BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak - 
           stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases 
           bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as 
           she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from 
           his shoulders and plops her on the ground.

                                 MARGARET
                        The carriage--? 

                                 TRAVERS
                        Who needs a carriage my love? A 
                        stroll is a gift!
                             (beat, excited)
                        Everybody ready?

           Margaret takes her youngest child MOYA (1) from the nanny. 

                                 GINTY & BIDDY
                        Yes. Yep!

                                 TRAVERS
                        Come along my team! We mustn’t miss 
                        the train. 

                                 MARGARET
                             (to her staff)
                        Thank you so much. For everything.
           She picks up her own case.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Walking bus!

           The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in 
           the lead.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget Jock!

           Ginty takes Jock’s leash, her own case and somehow helps her 
           sister too.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Ready? And off we go! 

           Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as 
           the Goff family march down the street. 

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           The train chugs its way through the night, the cane fields 
           like a moonlit sea around its tracks.

           INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ginty lies awake on a pull down bunk, she watches dark, 
           ominous shadows dance about the compartment ceiling. She 
           can’t sleep, it’s too exciting. 

                                 GINTY
                        Allora.

           INT. PLANE - NIGHT

           Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She’s disturbed 
           by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if 
           somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs 
           her heel into the carpet of the plane.

           INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY

           A bleary eyed Pamela pushes her trolley into the arrivals 
           area. She’s immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of 
           signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies: 
           she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling 
           upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath “Walt Disney 
           Presents”.

                                 PAMELA
                        Oh does he indeed?
           She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on 
           his cap and lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.

                                 RALPH
                        Travers? P.L. Travers?

                                 PAMELA
                        Mrs.

                                 RALPH
                        Welcome, Mrs P.L. Travers! Welcome 
                        to the City of Angels.

           Pamela sneers. He grabs her trolley.

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                        Let me take that.

                                 PAMELA
                        I’m perfectly capable of-- Oh, 
                        nevermind.

           Ralph pushes the trolley through the doors-- 

           EXT. LAX - DAY

           --and into the sunlight.

                                 RALPH
                        Sun came out to say hello just to 
                        you.

                                 PAMELA
                        Don’t be preposterous.

           Pamela sniffs the air.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        It smells. Like-- 

                                 RALPH
                        Jasmine.

                                 PAMELA
                        --chlorine and sweat.

           Ralph chuckles.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        It’s dreadful.

           EXT. LIMOSINE - DAY

           The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega 
           Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish 
           billboard advertising. 
           INT. LIMOSINE - DAY

           Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car. 
           She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-
           car bar.

                                 PAMELA
                             (to herself)
                        Absurd.

           Ralph looks at her in the rearview.

                                 RALPH
                        You okay back there Mrs P.L. 
                        Travers?

                                 PAMELA
                        It’s not Mrs P.L. It’s just Mrs-- 
                        Oh, it’s so hot.

                                 RALPH
                        No problemo! We got a brand new air 
                        conditioning system, Missus; cool 
                        you right down in no time. Just 
                        about make you feel like you’re in 
                        good old Engerland again! Things 
                        they can put in cars these days--
                             (he shakes his head in 
                              amazement)
                        Gosh almighty.

           Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around, 
           finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between 
           passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph’s 
           natter.

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                             (happy as a clam)
                        No problemo. 

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           A porter opens the door to Pamela’s suite and places her 
           belongings in the hallway.

                                 PORTER
                        Would you like me to send someone 
                        to unpack for you ma’am?

                                 PAMELA
                        Unpack?

                                 PORTER
                        To take your items from their cases 
                        and hang them in the wardrobe 
                        ma’am.
                                 PAMELA
                        Young man, if it is your wish to 
                        handle ladies garments I suggest 
                        you take employment in a 
                        launderette.

           The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

           His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She 
           closes the door on him.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Odd.

           She turns and for the first time takes in--

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my.

           --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent 
           beyond imagination but its classy decor has been rather 
           diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across 
           every surface of the room. 

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Oh no, no, no. 

           Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit 
           baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Daffy, 
           Donald, Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - 
           the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. 
           Nope. BIGGER!

           Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust 
           for a moment, her eyes falling upon three pears in the fruit 
           basket. She rushes over and picks them out, turning them over 
           in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over 
           her. 

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (muttering to the pears)
                        This won’t do.

           She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is 
           greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--

           EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

           --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the 
           children climb down from a buggy, stopped at the top of a 
           pathway. From Ginty’s perspective all there is to see is a 
           cloud of swirling red dust; it obscures and then gradually 
           reveals her new home. 
           The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush 
           greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.

                                 TRAVERS
                        A palace!

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh--

           Travers puts an arm around her shoulder.

                                 TRAVERS
                        We’ll build beautiful memories here 
                        my angel.

           Margaret offers him a trusting smile. 

                                 MARGARET
                        Yes.

           Travers takes Ginty and Biddy’s hands and they run towards 
           their new home. 

                                 TRAVERS
                             (in the distance)
                        --in this house you get to share a 
                        bedroom!

           Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there’s simply 
           nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           Pamela  throws the pears, one by one, off her balcony and 
           into the swimmer-free swimming pool. 

                                 PAMELA
                        Good riddance.

           She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.  

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        Well, first things first. 

           She picks up her carpet bag and begins to unpack. She takes 
           from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night 
           stand, followed by another bottle and another and another. 
           The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up, 
           the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come 
           streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses 
           windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature 
           Buddhas. 

           She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in 
           a closet. 
           Mickey is too big despite a massive effort on Pamela’s part 
           to squeeze him inside the cupboard, so she places him on the 
           floor, facing the wall.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (to Mickey)
                        And you can stay there until you 
                        learn the art of subtlety.

           Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in 
           front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns 
           her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans 
           forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly 
           unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (satisfied)
                        Yes. 
                             (answering an imaginary 
                              question)
                        Well, no, I don’t suppose I do 
                        mind. 

           She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as 
           an ugly snort.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Now, really! Flatterer!
                             (then scolding herself)
                        Silly girl.

           She turns her attention away from the mirror and switches on 
           the TV, flipping through the black and white channels and 
           stopping suddenly as the charming, moustached, kindly face of 
           WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) appears on The Wonderful World of 
           Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Well, well-- There you are.

           CU: TV SCREEN

           Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.

                                 WALT
                        Don’t worry! There’s nothing wrong 
                        with your television set. This is a 
                        pixie bell, the sound is much too 
                        high for human ears.

           Tinkerbell flies into shot.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Oh there you are Tink!

           She covers Walt in fairy dust.
                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        Hey! Get that stuff off of me!
                             (to audience)
                        You know, a little sprinkling of 
                        fairy dust can make you fly!

           Pamela can’t help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then 
           just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and 
           switches him off.

                                 PAMELA
                        Off! That’s how we deal with you. 

           EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

           A tray of untouched dinner sits outside the door.

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes 
           her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

           Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately, 
           not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and 
           Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car 
           and rush round to open the passenger door.

                                 RALPH
                        Good morning Mrs!

                                 PAMELA
                        It’s not Mrs, it’s-- Oh, why do I 
                        bother? We’re just not going to get 
                        it right are we?

                                 RALPH
                        Hm?

                                 PAMELA
                        Will it be the same driver every 
                        day?

                                 RALPH
                             (oblivious to her tone)
                        Yes ma’am! I’m all yours.
                             (beat)
                        Sun came out again!

                                 PAMELA
                        You say it like you’re surprised. 
                        Like the sun is particular about 
                        whom it appears for. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAMELA (CONT'D)
                        It seems you think that I am 
                        responsible for its miraculous 
                        dawning every day. For goodness 
                        sake, it’s California! 

                                 RALPH
                        It certainly is!

           He gestures for her to get in.

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                             (trying a British accent)
                        Madame.

           Pamela grimaces.

           INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap. 
           Ralph climbs into the driver’s seat.

                                 PAMELA
                             (as much to herself as 
                              Ralph)
                        I would so much rather be 
                        accountable for the rain.

                                 RALPH
                        Oh, that’s sad.

                                 PAMELA
                        Sad is entirely the wrong emotion. 
                        I shan’t bother explaining why; 
                        it’ll simply
                             (she makes gesture for 
                              flying over his head)
                        Zip!

                                 RALPH
                        Okey dokey.

                                 PAMELA
                        The rain brings life!

                                 RALPH
                        So does the sun.

                                 PAMELA
                        Be quiet!

                                 RALPH
                        Yes ma’am.
           EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

           THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the 
           enormous gates of Disney’s Burbank Studio and pulls up in a 
           very twee forecourt.

           They are: DON DI GRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT 
           (34), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31), who has 
           a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face. 

           Don opens the car door for Pamela and puts out a hand to help 
           her from the vehicle but she pushes it away.

                                 DON
                        Pamela! Good morning!

                                 PAMELA
                        It is so discomforting to hear a 
                        perfect stranger use my first name. 
                        Mrs Travers. Please.

           The Sherman’s look at each other. Uh oh.

                                 DON
                        I do apologize, Mrs Travers. 
                             (beat)
                        I am Don Di Gradi, the script 
                        writer.

                                 PAMELA
                        Co-script-writer. I shall certainly 
                        be having my say Mr Di Gradi.

                                 DON
                        Wonderful! I welcome it.

                                 PAMELA
                        If indeed we ever sign off on a 
                        script.

           Bob and Dick flash each other a look. What the fu**?

                                 DON
                        Uh. Okay, so this is the rest of 
                        your team, Dick and Bobby Sherman! 
                        Dick’s music, Bob’s lyrics. 
                             (to Shermans)
                        Boys, this is the one and only Mrs 
                        P.L. Travers, creator of our 
                        beloved Mary.

                                 PAMELA
                        Poppins.

                                 DON
                        Who else?
                                 PAMELA
                        Mary Poppins. Never ever just Mary.
                             (to Dick and Bob)
                        A pleasure to meet you, though I  
                        fear we shan’t be acquainted for 
                        too long.

                                 BOB
                        Excuse me?

                                 PAMELA
                        These books simply do not lend 
                        themselves to chirping and 
                        prancing. No. Certainly not a 
                        musical. Now, where is Mister 
                        Disney? I’d very much like to get 
                        this started and finished as 
                        briskly as is humanly possible.

                                 DICK
                        Don?

                            BOB
                                                         PAMELA
           Not a music--?
                                              If you’ll point me in his 
                                              direction?

                                 DON
                        Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a 
                        little tour of the studio for you 
                        Mrs Travers--

                                 PAMELA
                        No thank you.

                                 DON
                        --Wanted to show the place off.

                                 PAMELA
                        No one likes a show off.

           Pamela takes herself off in the direction of a building. 

                                 DON
                        Mrs Trav-- it’s a long way to--

           Don hurries behind her, Bob looks like he is about to murder 
           the woman and Dick is finding the whole thing incredibly 
           amusing.

           EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

           The Shermans, Don and Pamela are riding through the studios 
           on a golf buggy - dutifully emblazoned with the famous mouse.

                                 PAMELA
                        I am perfectly capable of walking.
           A group of Disney characters bounce up to the golf cart, 
           waving brightly. Donald, Goofy, Snow White. Mickey himself 
           holds out his arms to Pamela for a hug - she recoils in 
           horror.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Shoo! Go away!

           The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod 
           meaning ‘beat it’. 

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Ghastly.

           Bob and Dick Sherman are in shock.

           INT. DISNEY - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office, 
           where a perfectly groomed and manicured secretary smiles 
           brightly at her.

                                 DON
                             (to secretary)
                        Could you let--

                                 PAMELA
                             (over, to secretary)
                        Would you let Mister Disney know I 
                        have arrived please?

           The secretary loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly 
           and makes her way down a long corridor to an imposing glass 
           door at the other end.

                                 DON
                        A word of advice Mrs Travers, if I 
                        may. 

                                 PAMELA
                        You may. Whether I heed it or not 
                        will be another matter entirely.

                                 DON
                        Wow. Uhm. It’s just that he can’t 
                        stand being called Mr Disney. We 
                        are all on a first name basis here.
                             (to secretary)
                        Carolyn, is he--?

           Carolyn knocks on the glass door, pokes her head in and the 
           door swings open to reveal a beaming Walt Disney, in the 
           flesh, his arms outstretched.

                                 WALT
                        At last!
           Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way 
           serenely towards the man, who is hurtling down the corridor 
           to greet her, talking a million miles an hour.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Oh my sweet gal! You cannot imagine 
                        how excited I am to meet you 
                        finally!

           Pamela doesn’t know what to do with this amount of 
           enthusiasm, he’s like a bounding puppy. She extends a formal 
           hand before he manages to get her in an embrace.

                                 PAMELA
                        Oh!

           He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to 
           compose herself, she hasn’t been that close to a man in 
           decades!

                        Hum-- ah. It’s an honour, Mister 
                        Disney.

           Disney winces.

                        ‘Mister Disney’ was my dad, and he 
                        was an ass. Come!

           He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads 
           her into his office.

           INT. DISNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Disney’s office is tastefully furnished and filled with 
           pictures of himself hanging out with movies stars. Framed 
           posters of his films provide splashes of colour to the cream 
           walls, and a cabinet contains his already significant 
           collection of trophies, many of them Academy Awards. If 
           Pamela is impressed she doesn’t show it.

                                 WALT
                        Please take a seat.

           Pamela takes a seat in front of Walt’s desk, glancing at the 
           sign above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the 
           edge of the desk, close to her, gazing at her.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)

           Interestingly, she doesn’t pull him up on using her first 
           name and shortening it too!

           He stands up and throws his arms in the air to emphasise his 
           point.

                        Pam, I want you to know that the 
                        last thing I would do, the very 
                        last, is tarnish a story I have 
                        cherished. 

           He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her 
           teacup, it’s awkward.

           Pamela is torn between finding Disney captivating and totally 
           barking.

           She pops it in her bag. Walt’s joviality, his bright 
           demeanour, vanishes in a split second.

           Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt and purposefully 
           strides out of the room, a smile across her face that Disney 
           does not see.

           Ginty and her family at their evening meal. Travers pours 
           wine for Margaret and himself, there is an almost 
           imperceptible glance at his wine glass from her.

           Travers sits, looking out at the evening sky, playing a 
           mournful air on his pipe, Ginty curled up in his lap, Jock 
           the dog asleep beside him. Margaret steps out onto the 
           veranda.

           Margaret strokes her hand over Ginty’s hair as the little 
           girl slips into the house but hovers unseen by the door, 
           watching her parents. Travers pats his knee and Margaret 
           perches on it.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           The Sherman brothers, Don DiGradi and Pamela sit awkwardly 
           around a large meeting table. It is laden with every type of 
           snack and beverage imaginable from bagels to candy, coffee to 
           soda, there are exotic fruits, enormous bouquets of flowers. 
           Pamela just stares at it all. 

                                 PAMELA

                        alone! Ugh, it’s so vulgar.

           She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the 
           table and plops it on top of Dick’s piano. He in turn moves 
           it from the piano to the floor.

                                 DICK

                        happily minding their own business 
                        and very much still alive.

           Dick hasn’t a clue what to say.

                        Let us begin.

           Pamela takes a seat, she perches her glasses on her nose and 
           raises an eyebrow at the cover of her script - “Walt Disney’s 
           Mary Poppins”.

                        Hm.

           A rustling of papers and one or two uneasy glances as the

           She nods.

                        Yes. That’s good, that can stay.

                                 DICK
                        That’s just the scene heading!

                                 PAMELA
                        --Though I do think we should say 
                        number 17, instead of just 17, yes? 
                        It’s proper.

                                 DICK
                        No one’s going to see it.

                                 PAMELA
                        I will see it.

           She makes a note in her script and looks to the others who 
           are dumbstruck.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Write it down, write it down, chop 
                        chop.

           They dutifully make the note.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Good-- onwards.

           They are interrupted by a secretary (DOLLY) carrying a new 
           tray of refreshments.

                                 DOLLY
                        I’m sorry to interrupt. 
                                 PAMELA
                        Is this a joke?

                                 DOLLY
                        Excuse me?

                                 PAMELA
                        Do you think you are a comedienne?

                                 DOLLY
                        I’m sorry I don’t understand.

           Dolly gingerly places the tray on the table and hovers, 
           distributing fruit and biscuits within reachable distance.

                                 PAMELA
                        Unbelievable. 

           Pamela shakes her head but decides to ignore Dolly and carry 
           on.

                             (she looks up)
                        This is to be your Mister Van Dyke 
                        is it?

                                 DICK
                        We do hope so.

                                 PAMELA
                        Hmmm, we’ll see about that. He’s 
                        totally wrong, totally and utterly.

                                 BOB
                        Dick is one of the greats!

                                 PAMELA
                        Dick Van Dyke? My dear, Olivier is 
                        one of the greats, Burton, Guinness 
                        - greats without question. I can 
                        assure you Dick Van Dyke is not.

                        Bert, a one-man band plays to a 
                        small gathering outside the gates 
                        to the park.

                        Bert says--
                             (she looks to Don)
                        You can do Bert.

                        poem, suitable for the occasion--

           Dick jumps up and sits at the piano.

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        --extemporized and thought up 
                        before your very eyes! Alright, 
                        here we go--

           Dick begins to play as Bob sings, Dick pounds the keys with 
           gusto, smiling away and occasionally joining in for a word or 
           two of the song, almost unable to contain himself with glee. 
           Bob, on the other hand, is much more serious, eyeing Travers 
           for her every reaction. 

                                 BOB
                             (singing)

                        "responstable." 

                                 BOB
                        Now, how does that sound?

                                 PAMELA
                        Hold it!

           Dolly winces on everyone’s behalf and leaves the room.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Responstable is not a word.

                                 DICK
                             (excited)
                        We made it up!

                                 PAMELA
                        Well, un-make it up.

           Silence.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve a thought! I’ve always liked 
                        Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay. Now, that 
                        would be a wonderful song for the 
                        film! Oh! And Admiral Boom could 
                        sing it! Do you see?

           Dick’s fingers crunch the piano keys.

           EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - EVENING

           Another half-eaten room service meal sits outside the door.
           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

           Pamela lies awake staring at the ceiling.

                                 PAMELA
                        Irresponstable.

           EXT. BACK PADDOCK - ALLORA

           CLOSE ON:

           A tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny 
           trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a 
           pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden 
           clothes-peg people.  

           Ginty puts the finishing touches to the bandstand and sits 
           back, staring in wonder as an echidna lumbers towards her 
           little park, snuffles at it and then plods away. The moment 
           is broken with the sound of hooves as her father appears, 
           atop his horse.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Ahhh, there’s my girl. 

           The horse moves up to her.  

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        That’s it Albert. Give Ginty a 
                        smooch. There’s a good boy, give 
                        her a little smooch.

           The velvety muzzle of the horse “smooches” Ginty’s neck and 
           ear.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Poor old Albert; he’s your secret 
                        uncle you know? But a miserable, 
                        horrid witch turned him into a nag.

                                 GINTY
                        Poor Uncle Albert! How can we fix 
                        him?

                                 TRAVERS
                        We have to teach the witch how to 
                        be happy again.
                             (beat)
                        Your mother’s been calling you for 
                        a good hour. I shouldn’t go if I 
                        were you, she’s after little slaves 
                        for housework!

           Travers leans down and swings Ginty up onto the horse, 
           placing her in front, facing him.
                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                             (reciting Yeats)
                        Ah, I must scrub and bake and sweep
                        Till stars are beginning to blink 
                        and peep; 
                        And the young lie long and dream in 
                        their bed
                        Of the matching of ribbons for 
                        bosom and head.

           Travers sighs, let’s the words ring in his ears, touches the 
           end of daughter’s nose.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to know what it feels 
                        like to fly Ginty? 

           She nods.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        I can make you fly! Yes, yes. 
                        Spread your arms like wings, then 
                        and we shall take off!

           He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her 
           arms.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Gee up, Albert. Yah!

           Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, 
           heading for the fence. Ginty squeals with delight, travelling 
           backwards at such speed.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Yah!

           In one clean leap, they’re up and over the fence, everything 
           slows in mid-air, like Ginty really is flying backwards.

           INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

           Pamela looks out of the window at the palm trees, the empty 
           sidewalks. She looks dazed, extremely tired--

                                 PAMELA
                        Nobody walks.

                                 RALPH
                             (sadly)
                        Leisurely stroll’s a gift. 

           EXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING

           The limo floats along the windy canyon roads, cresting the 
           top of the hill and revealing an awe inspiring vista. 
                                 RALPH
                        Beautiful ain’t it?

                                 PAMELA
                             (refusing him the 
                              satisfaction)
                        If you like that sort of thing. 

                                 RALPH
                        I do.

           EXT. FIELD - ALLORA - DAY

           Travers and Ginty still mid-air, reanimate and land. The 
           horse kicking up great clods of earth as they gallop away 
           into the distance.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - ANIMATION BUILDING - DAY

           Don DiGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row 
           of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles 
           along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which 
           Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from.

           She stops in front of a sketch of the Banks house.

                                 PAMELA
                        No, no, no. Goodness no. 

                                 DICK
                        No?

                                 PAMELA
                        The Banks house doesn’t look like 
                        that! No, I shall find you a 
                        photograph of my own home. That 
                        will suit. 
                             (to herself, slightly 
                              hysterical)
                        Oh dear, it’s all a big mistake. 
                        It’s all wrong.

                                 DON
                        What’s wrong with the--?

                                 PAMELA
                        It’s too grand! The Banks family - 
                        they’re normal, everyday sort of 
                        people.

           Don allows a tiny smile. She’s right. Pamela lingers over a 
           picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of 
           something like recognition on her face and then she simply 
           moves on. 
                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        Okay.

           She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                             (sighing)
                        Do I even have to say it?

                                 DON
                        Um-- yeah?

                                 PAMELA
                        Why in the world have you made Mrs 
                        Banks a silly suffragette?

                                 BOB
                        I wonder if Emmeline P would agree 
                        with that adjective--

                                 PAMELA
                        Quite possibly, looking back.

           Dick mouths ‘oh my god!’

                                 DON
                        It does seem strange that Mrs Banks 
                        allows her children to spend all of 
                        their time with the nanny when she 
                        has no job to speak of-- 

                                 PAMELA
                        Are you calling Mrs Banks 
                        neglectful?

                                 BOB
                        Yep!

                                 DON
                        No! Of course not! We just felt 
                        that if she had a job it would go 
                        some way to explaining--

                                 PAMELA
                        Being a mother is a job. A very 
                        difficult job and one that not 
                        everybody is up to, that not 
                        everybody should have taken on in 
                        the first place!

           The boys see that Pamela is talking about something 
           meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief 
           moment, until--

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        I will NOT have her called Cynthia! 
                        Absolutely not. It feels unlucky. 
           Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        No it should be something warm, a 
                        bit sexy.

           They all nearly choke at the word ‘sexy’ coming out of her 
           mouth.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        How about Araminta?

           No response.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Gwendolyn?

           No response.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Winifred!

                                 DON
                        I could go with Winifred.

                                 DICK
                        Yeah, Winifred’s good.

                                 PAMELA
                        I know!

           She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of 
           it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t Mr Banks?

           She turns to face Don and the boys.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t him.

                                 DON
                        Ahm, yeah, that’s him--

                                 PAMELA
                        He has a set of moustaches!

                                 DON
                        In the books he--

                                 PAMELA
                        I told the illustrator I didn’t 
                        like the facial hair but she chose 
                        to ignore me. This is MY film and 
                        this time around I shall have MY 
                        way.
                                 DOLLY
                             (clearing her throat)
                        Mrs Travers, it was a specific 
                        request, from Walt.

                                 PAMELA
                        Why?

           Everyone shrugs, they don’t know why.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t, he doesn’t, Mr Banks is 
                        clean shaven!

           Bob buries his face in his hands and let’s out a long, loud, 
           unashamed moan.

                                 BOB
                        Does it mattterrrrrrr?!

           Pamela stares at him.

                                 PAMELA
                        You can wait outside!

           She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob 
           is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        I shan’t say it again Robert.

           Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will 
           allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        KILL ME! KILL ME NOW!

                                 PAMELA
                             (to Dick)
                        What is wrong with his leg?

                                 DICK
                        He got shot.

                                 PAMELA
                        Hardly surprising.

           Pamela smiles sweetly.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Can I expect anymore drama from 
                        anyone else?
           INT. GOFF HOUSE - WASHROOM - ALLORA - MORNING

           Travers faces his reflection in the mirror as Ginty looks on 
           from the doorway. He picks up his razor and begins to scrape 
           away the stubble.

                                 GINTY
                        Why do you do that?

                              the air like a swordsman)
                        Swish! Which kind of kisses do you 
                        prefer Gintamina? Scratchy ones or

           Pamela stares at herself in the clouded bathroom mirror. She 
           runs a finger through the steam on the glass.

                                 PAMELA
                        Swish.

           Dolly, carrying a tray of cakes, stops at the meeting room 
           door where fractious voices ring out.

                                 PAMELA (O.S.)
                        No no no no no no no. A 29th time, 
                        NO and yes I’ve been counting. No. 
                        That makes 30!

           The slamming of a piano lid. Dolly pushes the door open with 
           her foot.

                                 PAMELA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        If you so much as step one foot in 
                        here with that tray I shall scream! 
                        One cannot live on cake alone!

           INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY

           Dolly stands in Disney’s office.
                                 DISNEY
                        Well?

                                 DOLLY
                        She has a lot of-- ideas.

                                 DISNEY
                        Ideas?

                                 DOLLY
                        About how she, uh, sees things.

                                 DISNEY
                        And how does she ‘see’ things?

           Dolly sighs and pulls out a note pad.

                                 DOLLY
                             (reading)
                        The name Cynthia has been changed 
                        to Winifred.

                                 WALT
                        Okay.

                                 DOLLY
                        She won’t approve Dick van Dyke.

           Walt laughs, Dolly allows herself a little giggle too.

                                 DOLLY (CONT’D)
                        The sketches of the Banks house 
                        make it look too opulent, there 
                        must be no hint of romance between 
                        Mary Poppins and Bert, she wants to 
                        know why Mr Banks has been given a 
                        moustache, the-- 

                                 WALT
                        I asked for that.

                                 DOLLY
                        Yes. We did tell her but she wants 
                        to know why.

                                 WALT
                        Because I asked for it.

                                 DOLLY
                        Right. Of course. Uh-- the tape 
                        measure Mary Poppins uses to record 
                        Jane and Micheal’s height must be a 
                        roll tape, not a ruler, we must 
                        find a section for the bird woman--

                                 DISNEY
                        But she’s boring!
                                 DOLLY
                        It will add gravi-- gravitas, she 
                        says.

                                 DISNEY
                        Gahd! Anything else?

                                 DOLLY
                        She only wants green vegetables and 
                        broth, I don’t know what that is 
                        but she wants it in the meeting 
                        room from now on and oh! She 
                        doesn’t want the colour red in the 
                        film-- at all.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Dick, Don and Pamela sit around the meeting table. Bob hovers 
           by the door in a right humph. Disney prefers to stand, 
           grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy.

                                 PAMELA 
                        I’ve simply gone off the colour. 

           Their mouths are agape.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        You did say I was to have final say 
                        did you not?

                                 DISNEY
                        We can’t make the film without the 
                        colour red! It’s set in London for 
                        god’s sake.

                                 PAMELA
                        And?

                                 DISNEY
                        There’s buses and mail boxes and 
                        guards uniforms-- the goddammned 
                        British flag! Pam, I’m not sure why 
                        you’re--

                                 PAMELA
                        I understand your predicament Mr 
                        Disney, I do. I just-- hm-- I don’t 
                        know what it is, I’m just suddenly 
                        very anti-red. I shan’t be wearing 
                        it ever again.

           Disney comes and sits on the table in front of Pam and locks 
           eyes with her.
                                 DISNEY
                        Is this a test? Are you requiring 
                        proof of how badly I wanna make you 
                        happy so that we can create this 
                        beautiful thing together?

           Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about 
           ‘creating something beautiful’ with Walt, but quickly 
           recovers and eyeballs him right back.

                                 PAMELA
                        I took you at your word Mr Disney 
                        and it seems my first stipulation 
                        has been denied. There will be many 
                        more, so-- perhaps we should just 
                        call it quits and I should hand you 
                        back these?

           She takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it 
           to him. Disney smiles at Pamela.

                                 DISNEY
                        Very well. No red in the film.

                                 DON
                        What?!

                                 DICK
                        Walt!

           Don and the Shermans can’t believe he has given in! Disney 
           strides out of the room.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Disney marches down the corridor away from the meeting room. 
           He stops, turns, shakes his fist at the closed door and moves 
           on.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pamela smiles a broad satisfied smile at the boys, smooths 
           down her skirt and opens the script.

           INT. DISNEY’S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Walt stands looking out of his window, a Gitane balancing 
           between his lips.

           DISNEY POV:

           Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms 
           clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits 
           perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out, 
           patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her. 
           Pamela, opens her eyes and Ralph nods hello. He opens the 
           back door for her and she climbs in.

                                 DISNEY
                        That woman.

           INT. BAR/LOBBY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON

           Pamela enters the lobby and heads for the elevator. She spies 
           the bar, a few people animatedly chatting over cocktails. The 
           elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar 
           instead.

                                 BARMAN
                        Good afternoon Ma’am. What can I 
                        fix you?

                                 PAMELA
                        A pot of tea.

                                 BARMAN
                        Sure thing.

           Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all 
           glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs 
           Travers. 

           The tea pot arrives.

                                 PAMELA
                        Thank you. Tea is a balm for the 
                        soul don’t you agree?

           But the barman has already moved on to another patron.

           Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come 
           and go. The barman talks with another customer further along 
           the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks 
           like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring 
           into her empty cup.

           INT. BANK - ALLORA - DAY

           An upright, top hatted gentleman holds the door of the bank 
           open chivalrously for Ginty - who wears a rather tattered 
           school uniform.

                                 GINTY
                        Thank you.

           She and the gentleman are startled for a second by a loud 
           crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers’ office. 
           The etching on the glass reads:

           INT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY

           Travers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on 
           the floor. He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been 
           drinking.

                        What sort of name is that?

                        fit to make a complaint that I was 
                        missed an appointment with him? Ha! 

           Travers is not taking this seriously at all.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                             (in a comedy voice)
                        Time’s Money, Goff, y’know! Time’s 
                        money my man!  

           The clerk laughs nervously.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        That’s right! Bell Hatchett! 
                        Beautiful hatchet. That’s what it 
                        means. And I suppose if the poor 
                        dumb lambs or cows on his Downs, 
                        are five minutes late with their 
                        milking or their calving, or they 
                        don’t drop dead on schedule when he 
                        wants a crown roast, he takes to 
                        them with the business end of his 
                        beautiful hatchet.  

           Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing 
           piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        There, whack! That’ll teach you for 
                        not dropping your bairns on 
                        schedule. Whack! Off with ye heads 
                        and out with ye sweetbreads! Whack! 
                        There’s a leg! Whack! A lamb’s fry! 
                        A steak and kidney pie! Whack whack 
                        whack! 

           The clerk is enthralled and intimidated all at the same time.
                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Whack!

           Travers falls into his chair laughing until he looks up, into 
           the bank, and his eyes widen. 

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Woops!

           The clerk follows Travers gaze and pales. They are looking at 
           the man who held the door for Ginty, none other than Randolph 
           Belhatchett.

                                 CLERK
                        Christ!  

           Travers is up and out of his seat, making his way to 
           Belhatchett.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Mr Belhatchett! 

           He thrusts out a hand, which Randolph doesn’t take.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Allow me to apologise profusely for

                        the other day. Pleeeeeeeease do 
                        accept my apologies, sincere as

                                 RANDOLPH
                        I want you gone.

                                 CLERK
                        Oh--

                                 TRAVERS
                        Of course! Yes! Sir! Gone I shall 
                        be!

           Travers salutes.

                                 GINTY
                        Daddy?

           All eyes fall upon the little girl who no one yet has 
           noticed. Travers is suddenly overcome with embarrassment and 
           guilt.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Ginty! Sweet thing! What are you 
                        doing here?

           Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.
                                 GINTY
                        You’re supposed to take me to the 
                        dentist. Remember?

                                 TRAVERS
                        Ah! The dentist! Yes! What kind of 
                        father am I?

                                 GINTY
                             (scared)
                        Are you fired again?
                             (looking at Belhatchett)
                        Are you going to--?

                                 TRAVERS
                        Ah, yes it does seem that--

                                 RANDOLPH
                             (to Ginty)
                        No. No sweetheart-- he isn’t.

           Randolph walks away, stopping to whisper in Travers ear.

                                 RANDOLPH (CONT’D)
                        If you can’t straighten up for your 
                        own sake. Do it for your daughter.
                             (muttering to himself)
                        Irresponsible.

           Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them.

                                 TRAVERS
                        How about this? We forget the nasty 
                        old dentist and we go get ice cream 
                        instead!?

           EXT. RIVER - ALLORA - DAY

           Ginty and Travers sit by the river. Ginty eats an enormous 
           ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask.

                                 TRAVERS
                        We share a Celtic soul, you and I. 
                        This world is just an illusion, 
                        Ginty old girl. As long as we hold 
                        that thought dear, they can’t break 
                        us. They can’t make us endure their 
                        reality, bleak and bloody as it is. 
                        Money, money, money. Don’t you buy 
                        into it Ginty! It’ll bite you on 
                        the bot! 
                             (he sighs)
                        It’s a chimera. The world, the 
                        bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-
                        whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an 
                        illusion.
           He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep 
           melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound 
           unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.

           EXT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Another untouched meal in the hallway.

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Pamela lies in the dark, the phone pressed to her ear. 

                                 PAMELA
                             (into phone)
                        I loathe this place, Mr Russell. 
                        How can a place so sunny be so 
                        cold? 

           We don’t hear what Diarmuid says.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        I meant heartless. I’m afraid a 
                        jumper wouldn’t suffice. It’s 
                        bringing up these-- it’s so hot and 
                        stuffy I feel like I am being 
                        attacked. These odd dreams, like my 
                        subconscious is after me. Punishing 
                        me for entertaining the idea that I 
                        might hand her over. I am at war 
                        with myself Mr Russell.
                             (beat)
                        The script is ghastly, exactly as I 
                        expected--
                             (beat)
                        Yes, a few more days and then I’ll 
                        decide--
                             (beat)
                        I know, I know I need the money. 
                        The money. The money. 
                             (to herself)
                        Money. It’ll bite you on the--
                             (into phone)
                        It’s all an illusion you know Mr 
                        Russell? All an illusion.
                             (beat)
                        Very well. Good morning and 
                        goodnight.

           She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright.  Wide 
           awake. Staring into the darkness.

           LATER
           Pamela is still awake, staring at the ceiling-- she checks 
           through her multitude of pill bottles for something to help 
           her. Nothing. She groans as she drags herself out of bed, 
           pacing the room, counting steps.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Serves me right. Money, money, 
                        money. Bit me on the bot.

           Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the 
           bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto 
           the stuffed toy for comfort.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           The meeting room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of 
           the cast and models of the sets all about the place. And of 
           course, the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now 
           accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a 
           fluorescent looking soup.

           We join them in the middle of a song. Don Di Gradi is 
           enchanted, Pamela is expressionless. Walt sits quietly in the 
           corner, tapping his feet along to the music.

                                 BOB
                             (singing)

                        Will help dum dum dum duuuum! 

           Dick whistles the Robin’s part of the song.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                             (singing)

                        helps the medicine go down

                        We’ll work out the other lyrics.

                        You see how it goes up on the word

                        Up.

                                 DON
                        It’s ironic.

                                 PAMELA
                        Is it?

                                 WALT
                        Forget ironic, it’s iconic.

           Pamela rolls her eyes.

                                 PAMELA
                             (sarcastic)
                        Bravo.

                        I won’t be able to stop singing 
                        that for weeks!

                                 PAMELA
                        It seems enormously patronising to 
                        me. The very sort of annoying tune 
                        you would have playing in one of 
                        your themed parks I daresay. All 
                        giddy and carefree, encouraging 
                        children to face the world unarmed. 
                        All they need is a spoon and some 
                        sugar and a brain full of fluff and 
                        they’re equipped with life’s tools. 
                        Wonderful! 

                                 WALT
                        What’s your point Pam?

                                 PAMELA
                        MRS Travers! My point is that, 
                        unlike yourself, Mary Poppins is 
                        the very enemy of sentiment and 
                        whimsy. She is truthful, she 
                        doesn’t sugar coat the darkness in 
                        the world that these children will 
                        eventually come to know. She 
                        prepares them for it, she deals in 
                        honesty. One must clean ones room; 
                        it won’t magically do it itself! 

           She waves the script in the air.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        This whole script is flim flam! 
                        Where is its reality? Where is its 
                        heart, where is the gravitas?

           She opens a window and flings the script out.
                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        No weight Mister Disney! See?

           Dick, Don, Bob and Disney look out of the window as the pages 
           flutter downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.

                                 WALT
                        No whimsy or sentiment says the 
                        woman who sends a flying nanny with 
                        a talking umbrella to save the 
                        children.

                                 PAMELA
                        You think Mary Poppins is saving 
                        the children Mr Disney?

           Pamela sighs, shakes her head.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Oh dear.

           EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - LATE AFTERNOON

           Pamela walks past Donald and Goofy as she makes her way to 
           the bench she waits on for Ralph.

           She sits down, wraps her arms around herself, closes her 
           eyes. 

                                 PAMELA
                             (to herself)
                        It goes up. 

           EXT. BACK PADDOCK - ALLORA - DAY

           Margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately 
           shushing her screaming infant. 

                                 MARGARET
                        There there. Shush shush now-- 

           Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large 
           hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the 
           girls.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                             (to the girls)
                        If you could just-- 

                                 TRAVERS
                             (calling)
                        Ahoy Goffs!

           The girls and Margaret look up, surprised to see Travers so 
           early.
                                 GINTY
                        Father!

           She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one 
           arm, catching Biddy with the other.

                                 MARGARET
                        What a lovely surprise! Did you 
                        finish early?

                                 TRAVERS
                        I couldn’t stop thinking about my 
                        beautiful girls on this beautiful 
                        day in this beautiful place and I 
                        thought to hell with it!

                                 MARGARET
                        But--

                                 TRAVERS
                        Buts are for goats my love!

           He dips her and smooches her.

                                 GINTY & BIDDY 
                        Urgh!

                                 TRAVERS
                             (whispering to Margaret)
                        I’ll put in extra hours tomorrow.
                             (to Ginty)
                        What are we playing?

                                 GINTY
                        The hen got out and we’ve been 
                        trying to catch her!

           Travers spies the clucking demon.

                                 TRAVERS
                        That’s no hen! That’s Katie Nanna, 
                        your mother’s ugly step sister!

           Margaret laughs.

                                 GINTY
                        Gracious!

                                 BIDDY
                        Really?!

           Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase 
           the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them 
           into the ground.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh! 
                                 TRAVERS
                        I’ll wash them again my love!

           Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.

           The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the 
           poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in, 
           Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a 
           whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it 
           back inside - out of sight, out of mind.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Go Sergeant Ginty! Fell the beast!

           Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and 
           scarpers. It’s chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the 
           evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other, 
           cursing and laughing.

                                 GINTY
                        Katie Nanna!

                                 TRAVERS
                        Oh she’s a foul fowl!

           INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Biddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled 
           firmly under her arm. She can hear the tense voices of her 
           parents. 

                                 MARGARET
                        --darling, it’s just that um-- a 
                        little concerned-- 

                                 TRAVERS
                        --Meg sweet, I had a throat scratch-
                        - 

                                 MARGARET
                        --the bank is getting you down 
                        again? Perhaps my sister--

                                 TRAVERS
                        God no! No. I can endure. I will 
                        endure. For the girl’s sake-- Just, 
                        please-- not Ellie.

                                 MARGARET
                        Oh my dear--

           Travers weeps and Ginty closes her eyes, buries her little 
           face in the hens feathers.

                                 GINTY
                             (whispering)
                        Foul fowl.
           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Pamela sits up in bed - leaning back into the open arms of 
           Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face 
           is screwed into a twist of unhappiness. 

           INT. DISNEY’S OFFICE - BURBANK - NIGHT

           Disney lies on his couch, lit only by a warm lamplight and 
           the glow of his cigarette. He turns the pages of his well 
           worn copy of Mary Poppins. 

           Piano music tinkles from somewhere in the building and Walt 
           gets up to follow its sound.

           INT. MUSIC ROOM - BURBANK - NIGHT

           Also in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano. Bob asleep 
           on a couch in the corner. Walt pushes the door open, Dick 
           knows he’s there but keeps tinkling away.

                                 WALT
                        You’re still here?

           Dick nods. Walt makes his way to the piano, sighs, sits next 
           to Dick on the stool.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        She’s going to say no isn’t she?

                                 DICK
                        A man has dreams of walking with 
                        giants
                        To carve his niche in the edifice 
                        of time
                             (singing)
                        Before the mortar of his zeal
                        Has a chance to congeal
                        The cup is dashed from his lips
                        The flame is snuffed aborning
                        He's brought to rack and ruin in 
                        his prime--

           Walt laughs out loud, he sings with Dick - Walt’s a terrible 
           singer - reading the lyrics from the music sheet.

                                 WALT & DICK
                        My world was calm, well ordered, 
                        exemplary
                        Then came this person, with chaos 
                        in her wake
                        And now my life's ambitions go with 
                        one fell blow
                        It's quite a bitter pill to take.
                                 WALT
                        Inspired by someone we know?

                                 DICK
                        Oh yeah.

           The men smile, bittersweet.

                                 DICK (CONT’D)
                        She might not say no, she might 
                        surprise us all.

                                 WALT
                        She won’t. 

                                 DICK
                        You don’t know that.

                                 WALT
                        I do. I know it, I know it only too 
                        well.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve fought this battle from her 
                        side. Pat Powers, he wanted the 
                        mouse and I didn’t have a bean back 
                        then.

           Dick raises his eyebrows.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        He was this big terrifying 
                        Hollywood producer and I was just a 
                        kid from Missouri with a sketch of 
                        a rodent but-- it woulda’ killed me 
                        to give him up.

           Walt peers down at the sleeping Bob.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Honest to god killed me. That 
                        mouse, he’s family.
                             (beat)
                        Get some sleep boys.

           Walt leaves the room.

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Pamela, still wide awake, hears a clattering noise from 
           outside, she jumps out of her bed and goes to her balcony.

           EXT. BALCONY - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Pamela looks out over the swimming pool and sees a man - the 
           spitting image of her father, Travers Goff - lying beside a 
           couple of fallen loungers. 
           She gasps, leans forward over the railings, the resemblance 
           is uncanny. Two hotel porters rush out and help him to his 
           feet. The man is swaying and virtually unable to walk.

                                 MAN
                             (slurring)
                        Thanking you s’much. S’very kind.

           Pamela stares at the space vacated by the drunken man as she 
           hangs precariously over the balcony. She spreads her arms 
           wide--

                                 TRAVERS (V.O)
                        The world is an illusion Ginty.

           EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - LATE AFTERNOON

           Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped 
           around her body, face to the sky.

           The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last 
           deafening chorus of the birds.

           Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit 
           jacket over his shoulder and his shirt and tie loosened. His 
           shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of 
           something close to despair.

           He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and 
           immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of 
           greeting.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Ahh the Countess Mary Sparklestick! 
                        Pray tell me, what are you 
                        concentrating so hard on? 

                                 GINTY
                        I am laying eggs!

                                 TRAVERS
                        Really!? Fabulous!

                                 GINTY
                        Today I am a hen.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Indeed! I can see the feathers 
                        sprouting as we speak!

           Margaret steps out onto the veranda, takes one look at her 
           husband and knows he is drunk.

                                 MARGARET
                        Ginty, could you lay the table for 
                        supper--
           She reaches for Travers jacket.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Darling, let me take your--

                                 TRAVERS
                             (over)
                        She can’t possibly lay a table; 
                        she’s busy laying eggs! Laying! 

                                 MARGARET
                             (her contorts in pain)
                        I’m sorry!

           She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty 
           gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.

           He swallows hard, eyes welling.

                                 TRAVERS
                             (urgent, his voice 
                              breaking)
                        Don’t you ever stop dreaming Ginty 
                        my love. Don’t you ever be like 
                        your old pa-- you follow your heart 
                        and soul, your dreams and rainbows-- 
                        don’t let anyone get in the way. 
                        Anyone. Don’t leave yourself always 
                        searching for-- something-- 

           He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the 
           porch. 

           Ginty is unnerved by her Travers’ demeanour, she creeps 
           around to the side of the house where she watches as the 
           silhouette of her father appears in the window of the 
           washroom. She watches the silhouette as it lifts a glass to 
           its lips and drinks.

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

           Pamela drags herself out of bed, day by day she is more 
           exhausted. She clearly hasn’t slept a wink-- again. 

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - MORNING

           Pamela is brushed and dressed, ready for another laborious 
           day at the studio. She looks at the door, looks at herself in 
           the mirror, licks a finger and presses a stubborn stray hair 
           back into place. She looks at Mickey, who stares back with 
           his big trusting eyes and her face creases into a singular, 
           silent sob and then she pulls herself together and leaves the 
           room.
           INT. LIMO - MORNING

           Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the 
           steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped 
           around her chest, her face turned to the window.

                                 RALPH
                        Ya alright Mrs?

           Pamela doesn’t even hear him.

           INT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush 
           in her hand, dripping colour down her arm.

           She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY.

                                 MRS CORRY
                        Wake up dear. You want your banner 
                        to be ready for the fair don’t you?

           Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads:

           ALLORA FAIR

           Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with 
           stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its 
           bridal.

           INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

           Margaret is pinning a highland dancing outfit on Biddy, 
           checking the hem of the skirt, and the detail on the velvet 
           jacket.

           Ginty perches nearby, shelling peas.

                                 BIDDY
                        Miss MacKenny said Father’s 
                        presenting the medals.

                                 MARGARET
                             (a flutter of pride)
                        He is indeed! On behalf of the 
                        bank.

                                 BIDDY
                        He might pin one on me for my 
                        dancing!

                                 MARGARET
                        He might!
           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - MORNING

           Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on 
           what’s going on in the room.

                                 DON
                        Mrs Travers?

           Again, she doesn’t hear.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Mrs Travers?

           Pamela looks at Don.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        We were just saying that we’d like 
                        to play you the song in the bank.
                             (beat)
                        Would that be good?

           Pamela nods, noncommittal.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                             (as Dawes Snr)
                        So you have tuppence? May I be 
                        permitted to see it?
                             (changing voice to Michael 
                              Banks)
                        No, I want it to feed the birds!
                             (back to Dawes Snr)
                        Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds 
                        and what’ve you got?

                        But! If you invest your tuppence
                        wisely in the bank

           EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        Safe and sound--

           The fairground has been set up for show day - tents are 
           erected, beautiful animals pad about their cages, a carousel 
           spins around with stunning white horses, roses on their 
           bridals. A small stage and dais stand central of the event 
           over which a large sign reads:

                       SPONSORED BY THE AUSTRALIAN JOINT STOCK BANK
                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Soon that tuppence safely invested 
                        in the bank will compound--

           The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her 
           family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as 
           they pass through the crowds. 

                                 BOB (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And you’ll achieve that sense of 
                        conquest--

           Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family 
           walk past.

                                 TRAVERS
                             (clears his throat)
                        Mr Belhatchett.

           Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his 
           family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        As your affluence expands--

           Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them 
           to Ginty and Biddy.

                                 MARGARET
                        Travers, Biddy’s stomach--

                                 TRAVERS
                        Oh, for Gods’ sake, Meg, stop 
                        whinnying like an old nag will you?

           Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but 
           she keep her mouth shut.

           Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments 
           tent.

                                 GINTY
                             (panicked)
                        Father... come look at the 
                        elephants!

           But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           As before.

                        In the hands of the directors
                        who invest as propriety demands.
           EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

           The family watch a group of school children on the stage 
           singing “God Save The King.” Travers quietly slips away from 
           his family and disappears into the crowd. 

                                 MARGARET
                             (to Ginty)
                        I’ll take Biddy to get ready for 
                        her dance.

           Margaret turns to speak to Travers but he’s gone.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Where’s--?

           Ginty stands on tip toes, scanning the crowd. 

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Trav--? 

           Margaret’s face falls but she takes Biddy by the hand and 
           heads for the stage. 

           Ginty sprints, straight for the refreshment tent.  

           Her running feet.

           Her thumping heart.

           Her breathless whisper, in time to the rhythm.

                                 GINTY
                        Please, please, please--

           INT. REFRESHMENT TENT - DAY

           On first glance, Ginty sees only an unidentified group of 
           local drinkers. She scans the group, and then, as relief 
           begins to dawn, she starts to turn away.  

           It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to 
           see the group part to reveal Travers at its centre.

           She takes a deep breath and moves forward, grabs Travers 
           hand.

                                 GINTY
                        Father, come and look. Biddy’s 
                        dancing.

                                 TRAVERS
                        In a moment, my princess. I’m 
                        talking.
                                 MAN
                        He’s almost at the punch line, 
                        darling. You can’t drag him off 
                        now.

                                 GINTY
                        But she’s-- she really wants you to 
                        watch, Dad. You’ll miss it.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Not now Biddy!

                        I’m Ginty.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Ginty! Shoo!

           Devastated, Ginty doesn’t know what to do, she pulls at his 
           shirt sleeve again. 

                                 GINTY
                        You said don’t give up--

           A waiter approaches and takes her by the arm, leading her 
           away.

                                 WAITER
                        Excuse me, Miss. It’s gentlemen 
                        only in this section of the tent.  
                        I think you’ll be more comfortable 
                        at the far end.
                             (beat)
                        Are you alright sweetheart?

                                 GINTY
                             (to waiter)
                        I’m scared my pa is--

           Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya, 
           in the entrance. Her mother’s face falls and crumples.

           EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

           Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the 
           dais, and finds his way to the speaker’s podium.  Margaret 
           and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Good afternoon, distinguished 
                        guests, our biggest supporter Mr 
                        Randolph Belhatchett and his lovely 
                        wife, ladies and gentlemen, boys 
                        and girls!  

           Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of 
           the bank staff.
                                 RANDOLPH
                        Why is he speaking for the bank?

                                 BANK WORKER
                        He’s the manager.

                                 TRAVERS
                        I’m honoured to be here on behalf 
                        of the Australian Joint Stock Bank. 
                        Shortly, it will be my very 
                        pleasant duty to present the awards 
                        to our young performers. But before 
                        I begin, I’d like to say a very few 
                        words to our very youngest citizens 
                        about the role of the - er, the 
                        Joint Stock Bank in our community. 

           Ginty allows herself to breathe. So far, so good.

                                 MARGARET
                        He’s using too many ‘verys’. He 
                        always says ‘very’ too much when 
                        he’s--

           She can’t say it. Ginty takes her mother’s hand but Margaret 
           pushes the hand away.

           Pamela turns away from Don and the Sherman’s and takes

                        England stands!

           EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

           There’s a smattering of applause, Travers is encouraged, 
           Margaret and Ginty look relieved, even hopeful.

           But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs 
           the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front 
           of the dais.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Uhmm. Thank you kindly. Thanking 
                        you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRAVERS (CONT'D)
                        Now-- what, what am I doing next? 
                        Oh! It’s a marvellous idea to 
                        encourage children to open 
                        accounts. My daughter, the Princess 
                        Ginty-- she’s-- uh. 
                             (looks at Ginty)
                        How old are you? Come up here.

           Ginty - what? Me?

           Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs, 
           makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.

           Margaret watches, growing uneasy.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Ginty has a bank account-- and 
                        that’s good. Give her a drink! 

           The audience is shocked.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                             (mumbling)
                        I mean give her a hand.

           Everyone is beginning to look uncomfortable.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        I shall return in just a moment to 
                        present the awards. But right now I 
                        must-- relieve myself.

           Gasps from the audience.

           Margaret - dying.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Give us your shoulder, Ginty, will 
                        you? I’m busting. There’s a good 
                        girl.

           Father and daughter walk towards the edge of the stage, 
           Travers leaning on Ginty’s shoulder. The shameful glare of 
           Allora burning into them.

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        When fall the banks of England, 
                        England falls!

           Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps 
           and topples off the stage. There’s an audible, horrible snap 
           as he lands in an undignified pile. His leg forms a clear ‘S’ 
           shape. But, despite his ugly injury, Travers cannot stop 
           laughing.
           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           The boys are laughing, congratulating one another.

                                 DON
                        I love it!

                        You think Walt’s gonna like it?

           Pamela takes a last look at the Mr Banks picture and spins 
           around viciously.

                                 PAMELA
                        Why did you have to make him so 
                        cruel?

           The boys jubilance is halted immediately.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        He was not a monster!

                                 DON
                        Who are we talking about? I’m

                                 PAMELA
                        And do those children write you 
                        letters, make drawings for you?

                                 DON
                        Of course.

                                 BOB

                             (cutting him off)
                        And would you tear up those gifts? 
                        In front of them?!

           Silence. They know where this is going.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        It’s a dreadful thing to do! I 
                        don’t understand! Why must Mr Banks 
                        tear up the advertisement his 
                        children have written and throw it 
                        in the fireplace!?

                        Why won’t he mend their kite? Why 
                        have you made him so unspeakably 
                        awful?
                             (beat)
                        For all the world to see, in

                        it.
                             (softly)
                        Please don’t--

           The boys are shocked at the level of upset.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t-- I’ll feel like I let 
                        him down again-- 

           INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

           Travers is in bed, his leg elevated and set with plaster.  He 
           is shaking badly with DT’s, his mood is poisonous.

           Ginty sits on the edge of the bed as the DOCTOR packs up his 
           bag.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay Travers, everything seems to 
                        be in order. You’ve a slight chest 
                        infection we need to keep an eye 
                        on.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Slight? Feels like an elephant is 
                        sitting on my torso. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        And your liver-- well.

                                 TRAVERS
                        I don’t suppose there’s any more 
                        you can give me for the pain?

           The doctor shakes his head at Travers wanton greed for more 
           and leaves the room.

                                 GINTY
                        I’ve brought you something father.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Be a darling Ginty my old pal! Help 
                        father out won’t you?

           Ginty is wary.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        In my washroom-- there’s a bottle 
                        of medicine that father needs--
                                 GINTY
                        Mother took it away.

           Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Godammit!

           Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper 
           from her pocket.

                                 GINTY
                        I wrote a poem for you.  It - it 
                        won first prize, at school.

           Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his 
           shaking hand.

                                 GINTY (CONT’D)
                        Would you like me to read it to 
                        you?

                                 TRAVERS
                        I’m not a cripple!

           Once again, the agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand.  
           Finally, the humiliation is too much for Travers.  He scans 
           the page rapidly and lowers his hand.

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        It’s hardly Yeats, is it?

           Ginty is devastated. But more than this there’s a hardening 
           in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far 
           she’s held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela 
           to come.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

           Pamela rushes from the meeting room, down the corridor, her 
           face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure. Don 
           rushes out after her.

                                 DON
                        Mrs Travers!

           He stops, recognizing she doesn’t need to be followed.

           INT. KITCHEN - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

           Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash 
           but doesn’t find what she’s looking for.
           EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

           Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the 
           lot, past Ralph - who’s taking his lunch at the cafeteria - 
           and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of 
           a soundstage.

           EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

           Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun 
           as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what 
           it is she’s looking for.

           EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

           Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into 
           the dirt and lawn.

           INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY

           Ginty creeps into her father’s room, he sleeps fitfully, and 
           presses the half-full bottle into his hand. Covering both 
           hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room.

           EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY

           Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in 
           the grass. 

                                 RALPH
                        Mrs?

           Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she’s not 
           crying.

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                        I, uh, brought you a tea.

           He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.

                                 PAMELA
                        It’s blasphemy to drink tea from a 
                        paper cup.

           Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He’s not quite 
           sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea. Pamela 
           puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits and 
           pieces of twig and bloom that she’s plucking from the area 
           around her.

                                 RALPH
                        Everything okay Ma’am? Would you 
                        like me to drive you home?
                                 PAMELA
                        All the way to England? Yes, 
                        please.

           Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.

                                 RALPH
                        You got family back there Mrs?

                                 PAMELA
                        You’re an impertinent man you know? 
                        You ask an awful lot of questions 
                        that have no relevance to you being 
                        able to carry out your duties.

                                 RALPH
                             (laughing)
                        I know! I do, do that. Yes!

                                 PAMELA
                        And you have no barometer.

           Ralph is confused.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t family.

           She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs 
           together.

                                 RALPH
                        Ma’am; I--

           Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he 
           looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a 
           small line through the grass then hands it to him.

                                 PAMELA
                        Make a little furrow, there.

           Ralph dutifully does as he’s told, looking over his shoulder 
           for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.

           Ralph pokes the ground, thinking. 

                                 RALPH
                        I gotta kid.

                                 PAMELA
                        Well, most people do.

                                 RALPH
                        She’s got all kinds of troubles.

           Pamela raises an eyebrow.
                                 RALPH (CONT’D)
                        Special needs you know?
                             (beat)
                        She’s in a wheelchair see? That’s 
                        why I concern myself with the 
                        weather-- sunny day she can sit out 
                        in the garden. Rainy day I have to 
                        leave her cooped up inside.
                             (beat)
                        Worry ‘bout the future, but then I 
                        stop cuz you can’t do that. Only 
                        today.

           Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes 
           holes in it.

                                 PAMELA
                        Now look.

           She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes 
           and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of 
           Pamela’s tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig 
           struts forming a roof.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        It’s a band stand.

           She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid 
           into Ralph’s trench, which runs all the way around the park.

                                 RALPH
                        A river!

                                 PAMELA
                             (correcting him)
                        Lake.

                                 RALPH
                        Lake.
                             (beat)
                        Hey! I wish I could take her there!

           He points at the miniature park.

                                 PAMELA
                        Wouldn’t that be nice?

           INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem 
           to her chest. 

           The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows 
           looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she 
           seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There’s 
           just nothing there--
           She gently taps Ginty awake, kneeling beside the bed.

                                 MARGARET
                             (whispering)
                        I know you gave it to him. 
                             (squeezing Ginty’s hand)
                        All the hope is in the bottom of 
                        that bottle.

                                 GINTY
                        Mother?

                                 MARGARET
                        I want you to take care of the 
                        children.

           Ginty is groggy, she doesn’t understand.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        Watch over them.

           Ginty sits up.

                                 MARGARET (CONT’D)
                        I know you love your father more. 
                        But one day you’ll understand.

                                 GINTY
                        What?

           Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed 
           following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is 
           crying.

           EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT

           Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in 
           her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden 
           like some ethereal ghost.

                                 GINTY
                        Mother!

           She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.

                                 BIDDY (O.S.)
                        Ginty!

           Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her 
           mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.

                                 GINTY
                             (calling)
                        Mother! Mother!

           The baby is screaming now.
           INT. GINTY BIDDY & MOYA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in 
           it, she scoops Moya up from the crib.

                                 BIDDY
                        Where’s ma?

                                 GINTY
                        Once upon a time there were three 
                        little girls alone in a house.  
                        They knew nothing about the big 
                        wide world outside. 

           She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily 
           outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar 
           and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.

                                 GINTY (CONT’D)
                        They were afraid.

           She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting 
           her mother to be standing there any minute but there is 
           nothing.

           EXT. CREEK - NIGHT

           The mud-stained hem of Margaret’s nightdress sweeps along the 
           ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of 
           the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her 
           ankles, soaking the nightgown.

                                 GINTY (V.O.)
                        But the faeries were guarding them 
                        and they said to each other “We 
                        shall send them a guide to show 
                        them the way through the cold, dark 
                        world to fairyland.”

           EXT. PADDOCK - GOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

           Biddy and Moya are calming.

                                 GINTY
                        And who do you think they sent?  
                        Who do you think they sent flying 
                        through the starry, starry sky to 
                        carry us off to fairyland?

                                 BIDDY
                        An elf?

           Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence.

                                 GINTY
                        Their old Uncle Albert of course!
           EXT. CREEK - NIGHT

           Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the 
           creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the 
           water. She wants to sink down and simply float away. 

           From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret 
           turns her head and there, atop the horse, are her children.

           Margaret begins to weep.

           Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother, 
           wading into the water to grab hold of her.

           Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep 
           water.

                                 MARGARET
                        Sometimes a person we love, through 
                        no fault of his own, can’t see past 
                        the end of his nose.

                                 GINTY
                        It’s time to go home, ma. 

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DRAWING ROOM - EVENING

           Pamela scans the bookshelves in the drawing room, she takes a 
           couple and leaves.

           INT. SUITE - EVENING

           Pamela flicks through the books intently, jotting something 
           down on a scrap of paper every now and then. 

           Presently, the phone rings. Pamela almost jumps out of her 
           skin. She rushes to grab it.

                                 PAMELA
                             (into phone)

           INT. DISNEY’S OFFICE - BURBANK - EVENING.

           Disney sits at his desk, flicking through cartoon drawings of 
           penguins.

                        I wanted to check up on you.

                                 PAMELA
                        Check ups are for medical

                        plate and chain mail, sword aloft

                                 WALT
                        I heard things didn’t go too well 
                        today.

                                 PAMELA
                        They went as well as they’ve gone 
                        every other day that I’ve been 
                        here. I don’t recall ‘special’ 
                        phone calls from you on any of 
                        those other evenings.

                                 WALT
                        I’m wondering how we can make you 
                        happy.

                                 PAMELA
                        Ha! 

                                 WALT
                        You’re wondering that too.

           Silence.

                        I cannot tell you how uninterested, 
                        no, positively sickened I am at the 
                        thought of going to see your dollar 
                        printing machine Mr-- Walter.

           She notices Mickey’s innocent eyes staring at her and gently 
           turns his face away.

                        what the thunderstorm is to the 
                        air.

           Walt slams the phone down. Pamela stares at it in shock!

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        He hung up! I’m! I! I can’t believe

           Walt leans back in his chair and grins, Carolyn enters.

           INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA

           Margaret and the children are wrapped in blankets as she 
           cradles all three in front of the open fire. Ginty wipes away 
           the tear that trickles down her mothers face.
           INT. GOFF HOUSE - TRAVERS BEDROOM - ALLORA - MORNING

           Ginty sits beside her father, he is restless and sweating in 
           his sleep as she wipes his face with a damp sponge.  

           The sound of a buggy pulling up outside breaks the silence.

                                 MARGARET (O.S.)
                        Oh my!

           And then a new voice, clear as a crystal bell.

                                 AUNT ELLIE (O.S.)
                        Margaret, my poor child.  I simply 
                        had to come.

           Travers eyes spring wide open in horror.

                                 TRAVERS
                        The Aunt.

           INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - MORNING

           A parrot headed umbrella hangs from the back of a chair.

           An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries - 
           plonked on the living room table and there beside it, 
           upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair 
           scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket.  

           Ginty and Biddy look on in awed silence as Ellie begins to 
           remove an endless supply of belongings from her bag.

                                 ELLIE
                        Now, I’ve brought every new fangled 
                        fever treatment available in 
                        Sydney.

           She glances at the girls.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Will you just stand there and stare 
                        or will you help? I spy a multitude 
                        of jobs to be done.

                                 MARGARET
                        They’ve been so worried-- I’ve--

                                 ELLIE
                        Do stop babbling nonsense! I’m here 
                        now and I shall fix everything.

                        - well I shouldn’t like to say.

           Young Pamela and Biddy look on in a kind of bewildered trance

           INT. LIMOSINE - MORNING

           Ralph drives along solemnly. Pamela looks out of the window, 
           confused.

                                 PAMELA
                        Where are we--? This isn’t the way.

                                 RALPH
                        Change of venue this morning 
                        apparently.

                                 PAMELA
                             (realizing where she’s 
                              being taken)
                        Ugh.

                                 RALPH
                        I was thinking about our-- tea 
                        party?

                                 PAMELA
                        I’m sure I don’t know what you’re--

                                 RALPH
                             (over)
                        Yesterday, the little park.

                                 PAMELA
                        Little park? I haven’t a clue what 
                        you’re talking about.

                                 RALPH
                        But--
                                 PAMELA
                        Concentrate on the road. Always 
                        chitter chattering!

           EXT. DISNEYLAND VIP ENTRANCE - DAY

           Ralph drives Pamela right up to the VIP entrance to the park. 
           Walt Disney himself is waiting at the gate.

                                 RALPH
                        Oh! Isn’t that nice? Wowzers. Never 
                        met him myself but there he is! 
                        Right there. Real. Living, 
                        breathing. Oh boy!

           Ralph jumps out of the car to let his passenger out.

           EXT. DISNEYLAND - DAY

           Pamela makes her way towards Walt. Ralph hovers at the car, 
           filling his eyeballs with as much Walt Disney as he can get 
           before he has to drive away.

                                 WALT
                        Pam!

                                 PAMELA
                        Do you always get everything you 
                        want Walter?

                                 WALT
                        Pretty much! 

                                 PAMELA
                        With the exception to the rights to 
                        my books of course!

                                 WALT
                        War ain’t over yet Pam!

           Walt takes Pamela by the arm and leads her through the gates, 
           he turns to some passersby.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        This woman’s a goddamn genius!

           The passersby are astounded at seeing the one and only Walt 
           Disney. 

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the Magic Kingdom!

           Pamela’s eyes nearly pop put of her head with brightness of 
           the place, unbelievable colour and excitement.
                                 PAMELA
                        Is it all like this?

           Pamela pops a headache pill.

                                 WALT
                        Yup! Isn’t it wonderful?
                             (beat)
                        See that tree there? 

           Walt gestures to an absolutely enormous tree.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Three million leaves, four million 
                        flowers. 

                                 PAMELA
                        Gosh.

                                 WALT
                        And they said only God could make a 
                        tree!

           Pamela rolls her eyes.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t wanna be here so 
                        I’m gonna take you to one-- to my 
                        favourite amusement and then I’ll 
                        set you free.

           EXT. KING ARTHUR’S CAROUSEL - DISNEYLAND - DAY

           The carousel slows to a halt and a herd of excited children 
           climb down from the horses and disappear into the park.

                                 WALT
                        Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if 
                        you would ride Jingles. She’s my 
                        wife’s favourite horse.

           He escorts Pamela to a beautiful white horse, roses on it’s 
           bridal.

                                 PAMELA
                        No thank you. I’m happy to watch.

                                 WALT
                        No greater joy than that seen 
                        through the eyes of a child.

           Pamela looks at the children climbing onto the carousel.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        There’s a child in us all.
                                 PAMELA
                        Maybe in you Mister Disney, but 
                        certainly not I.

                                 WALT
                        Get on the horse Pamela!

           Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        When we first met, you said to me 
                        ‘they’re family.’ 

                                 PAMELA
                        I said what?

                                 WALT
                        Mary Poppins, the Banks’s, they’re 
                        family.
                             (beat)
                        The boys have had an idea for your 
                        Mister Banks. I think it’ll make 
                        you happy.

                                 PAMELA
                        You brought me all the way out here 
                        to tell me that?

                                 WALT
                        No. I brought you all the way out 
                        here for monetary gain. Had a wager 
                        with the boys that I couldn't get 
                        you on a ride. I win!

           He clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride 
           controller and off they go!

           Pamela gently bobs up and down, Walt waves to her and she 
           sees the unbridled thrill from the child in Mister Disney 
           spilling out. The tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to 
           surface on her lips.

           INT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

           Ellie - a look of deep satisfaction on her face - helps 
           Margaret and the girls collect scattered clothing, fold it 
           and put it away.

           They shake out tablecloths and tea towels, wash dishes and 
           stack them neatly into cupboards, sweep dust from the porch 
           and turn the chaos into an orderly, comfortable, home. 
           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM

           All the tables have been pushed to the walls, Don is just 
           pushing the last one away as Pamela comes in, followed by 
           Dolly with the tray carrying Pamela’s tea.

                                 DON
                        Good morning Mrs Travers!

           She looks at the new arrangement of the room.

                                 PAMELA
                        What horrors have you in store for 
                        my beautiful characters today, hm?

           Bob clenches a fist but Dick gives him a look that says: keep 
           calm. 

                                 DON
                        Now, Mrs Travers you sit here.

           He ushers her to a chair facing the centre of the room. He 
           hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to 
           their knees so that they are half the height of Bob. 

           Pamela raises an eyebrow.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        We thought about what you said Mrs 
                        Travers and Mr Banks isn’t cruel. 
                        He isn’t. We’ve got a new ending 
                        for the film. Watch.

           Bob pulls a kite out from behind his back.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                             (as Michael)
                        He mended it! It’s wonderful!

                                 DOLLY
                             (as Jane)
                        However did you manage it?

                                 PAMELA
                             (to herself)
                        He mended it?

           Dick strikes a chord on the piano.

                                 BOB
                             (singing)
                        With tuppence for paper and strings
                        You can have your own set of wings
                        With your feet on the ground
                        You’re a bird in flight
                        with your fist holding tight
                        To the string of your kite
                        Oh oh oh oh
           Bob takes the hands of Don and Dolly and he dances around 
           with them (awkwardly as they are still on their knees.) 
           Pamela’s eyes on the fixed kite.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go fly a kite
                        Up to the highest height
                        Let’s go fly a kite and send it 
                        soaring
                        Up through the atmosphere
                        Up where the air is clear
                        Oh let’s go fly a kite

           Don notices Pamela’s foot tapping, he stands up.

                                 DON
                        And then Mrs Banks goes to fetch 
                        her suffragettes ribbon.
                             (as Mrs Banks)
                        A proper kite needs a proper tail 
                        don’t you think?!

           Don drops to his knees again.

                                 BOB/DICK/DON/SECRETARY
                        Let’s go fly a kite
                        Up to the highest height

           Is Pamela humming too?!

                                 BOB/DICK/DON/SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go fly a kite and send it 
                        soaring

           Don bows to Pamela puts his hand out to her and to his 
           surprise, she accepts and they begin to waltz. Pamela is 
           surprisingly elegant and accomplished.

                                 BOB/DICK/DON/SECRETARY/PAMELA
                        Up through the atmosphere
                        Up where the air is clear
                        Oh let’s go fly a kite

           Everybody is up and dancing, it’s like something out of a 
           Disney movie!

                                 BOB
                        When you send it flying up there
                        All at once you’re lighter than air

           Dolly breaks away and rushes from the room.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        You can dance on the breeze over 
                        houses and trees--
           INT. DISNEY OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           Dolly pants her way to the top of the stairs, and sees Disney 
           just about to enter his office.

                                 DOLLY
                        Mr Disney! Walt!

           Walt spins around.

                                 DOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to interrupt.  It’s just 
                        she-- she’s dancing! Mrs Travers.  
                        She’s dancing with Don!

           Disney cracks a great big smile.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        With your fist holding tight
                        To the string of your kite

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           As before.

                                 BOB/DICK/DON/PAMELA
                        Oh Oh Oh Oh
                        Let’s go fly a kite
                        Up to the highest height
                        Let’s go fly a kite and send it 
                        soaring
                        Up through the atmosphere
                        Up where the air is clear
                        Oh let’s go fly a kite!

           They all collapse in a heap, exhausted and thrilled.

                                 PAMELA
                        Well. 

                                 BOB
                        Well?

                                 PAMELA
                        Yes! He fixes the kite! Oh, I love 
                        it!

           Dick punches the air.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Though proper English would be ‘Let 
                        us go and fly a kite.’

           Bob glares at her.
                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        But I might be willing to overlook 
                        that.

           Everybody sighs with relief and Pamela looks to the 
           caricature of Mr Banks with deep warmth.

           INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - EVENING

           Ginty sits with her father, he’s a shadow of his former self, 
           extremely ill. The shaking has stopped, his lips are parched 
           and blueish.

                                 TRAVERS
                        Look at you-- all ship shape.

           Travers reaches up a shaking hand and musses up Ginty’s 
           perfectly plaited hair.

                                 GINTY
                        I re-wrote the poem father.

           Travers doesn’t respond. Ginty reaches into her pocket, takes 
           out tuppence.

                                 GINTY (CONT’D)
                        She gave me tuppence.

           She shows it to him in her open palm.

                                 GINTY (CONT’D)
                        Shall I buy you something father?

                                 TRAVERS
                             (barely audible)
                        Pears--

           INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Pamela sits bolt upright in bed, panicked.

                                 PAMELA
                        Father? 

           EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY

           Ginty skips off the porch, clutching her tuppence. Chattering 
           to herself about pears.

           EXT. LAUREL CANYON - MORNING

           The limo crests the top of the hill.
           INT. LIMO - MORNING

           Ralph admires the view as he always does.

                                 PAMELA
                        Do you know you’re quite right? It 
                        is beautiful. Exquisite.

                                 RALPH
                        It’s always new.

           INT. DISNEY STUDIOS - MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Pamela is genuinely curious.

                                 PAMELA
                        How in the world does Mister Disney 
                        propose to train penguins to 
                        dance?!

                                 BOB
                        Are you serious?
                             (to Dick)
                        Is she serious?

           Dick shrugs.

                                 PAMELA
                        I’ve seen his implausibly leaved 
                        trees so I assume he does have some 
                        insane penguin wrangling scheme but 
                        it does seem rather far fetched. 

                                 DON
                        Mrs Travers. He doesn’t intend to 
                        train actual penguins.

                                 PAMELA
                        Oh?

                                 DICK
                        They’re animated.

                                 DON
                             (over)
                        No!

                                 PAMELA
                        I’m sorry?

                                 DICK
                             (realizing he’s said 
                              something he shouldn’t)
                        Not-- nothing. No.
           Pamela’s face turns beetroot red, she pushes herself away 
           from the table and storms out of the room, slamming the door 
           behind her.

                                 DON
                        Ugh.

                                 BOB
                        I thought we were home free after 
                        your cavorting with the old bag.

           INT. DISNEY - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

           Pamela comes storming into the offices suite. Carolyn smiles 
           up from her desk.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Good afternoon Mrs Travers!

                                 PAMELA
                        Where is Mister Disney?

                                 CAROLYN
                        If you’d like to take a seat--

                                 PAMELA
                        I would not like to take a seat 
                        thank you. I would like to--

           She heads for Disney’s office and Carolyn is up and running 
           after her down the corridor.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Mrs Travers, please!

                                 PAMELA
                        DISNEY!

           Pamela pushes open Walt’s doors, catching him with a 
           cigarette in his mouth. 

                                 CAROLYN
                        Walt, I’m so sorry.

                                 WALT
                        Don’t worry Carolyn, please close 
                        the door.

           Disney gestures to his cigarette.

                                 WALT (CONT’D)
                        Never let anybody see me smoking. 
                        I’d hate to encourage bad habits. 
                        Please, sit down.
                                 PAMELA
                        I shall not sit in the seat of a 
                        trickster! A fraudster! A sneak!

                        Mrs Travers, what in the world has 
                        upset you so?

                                 PAMELA
                        Penguins!

           Walt is confused.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Penguins have very much upset me 
                        Mister Disney! Animated, dancing 
                        penguins! Now, you have seduced me 
                        with the music Mr Disney, yes you 
                        have. Those Sherman boys have quite 
                        turned my head but I shall not be 
                        moved on the matter of cartoons. 
                        Not one inch sir!

                                 WALT
                        It’s a sequence--

                                 PAMELA
                        You promised me. You promised me 
                        that this film would not be an 
                        animation!

                                 WALT
                        And it isn’t!

                                 PAMELA
                        So they’re real penguins?

                                 WALT
                        No they’re animated.

           Pamela reaches into her purse and pulls out the assignment of 
           rights papers.

                                 PAMELA
                        Cartoons are for children! Cartoons 
                        are an illusion, they are not real, 
                        real-- reality!

           She tears them in half and flings them at Disney.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Good day Mister Disney.
           She turns on her heel and leaves. Disney stares at the pages 
           aghast.

                                 WALT

           Pamela flees to her bench, wrapping her arms around herself. 
           Disney comes after her.

                                 WALT
                        Please Mrs Travers-- You must

                                 PAMELA
                        You shouldn’t make promises you 
                        can’t keep, especially to children, 
                        they hold on to them you see? And 
                        those promises they just sit there 
                        inside of them, like little doses 
                        of poison, all those broken 
                        promises, eating away forever.

                        The books weren’t written for the 
                        children. They were written for the

           Ralph pulls up and gets out of the car.
                                 RALPH

           He suddenly sees that Pamela is more deeply entrenched in 
           herself than usual and his priority becomes her.

                             (to Walt)
                        Excuse me.

           Ralph moves past Walt and gently taps Pamela on the shoulder, 
           she opens her eyes, relieved to see him.

                                 RALPH (CONT’D)

                        Life is filled with prickles and 
                        heartbreaks. It all too frequently 
                        disappoints. It simply cannot be 
                        dunked in molasses or swallowed 
                        down with a spoonful of sugar, as I 
                        think your version of Mary Poppins

           She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her 
           but Ralph blocks it.

                                 RALPH
                        The lady’s ready to go now sir.

           Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car.

           Walt watches the car disappear and then takes a seat on 
           Pamela’s bench, he wraps his arms around himself and looks to 
           the sky.

           Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for 
           Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and 
           opens the trunk of the car.

                                 RALPH
                             (chuckles)
                        I really have enjoyed it. Didn’t 
                        know who you were at first and then 
                        guess what?

                                 PAMELA
                        You found out?

                                 RALPH
                        I was telling my daughter all about 
                        my day and how I was driving this 
                        nice lady writer for Mr Disney and 
                        she asked me your name. Couldn’t 
                        remember it so the next day I 
                        brought the sign home, you know, 
                        the one I held up for you when I 
                        picked you up at the airport?

                                 PAMELA
                        And--
                                 RALPH
                        And--
                             (he leans into the 
                              passenger window)
                        And she makes me go to her bedroom 
                        and get this!
                             (he pulls out a Mary 
                              Poppins book)
                        Can’t stop reading it. I’m very 
                        slow mind.

           Pamela smiles.

                                 PAMELA
                        Would you like me to sign it?

                                 RALPH
                             (delighted)
                        Would you?!

                                 PAMELA
                        I’d be honoured.

           Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Your daughters name?

                                 RALPH
                        Jane.

                                 PAMELA
                        Really?

                                 RALPH
                        Uh huh. Like the girl in the book.

                                 PAMELA
                             (reading as she writes)
                        To Jane and her dearest father--
                             (she looks at him)
                        I’ve just this instant realized I 
                        don’t know your name.

                                 RALPH
                        Ralph.

           She shakes his hand.

                                 PAMELA
                        Pamela.

                                 RALPH
                        Pamela.

                                 PAMELA
                        You’re the only American I have 
                        ever liked, Ralph.
           Ralph is chuffed to bits.

                                 RALPH
                        May I ask why?

                                 PAMELA
                        No. Now take this--

           She hands him the scrap of paper.

                                 RALPH
                             (reading)
                        Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, 
                        Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo--
                             (beat)
                        What is this?

                                 PAMELA
                        They all had special needs. Jane 
                        can do anything that anyone else 
                        can do, do you understand?

           Ralph looks at her in awe.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        Look at the bottom.

                                 RALPH
                        Walt Disney!

                                 PAMELA
                        Attention deficit and 
                        hyperactivity. Explains everything!

           Pamela turns to leave.

                                 RALPH
                        Thank you Mrs. 

           Pamela doesn’t look back.

           EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

           Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She 
           ruffles Jocks fur before entering the house.

           INT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY

           Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and 
           emotional voices in the hall. She pokes her head into the 
           hallway. There, huddled together, whispering are her mother, 
           the doctor and Aunt Ellie.

           Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.
           Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of 
           her heart.

           Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo. 
           There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen, 
           shattered. She comes down to Ginty’s level.

                                 MARGARET
                        Daddy-- 

           Ginty cannot react.  

           Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown 
           paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor.

           Ginty’s eyes fix on Aunt Ellie’s umbrella on the back of the 
           chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.

                                 GINTY
                        I want to see my father.

                                 MARGARET
                        No, you mustn’t.

                                 GINTY
                        I want to see him!

           Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing, 
           biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.

                                 AUNT ELLIE
                        Let her go Margaret.

           Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father’s 
           bedroom.

           INT. TRAVERS’ BEDROOM - DAY

           Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed.  She 
           stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step 
           by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The 
           sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted 
           with blood. The front of her father’s nightdress is also 
           bloodstained. Ginty’s eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes 
           open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither 
           peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.

                                 GINTY
                        I dropped the pears.

           She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand.

                                 GINTY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry daddy.

           Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without 
           turning around.
                                 GINTY (CONT’D)
                        I thought you said you would fix 
                        everything.

           EXT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - AFTERNOON

           A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs 
           out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out 
           too.

           INT. SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - AFTERNOON

           Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase.

                                 PAMELA
                        Hello house.

           INT. SHAWFIELD STREET - AFTERNOON

           Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching the 
           afternoon light fade and replace itself with darkness. She 
           gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and a lifetime’s 
           despair.

           There’s a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn’t 
           know how long she’s been asleep but it’s black outside. She 
           get’s up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will 
           take her. 

           She swings it open.

                                 PAMELA
                        Oh my god.

           Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite 
           literally, speechless.

                                 WALT
                        It was one heck of a job getting a 
                        seat on the very next flight, let 
                        me tell you.

                                 PAMELA
                        But, you always get what you want 
                        eventually. Isn’t that right 
                        Walter?

           He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.

                                 WALT
                        How about you show me how to make 
                        one of those nice English cups of 
                        tea?
           INT. PAMELA’S DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

           Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a 
           teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he 
           places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.

                                 PAMELA
                        Milk. The milk goes in first.

           He attends to it.

                                 WALT
                        I remember.

                                 PAMELA
                        And whiskey. I’ll have whiskey in 
                        mine.

           Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes 
           it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.

                                 WALT
                             (surprised)
                        Oh. 
                             (beat)
                        Oh well, whilst in Rome!

           He pours a slug into his tea too.

                                 PAMELA
                        You’ve come to change my mind. To 
                        beat me into submission.

                                 WALT
                        I’ve come because you misjudge me.

                                 PAMELA
                        How do I misjudge you?

                                 WALT
                        You look at me and you see some 
                        kind of Hollywood King Midas. You 
                        think I’ve built an empire and that 
                        I want to use your Poppins as just 
                        another brick in the colossus. You 
                        think I see her with a carpetbag 
                        full of greenbacks.

                                 PAMELA
                        And don’t you?

                                 WALT
                        If that was all it was would I have 
                        pursued an obstreperous 
                        argumentative dame like you for 
                        twenty years? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALT (CONT'D)
                        I could have made another twenty 
                        Mickey Mouse movies in that time-- 
                        and saved myself an ulcer!
                             (beat)
                        You expected me to disappoint you  
                        and so you made sure I did. I think 
                        life disappoints you, Mrs Travers.  
                        I think it’s done that a lot. Maybe 
                        Mary Poppins is the only person in 
                        your life who hasn’t.

                                 PAMELA
                        Mary Poppins isn’t real.

                                 WALT
                        Oh, now, that’s not true. She’s 
                        real as can be to my daughter Diane 
                        and to thousands upon thousands of 
                        other children-- adults too. She’s 
                        been there as a nighttime comfort 
                        to so many.

                                 PAMELA
                        Well, Where is she when I need her? 
                        Hm? I open the door to Mary Poppins 
                        and who should be standing there 
                        but Walt Disney!

           He laughs.

                                 WALT
                        I am so sorry Mrs Travers. I wanted 
                        so much for this to be a magical 
                        experience for you, all of us. But 
                        I let you down-- and in doing so, 
                        I’ve broken a twenty year old 
                        promise to my daughter.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve been wracking my brains, 
                        trying to figure out what’s been 
                        making this all so hard for you and 
                        I--
                             (beat)
                        I have my own Mr Banks. Mine had a 
                        moustache.

                                 PAMELA
                        Ah! Not true then that Disney 
                        created man in his own image?

                                 WALT

                        It’s cold there in the winters. 
                        Bitter.

                        My father, Elias, he owned the 
                        newspaper delivery route in our 
                        town. Thousand papers. Twice daily. 
                        Morning and evening edition.

           Walt’s normal enthusiasm has completely disappeared. He’s 
           suddenly as ragged and as weary as Pamela.

                        Elias, he was a shrewd businessman. 
                        A save-a-penny anywhere you can 
                        type of fella so he didn’t employ 
                        any delivery boys, he just used me 
                        and my brother Roy. I was eight 
                        then-- eight. Like I said, those 
                        winters were harsh and old Elias 
                        didn’t believe in new shoes until 
                        the old ones were worn right 
                        through so--

                        Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow 
                        would be up to here--

                        You’d push through it like wading 
                        through treacle. And the cold and 
                        the wet would be seeping through 
                        the shoes and the skin would be raw 
                        and peeling from our faces-- and 
                        sometimes I’d find myself sunken in 
                        the snow, waking up, cuz I must’ve 
                        passed out for a moment-- I dunno. 
                        And by the time we got home it’d be 
                        just getting dark, and every part 
                        of you would sting like crazy as it 
                        slowly came back to life in the 
                        warmth. My mother would feed us 
                        dinner and then it’d be time to go 
                        out again for the evening round.

           pour and turns to leave.

           the tarmac.

           She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes 
           again and she is airborne - the view is now one of blue sky 
           and white fluffy clouds. 

           She tucks her feet tidily together, folds her hands neatly 
           into her lap and looks straight ahead.

           INT. DISNEY OFFICE - DAY

           Walt gestures for Pamela to take seat, which she does.

                                 PAMELA
                        I’m here for my premiere. 

           Walt gulps.

                                 PAMELA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t receive my invitation, but 
                        I just assumed the American postal 
                        service had fallen down on the job 
                        as usual.

           She smiles sweetly.

                                 WALT
                        I’ll have a-- uh, replacement sent 
                        to your hotel right away.  

                                 PAMELA
                        That’s very kind, Mr Disney. I knew 
                        you wouldn’t have forgotten me.

                                 WALT
                        Pam, how could I?

                                 PAMELA
                        How indeed? You did, after all, 
                        assure me that I wouldn’t be 
                        disappointed.

           INT.  SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn’t even bother 
           hovering for a tip.  

           Pamela turns and it’s like deja vu - the flowers, the 
           chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere 
           of Walt Disney’s Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous 
           stuffed Mickey Mouse.

                                 PAMELA
                             (to Mickey)
                        I thought I left you in London.

           EXT. FOYER - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL -NIGHT

           Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise 
           silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her 
           shoulders.

                                 PAMELA
                             (to doorman)
                        Would you call me a taxi please?
                                 DOORMAN
                        Absolutely.

           The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo 
           pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn’t dare get her hopes up 
           but the door swings open and there he is, her favourite 
           person in America.

                                 RALPH
                        Had a feeling a certain friend of 
                        mine might be needing me tonight.

                                 PAMELA
                        Ralph!

           She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.

                                 RALPH
                        You look a million dollars!
                        Let’s get you to the ball.

           He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           It’s spectacular! Disney’s biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs 
           flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red 
           carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters 
           stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their 
           hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens 
           play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream 
           every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and 
           posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces 
           up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing 
           for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is 
           completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest 
           party you could ever go to.

           INT. LIMO - NIGHT

           Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers 
           press their faces against the windows trying to make out who 
           is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with 
           them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT

           The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out. 
           He rushes round to Pamela’s side and helps her from the car. 
           Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm 
           up to shield her eyes. It’s too much.
                                 RALPH
                             (in her ear)
                        This is your night. None of this 
                        would be possible without you.

           She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks 
           into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic 
           whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: “Who is 
           that?” “Is that anyone?” 

           Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and as he passes her he 
           speaks--

                                 MICKEY MOUSE
                        Hello, Mary Poppins.

           Behind her a huge toy train chugs to a halt on the blvd and 
           hundreds upon hundreds of coloured balloons fly out of its 
           roof and into the air.

           INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect 
           toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.

           INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of 
           Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the 
           same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin 
           to dim. The overture begins-- 

           We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade 
           and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers 
           old melody’s rings in her ears.

           We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain 
           with Pamela.

           She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing, 
           humming, sad, happy, joyous.

           Intercut with images from Pamela’s childhood and the voices 
           of Bert and Jane - 

           Ellie’s parrot head umbrella--

                                 BERT
                        You know, begging your pardon, but 
                        the one my heart goes out to is 
                        your father.

           The carousel horses at the Allora fair--
                                 BERT (CONT’D)
                        There he is in that cold, heartless 
                        bank day after day, hemmed in by 
                        mounds of cold, heartless money. 

           The tuppence and rolling pears--

                                 BERT (CONT’D)
                        I don't like to see any living 
                        thing caged up.

           Uncle Albert with the three children on his back, carrying 
           their river soaked mother back to the house--  

                                 JANE
                        Father in a cage?

           Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father’s hand--

                                 BERT
                        They makes cages in all sizes and 
                        shapes, you know. 

           The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--

                                 BERT (CONT’D)
                        Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets 
                        and all.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.  
           Rapt.

                                 MICHEAL
                        You won’t ever leave us will you?

                                 JANE
                        Whatever would we do without you?

                                 MARY POPPINS
                        I shall stay until the wind 
                        changes.

           And then an image from the film:

           George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined 
           London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.

           Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.

           Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her 
           shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud 
           but people are noticing, looking at her.  

           Prompted by a nod from Disney, Bob Sherman leans in and takes 
           her hand. She grips it tightly.
                                 BOB
                             (whispering)
                        Listen to them, listen, they love 
                        it!

           Pamela is unable to speak.

           Walt leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder.

                                 WALT
                        It’s all right, Mrs Travers. It’s 
                        alright. Mr Banks is going to be 
                        all right. I promise.

           Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It’s 
           as though it’s all pouring from her now, in one immense 
           catharsis.

                                 PAMELA
                        No, no. It’s just that-- I can’t, I 
                        can’t abide cartoons! 

           We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the 
           film: Let’s Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are 
           smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent 
           now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to 
           mouth along with the lyrics.

           And in her head one final image appears.

           Ginty and her father stand together in front of one of her 
           tiny parks. They grip each others hands and jump! 
           Disappearing into the park itself, like they were jumping 
           into a chalk painting.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. GARDEN - MARYBOROUGH - DAY

           The shadow of an umbrella leaves the seven-year-old Ginty 
           sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her 
           chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her 
           face. 

                                 TRAVERS
                             (singing)
                        Winds in the East 
                        Mist coming in--

           The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher--

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        --Like something is brewing, 
                        about to begin--

           And further and further--
                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        Can't put me finger on what lies in 
                        store--

           We give chase but cannot catch up--

                                 TRAVERS (CONT’D)
                        But I feel what's to happen, all 
                        happened before...

           And the umbrella floats up, up, up into the atmosphere and 
           away--

                                                              FADE OUT:

           END
