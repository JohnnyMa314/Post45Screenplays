           EXT. COLGATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

           Not a cloud in the sky on this beautiful fall day in New 
           England.  It’s the MID-NINETIES, so COLLEGE KIDS still looked 
           like college kids -- lots of flannel shirts and ripped jeans.  
           Everyone is out on the quad, not a care in the world.

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        What kind of pussy are you? 

           PULL BACK to reveal that we are not actually out on the quad, 
           but inside THE LIBRARY, looking out of a wall of windows.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        I’m serious.  

           The CAMERA finds JAY JOHNSON.  20 years-old.  A guy’s guy.  
           Good-looking but not in a gay way.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        That’s the girl I’m going to marry.

                                 ROBBIE
                        So, you’re that kind of pussy. 

           And there’s his best friend ROBBIE.  A beefy guy.  Looks like 
           he once played football but gave it up for beer.

                                 JAY
                        Look at her.  She’s amazing.

           REVERSE TO an UGLY GIRL at the reference desk.

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        She looks like a foot.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Not that one, you idiot.  Next to 
                        her.

           The CAMERA PANS to an ANDROGYNOUS GOTH STUDENT.

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        I don’t even think that’s a girl.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Behind the desk.  Jesus, you’re 
                        really ruining this for me.  This 
                        is a defining moment and you’re 
                        fucking it all up. 

           Behind the desk, the CAMERA finally finds ANNIE KEATS.
           19 years-old and beautiful, but in the most quiet way.  She 
           has no idea of her beauty and will disagree with you if you 
           tell her.  She wears cardigans.    

                                 ROBBIE
                        The librarian?

                                 JAY
                        She’s not a librarian.  She’s a 
                        student.  She works here.  Or maybe 
                        she just likes to read.

                                 ROBBIE 
                        Why?

                                 JAY
                        People do that.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You don’t.

                                 JAY
                        Just get out of here.  You’re 
                        sullying my moment.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Oooh...sullying.  Look who’s using 
                        big library words all of a sudden.

           Jay SHOVES Robbie.  Robbie shoves Jay.  Soon they are pushing 
           and swinging like idiots.  Robbie grabs Jay in a headlock. 
           VIOLENT SHUSHING from every direction.  Robbie SHUSHES back.  

           Annie looks up and sees Jay for the first time, his face 
           bright red from the headlock.  

           INT. COLGATE LIBRARY - DAY

           The next day.  Jay tries again.  This time without Robbie.  
           He goes to her desk.  Annie looks up.  She has tiny freckles.  
           So cute. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Can I help you?

           INT. FRENCH LITERATURE SECTION - LATER

           Annie leads Jay through the French Lit section.

                                 ANNIE
                        Do you know the name of the book?

                                 JAY
                        No.
                                 ANNIE
                        Is it for a class?  I may have the 
                        syllabus downstairs.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll know it when I see it...

           He randomly pulls out the unwieldy, History of the Girondists 
           by Alphonse de Lamartine.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Found it. 

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re reading that for pleasure?

                                 JAY
                        I love the Girondists.

                                 ANNIE
                        Do you love french?  Because that’s 
                        in French.

                                 JAY
                  (thrown, and then)
                        Tres bien.

                                 ANNIE
                        You don’t speak French, do you.

                                 JAY
                        No, but I can read it fluently. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Is it possible to actually read 
                        fluently?

                                 JAY
                        I’ll let you know.

           A big smile and he’s off.  Annie watches him go, skeptical 
           but intrigued.

           INT. COLGATE LIBRARY - DAY

           A few days later, History of the Girondists lands on Annie’s 
           desk.  She looks up.  There’s Jay with that big smile.

           INT. HISTORY SECTION - LATER

           Annie leads Jay through the stacks.  Jay trails behind, 
           trying not to stare at her ass.  

           ON Annie, wondering if he’s staring at her ass.  She turns.  
           He looks away.
                                 JAY
                        Ah.  Here it is...

           He pulls out the enormous, European Dynastic States 1494 - 
           1660 by Richard Bonney.

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you studying for a game show or 
                        something?

                                 JAY
                        I just like to read.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Do you really like to read or is 
                        this some kind of ploy.

                                 JAY
                        I’m trying to prove a theory.

           Annie looks at him.  They are clearly doing a little dance. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the science section?

           INT. SCIENCE SECTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Walking through the Science Section, Jay trails behind, 
           staring at her ass.  

           ON Annie, wondering if he’s looking at her ass.  She turns.  
           He looks away, quickly.  Busted.

                                 ANNIE
                        So, what’s your theory?

                                 JAY
                        That there’s no such thing as love 
                        at first sight.

                                 ANNIE
                        What does History of the Girondists 
                        have to do with love at first 
                        sight.

                                 JAY
                        Nothing.  My theory’s all fucked up 
                        now.

           There’s that smile again.  Annie’s cheeks flush.  And then 
           she recovers, crossing her arms.
                                 ANNIE
                        Let’s cut the bull-shit.  Are you 
                        really out to prove some stupid 
                        theory or are you just trying to 
                        get in my pants?

                                        CUT TO:

           INT. REMOTE STACKS AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Pushed up against the wall, they are kissing and groping, 
           and, within moments...he’s in her pants.

           INT. REMOTE STACKS AREA - NIGHT

           Another night.  Another area of the library.  They are 
           recklessly fucking.

           INT. REMOTE STACKS AREA - NIGHT

           More sex.  This time pushed up against a book shelf.  They 
           are almost caught by a JANITOR who pushes a broom close by.  
           They laugh as BOOKS FALL from above, blowing their cover.

           PUSH IN on the books falling...

                                     MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. JAY’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 

           BOOKS FALLING from Jay’s night-stand as the dorm room rocks 
           with Jay and Annie’s sexual olympics.  WIDEN TO REVEAL Jay 
           has several computers and a dry erase board filled with 
           computer codes.  The dry erase board falls over AS WE:   

           INT. JAY’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 

           One year later.  Two black graduation robes in a heap on the 
           floor, and Jay and Annie humping on the bed.

           JAY’S POV -- Annie above him.  Naked except for the 
           graduation cap.

                                 JAY
                        I fucking love you.

                                 ANNIE
                        I fucking love you, too.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A few years later.  Still having sex.  Annie sits up and we 
           see she is wearing a WEDDING VEIL.  They’re married now.  He 
           pulls her to him and they KISS.

                                     MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ...still KISSING.  A few years later now.  Annie sits up and 
           we see she has a big BABY BUMP.  Not that it matters, they’re 
           still going at it like the very first time.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a BABY MONITOR.  

           The little red dots go up and down as the baby CRIES.  The 
           monitor and the bedside table are RHYTHMICALLY SHAKING.  The 
           red dots reach the highest level.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Ignore it.  You’re almost there...  

           PULL BACK to reveal Annie and Jay close to climax.  Annie 
           closes her eyes in concentration.  The baby WAILS.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        He’s fine.  Just clearing his 
                        lungs...

           Jay tries to turn off the monitor but fumbles, turning it 
           LOUDER by accident...

                                 ANNIE
                        Fuck!

           Jay RIPS IT OUT OF THE WALL and THROWS IT OUT THE WINDOW.  We 
           hear RADIO FEEDBACK until it CRASHES onto the driveway.  

           The baby KEEPS CRYING.  Jay KEEPS THRUSTING.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        How can you ignore that?

                                 JAY
                  (totally serious)
                        Ignore what?

                                 ANNIE
                        He’s screaming, Jay.

                                 JAY
                        Who?
                                 ANNIE
                        Our baby.

           She pushes him off and EXITS to get the baby.

                                 JAY
                        He’s not screaming.  He’s crying.
                  (to himself, re hard-on)
                        I should be the one who’s crying.

           Annie returns with baby MAX, 6 MONTHS. 

                                 ANNIE
                        He threw up.  I think he should 
                        sleep with us. 

                                 JAY
                        So he throws up in our bed?  

           She puts the baby between them. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This is a bad idea.  He’s always 
                        going to want to sleep with us now.

                                 ANNIE
                        Just this one time.

                                 JAY
                        Bad idea.  Mark my words...

           Jay turns over, annoyed.  A beat later, Max’s FOOT KICKS HIM 
           UPSIDE THE HEAD.

                                    TIME DISSOLVE:

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

           That foot GROWS AND GROWS and is now a BOY’S SIZE 3.  Max is 
           8 years-old and sleeping perpendicular in the bed.  Next to 
           Max is his sister, FRANKIE, 5, asleep with a large WET SPOT 
           of PEE beneath her.  On the other side of the bed is Annie, 
           who’s looking at Jay with tired, blood-shot eyes.  

           Jay opens his mouth, but Annie puts her finger to her lips.  
           He grabs his phone and TEXTS her.  BUZZ.  She picks up her 
           phone. 

                                 JAY’S TEXT
                        Fuuuuuuuuuuck!

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay and Annie meet up in the bathroom.  They look exhausted.
                                 ANNIE
                        We should just give them our room.  

                                 JAY
                        Let’s give them the house.  Let’s 
                        get out of here.  We can still save 
                        ourselves.  I miss you.

           He grabs her.  Grabs her ass.  Starts kissing her neck.  
           Annie reciprocates by yawning.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay, they’re in the next room.  We 
                        can’t...

                                 JAY
                        They’re asleep.  

           SFX a BABY CRYING.  Jay sighs and hangs his head.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’ll do it later.  I promise.  
                        After drop-off, it’s on.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t want it on.  I want it off.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           All eyes on BABY LULU, 9 MONTHS, who is still crying.  She’s 
           in her highchair and ruining everyone’s breakfast.  Annie 
           tries to feed her, while simultaneously typing on her laptop.  

                                 MAX
                        If we record this sound and then 
                        amplify it, like, a million times, 
                        it could be a weapon of mass 
                        destruction.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m getting a migraine.

                                 JAY
                        How do you know what a migraine is?

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s what Mommy says.

                                 JAY
                  (to Annie)
                        Since when do you get migraines?

                                 ANNIE
                        Since I gave up coffee.
                                 JAY
                        Are you still doing that stupid 
                        blog challenge?

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s been almost three weeks.  It’s 
                        horrible.  

                                 MAX
                        Remember when Mom stopped eating 
                        sugar?  That was the worst.

                                 ANNIE
                        No.  This is worse.  My head is 
                        pounding and I hear this endless 
                        wailing.  Oh, wait, that’s Lulu...

           She lifts Lulu out of the highchair and puts her in the 
           Fisher-Price JUMPEROO (a bouncing baby swing that clips to 
           the door frame.)  Lulu instantly quiets and starts jumping 
           happily.  Everyone sighs.

                                 ALL
                        Ahhhhhh....

           Jay and Annie high-five.

                                 JAY
                        Well played.

           INT. MINIVAN - DAY

           Jay drives the minivan with Max and Frankie in the back.  
           They are stuck in the never-ending CARPOOL LANE. 

                                 JAY
                        Wow.  This sucks, kids.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You’re not allowed to say “sucks.”  
                        Mommy doesn’t say “sucks.”

                                 JAY
                        Mommy doesn’t do carpool anymore.  
                        This suuuuuuuuuuucks!

           He lays on the HORN.  The mom in front shakes her fist.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!  It was an accident!
                  (then, to kids)
                        Wasn’t an accident.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Why doesn’t Mommy do carpool 
                        anymore?
                                 JAY
                        Well...Mommy has an important 
                        business now.  

                                 MAX
                        You have important business, too, 
                        right, Dad?

                                 JAY
                        Of course I do.  Who’s helping you 
                        make the best, most awesome Family 
                        Day presentation?

                                 MAX
                        You.

                                 JAY
                        And who helps Frankie with all 
                        those crazy hip-hop moves for dance 
                        class.  Like this one...

           He does a hip-hop head and shoulder move.  The kids laugh.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Dad, that sucks.

           INT. ANNIE’S HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Annie is at the computer doing her daily post with one hand 
           and feeding Lulu a bottle with the other.  

           PUSH IN on the GO ASK YOUR MOTHER! homepage.  Three years 
           ago, Annie had a little idea for a parenting question and 
           answer search engine.  Today, that little idea has 2.4 
           million subscribers.  She types her daily post, MOTHER F’ER. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Daily recalls are 2011 Little Tykes 
                        tricycles, Gerber Stage 2 Apples, 
                        and, quite possibly, yours truly.  
                        Day 16 without coffee.  Feel like 
                        ass.  Why are we doing this again?  

           She pushes SEND.  As soon as she does, the LIGHTS FLICKER.  A 
           beat and then another FLICKER.  Annie looks up, annoyed. 

           EXT. JAY AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - AFTER DROP OFF

           Jay runs up the steps to the house two at a time.  He’s 
           already unbuttoning his shirt...
           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           He hurries down the hallway just as Annie is closing the door 
           to Lulu’s room.  She puts her finger to her lips.

                                 JAY
                        Give me that finger...

           Caveman style, Jay picks her up and runs her down the hall.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sex!  Finally!  Kind of...  

           Annie looks distracted.  Jay finally stops.  Big sigh. 

                                 JAY
                        Grocery list?

                                 ANNIE
                        No.

                                 JAY
                        Invite list for Frankie’s birthday?

                                 ANNIE
                        No.  I’m all yours.  Come on...

           She pulls him back to her.  They get back into it for a beat  
           but Jay senses Annie’s distraction.

                                 JAY
                        What?!  

                                 ANNIE
                        We’ll talk about it later.  Just 
                        say “fuse” so I remember.

                                 JAY
                        This better not be about the fuse 
                        box.  I told you a hundred times 
                        I’m going to fix it.

                                 ANNIE
                        I know, baby.  Of course you will.  
                        When?

                                 JAY
                        When we’re not having sex for the 
                        first time in six months!

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           They are at the kitchen table.  Silence.
                                 ANNIE
                        I’m sorry.  It popped into my head.  
                        I didn’t want to forget it.  If I 
                        forget it, then we don’t address it 
                        and then the servers go down again--

                                 JAY
                        You know what I’m thinking about 
                        when we’re having sex?  Sex!

                                 ANNIE
                        Me, too, honey--

                                 JAY
                        Really?  The last time we did it, 
                        you yelled out “Pirate’s Booty,” 
                        and it wasn’t a roll-playing thing.  

                                 ANNIE
                        I was “Snack Mom” that day.

                                 JAY
                        All I’m asking for is five minutes.  
                        Two, if you can actually pretend to 
                        be into it.
                  (then, serious)
                        I don’t know what’s happening to 
                        us.

           He looks her in the eyes.  It’s a real moment of truth.  More 
           real than he even intended.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Remember how we used to be?  If we 
                        weren’t having sex we were talking 
                        about sex, or thinking about sex, 
                        or going over the sex we’d had the 
                        night before.  Remember how we’d 
                        have a “highlights” session the 
                        next day?

                                 ANNIE
                        But we didn’t have three kids and--

                                 JAY
                        Do you remember “highlights”?

                                 ANNIE
                        Of course I remember “highlights.”  
                        I remember everything.

                                 JAY
                        What was the first book I checked 
                        out? 

           Annie climbs onto his lap, straddling him.
                                 ANNIE
                        History of the Girondists, which 
                        you pretended to read fluently.

                                 JAY
                        I pretended to read that for you.

                                 ANNIE
                        I could never forget that.  How 
                        could you not know that?  You’re 
                        everything to me.  

           All Jay knows is she’s straddling him right now so this looks 
           kind of promising.  He kisses her neck.  Tries to get things 
           going again.  Until...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                         You’re my...air.

           Jay stops kissing her.  Huh?

                                 ROBBIE (PRELAP)
                        Air?  What the fuck does that mean?

                                       SMASH TO:

           INT. MY GYM - DAY

           Jay and his college buddy, Robbie, sit in the ball pit with 
           Lulu and his daughter SARAH, 2. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Maybe she said “hair.”  

                                 JAY
                        She didn’t say hair, dumb-shit.  
                        She said, air.  Air is so boring.  
                        I used to be her fire. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        You can’t fuck air.

                                 JAY
                        She can’t ever let go.  She’s 
                        always making lists.  Or thinking 
                        about the kids.  Or she’s too 
                        tired.  Or she feels fat.
                  (then)
                        Maybe this is just who we are now.
                        We’re just boring married people 
                        who don’t have sex.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Come on.  Let’s have a little talk.
           Robbie stands.  Because of his size, all of the balls are 
           displaced, sending a few babies under the surface.  NANNIES 
           dive under to find them.  Robbie and Jay wade to the side of 
           the ball pit.

                                 ROBBIE (CONT'D)
                        Here’s the problem with marriage.  
                        When a couple first hooks up the 
                        man is the man and the woman is the 
                        woman.  The man’s in charge and 
                        calls all the shots and the woman 
                        is soft and sweet and waits by the 
                        phone.  Everyone’s turned on and 
                        has tons of sex.  But, once you get 
                        married and have kids, something 
                        happens.  The woman becomes the man 
                        and the man becomes the woman.
                        She’s now in charge and calls all 
                        the shots and he’s soft and waits 
                        by the phone.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ROBBIE
                        She’s in charge of everything -- 
                        the kids, the house, the food, the 
                        schedule...what’s the man in charge 
                        of?

                                 JAY
                  (donning on him)
                        Nothing.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Exactly.  He just sits by the 
                        phone, waiting to be told what to 
                        do.  That’s why no one’s getting 
                        laid.  It’s not hot.  The man’s not 
                        a man.  And everyone knows a woman 
                        wants a man.

           Jay lets this sink in.  Robbie puts his hand on Jay’s 
           shoulder in solidarity.

                                 JAY
                        What are you doing?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I don’t know.  Is it helping?

           ANGLE ON a group of LATINA NANNIES looking at them.

                                 JAY
                        They already think we’re gay.  Get 
                        the fuck off me.
           EXT. MY GYM - LATER

           They push their strollers through the parking lot. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Are you still coming to the office 
                        tomorrow?  The network is all 
                        fucked up.  It’s a man sized job.  

           Jay OPENS the automatic door of his minivan.  The back window 
           has a “family sticker” with each family member waving.  

                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        This is not a man-van.  If a man 
                        has a van, it should have a 
                        mattress in the back.  

                                 JAY
                        I have to go.  I have an 
                        appointment.

                                 ROBBIE
                        What kind of appointment?  I hope 
                        it’s manly.  Like kick-boxing or 
                        axe-throwing...

           INT. MUSIC TOGETHER - DAY

           Baby music class.

                                 MUSIC TEACHER
                  (singing)
                        Hello everybody, so glad to see 
                        you.  Hello, everybody, we’re so 
                        glad to see you... 

           Jay’s face turns red with anger as he sits in a circle of 
           BABIES, MOMMIES and a HIPPIE-DIPPIE TEACHER.

           Jay’s phone rings.  He picks it up with an angry whisper.

                                 JAY
                        Are you calling to make sure I’m 
                        following the schedule?

           INT. ANNIE’S OFFICE - SAME

           The LIGHTS FLICKER, while Annie’s on the phone.

                                 ANNIE
                        No.  I was calling to see when you 
                        were going to fix the fuse box.
                                 JAY (O.S.)
                  (exasperated)
                        Fuck the fucking fuse box!

           INT. MUSIC CLASS - DAY

           The music stops.  A baby starts to CRY.  Jay hangs up.  A 
           beat and then he lamely starts to sing.

                                 JAY
                        Hello, everybody...

           INT. ANNIE’S OFFICE - SAME

           Annie hangs up the phone as her mother, LINDA, 60s, nicely 
           dressed and coiffed, ENTERS through the back door.

                                 LINDA
                        There’s record breaking traffic on 
                        the site this morning.  I just got 
                        the call.  Fisher-Price wants to 
                        set up a meeting with you.

           The lights FLICKER.  They both look up.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Please let me call my handyman.  
                        He’s at my house right now.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay said he’d do it.

           Another FLICKER.  They both look up again.

                                 LINDA
                        This is not a good day for the 
                        servers to go down.  Did you hear 
                        what I said?  Fisher-Price wants to 
                        talk.

           Annie did not hear what Linda said.  She looks dazed.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t know.  Something’s off 
                        between me and Jay.

                                 LINDA
                        You know what it might be?  Your 
                        hair.  

                                 ANNIE
                        What?
                                 LINDA
                        You know what that little half- 
                        ponytail, half-bun says to a man?  
                        It says, I’ve got nothing left.  I 
                        don’t even have the strength to 
                        pull the ponytail through, so I’m 
                        going to let it flop on my head 
                        like a flaccid penis.

                                 ANNIE
                        Wow.  I had no idea my hair was 
                        bothering you so much.

                                 LINDA
                        Doesn’t bother me.  I’m your 
                        mother.  Nothing you do bothers me.
                        Except the yoga pants.  You don’t 
                        even do yoga.  Put on some pants 
                        with a non-elastic waist and join 
                        the rest of us.

                                 ANNIE
                        I used to do yoga.  Back when I had 
                        two seconds to myself.

           Annie goes to the mirror and looks at her reflection.  Sighs. 

                                 LINDA
                        Honey.  I know how hard it is.  But 
                        you still have to try.  I always 
                        dressed up for your father -- got 
                        my hair done, did my Kegels.  It’s 
                        important.  Do you do your Kegels?

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ve pushed three kids out of my 
                        vagina.  I can’t Kegel.

                                 LINDA
                        If you don’t keep your man happy, 
                        someone else will.  Until your 
                        father’s dying day, if he wanted 
                        the Bermuda Triangle, I let him 
                        land his plane.  And guess what, he 
                        died with a huge smile on his face, 
                        which is not easy for a man who had 
                        multiple strokes and lost the use 
                        of his lips.

           Annie pulls her hair out of the ponytail loop and tries to 
           make it look better.  It doesn’t.      

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re right.  I need to make more 
                        of an effort.  This is bad.
                                 LINDA
                        Do it tonight.  Take him by 
                        surprise.  Do you want to know a 
                        surprise your father liked?  He 
                        liked when I took my pinky and--

           SFX the sound of a HAIR-DRYER.

                        And I will, if I feel like it.  Not 
                        because she told me to but because 
                        I like pizza.

           Jay finishes a beer in one long swig.  He closes his eyes and

                        got for me, stud?

                        Uh...two pizzas?  One with light 
                        sauce and no garlic because the 
                        baby is allergic?  Where is the

                        Mama wants some pepperoni.

           Jay drops the pizzas.  Annie kisses him.  Soon, they move to

                                 ANNIE
                        God, I wish.  I’m sorry about how 
                        things have been.  I’ve just been 
                        so wiped out.

                                 JAY
                        You don’t have to be sorry.

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t want to be that person.  
                        And I don’t want you to be married 
                        to that person.  That’s not me.  I 
                        used to be fun, remember?
                  (then)
                        I looked up “mother” in the 
                        dictionary, and you know what’s the 
                        word right before it?  Moth-eaten.  
                        How ironic is that?

                                 JAY
                        What’s before father?

                                 ANNIE
                        Fat, I think.  It’s not quite as 
                        poetic.
                  (then, standing)
                        Come on.  I have a surprise.

                        You made brownies?   

                                 ANNIE
                        I defrosted them.  They were my 
                        dad’s.

                                 JAY
                        Your dad’s been dead for two years.

                                 ANNIE
                        These were his “magic” glaucoma, 
                        brownies, if you know what I mean. 

           Jay gets it.  A beat.  Then...
                                 JAY
                        I have to admit, I’m a little 
                        freaked out.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Me, too.  But my mom said they’re 
                        outrageous and she thinks I need 
                        help relaxing, so I can “orgasm.”  
                        Her words, not mine.
                  (then)
                        Look what she gave me.

           Annie holds up a worn copy of THE JOY OF SEX (the seminal 
           illustrated sex manual by Alex Comfort, published in 1972).

                                 JAY
                        This is getting weirder by the 
                        second.
                  (flips through the book)
                        Holy 70s.  They’re even hairier 
                        than I remember.

           Annie takes a big bite of a brownie.  Jay is surprised.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Just like that?

                                 ANNIE
                        Come on, let’s do something crazy.

           She gives him the other half.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Now come here and kiss me.

           He does.  And we:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Lying together on the couch, staring into space and laughing.  

                                 JAY
                        Do you feel anything yet?

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t know.  Maybe like a little 
                        tickling on my ass.

                                 JAY
                        That’s my hand.

                                 ANNIE
                  (giggling)
                        It is?

           They look down at Jay’s hands which are folded in his lap.
                                 JAY
                        Wait.  My hands are here.
                  (giggling)
                        I can’t feel my hands.

                                 ANNIE
                        I have another surprise for you.

           EXT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay waits on the couch, while Annie changes in the bathroom.

                                 JAY
                        Hurry up!  I’m dying.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        I’m embarrassed. 

                                 JAY
                        Come on.  It’s me.  I watched you 
                        give birth.  Wait, erase that.  
                        That is not what I want in my head 
                        right now...

           He closes his eyes and shakes his head.  While his eyes are 
           closed, Annie comes out from the powder room.  She looks 
           amazing.  Jay opens his eyes.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.  You are smoking hot.

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re hallucinating.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, but you have no idea how good 
                        you look.  I have to show you...

           Jay grabs the VIDEO CAMERA off the tripod and turns it on.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Honey, no.

           VIDEO CAMERA POV -- Annie holds up her hands.  

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop that.  I’m serious

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Do a little pose.  Just so you can 
                        see how caliente you are.

           Annie LOOKS RIGHT AT US.  She blows a kiss.  And then feeling 
           a little bold, strikes a sexy pose.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They look at the footage on the small video camera screen.  

                                 JAY
                        See?  You’re amazing!

                                 ANNIE
                        I can’t see anything.  It’s too 
                        small.   

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           FOLLOWING the wire from the video camera to the 50” PLASMA.  
           ON the screen, there’s Annie in HD doing a STRIPTEASE.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Hey, I don’t look that bad.

           REVERSE TO Annie and Jay watching from the couch. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m actually kind of hot.  Wait, am 
                        I hot or just high...

                                 JAY
                        Both.  But way more hot.

                                 ANNIE
                        Let’s do more.  I like this. 

           He runs to the video camera and yanks the cord from the TV.  
           The PLASMA SCREEN GOES BLUE.

           VIDEO CAMERA POV -- Annie looks at us.  And then...  

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Can you videotape me and have it on 
                        the tv, so I can watch it while you 
                        watch me?

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Honey, I’m tripping my balls off 
                        and I’m about to explode, it’s a 
                        miracle I can even hold the camera.
                        Show me your ass.

           She turns around, bends over and does a rump-shaker move.

                                 JAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Holy mother of Christ.  You know 
                        how to do that?

                                 ANNIE
                        You like it, baby?  You like that 
                        ass? 
                                 JAY  (O.S.)
                        Oh, yeah.  I’m going to wear that 
                        ass as a hat.

                                 ANNIE 
                        What?

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        I don’t know what I’m saying.  I 
                        can’t feel my tongue.

           And then they both just start laughing.  And they can’t stop.  
           It’s the best kind of laughter...

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           They are naked in the kitchen and cracking up as they feed 
           each other another magic brownie.  Tears actually rolling 
           down their faces, they’re laughing so hard.  They are now in 
           the trippiest part of the trip.

           So what better time to look at The Joy of Sex.  With every 
           turn of the page, they laugh even harder.

                                 ANNIE
                        Now that is a beaver.

                                 JAY
                        Did you just say, “beaver?”

                                 ANNIE
                        You don’t think that thing could 
                        eat trees...

           All of a sudden, the HAIRY, PENCIL-DRAWN 1970s COUPLE 
           actually BECOMES ANIMATED on the page and start HUMPING.  
           They look at each other and just start laughing again.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        That beaver is hungry.  
                  (then)
                        My mouth is so dry.

                                 JAY
                        Let me kiss it.

           He kisses her, long and deep.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  My mouth is too dry.

                                 ANNIE
                        We need water. 

           Annie gets water and then turns back around.  She stops.  And 
           gasps.
           Annie’s POV -- JAY HAS MORPHED INTO THE PENCIL-SKETCH, JOY OF 
           SEX GUY, COMPLETE WITH 70’s LONG HAIR AND A BURT REYNOLDS 
           MUSTACHE.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Jay?  Is that you?
                  (cracking up)
                        Are you him?

           And now Jay looks at Annie.

           Jay’s POV -- ANNIE IS NOW THE JOY OF SEX GIRL, COMPLETE WITH 
           SHAG HAIRCUT, HAIRY UNDERARMS AND 70S, OLD-SCHOOL, VINTAGE 
           JUNGLE BUSH.

                                 JAY
                        Wow.  You look really groovy.

                                 ANNIE
                        I love your mustache.
                  (looks down)
                        And your uncircumcised penis.

                                 JAY
                  (looks down)
                        Whoa.  What is that?  Go get the 
                        video camera.  This is crazy...

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           CLOSE ON the plate of brownies.  There are now only crumbs 
           left.  They are officially high as the sky.

           BEGIN PSYCHEDELIC ANIMATED JOY OF SEX SEQUENCE 

           ANIMATED ANNIE and JAY go page by page and try out every 
           sexual position in the book.  We go chapter by chapter and 
           witness QUICK CUTS of the:

           Matrimonial (Jay on top)

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, yeah...

           The Upper Hands (Annie on top)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s right...

           Frontal (Jay on top, Annie with legs around him)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        G-spot...

           Inversion (Annie hanging off the bed, upside down)
                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Head rush...

           X-Position (like scissors)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Awkward...

           Flanquette (X-position turned sideways)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Confusing...

           Croupade (doggie-style)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Woof-woof...

           Cuissade (sideways doggie-style)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Like it.

           Kneeling Position (kneeling)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t like it.

           Seated Position  (Jay Indian-style, Annie on top.)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Too 70’s

           The Viennese Oyster (Annie with legs behind her ears)

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        This can’t be right.

           They close the book.  And then we find animated Annie and Jay 
           lying naked on the bed in each other’s arms.  They are 
           exhausted and exhilarated.  Happy to have found the people 
           they used to be.  Animated Jay turns to animated Annie.

                                 JAY
                        I fucking love you.

                                 ANNIE
                        I fucking love you, too.

           And then they fall asleep in the middle of a kiss.  It’s a 
           beautiful moment between a husband and a wife who truly still 
           love each other.

           SLOWLY PULL BACK and we realize we’ve been watching this 
           through the VIEWFINDER of the VIDEO CAMERA, which is on the 
           tripod positioned at the foot of the bed. 
           A BLINKING LOW BATTERY WARNING.  And then...

                                    FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           It’s morning.  Annie and Jay have not moved a muscle.  They 
           are sound asleep, still in the middle of last night’s kiss.

           SLOWLY PUSH IN.  Annie opens her eyes first.  And then Jay.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Hi.

                                 JAY
                        Hi.  What time is it?

                                 ANNIE
                        Who cares.

                                 JAY
                        There are no kids in our bed.  

                                 ANNIE
                        I know.  Best night ever.

                                 JAY
                        Best night ever.

           They lie in each other’s arms.  Just smiling.  And smiling.  
           Reliving the crazy night in their minds.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do “highlights.”

                                 ANNIE
                        Okay.

                                 JAY
                        You go first.

           As Annie is thinking, her face changes.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay...

                                 JAY
                        Yeah.

           Her eyes widen.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay!

                                 JAY
                        What?
           REVERSE TO the TRIPOD.  The video camera is GONE.

                                 ANNIE/JAY
                        WHERE’S THE FUCKING CAMERA?!

           WHIP PAN back to Jay and Annie.  They jump out of the bed and 
           grab whatever clothes they can find.

           INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           RUNNING naked down the stairs, dressing as they go.  Jay 
           pulls on his COLGATE T-SHIRT and Annie pulls on hers.

                                 ANNIE
                        Holy shit!

           But Jay can’t see.  He’s stuck in the shirt.  Because it’s 
           Annie’s shirt.

                                 JAY
                  (inside the shirt)
                        What?

                                 ANNIE
                        Our house!  

                                 JAY
                  (inside the shirt)
                        What happened to our house?

           REVERSE TO the living room.  There’s plaster and debris 
           everywhere.  It looks like a train went through it.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                  (still stuck in the shirt)
                        Get this fucking shirt off of me!

           As Annie tries to pull it off, a HISPANIC WOMAN APPEARS, 
           surprising Annie.  It’s HILDA, her mother’s housekeeper.  

                                 HILDA
                        Hello, Mrs. Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hilda?  What are you doing here?

                                 JAY
                  (in the shirt)
                        Hilda? 

           Jay tries to cover his naked groin but since his arms are 
           stuck in the shirt, he loses his balance and falls over.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Ahhhhh! 
           He curls into a ball to cover his balls, exposing his BARE 
           ASS.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jesus Christ, Jay.

           Annie yanks the shirt off and he goes running, BUTT-NAKED 
           back up the stairs.  Annie turns, just as another HISPANIC 
           WOMAN APPEARS, holding a cleaning bucket.  This is MARINA. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?!

                                 HILDA
                        This is my sister, Marina. 

           Marina gives the bucket to Annie.  Inside is The Joy Of Sex, 
           a black g-string, an empty tube of KY Jelly and an egg 
           beater.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, my God!

           Jay, now dressed, runs down the stairs.  Big smile.

                                 JAY
                        Hello.

           Annie hands him the bucket.  He looks in it, SCREAMS and then 
           RUNS BACK UPSTAIRS.  

                                 ANNIE
                        This isn’t what it looks like.  Not 
                        at all.  That said, did you happen 
                        to see a video camera?

           Jay RUNS BACK DOWN THE STAIRS. 

                                 JAY
                        Do they have the--

                                 HILDA/MARINA
                        Video camera.  No.  We no see...

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh.  Well, if you do find it, we 
                        need it back.  Not that there’s 
                        anything weird on it, or morally 
                        questionable, or illegal in some 
                        states...just some good old 
                        fashioned family movies that we 
                        need back.  Why are you here, 
                        anyway?

                                 HILDA
                        Your mother call us this morning 
                        and sent us here to help.
           Just then, more sisters appear -- MARTA and LEISA round the 
           corner with SHOPPING BAGS FULL OF DEBRIS.

                                 ANNIE
                        What is that?

                                 HILDA
                        That was your kitchen, Mrs. Annie.

           ON Annie’s and Jay’s face we:

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Jay and Annie stand where the kitchen wall used to be.  It’s 
           gone.  Totally demolished. 

                                 ANNIE
                        What happened?

                                 JAY
                        Where’s our wall?

           Vladimir, 50s, Russian, large and slightly scary, rounds the 
           corner from the office. 

                                 VLADIMIR
                        Ah.  You must be Annie and Jay.  
                        Did you have nice sleep?

                                 ANNIE
                        Who are you?

                                 VLADIMIR
                        I’m Vladimir, the handyman.  Your 
                        mother sent me.
                  (then)
                        Good news.  I think I found it.  

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        The video camera?!

                                 VLADIMIR
                        No.  Why your wall fell down.

           He holds up the broken Fisher-Price Jumperoo.

                                 VLADIMIR (CONT’D)
                        This bouncy thing broke the door 
                        frame and that collapsed the wall.

                                 ANNIE
                        How did that happen?

                                     SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. KITCHEN - FLASHBACK

           VIDEO CAMERA POV -- A QUICK CUT MONTAGE of Jay and Annie 
           using the Jumperoo as a SEX SWING:

           Jay fucking Annie on the swing.

           Annie fucking Jay on the swing.

           Jay in the swing, but in the living room with the cord 
           stretched as far as possible, getting a BLOW-JOB until he 
           can’t take it anymore and RICOCHETS BACK into the kitchen.

           Both in the swing, far side of the kitchen and on top of the 
           highest cabinet.  They SLINGSHOT/BUNGEE JUMP.

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        Kowabunga!/Weeeeeeeeee!

           A BIG CRASH.  The VIDEO CAMERA DROPS as debris rains down.

           INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

           Vladimir looks at Annie and Jay.

                                 VLADIMIR
                        You must have a pretty fat baby.

                 ANNIE
                                     JAY
           Super fat.
                             Total lard ass.

                                 VLADIMIR (CONT’D)
                  (then, excited)
                        Is that what’s on your video 
                        camera?  You could win a lot of 
                        money on one of those home video 
                        shows.  A giant, fat baby breaks a 
                        swing?  Now that’s funny.

                                 ANNIE
                        Can you excuse us a minute?

           They go to EXIT.  Vladimir calls after them. 

                                 VLADIMIR
                        Hey, did you know you have big 
                        problem with your fuse box?!

                                 JAY 
                        I know!  I’m going to fix it.

           Annie stands behind him shaking her head.

                                 ANNIE
                  (mouthing to Vladimir)
                        He’s never going to fix it.
           Annie turns and we follow them down the hall to the office.

           INT. ANNIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           They stand face to face.  Annie looks a little tweaked.

                                 ANNIE
                        Where the hell is our sex-tape!

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.

                                 ANNIE
                        I need some f-ing coffee.

                                 JAY
                        Really?  You seem very amped up.  
                        Just stay strong...

                                 ANNIE
                        Do you think he took it?  He seems 
                        very suspicious.  And Russian.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll go shake him down.

                                 ANNIE
                        Shake him down?  Who are you?  

           OUTSIDE, a car starts.  Jay and Annie look at each other.

           EXT. JAY AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vladimir TAKES OFF in his pick-up truck as Annie and Jay run 
           out of the house.

                                 ANNIE
                        Where’s he going?!  

           ON Jay jumping into the MINIVAN.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 JAY
                        To get our sex tape back!

           ANGLE ON the “family stickers” on the back of the van, waving 
           goodbye as he PEELS OUT.

           Annie turns just as Marina races by with a SHOPPING BAG and 
           then jumps in her car.  Annie watches her go.  Huh?
           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As Annie walks down the hallway, Linda ENTERS through the 
           back door, holding baby LULU.

                                 LINDA
                        Well, well, look who’s finally up.
                        Those brownies really unleash the 
                        beast, don’t they?

                                 ANNIE
                        What was in those things?  Look at 
                        our house! 

                                 LINDA
                        How about a “thanks, Mom.”  Thanks 
                        for watching my kids.  Thanks for 
                        taking them to school.  Thanks for 
                        calling in your pit crew to clean 
                        up after my sexcapades.  Where is 
                        Hilda, by the way?  I need her to 
                        watch the baby so I can go to 
                        Pilates.

                                 ANNIE
                        They’re around here somewhere.

                                 LINDA
                        They?  She brought her sisters?  Be 
                        careful.  One of them is a total 
                        kleptomaniac.

           ON Annie’s face we:

           INT. ANNIE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie is in the car and in hot pursuit of Marina, while 
           talking on the phone to Jay.

                                 ANNIE
                  (into phone)
                        I don’t know where she’s going, but 
                        she’s a klepto and she’s on the 
                        move...
                  (then)
                        Of course I’m being careful.  Are 
                        you being careful?

           INT. MINIVAN - SAME

           Jay SWERVES THROUGH TRAFFIC, following Vladimir’s truck.

                                 JAY
                        No.  He drives like a Russian Spy.
                        Wait.  He’s pulling over.
           ON Vladimir as he DRIVES OVER A CURB and into a parking lot.  
           He parks in front of FLOYD’S PAWN SHOP and goes inside.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.  He’s going into a pawn 
                        shop.  I feel like I’m on COPS.  My 
                        heart is racing.  I’ll just have to 
                        go in there and bust up the hustle.

           INT. ANNIE’S CAR - SAME

           Annie makes a face.

                                 ANNIE
                        “Bust up the hustle?”  You don’t 
                        know how to “bust up a hustle.”  
                        You’re half Jewish.  Wait, Marina’s 
                        pulling over, too.

           ANGLE ON a small CATHOLIC CHURCH.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Holy Christ.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        What?!

                                 ANNIE
                        No.  That’s just the name of the 
                        church.  Okay.  Bye.

           INT. HOLY CHRIST CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina, with the paper bag beside her, kneels at the alter 
           and lights a CANDLE.  

           In the BACKGROUND, we see Annie, peeking out from behind a 
           JESUS STATUE.

           EXT. FLOYD’S PAWN SHOP - SAME

           Vladimir EXITS the pawn shop and takes off in his truck.  Jay 
           waits a moment and then ENTERS the shop.

           INT. HOLY CHRIST CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina ENTERS the CONFESSIONAL and closes the curtain. 

           ON Annie tiptoeing from the JESUS STATUE to a VIRGIN MARY 
           STATUE. 

           A BEAT later, Marina EXITS the confessional WITHOUT THE BAG.
                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                  (from behind the statue)
                        The priest has our sex-tape!

           INT. CONFESSIONAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie bangs on the sliding wooden door of the confessional.

                                 ANNIE
                        Open up, pervert.

           The door slides open.  We see a pair of ELDERLY EYES.

                                 PRIEST
                        I’m sorry, my child.  I’m closed.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, I’ll bet you’re closed.  I’ll 
                        bet you’re going to run right over 
                        to your rectory and rub one out.

                                 PRIEST
                        Excuse me?

                                 ANNIE
                        That lady gave you something.  It’s 
                        mine and I want it back.  Don’t 
                        mess with me.  In one tweet I can 
                        have 2.4 million moms on your ass.  
                        Yeah, I said 2.4.  Pretty good for 
                        a start-up.
                  (then, menacing)
                        Don’t mess with the moms.

           With trembling hands, the priest pushes the bag through the 
           little door.  Annie opens it.  Inside is a SANDWICH and some 
           CARROT STICKS.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        What the f-word is this?

                                 PRIEST
                        My lunch.

           INT. FLOYD’S PAWN SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           FLOYD, the pawnbroker, wears a purple suit and lots of gold 
           teeth.  He is behind a BULLET PROOF GLASS WALL and talking to 
           Jay through an intercom system.

                                 FLOYD
                        I’m sorry.  I can’t reveal a 
                        client’s business.  Pawn code. 
                                 JAY
                        I just want to know if that man 
                        sold you a video camera.

                                 FLOYD
                        Which man?

                                 JAY
                        Vladimir.  The giant Russian guy.
                  (off his blank look)
                        Three minutes ago, a guy came in 
                        here.  Did he or did he not sell 
                        you a video camera?

                                 FLOYD
                        What kind of video camera?

           Jay loses it.  He starts banging his head on the glass wall.

                                 JAY
                        Give it back!  My wife will never 
                        have sex with me again!  Please! 

                                 FLOYD
                        Oh, shit.  Okay, man.  Calm down...

                                 JAY
                        Thank you.

           Jay rests his head on the glass.  CLOSES HIS EYES.  When he 
           OPENS his eyes, there’s a box of FIFTY VIDEO CAMERAS.

                                 FLOYD
                        Take whatever you need, brother.

           INT. ANNIE’S CAR - LATER

           Annie is driving and talking excitedly on the phone. 

                                 ANNIE
                  (into phone)
                        You have the video camera?

           INT. MINIVAN - SAME

           Jay is driving with the video camera next to him.

                                 JAY
                  (into phone)
                        I have a video camera.  But it’s 
                        not our video camera.

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED.
                                 ANNIE
                        Why did you take a video camera, if 
                        it’s not our video camera.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.  He offered it, and I 
                        figured if we don’t find ours, 
                        we’ll need a new one.  Besides, 
                        Vladimir wasn’t selling.  He bought 
                        a diamond bracelet.  I have his 
                        address.  I’m going to go check it 
                        out.  What are you doing?

                                 ANNIE
                        Following Marina.  I don’t know 
                        why.  I’m sure this is a dead end.

           ANGLE ON Marina’s car, turning into an alleyway. 

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina EXITS her car and walks towards a back door.  Annie, 
           slumped down in her seat, watches from her car.

           EXT. VLADIMIR’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jay pulls into the parking lot of a run-down townhouse on the 
           wrong side of town.  Vladimir’s truck is parked in front.  

                                 JAY
                  (into phone)
                        I’m at his house. 

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Where is it?

                                 JAY
                        Exposition and 39th.

           INT. ANNIE’S CAR - SAME

           Annie sits up and looks around.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m at Exposition and 39th.

           SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN ANNIE AND JAY ON THE PHONE.  

                                 JAY
                        I don’t see you.

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m in the back alley.
                                 JAY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ANNIE
                        Marina just went into an apartment.

           A beat, then...

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        They’re in this together!

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay runs to the back alley and joins up with Annie.  They 
           grab each other, excited and full of adrenaline

                                 ANNIE
                        Should we call the police?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.  
                  (then, real)
                        I missed you.

                                 ANNIE
                        I missed you, too!

           They kiss.  It’s a real kiss, full of excitement.

           SFX the sounds of PEOPLE MOANING. 

           Jay and Annie look up at a window.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my God, Jay.  The tape.  Is 
                        that us?

                                 JAY
                        I think so.

           SFX the sounds of a WOMAN ON THE VERGE OF CLIMAX.

                                 ANNIE
                        No.  That’s not me.

                                 JAY
                        No one ever thinks they sound like 
                        themselves on tape.

           SFX a female orgasm.  Annie is horrified.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay!  Do something!

                                 JAY
                        See if you can see anything.
           He gives her a boost.  Annie peers into the window.

           INT. VLADIMIR’S APARTMENT - SAME

           CLOSE ON Annie as she looks through the window.  Her jaw 
           drops.

           PULL BACK to reveal the erotic sounds are not coming from a 
           sex-tape but from Vladimir and Marina actually HAVING SEX.  
           As Marina throws her arms around Vladimir, we see the new 
           DIAMOND BRACELET.

           INT. BACK ALLEY - SAME

           Annie jumps down, freaking out.

                                 ANNIE
                        It wasn’t us!  It was them!  It was 
                        disgusting.  It was--

           And them, something catches Annie’s attention OFF CAMERA. 

           ANGLE ON STARBUCKS across the street.  The bright green sign 
           glistens in the sun.

                                 JAY
                        Uh, oh.  Stay strong...

                                        CUT TO:

           EXT. EXPOSITION BLVD. - MOMENTS LATER

           HORNS HONK as Annie does a death-defying Frogger.  Zigzagging 
           across the wide and busy street. 

           INT. STARBUCKS - MOMENT LATER

           CLOSE ON A VENTI CUP.  SFX the sound of continuous GULPING.

           PULL BACK to reveal they are now inside Starbucks and Annie 
           is guzzling coffee.   

                                 JAY
                        Isn’t that burning your throat?

           She keeps gulping.  And then puts the empty cup down.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.

           And then she GUZZLES Jay’s coffee, too.  Her body shakes as 
           caffeine hits every extremity.  And then a calming moment.
                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay.  I’m back.  What’s the last 
                        thing you remember from last night?  

                                 JAY
                        The washing machine. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I remember the washing machine.  
                        The spin cycle was awesome. 

                                 JAY
                        The dryer got a little hot, though.  
                        I think I singed my balls.  

           Annie takes a napkin and starts to write.

                                 ANNIE
                        Okay -- washing machine, dryer.  
                        What else?

                                 JAY
                  (a beat, then sheepish)
                        Crib?  
                  (then)
                        We should throw out that mobile.  
                        It’s not right for the baby to 
                        watch it spin anymore.  Wait!  
                        Didn’t we go in Lulu’s closet?

           Annie’s eyes light up.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes!  We wanted to fall asleep 
                        under the glow-in-the-dark star 
                        stickers.  I’ll bet it’s there.  

           They both stand.  But then Jay remembers something.

                                 JAY
                        Shit.  I’m supposed to go to 
                        Robbie’s to fix their network.

                                 ANNIE
                        Can’t you cancel?

                                 JAY
                        I guess.  But it’s a good job.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t you dare tell him about this.

                                 JAY
                        I would never.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay.
                                 JAY
                        I promise I won’t tell him 
                        anything.

                                 ROBBIE (PRELAP)
                        Tell me EVERYTHING.

           INT. COLDWELL BANKER OFFICES - LATER

           ON ROBBIE, behind his desk at his real estate office.  

           There are several BROKER OF THE YEAR PLAQUES WITH PICTURES OF 
           ROBBIE on the wall behind him.  Each picture showcases the 
           exact same toothy-grin we see right now. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        A sex tape is a strong man move.

           He holds up his hand for a high-five.  Jay leaves him 
           hanging.

                                 JAY
                        I think someone stole it.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I hope you were good because that 
                        could be really embarrassing.

                                 JAY
                        You’re missing the point.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Am I?  You think Tommy Lee was 
                        upset when his tape got out?  Hell 
                        no.  He had a huge dick and was 
                        fucking Pam Anderson.  Can you 
                        drive a boat with your penis? 

                                 JAY
                        No.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Then you really need to find that 
                        tape.  Who do you think took it?

                                 JAY
                        There were a lot of workers at our 
                        house today.

                                 ROBBIE
                        This is serious, dude.

                                 JAY
                        Well, I’m not thrilled about it, 
                        but what’s the worst that could 
                        happen?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        So the handyman took it and maybe 
                        he shows it to his friend.  I’ll 
                        never see them again.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        You’re thinking analog, Grandpa.  
                        You have to think digital.  You 
                        don’t watch a lot of online porn, 
                        do you?

           Jay shakes his head.

                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        There’s no tapes anymore.  This 
                        will go right to the web.

                                 JAY
                        What are you saying?

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’m saying, we need to call in a 
                        professional. 

           ON Jay’s look we:

           INT. LULU’S CLOSET - LATER

           The glow-in-the-dark stars illuminate Lulu’s closet, but it 
           doesn’t matter.  The tape is not there.  Annie sighs.

                                 ANNIE
                        Where is this stupid thing?

           QUICK CUT MONTAGE of Annie looking everywhere:

           She looks in the CRIB.  On top of the WASHING MACHINE. Inside 
           the DRYER.  Under the COUCH.  

           Linda ENTERS as Annie is tearing through the couch cushions. 

                                 LINDA
                        What are you looking for?

                                 ANNIE
                        Um...my earring.  I lost it.  Do 
                        you think Marina took it?

                                 LINDA
                        Marina?  No, Marina’s not the 
                        kleptomaniac.  Marina’s the 
                        nymphomaniac
                  (then)
                        Doesn’t matter.  Putting on 
                        earrings won’t dress up those yoga 
                        pants.  You need to go get dressed.
                                 ANNIE
                        For what?

                                 LINDA
                        I just got a call from Fisher-
                        Price.  They want to do a 
                        conference call at the lawyer’s 
                        office.  Can you believe it?

           ON Annie’s face we:

           EXT. NORTHRIDGE NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME

           Mountains in the distance, smog in the air, a modest street 
           where the houses look the same...we must be in the valley.

           AERIAL SHOT of Jay’s minivan driving.  The family stickers on 
           the back window smile and wave at us.

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        Does driving this car make your 
                        vagina hurt?

           INT. MINIVAN

           Jay drives.  Robbie holds an MLS listing in his hand.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You need another car.  Just for 
                        yourself.  Just to maintain your 
                        manhood.

                                 JAY
                        Oh, okay, I’ll just tell Annie 
                        we’re getting a third car.  We can 
                        really afford that right now.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I’d lose my house before driving 
                        this thing. 
                  (then)
                        I think that’s it over there.

           ANGLE ON a ranch-style house covered in Bougainvillea.

                                 JAY
                        That can’t be right.
                                 ROBBIE
                  (re MLS listing)
                        Ranch style, three bedroom, four 
                        bath, 3200 square feet with hidden 
                        charm?  Asking price 1.3?
                  (re asking price)
                        Good luck.

           EXT. MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           They stand at the front door.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Don’t look so nervous, the guys in 
                        the valley office say he’s the 
                        best.

                                 JAY
                        How do they know about him?

                                 ROBBIE
                        We’re real estate brokers.  We know 
                        everyone’s shit.  Ring the bell.

                                 JAY
                        You ring the bell.

                                 ROBBIE
                        You ring it.  You’re the one who 
                        has a runaway sex tape.  

           Jay rings the bell.  They wait.  And wait.

                                 JAY
                        He’s not here.  Let’s go.

           From the backyard, we hear the sounds of a party.  Robbie 
           goes to investigate.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Robbie!

           Jay has no choice but to follow.  As he starts walking, his 
           PHONE RINGS.

           INT. LINDA’S CAR - SAME

           Linda and Annie are in Linda’s LEXUS.  

                                 ANNIE
                  (into phone)
                        Hey, babe.  What’s happening?
                  (then, whispering)
                        You didn’t tell Robbie, did you.
                                 JAY (O.S.)
                  (a beat)
                        Nope.  He’s not even here.  It’s 
                        just me.  Working away on the 
                        network.  All by myself...

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh.  Okay.  Well, wish me luck.  
                        We’re on our way to the conference 
                        call.  What’s that music?

           EXT. MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S BACKYARD - SAME

           As they approach the back, REVEAL that it’s a full-on kids’ 
           party with BOUNCY CASTLE and SLIP ‘N SLIDE.  Jay covers the 
           phone.

           DUSTY approaches.  Dusty is in her late 40s and hot.  Wearing 
           Daisy-Dukes and heels.  Huge breast-implants.  She envelopes 
           Robbie in a giant, busty bear-hug.

                                 DUSTY
                  (southern accent)
                        Welcome, darlins!

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Who’s that?

                                 JAY
                  (into phone)
                        That’s...Robbie’s assistant.

                                 ROBBIE
                  (from inside the boobs)
                        I wish.

           And now Dusty hugs Jay, losing him in her gigantic breasts.

                                 JAY
                  (muffled)
                        I gotta go, babe.  Bye.

           He hangs up.

                                 DUSTY
                        You must be looking for my husband.  
                        He’s around here somewhere.
                  (then)
                        There he goes.  

           There is a BLUR on the SLIP ’N SLIDE.  A MAN flies past at an 
           alarming speed.  He reaches the end and keeps sliding, 
           through grass and then onto the gravel driveway.  

                                 DUSTY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll go get the first aid kit.
           EXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dripping wet and covered in blood, we meet suburban dad, 
           MARVIN SEBASTIAN, late 40s.  HE’S SHIRTLESS BUT WEARING LONG, 
           TIGHT, SATIN PANTS.  

           A group of BOYS inspect his wounds as Jay and Robbie 
           approach.     

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN 
                        That was friggin’ awesome!  Did you 
                        see that?  Totally rad, right?

                                 ROBBIE
                        That was rad.  Are you Marvin 
                        Sebastian?  I’m Robbie, we spoke on 
                        the phone?  Regarding the...thing?

                                 JAY
                  (re kids)
                        Maybe we should talk another time.  
                        Looks like you’re having a party.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Damn right we’re having a party.  
                        You’re looking at the Division 3 
                        Pee Wee baseball runners-up.  Boo-
                        ya!

                                 BOYS
                        Boo ya!

           Marvin Sebastian holds up his fist to Jay for a bump.  His 
           fist is covered in blood and pieces of grass.

                                 JAY
                        We should go.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        What?  You haven’t even tried my 
                        tri-tip yet.

           EXT. GRILL AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON a plate being overloaded with tri-tip.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        You have to try my barbecue sauce.  
                        You know the secret?  Pineapple 
                        juice.  And not just any pineapple 
                        juice.  The thick kind that’s left 
                        over when you eat the chunks in the 
                        can.  You know how many cases of  
                        pineapple chunks I have to eat to 
                        get what I need?  Tons.  But you 
                        tell me it’s not worth it...
           Marvin Sebastian holds a piece of saucy tri-tip to Jay with 
           the tongs.  Jay reluctantly tastes it.  Robbie tastes it, 
           too.

                                 JAY
                        Very good.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        It’s tangy.  I like it tangy.  Do 
                        you like it tangy?

                                 ROBBIE
                        That tang bangs.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I like coming up with new things.  
                        I’m good like that.  You like my 
                        pants?

           Marvin Sebastian shows off his SILKEN PANTS.  Jay shrugs.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        “Lap-Dance Pants.”  Silky on the 
                        outside for maximum dry humpage...

           He gyrates his hips like a stripper doing a lap-dance.  

                                 JAY
                  (averting his eyes)
                        Oh.  Okay.  I see...

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        No.  You don’t see.  Because the 
                        secret is inside.

           Marvin unzips the pants to reveal A: he’s not wearing any 
           underwear and B: the pants are lined in a different material.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Waterproof.  Wicks away unexpected 
                        surprises.  Lap-Dance Pants.  Slick 
                        for her, dry for him.  What do you 
                        think?  I’m debuting them tomorrow 
                        at the Adult Entertainment 
                        Convention.  

                                 ROBBIE
                        I wish I had some now because I 
                        think I just came.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        That’s what I’m talking about.  
                        Come on, let’s go to my office.

           They high-five and start walking.  Jay stays behind.  What 
           the hell has he gotten himself into?
           EXT. MARVIN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marvin Sebastian’s office is actually a small, aluminum tool 
           shed.  The prefab kind from Home Depot.  He unlocks a series

           overloaded with tangy barbecue meat.

                        Open sesame...

           He smiles ominously and pushes the door open.

           INT. MARVIN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Inside.  Jay looks around.  This tool shed is decked out.  
           There’s a wall of VIDEO EQUIPMENT, SEVERAL DVD PLAYERS, TWO 
           LAPTOPS, A DESKTOP and bookshelves filled with VIDEO 
           CASSETTES, DVDS and BOOKS.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I’ll be honest with you.  I don’t 
                        really do this work anymore.  I’m 
                        just trying to focus on my Lap 
                        Dance Pants. 
                  (then)
                        But have a seat.  Let’s see what we 
                        can do.

           He gestures to folding lawn chairs next to a wall of 
           HEADSHOTS OF FAMOUS ACTORS.  They all have notes written on 
           them, like in a dry cleaners.

           CLOSE ON TOM CRUISE with the inscription, YOU DA MAN!

                                 JAY
                        You helped Tom Cruise?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Have I helped Tom Cruise.  Yes.  
                        I’ve helped Tom Cruise.  A lot.  
                  (then, re Lap-Dance Pants)
                        Big fan, by the way.

           ANGLE ON OPRAH WINFREY.  The inscription reads, M.S. -- 
           THANKS AGAIN (AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN...)  XOXO

                                 ROBBIE
                        Oprah?

                        Ooph.  A real dirty bird.  Don’t 
                        ever kiss her on the mouth.

           ANGLE ON BARBARA BUSH.

                        Don’t even ask.  Disgusting.

           Marvin Sebastian puts on his glasses and grabs a clipboard.

                        Let’s talk about you.  When did you 
                        make the tape?  When did you 
                        realize it was gone?  Were you at a 
                        sex party that got out of control?  
                        Do you owe any debts to the mob?

                                 JAY
                        What?  No.  It was just me and my 
                        wife.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        No swingers?  Hookers?  Drug 
                        dealers?  Pets?  This is a safe 
                        place.
                  (re Barbara Bush)
                        Just ask “The Fist.”

                                 JAY
                        It was just us.  We were trying to 
                        spice up our marriage.  Do 
                        something different.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Have you tried the doggie-door?

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ROBBIE
                        He’s talking about a poke in the 
                        brown eye.

                                 JAY
                        What does this have to do with my 
                        missing sex tape?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Nothing.  Just curious.  I’ve been 
                        married twenty years.  Whenever we 
                        get stale, Dusty gets bigger 
                        implants.  Doesn’t solve anything.  
                        We still have all the same 
                        problems, but now they’re attached 
                        to some giant cans.  Does your wife 
                        have breast implants?

                                 JAY
                        No.
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Good for her.  Keeping it old 
                        school.  I dig it. 
                  (then)
                        Okay, so your tape will probably 
                        end up on a site like this.

           Marvin Sebastian turns the MONITOR towards Jay and Robbie.  
           He is on a PORN SITE.  Jay FREAKS OUT.  

                                 JAY
                        Oh, my God.  My wife will die.  
                        She’ll die!  I’m gonna be a widow 
                        with three kids.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Bro, this is what I do.  If it ends 
                        up here, I’ll kill it in eight 
                        seconds.  But I need to know what 
                        I’m looking for.  There are 
                        thousands of videos uploaded every 
                        day.  So anything I can do to 
                        refine the search is helpful.  
                        Check this out.  If I enter...  
                  (starts typing)
                        “Real tits” which she has, and 
                        “amateur” which you are, look what 
                        happens...

           He presses ENTER and smiles.  Robbie smiles, too.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Wow.  You are good.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        We just cut the number of tapes we 
                        need to look at by almost four 
                        thousand.

                                 JAY
                        I am so dead...

           PUSH IN to the computer so close that the image of a GUY 
           DOING A GIRL DOGGIE-STYLE ceases to look like anything.  Just 
           a blur of pixilation.

                                     MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. ANNIE’S LAWYER’S OFFICE - SAME

           THE SAME PIXILATED BLUR.  PULL BACK to reveal a panel of men 
           in suits ON THE MONITOR.  It’s the FISHER PRICE GUYS.  

           We are at the video conference and MR. NELSON, the CEO OF 
           FISHER PRICE and a grandfatherly-type, is talking to Annie, 
           Linda and a group of LAWYERS at a conference table.
                                 MR. NELSON
                  (from the monitor)
                        I’m so happy to meet you both.  
                        You’re a family company, we’re a 
                        family company.  We have a lot in 
                        common.

           Annie looks a little distracted.

                                 MR. NELSON (CONT’D)
                        Annie?  Are you there?

           Linda kicks her under the table.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.  I’m here.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        Can you tell us how you started “Go 
                        Ask Your Mother.” 

           Annie takes a beat.  Linda shoots her a look like it’s now or 
           never...

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.  Of course.  It started very 
                        simply.  When I became a mom, I had 
                        a lot of questions.  I was always 
                        researching things in the library 
                        or on the internet--

                                 LINDA
                        Or she came to me, which is how we 
                        came up with the name of the site--

           Everyone laughs.  Annie starts to loosen up. 

                                 ANNIE
                        So I figured that if I had all 
                        these questions, other moms must 
                        have questions, too.  Maybe with my 
                        research skills, I could answer 
                        some.  In almost no time, it took 
                        on a life of its own.  Before I had 
                        time to answer a question, another 
                        mom posted the answer.  Within 
                        weeks, hundreds and then thousands 
                        of moms started asking and 
                        answering each other. 

                                 LAWYER
                        You’ll find the exact trafficking 
                        figures in your prospectuses, 
                        gentlemen.

           ON the Fisher Price guys picking up their prospectuses.
                                 ANNIE
                        Go Ask Your Mother now serves as a 
                        forum for moms and dads or anyone 
                        who has a question.  It’s different 
                        from a search engine like Google 
                        because it’s personal opinion.  But 
                        that matters to moms because what 
                        good is the top-rated booster seat 
                        if my kid won’t get in it because 
                        the strap pinches his penis.
                  (then)
                        True story, by the way.  But moms 
                        need to know that!  We’re a social 
                        network and we tell it like it is.  

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I can see why your website is such 
                        a success.  You bring a real 
                        passion to it.  If this works out 
                        the way I hope it will, things 
                        could really change for you.  Are 
                        you ready for that?

                                 ANNIE
                        In all honesty, we welcome your 
                        partnership, but I hope to not 
                        change the integrity of what we do.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I’m talking about the deal.  I read 
                        your blog.  I know times are tough.  
                        This could be life-changing money.  

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ve got everything I need.  Money 
                        won’t change my life.   
                  (then)
                        Well, that’s not true.  If we can 
                        afford to hire a baby-sitter once 
                        in a while so my husband and I can 
                        go out to dinner and have some time 
                        together...that actually would 
                        change my life.

           Linda beams at Annie.  Annie looks at her and smiles.  Under 
           the table they are excitedly HOLDING HANDS.

           INT. MARVIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           ON MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S HAND, covered in barbecue sauce, as it 
           clicks the mouse over and over.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        No.  No.  No.

           PULL BACK to reveal Jay, Robbie and Marvin Sebastian, faces 
           cast in a blue light from the computer.  
           We don’t see what they see, but watch their reactions as they 
           see each porn clip, looking for Jay and Annie.   

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        No.  No.  Ow, that looks painful.  
                        No.  No...
                  (then)
                        Oh, come on.  There’s no way that’s 
                        an amateur video.  Regular guys 
                        don’t shave their pubes.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I’m telling you, this is why I got 
                        out of the business.  It’s all 
                        fake.  This isn’t pornography.  
                        It’s fast food fluff.  You click on 
                        the video and you’re at the money 
                        shot.  There’s no build up, no 
                        tension, forget story...it’s just a 
                        quick fix.  Porn used to be 
                        beautiful, man.  Maybe not for 
                        everyone, fine, but it was an art 
                        form.  We made movies.  With 
                        scores.  And stories.  And now it’s 
                        this shit.  It makes me sick.  Look 
                        at all these different categories -- 
                        Black, Boozy, Busty, Bukaki.  We 
                        don’t need categories, we need some 
                        good old-fashioned fucking...

                                 JAY
                  (a beat, then)
                        What is Bukaki, anyway?  That’s 
                        what my kids say when they have to 
                        do number two.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Make them stop.

           Marvin Sebastian CLICKS on Bukaki.  Jay SCREAMS.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Out of the mouths of babes, that 
                        word should never come.
                  (then)
                        You want to smoke a doob?  I feel 
                        like smoking a doob.  I’m getting 
                        depressed.  

           Marvin Sebastian lights up a spliff, takes a long drag and 
           passes it to Robbie.  Robbie takes a toke and then passes it 
           to Jay, who hesitates.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Come on.  Don’t insult the man.

           Jay takes a big toke and then coughs up a lung.  He gives it 
           back to Marvin Sebastian who gets introspective.
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        It’s like the music business.  
                        Everyone’s a one hit wonder.  Where 
                        are the artists?  Where are the 
                        albums?  Where are the deep cuts?  
                        The B-sides?  A good porn movie was 
                        like an album.  You put it on and 
                        you played the whole thing through.  
                        You experienced it.  Let it wash 
                        over you.  Sure, after a while, 
                        you’d know your favorite spots and 
                        you’d jump right to them, but that 
                        was the fun of it.  You had to find 
                        them.  Memorize where they were...
                  (then)
                        You want to see some real porn?  I 
                        mean, like, to me, the most real 
                        stuff there is?

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hell, yeah.

                                 JAY
                        Uh...actually, that might be a 
                        little weird.  Three dudes, a dark 
                        tool shed...

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Now you’re gonna get bashful?  We 
                        just watched Bukaki together.

           Marvin Sebastian goes to the bookshelf and hunts for 
           something.  He pulls down THE JOY OF SEX.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever seen this book? 

           Jay, now a little stoned, just starts laughing.

                                 JAY
                        Uh-huh...

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (flips through)
                        This is a masterpiece.  Look at 
                        these drawings.  Now that’s how a 
                        lady should look.  Look at those 
                        breasts.  Small-ish tits, big 
                        areolas?  I’m okay with it because 
                        she’s okay with it.  That kind of 
                        confidence turns me on, dude.  And 
                        look at that bush.  Now that’s a 
                        motherfucking bush.  Am I right?  I 
                        could get into that...for days... 
                        and never come out.  I’ll be honest 
                        with you.  I’m not really a breast 
                        man.  Dusty can do whatever she 
                        wants to her tits.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                        But don’t you dare touch that bush.  
                        I want that thing robust.  I want 
                        that shit creeping down her leg.  I 
                        want a motherfucking bramble, bro.  
                        The bigger the bush, the better the 
                        push.  Keepin it real, dude!
                  (holds out his fist)
                        Real hairy.

           Jay bumps his fist.  He is now CRACKING UP. 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Why do you keep laughing?  You’re 
                        really harshing my buzz.

                                 JAY
                        I have this book.  We used it last 
                        night.  We did every position.  
                        That’s what’s on our sex-tape.

                                 MARVIN
                        Bingo, brother!  You just refined 
                        the search.  This is going to do 
                        it!    

                                 ROBBIE
                  (to Jay)
                        I told you he was the best.

           Marvin goes to the computer and types THE JOY OF SEX into the 
           SEARCH WINDOW.  He pushes ENTER and turns to Jay.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Cross your fingers...

           A BEAT.  And then the answer appears.  NO RESULTS FOUND.  

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not on the internet!

                                 JAY
                        I’m not on the internet!

           They all jump up and down hugging each other.

           INT. LINDA’S LEXUS - LATER

           Linda and Annie are driving home from the Fisher-Price 
           meeting.

                                 LINDA
                        I’m so proud of you, honey.  You 
                        were amazing.  We need to 
                        celebrate.  
                                 ANNIE
                        They haven’t made an offer yet.  
                        Let’s not jinx it.  I need to call 
                        Jay.

           Annie picks up her phone and dials Jay.   A beat, then...

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        He’s not picking up.  He must be 
                        working really hard.

           EXT. CAMARO - DUSK

           AERIAL SHOT of a ‘67 RED CONVERTIBLE CAMARO.  Marvin 
           Sebastian is driving, Jay rides shotgun and Dusty is in the 
           back with Robbie next to her.  

           OVER THIS we hear the very distinctive sounds of blaring PORN 
           MUSIC.  There’s no way Jay can hear his phone.  We assume 
           this is SOUNDTRACK and the beginning of a montage until...

                                 JAY
                        Can we turn this down a little?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Sure thing, brother.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Turn it down, turn it up!

           Marvin Sebastian reaches to the tape-deck and turns it down.

                                 JAY
                        Thanks for taking me home.  There’s 
                        no way I could drive.  I’ve 
                        ingested more marijuana in two days 
                        than in the last ten years. 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        No problem.  I love to drive.  
                        Especially with these tunes.  It’s 
                        beautiful, right?  Wet Rainbow, 
                        1974.  It’s a classic.  
                  (playing air bass)
                        Bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm-wacka-wacka-
                        wacka-bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm.  
                        That’s not a synthesizer, either  
                        That’s the real deal.  You dig it?

                                 JAY
                  (digging it)
                        I dig it.
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        This is the scene where they go 
                        downtown on the bear-skin rug. 
                        Remember that, baby?

                                 DUSTY
                        Remember it?  I still have the rug.  
                        That was my first girl-on-girl.

           Jay turns around.  

                                 JAY
                        What???

                                 DUSTY
                        I was one of the best, baby.  I’m 
                        surprised you don’t recognize me.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I knew you looked familiar!

           Dusty uncrosses her legs and crosses them again.  The Daisy-
           Dukes are riding up.  Jay and Robbie do a double-take.

           ANGLE ON the bottom of her shorts.  Is that a BATCH OF BUSH 
           creeping down?

                                 JAY
                        Wow.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Holy bush, Batman.

           ON MARVIN looking at them with a big grin.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Keepin’ it real.
                  (holds out his fist)
                        Real hairy...

           He turns up the music, steps on the gas and the car WIPES 
           FRAME.

           EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

           AERIAL SHOT as the CAMARO winds it’s way towards the 
           SEPULVEDA PASS.   

           The PORN MUSIC is cranking.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - SAME

           The PORN MUSIC CONTINUES AS:
           Annie, holding the baby, helps the kids brush their teeth and 
           get ready for bed. 

           EXT. 405 - NIGHT

           The PORN MUSIC CONTINUES AS:

           They fly down the 405.  Everyone in the car is laughing and 
           having a good time.  Jay’s eyes are starting to look heavy.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - SAME

           The PORN MUSIC CONTINUES AS:

           Annie peaks in on Max, who’s practising his speech in front 
           of the mirror.  She kisses him on the head and then goes into 
           Frankie and Lulu’s room.  She gets in bed with Frankie to 
           read a story.     

           EXT. JAY’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           THE PORN MUSIC CONTINUES AS:

           The Camaro drives through Jay’s residential neighborhood.  
           NEIGHBORS turn as the strange car, with the strange music 
           drives by.  Robbie is passed out cold in the back.

           A DAD picking up his mail, waves to Jay.  Jay manages a 
           smile, but that’s it.  His eyes are heavy and he’s feeling 
           stoned and he can’t stay awake any more.

                                    FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. JAY AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           OVER BLACKNESS, THE PORN MUSIC CONTINUES.  And then:

                                 DUSTY (O.S.)
                        Wake up, baby.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
                        Rise and shine, sleepy-head.

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                  (a beat, then)
                        Dad?

           SCREECH.  THE MUSIC STOPS.  Jay’s eyes pop open.

           JAY’S POV -- Max is looking down at him as he sleeps in the 
           car.  Dusty and Marvin Sebastian are beside him.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Jay, realizing how weird this looks, jumps out of the car.

                                 JAY
                        Just, uh...taking a nap in my 
                        friend’s car.  These are my 
                        friends.  This is my son, Max.

                                 DUSTY/MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Hi, Max.  Hey, Big Guy!

                                 MAX
                        Hi.

                                 DUSTY
                        You’re a sweet one, huh.  You 
                        remind me of our little guy.

           Dusty gives Max a big hug, ENVELOPING HIM IN HER GIGANTIC 
           BREASTS.  We can no longer see his face.

                                 MAX 
                  (muffled)
                        Cool.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay and Max ENTER the house.

                                 MAX
                        Who were those people?  Did you see 
                        her boobs?

                                 JAY
                        No, I didn’t notice.  Where’s Mom?

                                 MAX
                        She fell asleep when she put us to 
                        bed.  Why are you both so tired?

                                 JAY
                        We’ve had a long day.

           Jay looks at his watch.  It’s 10:00.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You should probably be going to 
                        bed, too.  You need your sleep for 
                        your presentation tomorrow.

                                 MAX
                        I was waiting for you.  I really 
                        need your help.
           This brings Jay back to reality.  

                                 JAY
                        Sure thing, buddy.  Whatever you 
                        need.

                                 MAX
                        Will you teach me how to tie a tie 
                        for tomorrow?

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - LATER

           Facing the mirror, Jay stands behind Max teaching him how to 
           tie a tie.  It’s a tender, father and son moment.

                                 JAY
                        Around two times and then up and 
                        through.  Just like that.  You try.

           Max tries.  After a few attempts, he finally does it.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        See?  I knew you could do it.

                                 MAX
                        Thanks, Dad.

                                 JAY
                        Now let’s hear this awesome speech 
                        you’ve got planned for tomorrow.  
                        Do you have it memorized?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, but I’m nervous.  Mom said to 
                        imagine everyone in their 
                        underwear.  That just seems weird.

                                 JAY
                        Here’s what I do.  I find one 
                        person in the audience and I focus 
                        on them.  Like it’s just the two of 
                        you having a conversation.

                                 MAX
                        Will you sit in the front row so it 
                        can be you?  I want it to be you.

           Jay is touched by this.

                                 JAY
                        You got it.  Front and center.  I 
                        promise.

                                 MAX
                        I knew you’d be able to help me.
                                 JAY
                        Okay, let’s hear it.

           Max stands up a little straighter and delivers the speech. 

                                 MAX
                  (smiling and proud)
                        Family trees are important because 
                        in order to understand ourselves, 
                        we need to understand where we come 
                        from...

                                     DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Jay walks down the hall.  He looks happy, having just helped 
           his son. 

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        My parents are Jay and Annie 
                        Johnson, and they are the best 
                        parents in the world.  They do 
                        everything for us and never 
                        complain.  When we’re happy, 
                        they’re happy. 

           INT. LULU AND FRANKIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay ENTERS the girls’ room.  

           The night-light casts the room in a soft glow.  Annie fell 
           asleep while reading the story and the book is still on her 
           chest.  Frankie is curled up beside her.

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        I have two sisters, Frankie and 
                        Lulu.  Even though we sometimes 
                        fight, I love them, too.  A lot.

           Jay goes to Frankie and Annie first.  He puts the book away 
           and tucks them in.  Then he goes to Lulu’s crib where the 
           mobile is gently turning.  He moves it to the side so he can 
           lean over and touch Lulu’s face.

                                 MAX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        My family makes me feel loved and 
                        protected. 

           Jay smiles.  But then, something occurs to him.  He turns.

           RACK FOCUS to the MOBILE.  The same mobile from their 
           sexcapades last night.

                                        CUT TO:
           EXT. BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           THE MOBILE IS NOW IN THE GARBAGE CAN.  Jay slams the lid. 

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           And now, for the first time ever, Jay is alone in his bed.  
           He stretches out and takes up the whole mattress.

           A BEAT.  Something’s not right.  This feels too alone.  He 
           retreats back to his side, takes a pillow and spoons it. 

                                     DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jay is no longer spooning the pillow, but is now spooning 
           Frankie.  Under Frankie is a large wet spot of pee.  Next to 
           this wet spot is another wet spot from Lulu’s overturned baby 
           bottle.  Next to Lulu is Max and then Annie. 

           They are all sleeping peacefully.  One big, happy family.

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        This is my immediate family.  The 
                        first branch of my family tree.   
                        These are the people who make me 
                        who I am.

           Lulu stirs, which causes Max and Frankie to stir, which 
           causes Jay and Annie to open their eyes.  They look at each 
           other and smile. 

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie and Jay meet in the bathroom and hug.

                                 JAY
                        God, I missed you.

                                 ANNIE
                        I missed you, too.  What happened 
                        yesterday?  Please tell me you 
                        found the tape.

                                 JAY
                        Not exactly, but it’s under 
                        control.   Tell me about-Fisher 
                        Price.

                                 ANNIE
                        They loved us.  They’re in town 
                        next week, and they want to come to 
                        dinner and meet the family.
                                 JAY
                        Really?

                                 ANNIE
                        Really.
                  (then)
                        We better finish the kitchen.

                                 JAY
                        We will.

           They both start to brush their teeth.  Through this, they 
           communicate perfectly despite toothbrushes in their mouths.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So what do you think is going to 
                        happen?

                                 ANNIE
                        They’re going to make an offer.  I 
                        can feel it. 

           They stop brushing, look at each other with excitement, and 
           then spit at the same time.

                                 JAY
                        I’m so proud of you.

           They resume brushing.

                                 ANNIE
                        What about the tape?

                                 JAY
                        I found out where it’s not.  The 
                        internet.

           She spits again.

                                 ANNIE
                        The internet???

           Max RUNS between them and to the toilet.  He starts to PEE.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I never even thought it would end 
                        up there.

                                 JAY
                        That’s because we’re analog.

                                 ANNIE
                        Huh?

                                 JAY
                        Never mind.  All that matters is 
                        it’s not there, so we’re fine.
                                 ANNIE
                        But where is it?

                                 MAX
                  (still peeing)
                        Where’s what?

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        Nothing.

                                 JAY
                  (to Annie)
                        Don’t worry.  I have people helping 
                        us.

                                 ANNIE
                        People?

                                 MAX
                        Mom, have you met dad’s friend with 
                        the giant boobs?

           Annie turns to Jay.  Lulu CRIES in the bedroom.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll get the baby.

                                 ANNIE
                        Who’s your friend with the giant 
                        boobs?

                                 JAY
                        I’ll tell you later.  

           Jay EXITS.  Annie turns to Max.

                                 ANNIE
                        Who’s his friend with the giant 
                        boobs?

           Max shrugs.  And then.

                                 MAX
                        Can I have some privacy?  I need to 
                        do Bukaki.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Jay frisbees out waffles to Frankie and Max, while Annie 
           feeds Lulu.  In the BACKGROUND, Vladimir and his workers re-
           tile the wall.

                                 JAY
                        Her name is Dusty, and we’ll talk 
                        about it later, okay?  Trust me.
                  (then, to Vladimir)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        So how close are you to being done, 
                        Vladimir?

                                 VLADIMIR
                        A couple of days.  We still need to 
                        paint.

                                 ANNIE
                        Dusty?  What kind of name is Dusty?

                                 JAY
                        Probably a pseudonym.
                  (whispering)
                        For someone who works in the 
                        industry.

                                 ANNIE
                        What industry?

           A beat.  Annie doesn’t get it.

                                 JAY
                        Rhymes with “morn.”

                                 MAX
                        Born?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Corn?

                                 MAX
                        Horn?

                                 ANNIE
                        Ohhhhhhh...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Glorn?

                                 MAX
                        Glorn’s not a word, dummy.  

                                 JAY
                        Don’t call your sister a dummy.

                                 ANNIE
                        Why are you hanging out with 
                        someone in the “glorn industry?”

                                 MAX
                        What’s the “glorn industry?”

           Jay stands.

                                 JAY
                        Time for school, kids.
           The kids jump up and run for the door.  Jay follows.

                                 ANNIE
                        Am I supposed to just sit here and 
                        not worry about this all day?

                                 JAY
                        I’m taking them to school.  I’ll be 
                        right back.

                                 ANNIE
                        And then what?  The tape’s just 
                        gonna magically appear?

                                 JAY
                        I’ve got it under control.  

                                 ANNIE
                        You don’t even know where it is!

                                 JAY
                        I know where it’s not.

                                 ANNIE
                        Who cares?!  

                                 JAY
                        Why can’t you ever just trust me?  
                        I’m a capable person, you know.  
                        Maybe you’ve forgotten, but I do 
                        know how to manage a situation.  
                        Pretty well, actually.  

           Jay EXITS, annoyed.  A BEAT later, he’s back.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I have no idea where my car is.

           INT. ANNIE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The whole family is now in Annie’s car.  Annie is driving.  
           Jay is shot-gun.  The three kids are in the back.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Why is your car at Marvin 
                        Sebastian’s house?
                  (then)
                        Who is Marvin Sebastian?

                                 JAY
                        Dusty’s husband.

                                 MAX
                        Was he the weird guy in the pants?
                                 ANNIE
                  (into the rearview mirror)
                        How do you know all these people?

                                 MAX
                        I met them last night in the 
                        driveway. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        No fair.  I never get to meet 
                        anyone in the “glorn industry.”

           EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

           A large FAMILY DAY BANNER hangs above the school entrance.  
           Annie, Jay and the kids walk into the school.

           INT./EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

           More FAMILY DAY SIGNS and lots of BALLOONS inside, which 
           makes the already chaotic morning drop-off even more so.  
           KIDS and PARENTS everywhere.

                                 MAX
                        The assembly is at five o’clock.  
                        Don’t be late.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’ll be there.

                                 MAX
                        Front row, right, Dad?

                                 JAY
                        It’s you and me, buddy.  

           They high-five and then Max and Frankie run off.  Annie and 
           Jay turn to each other.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s drop off Lulu with your mom 
                        and go get my car.  I’ve got 
                        everything under control.

                                 ANNIE
                  (under her breath)
                        Just like the fuse box.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 ANNIE
                        Nothing.
                                 JAY
                        Is this about the stupid fuse box 
                        again?  Well, guess what, I fixed 
                        it last night.  Yeah, you heard me.  
                        I fixed it.  What do you have to 
                        say about that?

           Silence.  Annie looks like she wants to say something, but 
           for the first time, she can’t.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought.  Finally.  
                        The sweet sound of silence.  Let me 
                        listen...

           Jay cups his hand to his ear.  And then his PHONE RINGS.  He 
           picks it up, annoyed.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                  (into phone)
                        Hello?

           EXT. DUPARS PARKING LOT - SAME

           The parking lot is PACKED.  Jay and Annie walk towards the 
           restaurant.

                                 ANNIE
                        Why does he want to meet us here?
                  (then)
                        Who are all these people eating 
                        pancakes in the middle of the day?

                                 JAY
                        Can you keep an open mind, please?

           INT. DUPARS - MOMENTS LATER

           They ENTER.  The place is packed with a SKETCHY CROWD.  Lots 
           of tatoos, breast-implants and facial piercings.  Annie 
           raises an eyebrow.

                                 JAY
                        Will you stop?  

           Jay looks around.  Doesn’t see Marvin Sebastian.

           ANGLE ON the SKETCHY GUY IN A CAMO HOODIE AND HUGE MIRRORED 
           SUNGLASSES.  Jay looks closer.  Not him.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think he’s here yet. 
                                 ANNIE
                        Is he going to bring your car?  I 
                        don’t want to have to drive him 
                        home after this.

                                 JAY
                        I’ve been to his house.  It’s 
                        really nice.  They’re totally 
                        normal people.

                                 ANNIE
                        Uh-huh...

                                 JAY
                        I swear to God, they’re just like 
                        us.  Their kids go to Oakwood. 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
                        Psssssssst. 

           Jay doesn’t hear this.  Annie does.

           ANGLE ON the man in the hoodie and sunglasses.  He waves and 
           points to Jay.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                  (a violent whisper)
                        Pssssssssst.  Pssssssssst!

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay, the Unabomber is calling you.

           On JAY’S REACTION WE:

           INT. DUPARS - MOMENTS LATER

           They are now in the booth.  

           Marvin Sebastian is twitching.  Dressed in camouflage from 
           head-to-toe, he keeps his head down and his MIRRORED 
           SUNGLASSES on.  He has a BLACKBERRY, an iPHONE, and a PAGER 
           in front of him.  He checks all three devices every few 
           seconds for alerts.

                                 JAY
                        Uh....what’s going on, Marvin 
                        Sebastian?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (looking around nervously)
                        Shhhhhhh!  No names.
                  (then, re Annie)
                        Who’s she?

                                 JAY
                        My wife.  This is Annie.
                                 ANNIE
                        Hello.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (sotto, to Jay)
                        Is she cool?

                                 JAY
                        She’s my wife.  Of course she’s 
                        cool.  What’s happening? 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        There’s a lot of chatter.  Lot-a-
                        lot-a-lot of chatter.

                                 JAY
                        What do you mean chatter?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I haven’t seen this much activity 
                        since the Ruth Bader Ginsberg tape.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ruth Bader Ginsberg has a--

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        No she does not, thanks to me.
                  (then, to Jay re Annie)
                        How do you know she’s not wearing a 
                        wire.

                                 JAY
                        Because she’s my wife!

                                 ANNIE
                  (to Jay)
                        I thought you said this was under 
                        control.

                                 JAY
                        I thought it was. Marvin Sebastian--

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        What did I say about names?  Jesus 
                        fucking Christ!  Do you want to get 
                        me killed?

           Marvin Sebastian PULLS THE CORD ON THE BLINDS AND TWISTS THEM 
           CLOSED.

                                 JAY
                        Killed?  What are you talking 
                        about?  This can’t possibly be 
                        about our sex-tape.
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (not chill)
                        Just...keep it chill, okay?  Keep 
                        it chill.

           All Jay and Annie can see is THEMSELVES, REFLECTED IN 
           MARVIN’S MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.  They look a little scared.

                                 JAY
                        Can you please take off your sun-
                        glasses?  It’s really distracting. 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Sorry, brother, I’m a little amped.  
                        Been up all night chasing this 
                        tiger.

           He takes off the glasses.  His eyes are BLOODSHOT and there’s 
           BLACK GREASE smeared all around them like a marine. 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Better?

                                 JAY
                        Not really.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        You want pancakes?  

                                 JAY
                        I’m not sure this is really the 
                        time to eat pancakes.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        You ever had them here?

           Marvin Sebastian nods to a WAITRESS.  She brings over three 
           plates stacked high with pancakes.  

                                 WAITRESS
                  (whispering)
                        I heard you were back in the game, 
                        Big Daddy.  

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I said I wouldn’t come back unless 
                        I had a reason to come back.

           He drowns his pancakes in syrup and eats like an animal.  
           Syrup dribbling down his chin and hands.

                                 ANNIE
                  (nervous)
                        We’re the reason you came back?
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (mouth full)
                        You know how in California we’re 
                        always waiting for “the big one”
                        Well, you’re it.

           Annie and Jay look at each other.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                  (re pancakes)
                        Load up.  No telling when we’ll eat 
                        next.  Try the strawberry syrup, 
                        it’s got a real good tang.

           His BLACKBERY BUZZES.  Marvin Sebastian grabs it with his 
           syrupy hands.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

                                 ANNIE/JAY
                        What?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Korea’s in.

           EXT. DUPARS PARKING LOT - LATER

           Marvin Sebastian, with his hoodie back up and his glasses 
           back on, runs serpentine to his car.  He’s wearing CAMO LAP-
           DANCE PANTS.

           Annie and Jay struggle to keep up.

                                 JAY
                        Korea’s in what?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Meet me at my house.  It’s on.

                                 JAY
                        What’s on?

           EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - MOMENTS LATER

           AERIAL SHOT as Jay follows Marvin Sebastian’s car down 
           Ventura.  Marvin Sebastian WEAVES IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC.

           EXT. MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S BACKYARD - LATER

           Marvin Sebastian runs towards the tool shed, which now has a 
           HUGE SATELITE ON TOP and tons of CABLE RUNNING FROM THE SHED 
           TO THE HOUSE.  Annie and Jay follow, several paces behind.  
           Annie looks around the well-manicured yard.
                                 ANNIE
                        This is his house?

           They pass some bikes.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        He has kids?

                                 JAY
                        Yesterday he was totally normal!  
                        We ate tangy barbecue together.  
                        His wife is a sweetheart.  

           Dusty steps out of the tool shed, wearing MILITARY BOOTS and 
           a CAMO BIKINI.  She looks like the cover of an ammo/porn 
           magazine.  Her breasts are about to explode.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Whoa.

                                 ANNIE
                        Let me guess...Dusty.

           INT. MARVIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           The tool shed/office has been re-arranged.  There’s now a 
           long conference table filled with cable and phones and two 
           YOUNG GUYS with laptops.  This is SAJ and BRIAN, both late 
           20s, INDIAN and ASIAN respectively.

           Dusty paces the room, talking into a head-set and typing on a 
           BLACKBERRY.  Marvin Sebastian types on his iPhone, while Saj 
           and Brian type on their laptops.  

                                 JAY
                        Marvin Sebastian, please--

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (holds up his hand)
                        One second.  I’m talking to my guy 
                        in Shanghai.

                                 JAY
                        There has to be a mistake.  This 
                        can’t be about us.  We’re just 
                        regular people.  We’re not that 
                        good in bed!  I don’t even have a 
                        porn penis!

           Dusty touches her earpiece, all business.

                                 DUSTY
                  (into phone)
                        Okay, thanks.  Bye.
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        What’d they say?

                                 DUSTY
                  (a solemn nod)
                        It’s been verified.

           Dusty sits on Marvin’s lap but because of the LAP-DANCE PANTS 
           she SLIDES RIGHT OFF AND FALLS TO THE FLOOR WITH A THUMP.

                                 DUSTY (CONT’D)
                        Damn it!

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Sorry babe, these ones are extra 
                        slick.

                                 JAY
                        Can someone please tell us what the 
                        fuck is going on?  We’re a boring 
                        married couple trying to get our 
                        spark back.  There’s no way 
                        anyone’s interested in our sex 
                        life.  We’re barely interested in 
                        our sex life.  I mean, at worst, 
                        someone took it and posted it on 
                        one of those amateur porn sights, 
                        and we’ll just take it down.  
                        Right?  

           A long beat of silence.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Right???

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        The bidding has begun.

                                 DUSTY
                        Would you like a drink?  Or some 
                        coffee?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.  Coffee.  Please.  Shoot it 
                        into my veins.  

           Dusty nods to Saj and Brian.  They EXIT.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Thank God for interns.

                        This requires interns?

           Annie looks like she’s going to throw-up.

                                 ANNIE
                        I need air.

           EXT. MARVIN’S BACKYARD - SAME

           Annie runs through the backyard.  Jay chases after her.  

                                 JAY
                        Annie, wait!

                                 ANNIE
                        We have to get out of here, Jay.  
                        These people are fucking crazy.

                                 JAY
                        But what if they’re right?

                                 ANNIE
                        How can they be right?  We didn’t 
                        do anything wrong!
                  (starts to cry)
                        We just had a crazy night.  Maybe 
                        we got a little weird.  Why are we 
                        being punished?

                                 JAY
                        Please don’t cry.

                                 ANNIE
                        For the first time in years, I let 
                        go and really had an orgasm and now 
                        this happens?

                                 JAY
                  (a beat)
                        What does really have an orgasm 
                        mean?  You haven’t had an orgasm in 
                        years?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes, but...no, I mean, not like 
                        that.  Not like, really, like that.

                        There’s different kinds...  

           Jay looks crushed.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I felt like myself again.  Finally.  
                        I was myself.  After so long.  Not 
                        a mom, not a wife, not a business 
                        woman, just a girl getting her fuck 
                        on.  And look where it got us.

           Annie’s face gets very serious.

                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        If this tape gets out, do you know 
                        what it would do to us?  We’ll 
                        forever be those people.  Everyone 
                        will look at us and talk about us.  
                        There’s a mom in Frankie’s class 
                        who had a three-way and we talk 
                        about her constantly.

                                 JAY
                        Who?

                                 ANNIE
                        You see?  It’s all anyone wants to 
                        know.  And it will follow us 
                        forever.  Our kids won’t get into 
                        college.  We won’t get into a 
                        retirement community.  We’ll be 
                        octogenarians roaming the land with 
                        no place to go. 

           Annie is really crying now.  Jay takes her in his arms.  They 
           hold each other.  Gaining strength now from being together.

                                 JAY
                        I’m going to fix this.  I’m going 
                        to call our lawyer.  I’m going to 
                        fix everything.  I promise.   

           As they PULL APART, REVEAL MARVIN SEBASTIAN AND DUSTY 
           STANDING RIGHT THERE.  They have grim looks on their faces.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Why are you looking at us like

           INT. MARVIN’S HOUSE - LATER

           At the kitchen table.  Dusty pours coffee. 
                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I’ve been in this business for 
                        twenty-five years and this is the 
                        first time I’ve heard of one.  A 
                        Silver rating is rare, Gold is 
                        almost non-existent.  But a 
                        Platinum?  I’ve been waiting my 
                        whole life for a Platinum rating.

                                 DUSTY
                        We all have...

           Dusty sits on Marvin’s lap.  Again, SHE SLIDES RIGHT TO THE 
           FLOOR WITH A THUMP.

                                 DUSTY (CONT’D)
                        God damn it!

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Sorry, honey.  

           Annie looks at Jay like, what the fuck?

                  (then, back to Marvin)
                        Okay, so we’re talking about some 
                        kind of rating or something?

                                 MARVIN
                        Back in the day, when bushes were 
                        hairy and the VCR was just 
                        invented, people needed to 
                        classify.  It’s how we made sense 
                        in a senseless world.  The highest 
                        ratings were Silver, Gold and  
                        Platinum.  Like the Michelin star 
                        rating system.

                                 JAY
                        The Michelin star ratings of porn?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Yes.  But even more rarified.  
                        There are 81, 3-star Michelin 
                        restaurants in the world.  Do you 
                        know how many Platinum porns there 
                        are in the marketplace?  One.  
                        You’ve been bestowed the highest 
                        honor there is.

                        What the fuck are you talking

                        bouncy swing!  Trying out funny 
                        positions from a stupid book.

                        There must be something on that 
                        tape.  Something so pure.  So 
                        primal and honest.  The very 
                        essence of who we are and who we 
                        are meant to be.

                        That’s right.  When the planets 
                        align and the earth’s energy shifts 
                        from discord to harmony.  The 
                        energy is powerful enough to change 
                        the global perspective from 
                        conflict to cooperation. 
                  (then)
                        Does any of this ring true?

           Annie and Jay look at each other.

                        Only you two know what was on that 
                        tape.  Was that what it was?  Was 
                        their an epic shift in your 
                        universe?  One that broke down 
                        walls and reset your north?

                             Yeah.

           Jay takes Annie’s hand.  They are now finally remembering the 
           full extent of last night.  A BEAT as they feel the weight of 
           this.  It feels warm and good.  Marvin Sebastian gets tears 
           in his eyes.

                        That, my friends, is why your sex 
                        tape got a Platinum rating.  People 
                        have been searching for something 
                        truly real, and you two are the

                        Dusty here.  Uh-huh.  Oh, no.  
                        That’s terrible news.  Okay, bye.  
           She hangs up.

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        What now?!

                                 DUSTY
                        Junior twisted his ankle.  I have 
                        to get him at the nurse’s office.  

                                 ANNIE
                  (re camo-boobs)
                        Like that?

                                 DUSTY
                        No, silly.  Be right back.

           Dusty EXITS.  Marvin Sebastian lets out a big sigh.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I know this isn’t what you wanted 
                        to hear, but if it’s any 
                        consolation, your lovemaking will 
                        be emblazoned in our collective 
                        memories forever.  You’re famous 
                        now.  

                                 JAY
                        That’s no consolation!  

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        This must be tearing through 
                        Adultcon right now...

                                 ANNIE
                        How could this all happen so fast?  
                        It’s only been 24 hours.  It’s not 
                        possible! 

                                 MARVIN
                        Let’s go find Saj.

           INT. MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S “OFFICE”

           Back in the tool shed, they stand over Saj’s laptop as he 
           types furiously.

                                 SAJ
                        I can de-scramble some of it, but 
                        it’s only text.  No images yet.
                  (types some more)
                        I’m hacking into the worldwide 
                        database, but something’s blocking 
                        me.  It’s a code.  Looks like 
                        Mandarin.  Brian, we need you.

           Brian runs over.  He types and unscrambles a message.
                                 BRIAN
                        Okay.  It says, first Platinum 
                        Video to be encrypted then 
                        downloaded.  Sources say video 
                        shows a couple in their home, late 
                        thirties, in a bouncy swing...doing 
                        the Viennese Oyster.
                  (then, in Mandarin with 
                   subtitles)
                        You guys are fucked.

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        Holy shit.  No fucking way!

           And then, Dusty peaks her head into the shed.  She’s WEARING 
           YOGA PANTS AND HER HAIR IN A HALF PONY-TAIL, HALF BUN.

                                 DUSTY
                        Come on, hon.  We have to go.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        Okay.

           Marvin follows her out.  Jay and Annie run after them.

           INT. MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S BACKYARD - SAME

           FOLLOWING Dusty and Marvin Sebastian through the backyard and 
           to their car.

                                 JAY
                        Wait!  What are we supposed to do?
                        Can’t you shut it down?  Isn’t that 
                        what you do?  You’ll do it for 
                        Oprah and not for us?

                                 ANNIE
                        Oprah has a sex tape?

                                 DUSTY
                        Ooph, is she dirty.  Don’t ever 
                        kiss her on the mouth.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        It’s too big now.  It can’t be 
                        stopped.

                                 JAY
                        What if it’s not a Platinum?  We 
                        just need to change the rating to a 
                        silver or a bronze.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        You can’t un-fire a bullet.  This 
                        thing is traveling at the speed of 
                        life.   
                                 JAY
                        We’ll go before the board and plead 
                        our case.  When they see how boring 
                        we are they won’t want us to be the 
                        face of Platinum anyway. 

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        There’s no board.  It’s just one 
                        man.  The Wizard.

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        The Wizard?

           Dusty clicks open the automatic doors of her MINIVAN. 

           ANGLE ON the back window where we see their FAMILY STICKER.  
           It’s a father, a mother with HUGE BOOBS and a son, waving.

                                 DUSTY
                        I’m sorry, our son is in the 
                        nurse’s office.  We have to go.  

                                 JAY
                        Tell us how to find him.  Please.  

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        No one knows.  I wouldn’t even know 
                        where to start.
                  (then)
                        But if I was going to start 
                        anywhere... 

           EXT. THE LOS ANGELES CONVENTION CENTER - LATER

           FOLLOWING Jay and Annie’s sneakers, walking on asphalt.

           WIDEN TO REVEAL other shoes walking.  Mostly STRIPPER HEALS.

           The “WET RAINBOW” PORN MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY as we SLOWLY TILT 
           UP TO REVEAL THE MASSIVE LOS ANGELES CONVENTION CENTER.  A 
           MILLION PANES OF GLASS GLISTEN IN THE AFTERNOON SUN. 

           ON THE HUGE MARQUIS IT SAYS: WELCOME ADULTCON! 

           INT. LOS ANGELES CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

           CONFUSION in the enormous main atrium.  Signs everywhere for 
           the many different convention halls.  The place is packed 
           with STRIPPERS and PORN STARS and TOURISTS taking pictures of 
           strippers and porn stars.  

           ON JAY AND ANNIE hurrying through the crowd.   

                                 ANNIE
                        Everyone is staring at us.
                                 JAY
                        You’re being paranoid.  Come on.

           A LION TAMER crosses in front of them pulling a CAGE FULL OF 
           “LIONS.”  The lions are actually PORN STARS in LION FUR 
           BIKINIS.  Some are roaring, while the rest are licking each 
           other.  (It’s a promotion for CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK.)     

           The LIONS (over-acting, like they are in CATS) stare at Annie 
           and Jay as they pass.

                                 ANNIE
                        They were definitely staring.
                        Now they’re whispering in each 
                        other’s ears.  Look.  

                                 JAY
                        They’re licking each other’s ears.  
                        That’s how they clean themselves. 

           They keep walking.  Jay’s STOMACH GROWLS.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m starving.  I haven’t eaten 
                        anything today.  I should’ve had 
                        those pancakes this morning when we 
                        had the chance. 

                                 ANNIE
                        How can you think of food at a time 
                        like this?  

           ANGLE ON a PORNSTAR being stopped for an autograph. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s going to be us.  We’ll have 
                        to start carrying Sharpees.

                                 JAY
                        Stop!  I promise you will never be 
                        recognized.  Trust me, okay?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Annie Johnson?  Is that you?

           They FREEZE.

           REVERSE TO Mr. Nelson, the Fisher-Price CEO, with a team of 
           EXECUTIVES.  He looks older in person and walks with a cane.

                                 ANNIE
                  (a beat, then mortified)
                        Mr. Nelson?  What are you doing 
                        here? 
                                 MR. NELSON
                        We do this convention every year.  
                        We like as much exposure as 
                        possible.  What are you doing here.

           Annie draws a blank.

                                 ANNIE
                        That is a great question.
                  (then)
                        Do you know my husband, Jay?  Jay, 
                        this is Mr. Nelson.  From Fisher-
                        Price.

                                 JAY
                  (holy shit)
                        Hi.  Nice to meet you.

           Annie and Jay don’t know what to say, but then a DOMINATRIX 
           WALKING HER SLAVE ON A LEASH walks between them and everyone 
           forgets what they were saying anyway.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I’d like to be a fly on the wall at 
                        that convention, right?
                  (then)
                        Come on.  Consumer Electronics is 
                        in the South Hall.  Let’s go.

                                 ANNIE
                        Consumer Electronics!  Of course!  
                  (sotto, to Jay)
                        You go that way, I’ll go this way.  
                        I’ll be over as soon as I can.

           They high five and separate.

           INT. WEST HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           UP THE ESCALATOR and around the corner.  Jay runs towards the 
           WEST HALL.  HARD ROCK MUSIC GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

           INT. ADULTCON CONVENTION - MOMENTS LATER

           MUSIC BLARING, PEOPLE IN COSTUMES...Adultcon is like a 
           circus, literally, because the convention is sponsored by 
           CIRCUS ENERGY DRINKS.   

           There are SEDUCTIVE CLOWNS, GAY PORN JUGGLERS, STRIPPING 
           CONTORTIONISTS and maybe even a TRAPEZE ARTIST.  And of 
           course, there are booths filled with every matter of ADULT-
           CONTENT imaginable (SEXTOYS, VIDEOS, APPAREL, PORN-STAR MEET-
           AND-GREETS, etc.)
           Jay doesn’t know which way to turn.  And then: HONK-HONK.  A 
           HOT CLOWN with RED NOSES over her nipples HONKS A HORN at him

                                 CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN
                        Welcome to the Big Top.  Circus 
                        Energy Drink?

           She holds up a tray of little CANS OF CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK.

                                 JAY
                        Thanks.  I’m good.

                                 CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN
                        It’s delicious.  Guaranteed, all-
                        natural energy for six hours.
                        You’re going to need it.  Over five 
                        hundred sex-tacular booths this 
                        year.  It’s going to get wild.

           She hands him a can and then moves off.  Jay starts walking.  
           He takes a sip of the energy drink.  Not bad.  

           A GUY IN LATEX, JUGGLING DILDOS ON A UNICYCLE, rides past.

                                 JAY
                        O-kay.

           Another CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN walks by.  She is even 
           hotter than the last.  

                                 CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN 2
                        Circus Energy Jello shot?

                                 JAY
                        No, thanks. 

                                 CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK GIRL 2
                        You’re really cute.  Come on...

           She’s so hot, how can he say no...

                                        CUT TO:

           INT. CONSUMER ELECTRONICS CONVENTION - SAME

           DEAD QUIET.  Just the buzz of nerds and electronics.  Annie 
           and Mr. Nelson walk towards the impressive FISHER-PRICE 
           BOOTH.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I love that you’re here, Annie.  
                        You’re a real go-getter aren’t you?  
                        Always have your finger on the 
                        pulse.
                                 ANNIE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I’d love to walk through the 
                        convention with you and hear your 
                        thoughts on all the new products.
                  (then)
                        Where did your husband go?

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh.  Uh...he’s around here 
                        somewhere.  I think he might have 
                        gone to get a snack.  I’ll go 
                        check.

           INT. ADULTCON CONVENTION - SAME

           A CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN offers Jay an ENERGY POPSICLE.

                                 JAY
                        Oh, no.  I really shouldn’t.

           But she’s so hot.  And she’s very seductively eating a 
           popsicle.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                  (re posicle blowjob)
                        You’re really, uh...good at that.

                                 CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN 3
                        Now you try...

           She gives it to him.  He gives it a little lick.  She 
           giggles.  And then he gets into it, putting the WHOLE THING 
           IN HIS MOUTH...UNTIL HE REALIZES HOW GAY IT LOOKS AND GAGS.

           And then SOMEONE GRABS HIS ARM.

                                 JAY
                        Hey.

           REVEAL a SCANTILY-CLAD GIRL, SQUIRTING LUBE ON HIS ARM. 

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        Hey, baby.  Soooooo silky, right?  

           Seductive strokes up and down his arm.  Like a hand job.

                                 LUBE GIRL (CONT’D)
                  (X-rated overtones)
                        You like it?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUBE GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, it feels good, huh?  Oooh, I 
                        like it, too.  You want a li’l 
                        sample?  You want to taste it?  
                        Huh?  Do you?  Come back to my 
                        booth, baby. 

           She is now JERKING OFF HIS ARM.  Jay is a deer in headlights.

                                 JAY
                        For what?

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        Doesn’t your lady like lube?  Or 
                        maybe you’re into dudes, in which 
                        case, you really need lube.  We 
                        have all kinds of flavors.

                                 JAY
                        I’m not into dudes.

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        Me neither.  Come on.

           She pulls him towards the SLIXXX LUBE BOOTH.  It is the MECCA 
           OF LUBE.   

                                 JAY
                        I’m trying to find someone named--

           She puts her FINGER IN HIS MOUTH.

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        This is strawberry.

                                 JAY
                        Mmm-hmmm.  
                  (then)
                        Do you know someone named The Wiz--

           ANOTHER FINGER IN HIS MOUTH.

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        This is my favorite.  See if you 
                        can guess what it is.

           Jay makes a bad face.

                                 LUBE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        It’s hamburger.  

                                 JAY
                  (repulsed)
                        Hamburger?

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        Yeah.  It tastes exactly like a 
                        burger, right?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUBE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        You can be going down on your lady 
                        and it will taste like a juicy, 
                        delicious hamburger.

                                 JAY
                        Why would I want it to taste like 
                        hamburger?

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        Why are you making this so fucking 
                        hard, man?  I’m just trying to sell 
                        some lube.

                                 JAY
                        I’m sorry.  I’m just trying to find 
                        this guy called The Wizard.  It’s 
                        really important.  Do you know him?  

                                 LUBE GIRL
                        No.  Fuck you.  Enjoy your dry sex.

           She MOVES OFF as Annie runs towards him, out of breath.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay!  Did you find him yet?

                                 JAY
                        No.  Is there any food in your 
                        convention?  I’m dying.

                                 ANNIE
                        Can you stop thinking about food 
                        for five minutes?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t think so.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay.  Come on.  Keep it together.  
                        We have to find this guy and we 
                        don’t have a lot of time.

           A hot CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN approaches with a tray of 
           CLOWN ENERGY DRINK GUMMIES.  Jay grabs as many as he can and 
           stuffs them in his mouth.

                                 JAY
                  (mouth full)
                        You’re right. 

           And then another CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN approaches.  This 
           one has a tray of drinks.  Jay goes to grab one.

                                 ANNIE
                        What is this stuff?
                                 JAY
                        I don’t know, but I’m so 
                        dehydrated, I’m shaking.  Look.

           He holds up his hands.  They are shaking so much he knocks 
           over the tray and all the drinks spill all over his pants.  
           Looks like he peed himself.

                                 ANNIE
                        I gotta go.  Find the fucking 
                        Wizard.

           Annie bolts, leaving Jay and the clown alone staring at his 
           wet pants.  She shrugs.  

                                 CIRCUS ENERGY DRINK CLOWN
                        They sell pants in the next aisle.

           INT. PANTS BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay peruses the rack of pants.  There’s something weird about 
           these pants.  Something silky.  Something oddly...familiar.

           They’re LAP-DANCE PANTS.  TILT UP TO A LIFE-SIZE CUT-OUT OF 
           MARVIN WEARING THE PANTS.

           A SEXY SALESGIRL approaches and rubs up against his leg.  

                                 SEXY SALESGIRL
                        Free lap dance with any Lap-Dance 
                        Pants purchase.  

           She turns around and rubs her ass up and down his groin like 
           a pro.  Jay’s whole body is now SHAKING.    

                                 SEXY SALESGIRL (CONT’D)
                        Are you familiar with Lap-Dance 
                        Pants?
                  (then, re wet spot)
                        Looks like you really need them.

                                 JAY
                        No, I spilled.

                                 SEXY SALESGIRL
                        Don’t be embarrassed.  Some guys 
                        just get too excited.  Poor thing.  
                        You’re still shaking.

                                 JAY
                        No, seriously.  I--

                                 SEXY SALESGIRL
                        Let me guess...you’re married?

           She hands him some pants.
                                 SEXY SALESGIRL (CONT’D)
                        Try these.  They have extra 
                        strength waterproofing.

                                 JAY
                        Can you help me?  I’m looking for 
                        The Wizard.  Have you heard of him?

                                 SEXY SALESGIRL
                        No.  But there’s an information 
                        booth around the corner.  Ask them.

           INT. CONSUMER ELECTRONICS CONVENTION - SAME 

           Annie runs back to the Fisher-Price booth just as Mr. Nelson 
           and the executives are finishing up a rocking rendition of If 
           You’re Happy and You Know It on FISHER-PRICE INSTRUMENTS.  

                                 MR. NELSON (O.S.)
                        If you’re happy and you know it and 
                        you really want to show it, if 
                        you’re happy and you know it, buy 
                        Fisher-Price.
                  (then, to Annie)
                        Isn’t this great?  You can plug it 
                        into your television.  Does your 
                        family like making home movies?

           Annie practically chokes. 

           INT. INFORMATION BOOTH - SAME

           Jay approaches the booth.  His hands and arms are now really 
           SHAKING.  A cheerful ADULTCON REP smiles at him.

                                 ADULTCON REP
                        Can I help you, sir?
                  (then)
                        What’s wrong with your eye?

           REVERSE to Jay.  His eye is twitching like crazy.  First one 
           eye, and then the other.  And then his whole face.

                                 JAY
                        I think I had too many of those 
                        Circus Energy Drinks. 

                                 ADULTCON REP
                        Oooh, yeah.  Those are the 
                        equivalent of like, eighty Red 
                        Bulls.  They’re mostly for porn 
                        stars who are getting off Meth.
                                 JAY
                        I just need something to eat.  Are 
                        there any food vendors here?

                                 ADULTCON REP
                        Just the pie-eating contest.  Do 
                        you like pie?  There’s a pretty 
                        rockin’ prize this year.

           ANGLE ON the pie-eating contest booth.  Looks like something 
           out of a county fair except for the bad-ass, shiny black 
           CHEVY CORVETTE ZR1 spinning slowly on the stage.

           BACK ON Jay, his eyes light up.

                                 JAY
                        Now that’s a car.

           INT. ADULTCON CONVENTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay sitting at the pie-eating contest with a large wedge of 
           BOSTON CREAM PIE in front of him.  His head and neck 
           involuntarily jolt forward like someone with Tourette’s.    
           His STOMACH GROWLS loudly.

                                 HOT REFERREE
                        Somebody’s ready to eat some pie.

           The hot referee then ties his hands behind his back.

                                 JAY
                        I’m not allowed to use my hands?

                                 HOT REFERREE
                        In general, I’d say yes, please, 
                        but for the purposes of this 
                        competition, I have to say no.

           REVEAL that the hot referee is actually world famous 
           pornstar, JENNA JAMESON.  She winks at him.  And then she 
           takes a big can of chocolate WHIPPED CREAM and makes a 
           mountain of curlicues at the top of the pie wedge.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        How ‘bout some hair with your pie.

           ON THE PIE which now looks like a large pie vagina.

                                 JAY
                        Oh, my God.

           INT. PIE EATING CONTEST - BOOTH

           The pie-eating contest has begun.  Jenna walks down the line 
           of contestants and we see each person with their different 
           “pie-eating” technique.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Looks like we have a lot of pie 
                        lovers here today...

           EXTREME CLOSE UPS of the different contestants.

           There’s a GUY with a pierced, lizard-like tongue, lapping it 
           up.

           A HEAVY-SET LESBIAN with a mighty motor-boating technique.

           A GIRL with a long and useful nose.

           An OLD MAN with the longest tongue ever.

           And then there’s Jay, who’s devouring the pie like a rabid 
           animal.
           Jenna crosses and uncrosses her legs.  Clearly, she’s getting 
           turned on by him.

                                 JENNA JAMESON (CONT’D)
                        Oooh.  Oh.  Yeah...

           The crowd gets into it.  

                                 CROWD
                        Go.  Go.  Go.  Go...

                                        CUT TO:

           INT. ADULTCON CONVENTION - SAME

           Annie runs down the aisles looking for Jay.  In the 
           BACKGROUND we hear the crowd chanting.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay!  Jay!  Where are you!

           And then she stops.  And looks up.

           TILT UP to the JUMBOTRON.  There’s Jay, devouring his second 
           piece of pie, as the crowd goes wild. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?!

           INT. PIE EATING CONTEST - SAME

           Jenna puts yet another piece of pie down in front of Jay.  
           She’s now starting to perspire.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Oh, yeah.  Eat that up, baby...  

           Even the other contestants stop to watch Jay eat the pie.  
           Especially because he is now having full-body Circus Energy 
           Drink convulsions.  No one has ever eaten pie like this. 

           Annie pushes her way into the crowd.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jay!  What are you doing?

                                 MAN
                        He’s going to win that Corvette is 
                        what he’s doing.

           Annie looks up at the car.  And then looks back at Jay.  Even 
           she can’t help but be impressed.  And then in one final 
           spasm, his arms break free of the tie behind his back and 
           shoot forward into the pie.
                                 ANNIE
                  (turned on)
                        Oh, my.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Winner!

           INT. PIE EATING CONTEST BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Jenna Jameson hands Jay the keys to the Corvette.

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                  (to Annie)
                        You are one lucky lady. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I know.  Believe me, I know.

                                 JAY
                        Can you help us?  We’re trying to 
                        find the Wizard.  Do you know him?

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        Of course.  Everyone knows the 
                        Wizard.  Go to the next aisle.  
                        Right next to Design-a-Vagine. 

           INT. ADULTCON CONVENTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie and Jay RACE THROUGH ADULTCON hand-in-hand.  

           Weaving in and out of UNICYCLISTS and SWORD SWALLOWERS, they 
           have hopeful looks on their faces.  Soon, this nightmare will 
           all be over.

           And then...

                                 JAY
                        Oh, no.

           PUSH IN ON THE WIZARD.  IT’S A LARGE, SWIVELING, WIZARD-
           SHAPED VIBRATOR.

                                 ANNIE
                        No...

           And then, from the battle of the bands stage, comes Jenna 
           Jameson’s voice, addressing the crowd from the microphone.  

                                 JENNA JAMESON (O.S.)
                        Can I have your attention?  I have 
                        a special announcement.  As many of 
                        you know, a Platinum Video has 
                        recently surfaced.  I haven’t seen 
                        it yet but I hear it is HOT!  
           The CROWD WHISTLES AND CHEERS. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, my God...

                                 JENNA JAMESON
                        I’ve just gotten word that the 
                        video will be ready for purchase, 
                        download and viewing at midnight 
                        tonight at www.platinumporn.com.  
                        Get your spank on, people!

           Annie bursts into tears as the CROWD GOES NUTS.

           INT. LOS ANGELES CONVENTION CENTER LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           The cavernous lobby is now empty, which makes Annie’s sobs 
           sound even louder and more aching. 

                                 ANNIE
                        What are we going to do?
                  (then, re pants)
                        Are those Lap-Dance Pants?  Did you 
                        get a lap dance?

                                 JAY
                        No, of course not.  I’ll tell you 
                        in the car.  Let’s just go.  I 
                        don’t want to be late for Max’s 
                        speech.  I promised I’d be in the 
                        front row.  That’s all the matters.

           Jay’s violent facial tics continue and now his right arm 
           flies up to the sky every few seconds and needs to be pushed 
           down with the other.

                                 ANNIE
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                 JAY
                        I’m fine.  Just had a few too many 
                        energy drinks. 

           We FOLLOW THEM to the large glass doors.  They head right 
           into the setting sun.  In this light, they look tired but 
           heroic.  Like athletes who lost the game but left everything 
           on the field.  

           Annie looks at Jay.  Jay looks at Annie.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So, maybe we will be famous.  I 
                        always thought you were the sexiest 
                        girl in the world.  Now everyone 
                        will know it, too.
           A little smile, through her tears.

                                 ANNIE
                        I fucking love you.

                                 JAY
                        I fucking love you, too

           He tries to brush a strand of hair from her beautifully lit 
           face but his ARM SHOOTS UP and misses it completely.  He 
           grabs his runaway arm with the other hand.

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you sure you’re okay?

           OUTSIDE we see Marvin Sebastian running up the steps. 

                                 JAY
                        What the--

           Marvin Sebastian pushes through the doors and doubles over, 
           panting.  While bent over, he’s eye-level with Jay’s pants.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                  (touched)
                        Lap-Dance Pants?  Thanks, man. 

           He stands.

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I was just at school picking up my 
                        kid.  All the parents were there, 
                        the teachers...and then it hit me.  
                        This will kill you guys.  If this 
                        tape gets out, it will completely 
                        destroy your lives.

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        Now you’re realizing this?  

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN
                        I’m sorry.  The Platinum thing got 
                        me all messed up.  But, you have 
                        kids.  A lot of people won’t let 
                        their kids play with our kids 
                        because of Dusty being a former 
                        porn star.  That hurts us, man.  It 
                        hurts our kids the most and that’s 
                        what really matters.

           A moment.  Three parents with a common bond.  And then...

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Let’s fix this.  We’re off to see 
                        mother-fucking Wizard.
           ON their backs as they start walking.  It looks like Jay does 
           a jaunty little kick in the air like the scarecrow, but it’s 
           actually an INVOLUNTARY LEG TIC.

           INT. ADULTCON CONVENTION - MOMENTS LATER

           FOLLOWING Marvin Sebastian, Jay and Annie in SLOW MOTION as a 
           MUSIC MASH-UP of PORN MUSIC AND IF YOU’RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW 
           IT PLAYS.

           They pass the lions, the jugglers, the strippers and the 
           Slixx Lube girl, who GIVES JAY THE FINGER.  They pass the 
           Circus Energy Drink Clowns, the Lap-Dance booth and the Pie-
           Eating Contest Booth.

           And on to The Wizard booth.  Marvin Sebastian pushes past the 
           vibrator display and through the curtains to the back. 

           INT. WIZARD AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s almost pitch black except for pinhole rays of light 
           coming through an oversized WIZARD VIBRATOR-SHAPED LAMP.  We 
           can barely make out the outline of THE WIZARD -- a small, 
           elderly man, sitting in what appears to be a tiny thrown.  He 
           has a long beard and very thick ROUND GLASSES.  Like an old, 
           blind, HARRY POTTER.  

           He wears a NECKLACE WITH A LONG CRYSTAL PENIS ON IT.

                                 THE WIZARD
                        Who are you?  What are you doing 
                        here?

           Jay steps forward, pulling Annie with him.  He now has the 
           facial tic, the shooting arm thing and the involuntary leg 
           tic.  He looks like a complete freak.

                                 JAY
                        We’re Jay and Annie Johnson, and 
                        we’re here to ask that you to 
                        change the rating of the Platinum 
                        video.  

                                 THE WIZARD
                        Who cares what you want?  

           Jay points a convulsing finger in The Wizard’s face.  

                                 JAY
                        You listen to me.  I’ve got a kid, 
                        a fragile kid, who’s about to go on 
                        stage and may or may not know how 
                        to tie his tie.  He needs me right 
                        now, and I made a promise that I’d 
                        be sitting in the front row.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Do you hear me, Mr. Penis Necklace?  
                        I made a promise.  I also made a 
                        promise to my wife.  On the day I 
                        married her, I promised to love and 
                        protect her and keep her safe from 
                        the leering eyes of millions of 
                        perverted freaks on the internet.  
                        Maybe that wasn’t said in so many 
                        words, but it was implied.  And I 
                        will keep that promise, to both of 
                        them, if it’s the last thing I 
                        do...    

           Jay’s arm shoots up towards the ceiling.  He pulls it back 
           down with the other hand so his finger is right back in The 
           Wizard’s face.

                                 THE WIZARD
                        That’s a very impressive speech.  
                        Too bad I can’t help you.

           Jay grabs the penis necklace tight around his neck.

                                 JAY
                        Change the rating, old man.

                                 THE WIZARD
                        It’s too late.  It’s already gone 
                        viral.  It’s bigger than viral.  
                        It’s celestial!  At midnight 
                        tonight, the world will watch the 
                        premiere.

           JAY’S POV -- EVERYTHING SPINS FASTER AND FASTER and all 
           sounds start to warble as Jay is seconds away from a full 
           body shut down.

                                    FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. CORVETTE - MOMENTS LATER

           OVER BLACK we hear VOICES.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Where’s the nearest hospital?

                                 MARVIN SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
                        I don’t know.  Type it into the 
                        GPS.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        I can’t figure that out.  This 
                        thing is like a fucking spaceship.
                  (then)
                        Jay?  Open your eyes, honey.
           Jay opens his eyes.  They are in the Corvette.  Annie is 
           driving, Jay is shotgun and Marvin Sebastian is folded up 
           like a contortionist in the back seat.

                                 JAY
                        What happened?

                                 ANNIE
                        You fainted.

                                 JAY
                        No, what happened to the tape.

                                 ANNIE
                        It doesn’t matter, baby.  We’re 
                        taking you to the hospital.

                                 JAY
                        We’re not going to the hospital.  
                        We’re going to Max’s school.

                                 ANNIE
                  (tearing up)
                        It’s okay.  He’ll understand.

                                 JAY
                        No he won’t.  And I won’t either.  
                        If I don’t make it, I’ll always be 
                        the dad who can’t keep a promise.    

           Annie looks at Jay.  That’s the man she fell in love with.  
           She GUNS IT.

                                        CUT TO:

           EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

           HEADS TURN as the Corvette SCREECHES into the packed parking 
           lot.  Jay and Annie jump out and RUN INTO THE SCHOOL...

           INT. SCHOOL YARD - SAME

           They run into the empty courtyard.

                                 ANNIE
                        It must be about to start.  Hurry!

           They run towards THE AUDITORIUM...

           INT. AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           The auditorium is PACKED with PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS.  It’s 
           standing-room only.  Annie tries to make her way down the 
           CROWDED AISLE but no one will move.
                                 ANNIE
                        Excuse us.  Sorry.  Pardon us...

           ON LINDA, waving from the front row with Lulu in her arms.  
           She’s saved them two seats.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  (to people in front)
                        I’m sorry.  We’re just trying to 
                        get to the front...

           ANGLE ON the stage, where Max peaks out from behind the 
           curtain and sees the two EMPTY SEATS.

                                 JAY
                        Max!  I’m right here, buddy! 

           Jay jumps up and waves his hands.  Max can’t see him because 
           of the big crowd.  JAY STEPS ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Max!  

                                 DAD IN CHAIR
                        Hey, watch it.

                                 JAY
                  (waving his arms)
                        Max!  I’m back here!

           But Max only sees the empty chairs.  With a sad face, he 
           disappears behind the curtain.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming, buddy!

           Jay takes Annie’s hand and PUSHES HIS WAY TO THE FRONT.

           INT. FRONT ROW - MOMENTS LATER

           CLIMBING AND TRIPPING OVER THE SEATED PARENTS, Annie and Jay 
           muscle their way to their saved FRONT ROW SEATS.

           Lulu reaches for Annie with a big, baby smile.  Linda looks 
           less enthused... 

                                 LINDA
                  (re Annie’s yoga-pants)
                        It’s Family Day.  You couldn’t have 
                        put in a little more effort?

                                 ANNIE
                        Mom, it’s a miracle we’re even 
                        here...

           Annie takes Lulu in her arms and kisses her all over.
                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Mommy missed you so much.

                                 JAY
                        And Daddy, too.  Yes, he did.  
                        Daddy loves you...

           They both kiss and nuzzle their baby.  Jay puts his arm 
           around both of them.  Clearly, they are happy to be back with 
           their family, where they belong.

                                 LINDA
                        Where have you guys been?  I’ve 
                        been trying to reach you all day.

                                 ANNIE
                        We have been...

                                 JAY
                        ...on a journey.

           Linda looks at them, not sure what this means. 

           ANGLE ON the stage, where Max peaks out from the curtain.  He 
           sees Jay and smiles.  And it’s a moment.  All is right with 
           the universe.  A father kept his promise to his son. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                  (waving, tearing up)
                        Hey, buddy!  I’m here.  Just like I 
                        promised.  I’m right here.

           Max waves back.  So happy.  So relieved.  He shows Jay his 
           tied tie.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Way to go, buddy.  You did it. 

           Max nods and then DISAPPEARS behind the curtain.  Jay turns 
           to Annie.  They both breathe a huge sigh of relief.

                                 ANNIE
                        Let’s just forget about everything 
                        else.  This is all that matters.  
                        Right here.  Right now...

           They kiss.  It’s a real kiss.  They’re as bonded as they’ve 
           ever been.

           ON Linda, noticing this change.

                                 MRS. PONTELL (O.S.)
                        Psssst!  Jay!  Annie!  Woo-hoo...

           They turn.  Standing in the aisle (20 seats away) is MRS. 
           PONTELL, Max’s TEACHER. 
                                 ANNIE
                        Hi, Mrs. Pontell!

           Mrs. Pontell says something, but we can’t hear her because of 
           the noise of the crowd.  

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        What?  We can’t hear you.

           ON Mrs. Pontell, trying to talk louder.

                                 MRS. PONTELL
                        Max brought this to school by 
                        accident!

           ON Jay and Annie.  They still can’t hear her.

                                 ANNIE
                        What???

           Mrs. Pontell holds up a VIDEO CAMERA and then gestures that 
           she is going to pass it down to them.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  (a beat, then)
                        Is that ours?

                                 JAY
                        Why would Mrs. Pontell have our 
                        video camera?

                                 ANNIE
                        I have no idea.

                                 JAY
                  (to himself)
                        Why would Mrs. Pontell have our 
                        video camera?

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Hey!  Dad!  Over here!

           Jay looks up.  Max waves to him from behind the curtain.  Jay 
           fakes a smile, as it all suddenly starts to make sense. 

                                 JAY
                  (then, realizing, but 
                   still fake smiling)
                        Oh, my God.  The Family Day video!  
                        Max had the camera the whole time.

                                 ANNIE
                        Why would he do that?

                                 JAY
                  (still fake-smiling)
                        I don’t know!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe he couldn’t get the tape out.  
                        Maybe the battery was dead...

           PUSH IN on the video camera as it gets passed from parent-to-
           parent on its way to them.  Each time it reaches a new hand, 
           WE SEE A NEW, SPLIT-SECOND FLASHBACK before it gets passed on

           FLASHBACK QUICK CUTS:

           ANNIE AND JAY BOUNCING THROUGH FRAME DOING A STANDING 69 IN 
           THE JUMPEROO.

           ANNIE BENT OVER THE FISHER-PRICE PLAYHOUSE AND JAY FUCKING 
           HER FROM BEHIND.

           JAY’S GROIN COVERED IN BROWNIE CRUMBS AND ANNIE LICKING THEM 
           OFF.

           ANNIE’S GROIN COVERED WITH A PIZZA SLICE AND JAY EATING IT.  

           THE TWO OF THEM, NAKED AND LAUGHING THEIR ASSES OFF WHILE 
           SITTING IN LULU’S CRIB. 

           END FLASHBACKS.

           PUSH IN on Annie and Jay, their faces full of fear. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Did we tape over his Family Day 
                        assignment?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.

                                 ANNIE
                        Did Mrs. Pontell see our sex tape?

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know.

                                 ANNIE
                        Does this mean we’re not on the 
                        internet?  

                                 JAY
                        I DON’T KNOW!

           Jay DIVES OVER FIVE PEOPLE TO GRAB THE VIDEO CAMERA.  

           Now back in his seat.  A deep breath.  He PUSHES EJECT.  

           NO TAPE.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God.

           And then the HOUSE LIGHTS GO DARK as the assembly begins. 
           OVER BLACKNESS, we hear Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                  (terrified)
                        Where’s the tape?

           A BEAM OF LIGHT APPEARS FROM THE PROJECTIONIST BOOTH TO THE 
           SCREEN ON STAGE.  And then.  They realize.  The tape is up in 
           the audio-visual booth.

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        Holy.  Fucking.  Shit!

                                 PARENTS
                        Shhhhhhhhh!

                                 LINDA
                        What’s wrong with you two.

           The 3RD GRADE CLASS lines up on stage.  MAX LOOKS TERRIFIED.  
           He keeps his eyes on Jay the whole time.

                                 ANNIE
                  (freaking out to Jay)
                        What are we going to do?!

                                 JAY
                        I can’t do anything.  I promised 
                        Max I’d stay here.  You have to do 
                        something.  

           Annie looks around.  PARENTS, CHILDREN AND GRANDPARENTS 
           EVERYWHERE.  She couldn’t get out if she tried.

           Mrs. Pontell takes center stage.

                                 MRS. PONTELL
                        Welcome to Family Day!  A 
                        celebration of families around the 
                        world and right here at home.  Our 
                        3rd Grade family would like to 
                        start the festivities with a video 
                        presentation of their family trees.

           LUCY, the first girl on the left, walks to the microphone.  
           (MAX IS THIRD FROM THE LEFT.) 

                                 LUCY
                        My name is Lucy Yu and I have three 
                        people in my immediate family... 

           ON Annie (with Lulu still in her arms.)

                                 ANNIE
                  (whispering angrily)
                        Everyone is going to see our sex 
                        tape!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Three hundred and eighty-five 
                        people are going to see you don’t 
                        have a porn-penis.  Is that what 
                        you want?

                                 JAY
                  (whispering angrily back)
                        I’m not moving.

           SHUSHES ALL AROUND.

                                 ANNIE
                        Take the baby.

           She hands Lulu to Jay.  Lulu immediately STARTS TO CRY.  
           Annie climbs over Jay’s lap but the LAP-DANCE PANTS MAKE HER 
           SLIDE DOWN TO THE FLOOR WITH A THUD.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Mother fucker!

           MORE ANGRY SHUSHING.

           EXT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie finds the nearest staircase and RUNS UPSTAIRS.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

           ON the screen, there is now an ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN.

                                 ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN
                        Lucy is my great-granddaughter.  
                        She was such a good baby.  She 
                        never even cried...

           ON Lulu, in Jay’s arms, STILL CRYING. 

                                 JAY
                        Shhh-shhh-shhhh-shhhh...

           He puts her on his lap and she immediately SLIDES TO THE 
           FLOOR WITH A THUD.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my God!

           INT. 2ND FLOOR - SAME

           Annie races down the hallway towards the projection booth.  
           She opens the door but it’s THE JANITOR’S CLOSET.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, shit.
           She opens the next door.  It’s the MECHANICAL ROOM.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        SHIT!

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

           Lulu is still CRYING.  Linda takes her from Jay.

           ON stage, the next BOY goes to the microphone.  MAX IS NEXT.  
           Jay turns back to look up at the booth. 

                                 JAY
                        Come on, come on, come on...

           He grabs his CELL PHONE.

           INT. 2ND FLOOR - SAME

           Frantic, Annie OPENS EVERY DOOR ON THE SECOND FLOOR.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Where the hell is it?!

           Her PHONE BUZZES.  She picks it up.

           SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN ANNIE AND JAY, WHILE THEY TALK. 

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  (freaking out)
                        I can’t find the booth!

                                 JAY
                        It’s on the mezzanine!

           Behind Jay, PARENTS SHUSH.  Someone throws a a crumpled 
           program at his head.

                                 ANNIE
                        The mezzanine?  Where the hell is 
                        that?

           INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie RUNS DOWN THE STAIRS, looking for the door.

                                 ANNIE
                        Mezzanine, mezzanine, where are you 
                        mezza--

           She’s now back on the first floor.  No mezzanine.
                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        FUUUUUUUCK!

           Her “FUCK” echo’s through the stairwell...

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

           ...and into the auditorium.  HEADS TURN towards the back.  

           Hearing Annie’s voice makes Lulu STARTS TO CRY AGAIN.

           INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Annie RUNS to the SECURITY GUARD.

                                 ANNIE
                        Where’s the mezzanine?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        What’s that?

                                 ANNIE
                        Ahhhhhhh!

           Annie sees a DIFFERENT STAIRCASE on the other side.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

           It is now Max’s turn.  He walks slowly towards the 
           microphone, keeping his eyes glued to Jay the whole time.  

           Hard to say who looks more terrified, Max or Jay.

           INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL - SAME

           Annie BANGS ON the door until a NERDY PROJECTIONIST opens it.

                                 ANNIE
                  (out of breath)
                        Stop the tape.

                                 PROJECTIONIST
                        What?

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s an emergency...

           The projectionist looks through his window to the auditorium.  

           ON ANNIE as she sees that MAX IS NOW ON STAGE.  She LUNGES 
           FOR THE MACHINE.
                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                  (a crazy person)
                        Stop the fucking tape!

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

           DEAD SILENCE in the auditorium.  Max is frozen at the mic.   
           He clears his throat.  Looks at Jay for support.

           But Jay is not looking at him.  Jay is looking towards the 
           projectionist booth where we see ANNIE ON THE PROJECTIONIST’S 
           BACK.  They are spinning in circles, WWF-style.  

           ON Linda, watching this, too.  

           INT. PROJECTIONIST BOOTH - SAME

           Annie and the projectionist CRASH INTO A WALL.

                                 PROJECTIONIST
                        Get off me, you crazy yoga bitch!

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, Annie sees Max is about to start.

                                 ANNIE
                        No!  NO!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!

           SLOW MOTION AS she throws herself at the machine with FINGER 
           OUTSTRETCHED.  Just as her finger is about to touch the stop 
           button, she gets pulled back.

           ON ANNIE’S FACE as she is thrown out of the booth.

           The DOOR SLAMS.  AND LOCKS.  ANNIE BANGS ON THE DOOR.  

           A SLOW MOTION MOS MONTAGE BEGINS

           ON Max beginning his presentation.   

           ON Jay with his head in his hands. 

           ON Annie charging the projectionist booth using a FIRE 
           EXTINGUISHER as a battering ram.  The door stays put, but 
           Annie falls back, losing her grip on the extinguisher.  It 
           flips dramatically into the air.  Like a ROCKY SEQUENCE we 
           see her fall to the ground with sweat bouncing off her face.  
           Then, a moment later, the blunt end of the fire extinguisher 
           comes down on top of her, hitting her RIGHT ON HER EYE.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME

           MAX’S POV -- with stage lights blinding him and HEART 
           POUNDING, he finally begins.
           The BEAM OF LIGHT from the projection booth starts to FLICKER 
           as the VIDEO IMAGES BEGIN.

                                 MAX
                        Family trees are important because 
                        in order to understand ourselves--

           SFX a FIRE ALARM.  It’s DEAFENING.  Terrified, Max runs off 
           the stage. 

           INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL - SAME

           The FIRE ALARM BLARES.  The projectionist runs out of the 
           booth, passing Annie, still lying on the ground. 

                                 PROJECTIONIST
                        You’re crazy!

           He EXITS to the stairwell.  A beat, and then Annie stands, 
           like a fighter after a punch and stumbles into the booth. 

           EXT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           FIRE TRUCKS PULL UP WITH SIRENS BLARING.

           CHAOS as classes line up and parents look for their children.

           FOLLOWING ANNIE as she approaches her family.  Frankie has 
           her fingers in her ears, while Max’s face is buried in Jay’s 
           stomach.  Clearly, he’s crying.  

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t be sad.  You did great.

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t get to do any of my 
                        presentation.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What happened to your eye.

           REVERSE TO Annie’s eye.  It’s black and blue.

                                 ANNIE
                        Nothing.  Just had a little 
                        accident with a fire extinguisher.

                                 MAX
                        You put the fire out?  Cool.

                                 JAY
                        See?  Mommy’s a hero.  She saved 
                        the day.
                  (then, sotto)
                        You sure did.  Nice work. 
                                 ANNIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JAY
                        What do you mean, what do I mean?  
                        The fire alarm.

                                 ANNIE
                        I didn’t do it.  I thought you did 
                        it.

                                 JAY
                        I didn’t do it.  Who did it?

           Linda smiles.  

                                 LINDA
                        Okay, everyone.  It’s time to go.  
                        It’s been a long day.

           Annie and Jay look at Linda.  WTF?

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Walking to the parking lot.  Jay and Annie fall behind to 
           talk to Linda.

                                 ANNIE
                        Did you pull it?

                                 LINDA
                        Clearly you wanted that assembly to 
                        end.  And I’m not an idiot.  I can 
                        put two and two together.  You had 
                        a crazy night due to some magic 
                        brownies and pent-up lust.  You 
                        made a sex tape, you lost your sex 
                        tape and Max accidentally took it 
                        and almost premiered it to the 
                        entire student body and their 
                        extended families.

           Jay and Annie look at each other.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah.  I guess that pretty much 
                        sums it up.

                                 LINDA
                        You can’t just lose stuff like 
                        that.

                                 ANNIE
                  (holding up the tape)
                        Well, I’ve got it now so...
                                 LINDA
                        Good.  You need to be a little more 
                        responsible.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t worry.
                  (then)
                        That said, we can’t fit any of the 
                        kids in Jay’s new Corvette.  Can 
                        you drive them home?

                                 LINDA
                        What?

           ANGLE ON the shiny Corvette.  Max’s jaw drops.

                                 MAX
                        Awesome.

           INT. CORVETTE - LATER

           Jay drives his sweet new ride.  Annie is beside him.

                                 ANNIE
                        I just want to get home, forget 
                        everything that happened, get into 
                        a warm bath and go to bed.

                                 JAY
                        We can’t forget to burn the sex 
                        tape.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t worry.

           ANGLE ON Mr. Nelson sitting on the stoop with BOXES OF FISHER-
           PRICE LOOT.

                                 JAY
                        Why is the CEO of Fisher-Price 
                        sitting on our doorstep?

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, my God!  

           INT. ANNIE AND JAY’S HOUSE - LATER

           The walls in the kitchen are half-up, so you can see straight 
           through from the living room to the kitchen.

           In the living room we see Jay, Mr. Nelson and the kids  
           playing FISHER-PRICE GARAGE BAND.  Each plays an instrument 
           and sings into a microphone, and it’s all hooked up to a 
           FISHER-PRICE MEDIA CENTER.
                                 JAY
                  (singing)
                        If you’re happy and you know it 
                        clap your hands...

                                 MR. NELSON
                        If you’re happy and you know it 
                        clap you’re hands...

                                 ALL
                        If you’re happy and you know it and 
                        you really want to show it, if 
                        you’re happy and you know it, clap 
                        your hands.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           They are now all eating pizza in the kitchen.  It is chaotic 
           but familial.  

                                 MR. NELSON
                  (re broken wall)
                        I’m going to have to call quality 
                        control about that Bounceroo 
                        because this should not happen...

           Annie and Jay share a little smile.

                                 MR. NELSON (CONT’D)
                  (to Lulu in highchair)
                        You’re lucky you didn’t get hurt.  
                        Yes, you are.  Yes, you are.  You 
                        like to bounce, don’t you.  Yes, 
                        you do...

           Lulu smiles and claps her hands.  Mr. Nelson does the same.

                                 MR. NELSON (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for letting me invite myself 
                        over to dinner.  This is very 
                        special.  You have a wonderful 
                        family, and it’s clear that you 
                        draw your inspiration from them.

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s true.  I’m the luckiest person 
                        in the world.  I know that now.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I’d like to propose a toast.  To 
                        you, Annie, and to your beautiful 
                        family.  Welcome to the Fisher-
                        Price family.

           Everyone clinks glasses.  The only one at the table who 
           doesn’t look happy is Max.
                                 MAX
                        Can I be excused?

           Without waiting for an answer, he EXITS.  Jay stands.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ANNIE
                        He didn’t get to do his 
                        presentation because of the fire 
                        alarm.  He’s just a little sad.
                  (then)
                        I’ll go talk to him.

           Mr. Nelson stands. 

                                 MR. NELSON
                        Do you mind if I go?

           INT. MAX’S ROOM - SAME

           Max is now sitting up in bed, listening intently to Mr. 
           Nelson’s story.

                                 MR. NELSON
                        So there I was, on a boat, in 
                        China, with a translator, giving 
                        the biggest speech of my life.  And 
                        you know what happened?  

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 MR. NELSON
                        The ship started to sink.  Alarms 
                        go off.  People are running.  And 
                        you think that translator stuck 
                        around to tell me what everyone was 
                        saying?  No.  He ran to the nearest 
                        lifeboat and jumped on it.

                                 MAX
                        Wow.  Cool.  How did you survive?

                                 MR. NELSON
                        I got on a lifeboat and finished my 
                        speech to the people on board.  
                        They loved it.  That’s what you 
                        should do, too.  Get in the 
                        lifeboat and go tell your story.
                  (then)
                        Come on.  I’ll help you.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ON Annie’s open purse sitting by the front door.  Max reaches 
           in and grabs the VIDEO CAMERA AND THE TAPE.

                                 MAX
                  (to Mr. Nelson)
                        I’ve got it.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay is at the sink doing dishes.  Annie come up behind him 
           hiding something behind her back.

                                 ANNIE
                        Turn around and close your eyes.

                                 JAY
                        What.

                                 ANNIE
                        Just do it.  And open your mouth, 
                        too.

           As soon as he turns, Annie sprays whipped-cream all over his 
           face.  They both start laughing.  Annie takes a big lick 
           around his lips.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t wait to see your winning 
                        moves later.

           Jay grabs the whipped-cream and sprays it all over her.  It’s 
           cute and sexy and they‘re now cracking up and holding each 
           other and looking at each other like they used to look at 
           each other.  

           Jay wipes the whipped-cream from her face.  And then gives 
           her a kiss.  It’s a real moment.

                                 JAY
                        Congratulations, baby.

                                 ANNIE
                        It’s both of us.  I couldn’t do it 
                        without you.  You’re my...my air.

                                 JAY
                        What does that mean?  I don’t know 
                        if I like that.

                                 ANNIE
                        It means you’re the most elemental 
                        thing in my life.  I could never 
                        live without you.  Not even for a 
                        minute.
           Jay smiles.  Now it makes sense.

                                 JAY
                        I knew that.

                                 ANNIE
                        I think everything is about to 
                        change for us.

                                 JAY
                  (a beat)
                        I think everything already has.

           Annie tears up.  It’s true.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I knew I wanted to marry you the 
                        minute I saw you.  And everything 
                        that’s happened makes me realize 
                        that we got married for all the 
                        right reasons, but stayed married 
                        for even better ones.
                  (then)
                        We were just in a little rut.  
                        Sometimes life just gets in the 
                        way.

                                 ANNIE
                        There’s no one I’d rather be in a 
                        rut with than you.  

           And then they kiss.  A real movie-ending kiss...

                                 MR. NELSON (O.S.)
                  (clearing his throat)
                        Excuse me.

           Mr. Nelson stands in the doorway.  Annie and Jay turn, 
           embarrassed.    

                                 MR. NELSON (CONT’D)
                        Your presence is requested in the 
                        lifeboat.
                  (then)
                        By the way, where I come from a 
                        handshake means we’re making a 
                        deal.  A hug means we’re in 
                        business together.

           He holds out his arms to Annie.  Annie smiles.

                                 MR. NELSON (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations.

           They hug.  Jay stands to the side, beaming.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Max stands in front of a FISHER-PRICE KAROKE MIC with the 
           FISHER-PRICE VIDEO SCREEN behind him.  Mr. Nelson is beside 
           him, working the video camera.

           Annie and Jay join the rest of the family on the couch.  Jay 
           sits down first and Annie sits on his lap, IMMEDIATELY 
           SLIDING TO THE GROUND BECAUSE OF THE LAP-DANCE PANTS.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, man!

                                 JAY
                        Oops.  Sorry.

           They immediately start laughing.

                                 MAX
                  (to Jay and Annie)
                        Are you ready?

                                 JAY/ANNIE
                        Sorry.  Yes!  We’re ready.

           Max smiles and begins.

                                 MAX
                        Family trees are important because 
                        in order to understand ourselves, 
                        we need to understand where we come 
                        from.  I come from Jay and Annie 
                        Johnson, who are the best parents 
                        in the world...

           ON Annie and Jay as they beam with pride.

           Max nods to Mr. Nelson to start the VIDEO CAMERA.  Mr. Nelson 
           PUSHES PLAY.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Are you ready to be entered, zero-
                        gravity-style?

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        Give it to me, baby.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Let’s Jumperoo this bitch...

           ON Mr. Nelson as he hears this.

           ON Jay and Annie as they realize that THIS IS THE TAPE.

           ON the VIDEO SCREEN: we see JAY AND ANNIE IN THE BOUNCY 
           SWING, JUMPING OFF THE HIGHEST KITCHEN CABINETS.  THEIR 
           NUDITY IS DISGUISED BY THE SHEER VELOCITY OF THE JUMP.
                                 ANNIE/JAY
                        Kowabunga!!!!!!!

           THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND THEN, FOR THE LAST TIME, ALL OF THE 
           POWER IN THE HOUSE GOES DOWN. 

           UNDER BLACKNESS:

                                 ANNIE
                        You didn’t fix the fuse box!  I 
                        knew you didn’t fix it!  I knew it!  
                        I love you so much for not fixing 
                        it! 

           She grabs him and kisses him.  They are lit only by the faint 
           glow of the moon outside, but we can see their love bright as 
           the sun.

           INT. JAY AND ANNIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The room is pitch dark.  Annie and Jay are in bed.

                                 JAY
                        Can’t sleep?

                                 ANNIE
                        No.  Can you?

                                 JAY
                        Not really.
                  (then)
                        Do you want to?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah.  Kind of.  Do you?

                                 JAY
                        Hell yeah.  Let’s do it.

           Jay grabs a flashlight and we follow them out of the room.

           INT. ANNIE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s dark in the office.

                                 JAY
                        Come on.  Hurry up.

           Finally, Annie finds her laptop and opens it.  Their faces 
           now lit by the screen as it  powers up.

                                 ANNIE
                        You know it could still be us on 
                        this video.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        That projectionist at school was a 
                        real creep.  He could have made a 
                        copy...

                                 JAY
                        It’s not gonna be us.  But it’s 
                        gonnna someone.  And I can’t wait 
                        to see what the big deal was...

           PUSH IN on the computer as Jay types in the address...

                                       SMASH TO:

           INT. VLADIMIR’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Vladimir and Marina log on at the same time. 

                                       SMASH TO:

           INT. ROBBIE’S HOUSE - SAME

           Robbie logs on too.

                                       SMASH TO:

           INT. MARVIN SEBASTIAN’S HOUSE - SAME

           Marvin Sebastian (in Lap-Dance Pants PJs) and Dusty log, too. 

                                       SMASH TO:

           INT. ANNIE’S OFFICE - SAME

           CLOSE ON the computer.  We see the web address, 
           www.platinumporn.com.  Jay pushes ENTER.  And then:

           The Platinum Porn page comes up and the video begins.  We’re 
           not sure where we are.  But we’re not in Kansas anymore.  An 
           ESKIMO COUPLE ENTERS FRAME.  

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Holy shit.  Is that an igloo?

           The Eskimo man gently kisses his Eskimo bride.  He slowly 
           undresses her, first taking off her heavy pelt-coat and then 
           her softer under-garments, made of rabbit fur.  He is loving 
           and very tender.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        He really loves her.  That’s sweet.
           He removes the last little hide, which covers her privates.  
           And then... 

           REVERSE TO Jay and Annie.  In unison, their jaws drop.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Now that is a beaver.

                                 JAY
                        Marvin could get into that.
                  (and then)
                        Whoa, look at them go...

           BACK ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN, the Eskimos go at it National 
           Geographic style.  It is pure and primal.  As they fall onto 
           the bear skin rug, the man reaches for The Joy of Sex.

                                 JAY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What are the odds...

           And then, the Eskimo hooks up his homemade sex swing.  It’s a 
           caribou hide seat and animal sinew cords.  He gently puts her 
           in the seat, and then they assume a position that looks 
           almost impossible, with her Eskimo legs bent back behind her 
           Eskimo head.  And then they begin to swing.  And the Eskimo 
           bride reaches nirvana.

                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        So that’s how you do the Viennese 
                        Oyster.

           The Eskimos swing in and out of frame like a pendulum.  Each 
           time, their faces twisted in a new expression of primal 
           ecstacy.

           Back and forth and back and forth....

                                     FADE TO BLACK

                                 THE END
