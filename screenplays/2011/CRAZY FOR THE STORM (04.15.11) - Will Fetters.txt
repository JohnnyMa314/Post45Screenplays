                                FEBRUARY 18th 1979
           EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP -- DAY

           7,000 feet. Haloed by swirling grey clouds. 

           No signs of life up here save for the EVERGREEN TREES 
           growing at forty degree angles. It’s deadly quiet. 

           Find an ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY by himself staring down a 
           steep BACK-COUNTRY SLOPE spotted with rocks and trees. 

           The boy has a shock of sun-bleached blonde hair jutting 
           out from under his wool cap. We stay tight on his wind-
           bitten face, bright blue eyes. This is NORMAN OLLESTAD.

           Norman studies the icy slope. Just lost in his thoughts. 
           All we hear is his steady breathing, the wind. 

           He appears to be all alone on this frozen mountain top.

                                 STARTER O/S
                        Ollestad...

           Norman turns and finds an impatient-looking MAN wearing a 
           vintage 70’s two-way radio headset, holding a clipboard.

                                 STARTER
                        You’re up.

           Reveal that Norman is adorned head-to-toe in SKI RACING 
           GEAR - sharpened alpine skis, helmet, aluminum poles in 
           hand. He has a red number pinned to his chest. 

           Norman and The Starter cross from the undeveloped side of 
           the mountain to the developed side. They pass by an 
           operating CHAIRLIFT and approach a STARTING GATE. 

           Norman glides onto the launch ramp. Stops behind a spring-
           loaded PLASTIC WAND. Stares down a double black diamond 
           SLALOM RUN. The impossibly steep slope is marked with red 
           and blue wooden gates, slicked with ugly yellow ICE.  

           Norman studies the run like a chess master reading a 
           board. A calm washes over as he places his pole tips over 
           The Wand. He crouches down and waits. A coiled spring.

                                 STARTER
                        Racer ready.

           Every muscle in Norman’s body tenses. 3... 2... 1... 

           Norman explodes out of the gate, drops into a racer’s 
           crouch. In five seconds he’s up to fifty miles per hour.  

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He attacks the icy course. No fear. Perfect form. He 
           brushes the slalom gates within inches. Carves up the 
           mountainside like a surgeon wielding a scalpel. This kid 
           is one Hell of a skier. 

           Norman approaches the final gate - set on a treacherous 
           turn. He hits the gate too hard. His knee drives up into 
           his nose. He nearly wipes out but manages to stay up. 

           His NOSE STARTS TO BLEED. He ignores it. Drops into a 
           racer’s crouch for the final hundred yards. 

           He crosses the finish line which is laid under a BANNER 
           that reads: “1979 SoCal Ski Championships” 

           Norman skids to a stop, sprays snow into THE CROWD OF 
           SPECTATORS - Parents, Coaches, Fellow Racers, etc.  
           Before he’s even come to a full stop, his eyes find the 
           STANDINGS BOARD. After a few seconds his time is posted: 

           “N. Ollestad -- ‘45.10’ -- FIRST PLACE”

           The crowd cheers. Norman just stands there catching his 
           breath, his nose bleed dripping onto his coat. He stares 
           at his time like there must be some kind of mistake.

           We find a MAN climbing over the crowd barrier, ignoring 
           the flustered RACE OFFICIAL telling him not to. The Man 
           is handsome, bright eyes, out-of-control hair. This is 
           Norman’s father. This is “BIG” NORM OLLESTAD. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Ladies and Gentleman, we have just 
                        witnessed perfection personified. 
                        Boy Wonder, came, he saw, he... 
                               (sees the blood)
                        Might have broken his nose. Shit. 
                        OK. Head back. Try not to bleed on 
                        anything your mom has to wash.

           Big Norm gives him a handkerchief. Guides it to his nose. 
           Norman still staring at his time in disbelief.

                                 NORMAN
                        I won?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Well all the other kids seem 
                        pretty pissed off and bummed out, 
                        so if you didn’t, somebody better 
                        tell them.

           Norman smiles through the bloody handkerchief.
           EXT. LODGE -- LATER

           Norman comes out of the locker room still wearing his 
           snow pants, carrying his ski racing gear. He comes upon 
           his father arguing with a flustered RACE OFFICIAL. 

                                 RACE OFFICIAL
                        ...he’s welcome to take the trophy 
                        today. Or we can mail it. That’s 
                        the best I can do. I am sorry.  

           The Race Official walks off. Big Norm turns to Norman. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        They're doing a co-ed awards 
                        ceremony. The girls don't race 
                        'til tomorrow and we got that 
                        reunion thing at your mom's, so...

                                 NORMAN
                        I don’t care about the ceremony. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Of course. You get a trophy. All I 
                        get is the look on your face when 
                        they hand it to you. All the 
                        training and whining, all I get is 
                        that look and that’s all I need. 

                                 NORMAN
                        We can’t skip the reunion. Mom 
                        will freak. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’ll figure something out...

           Big Norm smiles reassuringly. Norman looks around.

                                 NORMAN
                        Where’s Sandra?

           Big Norm’s smile fades.

           INT. LODGE -- LATER

           SANDRA CRESSMAN, 29, petite and beautiful, is at the bar 
           drinking a martini and chatting with a handsome SKI BUM. 

                                 SANDRA
                        ...I’m a Malibu Girl. I don’t do 
                        snow. Or ice. Or any activities 
                        that involve snow or ice.

           CONTINUED:

           Big Norm and Norman walk in. They see Sandra at the bar. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Wait here, kiddo. 

           Big Norm sits beside Sandra. She sees him and smiles a 
           glassy smile.  

                                 BIG NORM
                        We got Jan’s party...

                                 SANDRA
                        “Jan” is his ex-wife. My boyfriend 
                        takes me to his ex-wife's parties. 
                        Is that weird? It's kind of weird. 
                        Right?

           The guy looks like a deer in headlights. Norm sees this.

                                 BIG NORM
                        It’s OK. She’s not talking to you.

           He signals the BARTENDER for Sandra’s check. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Isn’t there a big to-do where they 
                        give him a ribbon or something?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Tomorrow...

           He looks at her. She knows that look. 

                                 SANDRA
                        No. Absolutely not. No way. I’m 
                        not driving all the way back up 
                        here just to watch your kid get a 
                        ribbon. I won’t do it. 

           Norman pays her check. Stands to go. Sandra doesn’t move.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Who said anything about driving?

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Norman loads his ski gear into the rack on top of his 
           father’s ghost white ‘65 PORSCHE. Sandra climbs into the 
           backseat without a word. 

           Big Norm starts the engine. Pops in Willie Nelson’s “Red 
           Headed Stranger” album on 8-track. 
           EXT. BIG BEAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Willie sings over the two-hour car ride from the frozen 
           snow-capped peaks of the San Bernardino Mountains to the 
           sunshine, surf and sand of:

           EXT. MALIBU -- SUNSET

           The Porsche drives up the PCH. Jackets off. Sunglasses 
           on. If not for the salt stains on the wheel wells, we 
           might think they were on their way back from the beach.   

           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- EVENING

           A sleepy, conservative sub-division built into the hills 
           of Malibu. Suburbia by way of SoCal. 

           The Porsche stops in-front of a 1940’s CRAFTSMAN HOME. 
           Vintage CARS and TRUCKS are parked out-front, mostly off-
           road vehicles. Every one of them has a surf/ski rack. 

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- EVENING

           Where a traditional suburban BBQ is underway, though the 
           GUESTS don’t look like traditional suburbanites. 

           It’s all SURFERS and BEACH BUMS, none of whom seem quite 
           sure how to act at something like this.     

           JANICE ARCHER, Norman’s mother, 40 and still a stunner, 
           is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. She’s not a 
           natural housewife, but doing her best to play the part.  

           Norm, Sandra and Norman walk in. Norman is still wearing 
           his snow pants. His cheeks windburned. Quite the sight in 
           a party full of sandals, shorts and sundresses. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Your attention please... 

           The house quiets down. Everyone turns and looks at them. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Just wanted to let you know that 
                        you are in the presence of the 
                        1979 Southern California Boys 12 
                        and Under Slalom Ski Champion...  
                               (off applause)
                        He'll be available for autographs 
                        and pictures all night.

                                       BIG NORM (CONT'D)
                        Anyone interested in arranging a 
                        personal appearance, see me or his 
                        mother. There is a nominal fee.

           More applause. Norman blushes as his father raises his 
           arm. Laughter and smiles now. The buzz of conversation. 
           Life has been breathed into the party. 

           Norman follows his father and Sandra into the kitchen. 
           They come upon Janice refilling chips and salsa.

                                 JANICE
                        You’re late...

                                 BIG NORM
                        But not as late as you thought 
                        we'd be. Right? Be honest.

           Janice smiles in spite of herself. Turns to Sandra.

                                 JANICE
                        I’m so glad you could make it. 
                        Really. How are you?

                                 SANDRA
                        Great. Do you have vodka?

                                 JANICE
                        Yeah. Sure. The bar is outback.

           Sandra walks out without another word. Janice looks to 
           Norm, who shakes his head -- “don’t ask”.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Seriously, Jan, you learn you're 
                        the mother of a champion ski racer 
                        and the first thing you do is 
                        needle him about his punctuality? 

           The guys share smartass smiles.

                                 JANICE
                        So who wants to tell me how The 
                        Champ got blood all over his brand 
                        new snow pants? 

           Those smartass smiles disappear. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Would it be better or worse if we 
                        said it wasn't his?

           Janice walks over and kisses Norman on top of his head.

                        Go change. I’m so proud. I wasn’t 
                        needling you, I was needling your 
                        father.

           EXT. ARCHER HOME -- EVENING

           RICK ARCHER, Norman’s stepfather, 40, broad and handsome, 
           is manning the grill out back. He flips burgers while 
           talking at a couple of HIPPIE types. 

                                 RICK
                        ...we can't let these sons of 
                        bitches get The White House back. 
                        Carter isn't perfect, but there 
                        are worse things than inflation.
                               (pops open a beer)
                        Reagan? Just Nixon with better 
                        hair and fewer brain cells. All 
                        these guys are the same. 
                        Republicans don't care about 
                        people. They care about power.

           Big Norm walks out carrying a plate of VEGGIE BURGERS.

                                 RICK
                        Norm can tell you. He saw how 
                        these bastards operate first hand 
                        in Hoover’s F.B.I. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Well. Hoover’s problem wasn’t so 
                        much that he was a Republican...

                                 RICK
                        Right. He was also a closet queer.

           The Hippies laugh. Big Norm doesn’t.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Mostly he was a close-minded, 
                        paranoid ideologue who judged 
                        people, solely by how they looked 
                        and the company they kept.

           Rick’s smirk fades to a scowl. Big Norm smiles 
           congenially as he nods to the blackening burgers. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Think those are about done.
           EXT. ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT

           A big BONFIRE burns in a newly-dug FIRE PIT. Everyone is 
           drinking, laughing, talking. 

           Big Norm pops in his Willie Nelson 8-track. Cranks it up. 
           He dances his way around the yard. A few WOMEN join him. 

           Norman eats an overcooked burger while watching his 
           father dance. He notices Sandra sitting off by herself, 
           sipping a martini out of a water glass. 

           Norman tosses the burger. Walks over and sits beside her. 

                                 SANDRA
                        How much for an autograph?

                                 NORMAN
                        Been charging ten. But, for you, I 
                        can go as low as five.

           He smiles. She manages a weak one in return. They watch 
           as Big Norm single-handedly starts a dance party around 
           the bonfire by sheer charisma and force of personality. 

           He even manages to pull a reluctant Janice out of her 
           chair and into the fray. Sandra’s weak smile fades. 

                                 SANDRA
                        It must be hard. Being his kid...

           This lands with Norman but he shrugs it off. 

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m gonna grab a soda. Want one?

           Sandra shakes her head as she lights a cigarette. 

           Norman walks over to the cooler on the other side of the 
           porch. He fishes a coke out of the ice bath. 

           Rick walks up. He fishes out a Budweiser. Pops it open.   

                                 RICK
                        I was at USC today. Just catching 
                        up with Coach. He's doin’ a camp 
                        next month. Said he'd hold a spot 
                        for you. If you’re interested...

           Norman’s sudden nervousness isn’t lost on us.

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad and me were talking about 
                        spending more time on the slopes. 
                        To try to build off today... 

                                 RICK
                               (condescending smile)
                        Suit yourself. But you got talent. 
                        Put the work in now and you could 
                        land a full ride. Don't get me 
                        wrong, I love skiing as much as 
                        the next guy, but it's a hobby...
                               (beat)
                        There’s a future in football. 

           As Norman ponders this, the iconic opening guitar rift of 
           “Blue Eyes Cryin’ In The Rain” begins. COUPLES pair up 
           around the yard. Sway slowly together. Sing along. 

           Big Norm looks to Sandra. She shakes her head. 

           Janice looks to Rick. He shakes his head. 

           Big Norm and Janice exchange a nostalgic smile and shrug. 

           He holds out his hand. She takes it. They dance together 
           around the fire. He sings along louder than anyone else. 

           Norman watches his parents dancing with a smile. 

           His smile fades when he notices Sandra abruptly getting 
           up and walking into the house. The door slams.

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sandra is refilling her martini. She’s drunk. 

           Janice walks in just as she drops her GLASS. It shatters 
           all over the kitchen floor. Sandra bends down to pick up 
           the pieces and almost falls over. Janice hurries to help.

                                 JANICE
                        It’s OK. I got it.  

           Sandra balances herself against the counter. Watches 
           Janice carefully picking up the shards of glass. 

                                 SANDRA
                        What’s the secret, Jan? Girl to 
                        girl. How do I get him to look at 
                        me the way he looks at you?

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Janice stops cleaning. She looks up at Sandra who has 
           tears in her eyes.

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s the ‘mother of his child’ 
                        thing. Isn’t it?  

           Janice has no idea what to say. Big Norm and Norman walk 
           in as Sandra hastily wipes away a tear.  

                                 BIG NORM
                        Everything alight?

                                 SANDRA
                        No. It’s not. It hasn’t been for 
                        awhile but apparently I’m the only 
                        one who’s noticed... 
                               (realizes)
                        Sorry. That’s not fair. You do 
                        notice. You just pretend not to. 

           He tries to take her hand. She pulls away. He sighs.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’m not doing this here.

                                 SANDRA
                        OK. When? Tomorrow? Next weekend? 
                        Tell you what, you let me know 
                        when’s a good time for you to talk 
                        about how completely fucked our 
                        relationship is and I'll show up. 
                               (off his silence)
                        Say something. Talk to me. Please. 

           She looks at him with tearful, pleading eyes.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I said I’m not doing this h...

           Sandra slaps him. Hard. Norman flinches at the sound.   

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- LATE NIGHT

           The bonfire is down to coals. The guests are all gone. We 
           find Rick out back collecting beer cans and paper plates. 

           Norman is looking out the front window at Sandra sitting 
           in the ‘65 Porsche. She’s smoking a cigarette. The ember 
           illuminates her face. The tears are gone. She looks numb. 

           Janice and Big Norm are talking quietly in the doorway. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)

                        ...still gotta talk to a few 
                        people but, at this point, it'll 
                        just be easier to get a plane. 

                                 JANICE
                               (incredulous smile)
                        Of course. Just "get a plane". 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’m sorry about Sandra.

                                 JANICE
                               (smile fades)
                        I’m sorry for Sandra. That girl is 
                        head over heels in love with you. 
                        And you’re... well, you’re you. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Haven’t been married for awhile, 
                        Jan, I’m a little rusty on the 
                        passive-aggressive double talk. 

                                 JANICE
                        You’re a good guy, but you’re a 
                        pain-in-the-ass to be in love 
                        with. You never let anyone all the 
                        way in. It’s exhausting. What 
                        you’re doing to her isn’t fair... 

           This lands with him. He follows Janice’s eyes to Sandra.

                                 JANICE
                        Let her in. Or let her go.

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT -- SUNRISE

           A small municipal airstrip tucked amidst beach houses. 

           PILOT ROB ARNOLD is doing final pre-flight inspections on 
           his four-seat, single-engine CESSNA 172 AIRPLANE. Big 
           Norm accompanies him as he checks gauges, propellers. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        ...heard on the drive over there’s 
                        a system moving into Big Bear. 
                        Anything we need to worry about?

                                 ROB
                        Won’t be able to do much 
                        sightseeing but it should be a 
                        pretty smooth ride.

           Sandra sits on the hood of The Porsche, flipping through 
           a beauty magazine. She’s dressed fashionably. 

           A wood-paneled STATION WAGON pulls in. Janice is driving. 
           Norman is the only passenger. He’s dressed in a thin ski 
           sweater, jeans, and a pair of Vans tennis shoes.  

                                 JANICE
                        Aren’t you gonna be cold?

           He looks at her the way kids look at overprotective moms.

                        What? I’m asking. I can’t ask?

           INT. CESSNA 172 -- LATER

           Pilot Rob guides the little plane out onto the runway. 

           Norman is up-front. Sandra and Big Norm are in-back. 
           Everyone is wearing noise-reduction headphones. 

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT -- LATER

           Janice watches and waves from the parking lot as the 
           Cessna 172 takes off and banks east over Venice Beach.

           INT. CESSNA 172 (AIRBORNE) -- LATER

           The sky is blue and the flight is smooth.

           Over the ever-present buzz of the plane’s propellers, 
           Norman asks Pilot Rob a steady stream of questions about 
           the controls and how he uses them to fly. 

           Big Norm reads the paper while chomping on an apple. 
           Sandra stares blankly out the window at the desert below. 

           Off in the distance, a DOME OF GRAY CLOUDS covers the San 
           Bernardino Mountains. They’re heading straight for them.

           The Control Tower radios a warning to Pilot Rob -- “low 
           visibility in the Big Bear area” -- He acknowledges it.

           Norman stares at the ominous grey clouds getting closer. 

                                 NORMAN
                        We’re gonna fly into that...

           Rob hears the concern in his voice. Smiles reassuringly.

           Norman relaxes. Big Norm finishes the apple. He sets down 
           the paper and looks at Sandra. She looks sad. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        So. I’ve been thinking. A lot. 
                        And. I think we should try again.

           Sandra turns from the window. She studies his eyes. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I want to try again.

           Her lip trembles. There are tears in her eyes again, but 
           they’re not tears of sadness. He smiles ever so slightly.   

                                 BIG NORM
                        You good with that?

           She smiles and nods while hastily wiping away tears. 

           He holds out his hand. She takes it. Norman glances back 
           and sees Sandra smiling.

           He gives his father an approving nod as the plane pierces 
           the first tier of the once distant storm.  

           It gets dark in the cabin as a GREY MIST envelopes the 
           plane. There’s some initial turbulence, but it passes. 

           The clouds are so thick that if it weren’t for the buzz 
           of the propeller, it would be hard to tell the plane was 
           even airborne. They fly like this for awhile.

           Another warning is radioed in. More turbulence. Pilot Rob 
           puts two-hands on the steering wheel. Again, it passes.

           Norman looks out his window. Straining to see anything. 

           Suddenly something STRIKES THE WINDOW, he jumps back, it 
           looked an awful lot like a tree branch, but...

                                 PILOT ROB
                        Bird. Happens from time-to-time.

           Norman starts to tell him that it didn’t look like a 
           bird, but before he can the clouds part to reveal a 
           mighty EVERGREEN TREE a split second from impact. 

           Rob tries desperately to pull up, but it’s too late. 
           Before anyone can even scream, the wing clips the tree.

           The Plane does a 180. Time seems to slow down. Sandra 
           screams. The engines rev. Glass shatters. Metal tears. 

           The Plane bounces like a pinball off two more trees 
           before finally slamming into ONTARIO PEAK as we

           Silence. Darkness. We wait in it. We hear what sounds 
           like GUSTS OF WIND. After a moment it becomes clear that 
           it’s actually WAVES breaking against the shoreline.

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           A picturesque stretch of sand in the southern most cove 
           of Malibu. SURFERS on wooden long boards are riding the 
           waves we’ve been listening to. It’s a perfect day.  

           SUBTITLE: “TOPANGA BEACH -- EIGHT MONTHS EARLIER”

           The first thing we notice are the HOUSES built right on 
           the sand. Not glamorous beach houses, more like cottages. 

           The PEOPLE who live here range from burnt out DRIFTERS to 
           Ivy League LAWYERS. A family-style Hippie Commune by way 
           of “The Endless Summer” -- KIDS build sand castles next 
           to DRUM CIRCLES, topless WOMEN wave ‘hello’ to MOTHERS. 

           We find Norman on the beach, dark tan, white blond hair, 
           faded O.P. board shorts. He’s hand-rolling CIGARETTES on 
           top of an old milk crate and selling them to SURFERS.  

           Norman is counting the money in his coffee can - a few 
           dollars in change - when a sun-burned STONER approaches.

                                 STONER
                        How much for the rest of your 
                        papers, Little Man?

                                 NORMAN
                        Why do you just want the papers?

           The Stoner laughs conspiratorially. Norman just looks 
           confused. The Stoner stops laughing.

                                 STONER
                        Five bucks?

           Norman smiles. 
           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           Norman hides his left over TOBACCO under a rock near the 
           dunes. He walks nonchalantly back down to the beach. 

           He stops in his tracks when he sees a GIRL riding a HORSE 
           bareback through the waves. He’s transfixed. The Girl is 
           his age, cute on her way to gorgeous. It’s clear from the 
           way he stares that the boy is in love. The Girl is ELLY.   

           As Elly rides by, she sees Norman and smiles sweetly. 

           EXT. ARCHER BEACH HOUSE -- DAY

           Janice is out on her front porch tending to a ‘garden’ of 
           POTTED PLANTS with pruning sheers and a watering can. The 
           waves break right under the floorboards.

           Norman walks up the beach counting his money. He pockets 
           the cash as he climbs the stairs of the porch. 

                                 JANICE
                        You were selling cigarettes again.

           Norman tries to look and sound as innocent as possible.

                                 NORMAN
                        I was not. Who told you that?

           Janice stops pruning and looks at him the way mother’s 
           look at their kids when they know they’re lying.

                                 JANICE
                        I have it from several sources.
                        Come clean, and I’ll only make you 
                        donate your profits to cancer 
                        research. Lie to me, and you’re 
                        donating everything. That’s the 
                        best deal you’re gonna get. 

           Norman doubles down on the righteous indignation.

                                 NORMAN
                        Whoever told you that is lying. I 
                        wasn’t selling anything. I swear. 

                                 STONER O/S
                        Little Man!...

           The Stoner is walking up the beach with his FRIENDS 
           smoking a JOINT that he rolled with Norman’s papers.

                        ...tight papers. Nice, slow burn. 

           Busted. He talks fast.

                                 NORMAN
                        They’re just gonna buy them at the 
                        store anyway and those cigarettes 
                        have all kinds of chemicals, mine 
                        are natural. They're healthier. 
                        I'm making people healthier...

           Janice just holds out her hand. Norman sighs as he takes 
           all the money he made out of his pocket. Gives it to her.

                                 JANICE
                        You’re staying with dad tonight.

                                 NORMAN
                        Because of this?

                                 JANICE
                        You haven't spent a night with him 
                        all summer. And, more importantly, 
                        Rick and I haven't spent a night 
                        without you, so...

                                 NORMAN
                        Gross. 

                                 JANICE
                        Go pack your bag, Marlboro Man.   

           EXT. THE “YELLOW SUBMARINE” HOUSE -- DAY

           The biggest, loudest house on Topanga Beach. Some of the 
           best SURFERS in SoCal live under it’s sun-damaged roof. 

           A POKER GAME is going on out back. Seven card stud. 

           We see a lot of the same FACES around the table that we 
           saw at the party. They all look much tanner and happier.

           Big Norm and Rick are in a hand together. Rick makes a 
           big raise. Everyone folds, except Big Norm.

           BOB BARROW, an accountant, talks to ‘BEER CAN’ LARRY, a 
           drunk, over the “calls”, “raises”, and “re-raises”.

                                 BOB BARROW
                        ...we're out of hoops to make The 
                        State jump through.

                        It's a miracle Norm’s been able to 
                        hold 'em up as long as he has. 
                        We'll be lucky to make it to the 
                        end of the summer.

           Rick raises again. Norm calls. The final cards are dealt.

           Big Norm stares Rick down for a beat. Reading his eyes. 
           He pushes all his chips into the pot. 

                                 RICK
                               (frustrated)
                        You sucked out the flush...

           Rick folds. Shows his hand - straight to the Ace. Big 
           Norm shows his hand - pair of twos. Rick turns red. 

                                 BEER CAN LARRY
                        I got twenty bucks says we make it 
                        past Labor Day. 

                                 BOB BARROW
                        Make it fifty.

                                 BEER CAN LARRY
                        You gotta give me odds. 3-to-1? 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I got a hundred says we make it 
                        through the year.

           It gets quiet. They all turn. He can’t be serious? 

                                 BOB BARROW
                        Come on, Norm. Time's up. Game's 
                        over. The bulldozers are coming...

                                 BIG NORM
                        So take the bet. They’re gonna 
                        flatten your house, kick you off 
                        your land, mine as well cash in. 
                               (off the silence)
                        Two hundred. Who wants the action?

           Norm looks around the table. The guys look away. Ashamed. 

                                 RICK
                        Make it three.

           Big Norm and Rick hold a long, cold look. 
           EXT. THE “YELLOW SUBMARINE” HOUSE -- DAY

           A rag tag group of pony-tailed TEENAGE BOYS are hanging 
           out front, doing tricks on skateboards. 

           TRAFTON, 16 and already a local surf legend, sits 
           strumming a guitar. He’s clearly the alpha of the group. 

           Norman approaches the house, carrying his overnight bag. 
           Trafton sees him coming. They share a nod/smile.

                                 TRAFTON
                        Boy Ollestad...

                                 NORMAN
                        My dad still in the game?

                                 TRAFTON
                        He's up big. Don't think he's 
                        getting up anytime soon.
                               (off Norman’s sigh)
                        We were gonna go skate The Getty. 
                        You’re welcome to come with.

           We can tell from Norman’s smile that this isn’t an 
           invitation Trafton extends to many kids his age.

           INT. THE “YELLOW SUBMARINE” HOUSE -- DAY

           Norman walks through the house. Finds his father in a 
           hand with Barrow. Big pot. Very intense. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Is it cool if I go skateboarding 
                        with Trafton? 

           Big Norm’s focus stays on the game. He nods.

           Norman smiles. Starts to walk away.  

                                 RICK
                        No way.
                               (off Big Norm’s look)
                        It’s not me. It’s Jan. He got a 
                        ‘D’ in math. No skateboard until 
                        school starts.  

                                 BIG NORM
                        You trying to play me, Boy Wonder?

                                 NORMAN
                        Your night. Your rules.

                        Nice try. 

           Norman starts to argue.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Save it, kiddo. I don't want you 
                        to go skateboarding as much as I 
                        don't want to argue with your 
                        mother about it. 

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           Trafton and his crew are loading into an old VW Bus. A 
           group of TEENAGE GIRLS have joined them. One of them 
           lights up a joint. They crank the stereo. 

           Norman walks out. Deflated. Trafton calls to him.

                                 TRAFTON
                        You coming?

           Norman is about to say ‘no’, but then he sees Elly in 
           that group of teenage girls. They make eye contact.

           Fuck it. Norman runs over and jumps into the van. One of 
           the kids offers him the joint as they pull onto the PCH. 

           Norman hits it. Coughs.

           EXT. THE GETTY CENTER -- DAY

           Perched atop a hill in Brentwood. That treacherously 
           STEEP HILL is the reason Trafton and his gang are here. 

           The VW bus rolls to a stop. Norman and the rest of the 
           guys pile out with their skateboards. The girls drive off 
           down the hill. Leaving the boys with only one way down.

           Trafton is the first on his board. He takes off down the 
           steep, winding road. The rest of the guys go. It takes 
           Norman a moment to work up the courage, then he follows.

           In a matter of seconds, he’s flying. Norman catches up to 
           the guys. Sets his sights on Trafton leading the pack.

           Norman catches up to Trafton. Trafton smiles. Gets lower.  
           They approach the run out where the girls are waiting. 

           Norman sees Elly watching him. He tries to show off with 
           a dangerously tight turn. It goes wrong. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman WIPES OUT. His board goes flying. He baseball 
           slides along the asphalt. 

           Elly runs over as Norman gets to his feet. His whole left 
           side is scraped raw and bleeding. She winces. 

                                 ELLY
                        You OK? 

           Trafton walks up. He whistles at the sight Norman’s leg.

                                 TRAFTON
                        Check out that road tattoo. 

           Everyone gathers around to gawk at Norman’s battle wound.

                                 TRAFTON
                        You should get that cleaned up... 

                                 NORMAN
                        Let’s go again. I almost had you.

           Trafton smiles. Impressed by his moxie.

           EXT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- SUNSET

           Tucked into the Malibu Canyon. Just across the PCH from 
           Topanga Beach. Trafton’s VW Bus rolls to a stop. 

           Norman hops out. Walks gingerly up the driveway. As he 
           approaches the cottage, he can hear ARGUING.

           INT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- SUNSET

           Sandra is pacing around the cottage, worked up, fire in 
           her eyes. A stark contrast to Big Norm who seems just as 
           cool as always. His calm seems to fuel her anger. 

                                 SANDRA
                        ...I can't just drop everything to 
                        drive through a Mexican desert to 
                        see your parents. I have a life 
                        and a job.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You need a vacation. We both do.

                                 SANDRA
                        It's not a vacation. You're 
                        delivering a washing machine.

                        You can't ask me to do stuff like 
                        this, Norm. This is “married 
                        people” stuff. You don't want to 
                        be anyone's husband? Fine. Don't 
                        expect me to act like your wife. 
                        You can't have it both ways.

                                 BIG NORM
                        OK then. Marry me.

                                 SANDRA
                        Fuck you.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You want to get married? Let's get 
                        married. I'm serious.

                                 SANDRA
                        No. You're not. You're patronizing 
                        me. And It's mean. It's so fucking 
                        mean, I can’t even-- Hi, Norman...

           He follows her eyes to Norman standing in the doorway.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Give us a minute, will ya kiddo?

           EXT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- SUNSET

           Norman sits on the front steps. We can tell from the look 
           on his face it’s been much longer than a minute. 

           Big Norm emerges from the cottage. Sits beside him.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Listen...

                                 NORMAN
                        I should stay at mom's tonight?

           Janice has prepared a romantic CANDLELIT DINNER for two. 

           She and Rick sit across from each other drinking wine. 
           Norman sits right between them, gnawing on a chicken leg. 
           The proverbial third wheel. They eat in awkward silence. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NORMAN
                        So? How was everyone’s day?

           Janice hides a smile. Rick downs his wine in one gulp. 

           INT. ARCHER BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Janice does the dishes. Norman clears the table. 

           Rick sits in a rocking chair, drinking yet another glass 
           of wine and watching a PBS Special on “Watergate”.  

           Norman finishes clearing the table. He joins Rick in-
           front of the TV where a droll Narrator is talking over 
           stock footage of President Nixon. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Why do you always watch these 
                        shows? It's not like you're gonna 
                        learn anything new. Nixon lied. He 
                        lied some more. He got fired from 
                        being President. The end. 
                               (off Rick’s silence)
                        Seriously. Can't we watch a movie 
                        or something?

           Norman crosses to a bookcase of VHS TAPES. Looks it over. 
           He reaches up for a tape and inadvertently gives Rick a 
           glimpse of that nasty ROAD BURN on his backside.

                                 RICK
                        What is that?

           Norman turns around quickly. Tries to play the innocent. 

                                 NORMAN
                        What’s what?

           Rick pops out of the chair, grabs Norman’s arm and pulls 
           up his shirt. His bloodshot eyes narrow.  

                                 NORMAN
                        I slipped in the canyon... 

                                 RICK
                        Bullshit. I can see the blacktop 
                        around the edges. 

           Janice hears the commotion. Walks into the living room.

                                 JANICE
                        What’s going on in here?

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 RICK
                        He went skateboarding. 

                                 NORMAN
                        I did not. I slipped in the 
                        canyon. Tell him to let me go. 

                                 RICK
                               (amazed/incredulous)
                        It just come so naturally for you. 
                        Effortless. Nixon would be proud.

                                 JANICE
                        Rick. Let him go. 

                                 RICK
                        Not until he tells us the truth.

           Rick grips his arm even harder. Norman yelps.

                                 JANICE
                        You’re hurting him. Let him go.

                                 RICK
                        Your mom doesn't care about you, 
                        Norman. She's OK with you growing 
                        up to be a lying sack a shit. I’m 
                        not. Now. Tell the truth.

           He grips harder. Norman finally relents.

                                 NORMAN
                        OK. God. Fine. The truth is... 
                        you’re an asshole.
                               (beat)
                        Am I lying?

           Rick’s blood boils. He raises his hand to smack Norman. 

           Janice runs over and tries to grab his arm before he can. 

           Rick accidentally hits Janice. Hard. She falls to the 
           floor. Clutching her eye. Rick is immediately remorseful 
           and concerned. He lets go of Norman and goes to her.  

           Norman loses his shit. Starts pummeling Rick with his 
           little fists. Making it hard for him to attend to Janice. 

                                 JANICE
                        Norman. Damn it. That’s enough. 

           Norman stops. It gets quiet as Rick helps Janice to the 
           couch. Then goes to the kitchen to get her an ice pack. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Norman stares at his mom holding her swelling eye. He 
           fights back tears. Runs to his room and slams the door.

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- EARLY MORNING

           Pre-dawn. Still and quiet. The WAVES are up this morning. 

           INT. NORMAN’S BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

           Norman is asleep, still wearing the clothes from the 
           night before. His cheeks tear-stained. 

           His BEDROOM WINDOW opens. Norman stirs. A pair of hands 
           jump up and grab the ledge. They belong to Big Norm. 

           He climbs in - read: breaks in - through the window. He 
           is wearing a WETSUIT. He moves to the edge of the bed.

                                 BIG NORM
                        What are you doing? We got a storm 
                        front moving in, offshore wind, 
                        steady sets of six-footers at 
                        Swami's and you're sleeping? 

           Norman groans. Rolls over. His father is undeterred.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Come on. Me and Sandra are leaving 
                        for Mexico in a few days. While 
                        I'm gone, you can sleep in, eat 
                        junk food, arcade, whatever. But  
                        today, it's you and me. Let's go.
                               (off Norman asleep)
                        I'm gonna go wax your board. If 
                        you're not outside in ten minutes, 
                        I'm coming back with ice water.

           Norman’s eyes open. 

           EXT. “SWAMI’S” BEACH -- EARLY MORNING

           It’s not even 7 a.m. and dozens of SURFERS - men, women, 
           young, old - are already out catching six foot waves. 

           Big Norm and Norman paddle out. Big Norm rides a cherry 
           ‘gun’ board (pro), Norman is on a yellow-railed, seven-
           two longboard (amateur). He still looks groggy.

           They get beyond the breakers and sit on their boards. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman yawns as Big Norm takes in what is turning out to 
           be a spectacular morning. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        What kind of father would I be if 
                        I let you miss a day like today?

                                 NORMAN
                        A normal one.

           A wave comes. Norman is in perfect position to catch it.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Remember: balance and patience. 
                        Don’t rush. Let it come to you. 

           Norman paddles onto the wave. He catches it. But rushes 
           to stand. Loses his balance and wipes out. Hard. 

           Norman swallows water as he surfaces. Starts coughing. 
           Big Norm paddles over.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Considering you were totally off 
                        balance and showed no patience, 
                        that was actually pretty good.
                               (off Norman pouting)
                        Get your board. Let’s go again.

           Norman knows there’s no point arguing, so he doesn’t.

           EXT. “SWAMI’S” PARKING LOT -- MORNING

           SURFERS leave the water. Fun’s over. Time to go to work. 
           Norman purchases breakfast burritos from a STREET VENDOR. 

           He crosses the lot to his dad’s PICKUP TRUCK. Finds his 
           dad changing out of his wetsuit into a business suit. 

           Big Norm’s bare ass is in plain sight. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Jesus, dad. You couldn't wait 
                        until we got home?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Not going home. No time. I gotta 
                        be in court in an hour.

                                 NORMAN
                        What am I supposed to do?

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BIG NORM
                        Well. You can walk, paddle, 
                        hitchhike. Or come watch your 
                        father fight for truth, justice 
                        and The American Way. It’s 
                        completely up to you.

           EXT. L.A. SUPERIOR COURT -- MORNING

           AL FREEDMAN, 42, tall, bushy beard, is waiting on the 
           front steps. He paces back-and-forth. Nervous.

           Big Norm and Norman, hair still wet, jog up the stairs. 

                                 AL
                        What happened to “let’s meet an 
                        hour early to prep”?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Six-footers at Swami’s.
                               (off Al’s look)
                        You wanna prep? Let’s prep: we’re  
                        right, they’re wrong. I got this. 

                                 AL
                        Remember Judge Kale hates flash, 
                        so tone it down in-front of him. 
                        But Madison loves it, so go big 
                        when we’re on cross. Also...

                                 BIG NORM
                        Al. Relax. I got this.

           INT. COURTROOM (VARIOUS) -- DAY

           Norman watches his dad work. We'll INTERCUT three very 
           different cases before three very different JUDGES. 

           Big Norm doesn't just litigate. He performs. The cases 
           and courtrooms change over the following sequence. His 
           passion and infectious charisma are constant. 

           CLOSING STATEMENT: The JURY hangs on Big Norm’s every 
           word. Shades of Atticus Finch in "To Kill A Mockingbird".

                                 BIG NORM
                        ...you’ve heard a lot of opinions 
                        from a lot of experts. Facts have 
                        been presented and disputed.

           CONTINUED:
                                       BIG NORM (CONT'D)
                        But there’s one fact no one can 
                        dispute: Malcolm Carter checked 
                        into a hospital. He contracted an 
                        infection. He did not check out... 

           CROSS EXAMINATION: Big Norm grills a WITNESS, shades of 
           Caffey going after Jessup in "A Few Good Men".

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’m not asking what you thought 
                        about the bridge’s structural 
                        integrity. I know you knew. You 
                        knew about the flaws. You knew 
                        about the danger. I’m asking why 
                        you did nothing about it?

           JURY SELECTION: A young WHITE MAN stands. Norm gives his 
           approval. The plaintiff's ATTORNEY gives Norm a peculiar 
           look. Then nods is approval. The man is approved.

           JURY SELECTION: A middle-aged INDIAN WOMAN stands. Again, 
           Norm gives his approval. The plaintiff's ATTORNEY gives 
           Norm a "What the Fuck are you up to?" look. He thinks 
           about striking. But doesn't. The woman is approved.

           CROSS EXAMINATION: The Witness is really sweating now.

                                 BIG NORM
                        ...exactly how much would it have 
                        cost to reinforce the pylons? Or, 
                        to put it more accurately, how 
                        much did you save by costing my 
                        client the use of his legs? 

           JURY SELECTION: An elderly BLACK MAN stands. Norm nods 
           his approval. The flustered plaintiff's ATTORNEY gives 
           his too, but then second guesses himself and uses another 
           strike. The man is dismissed.

           CLOSING STATEMENT: There’s real emotion in Norm’s eyes 
           and voice as he says--

                                 BIG NORM
                        ...this case isn’t just about 
                        holding a hospital accountable for 
                        the well-being of their patients. 
                        It’s about closure. Closure for a 
                        wife who lost a husband. And five 
                        children who lost a father.   

           With that, he sits. The Jury looks moved. 

           The rival ATTORNEYS look concerned. Norman smiles.
           INT. LAW OFFICES -- AFTERNOON

           “Ollestad & Freedman” is on the door. A modest space. No 
           flash. Not a big money corporate firm.

           Big Norm, Norman and Al return from court. The PARALEGALS 
           applaud as they walk in. Big Norm takes a bow.   

           INT. LAW OFFICES -- EVENING

           All the employees have gone home for the day. It’s quiet. 
           Big Norm is at his desk reviewing a brief. 

           Norman walks around his dad’s office - picking things up, 
           putting them down. He comes across a fresh-baked BANANA 
           BREAD with a note: “With love, The Carters” 

                                 NORMAN
                        What’s this?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Some people can't afford to pay. 
                        They give what they can.

                                 NORMAN
                        You let people pay you in bread?

                                 BIG NORM
                        It’s really good bread.

           Norman continues looking around. Something occurs to him.

                                 NORMAN
                        Why didn't you say 'no' to anyone 
                        when you were picking the jury?

                                 BIG NORM
                        I need them to like me. People 
                        don't like profiling and 
                        discrimination, but everyone likes 
                        being picked first in gym class.  

           Norman smiles. Big Norm checks his watch. Shit.

                                 BIG NORM
                        We gotta go. Sandra's cooking 
                        tonight. You're welcome to join.

           Norman makes a face. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        She's getting better. Seriously.
           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY -- SUNSET

           Big Norm drives the pickup truck north. Norman is asleep 
           in the passenger seat.

           Big Norm notices a roadside FLOWER STAND. He pulls over.  

           EXT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- NIGHT

           The pickup pulls into the driveway next to the Porsche. 

           Big Norm leaves Norman sleeping in the front seat. He 
           takes a giant BOUQUET OF ROSES and heads inside.

           INT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- NIGHT

           It’s dark, empty, quiet. Big Norm walks in with the 
           roses. Smiling. He notices a a few picture frames missing 
           from the walls. His smile fades. 

           Big Norm finds a NOTE on the kitchen counter. He sets the 
           roses down. Picks it up. Reads it. We don’t see what the 
           note says, we just see what reading it does to him. 

           Norman walks in, rubbing sleep out of his eyes. He sees 
           his father reading the note. Doesn’t see Sandra.    

                                 NORMAN
                        She took off again?
                               (off the silence)
                        She’ll be back. She always comes 
                        back.

           Big Norm doesn’t look so sure, but he manages a smile. He 
           looks at the rose bouquet on the counter. Has an idea.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’ll walk you to your mom’s.

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- NIGHT

           Janice is moving her potted plants to protect them from 
           the storm. She has a nasty-looking BLACK EYE. 

           Big Norm and Norman approach. Big Norm carries the roses. 
           Smiling. He sees her black eye. His smile disappears.  

                                 BIG NORM
                        Jesus Christ, Jan. 
           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- NIGHT

           The WAVES are big tonight. Norman sits in the sand 
           tossing shells into the ocean. 

           He glances back at the porch where Big Norm and Janice 
           are arguing. He can’t hear what they’re saying. 

           Janice heads inside. Big Norm walks over to Norman. Sits 
           beside him. They watch the waves.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Your mom thinks it would be a good 
                        idea for you to come to Mexico 
                        with me, I think she's right... 
                               (off Norman’s sigh)
                        I know you were promised arcades, 
                        but, things happen, plans change. 
                        This wasn't exactly what I wanted 
                        either. Know what I mean?

           He does. They sit in silence for a moment.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Stay away from Rick. Don't look at 
                        him. Don't talk to him. Just keep 
                        clear. It's what I do. Understood?

                                 NORMAN
                        Can't you just kick his ass?

                                 BIG NORM
                        If he ever puts his hand on you 
                        again, we'll find out.

                                 NORMAN
                        Why can't I just live with you?

           Big Norm considers for a beat. His eyes on the waves. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        A really smart dead guy once said 
                        ‘most men lead lives of quiet 
                        desperation’... Rick has the 
                        volume turned up, but you’re gonna 
                        have to deal with guys like him 
                        your whole life. I won't always be 
                        there to fight your battles. One 
                        day you'll be on your own... 
                               (beat)
                        Eventually we all are.

                                                               BACK TO:
           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- DAY

           9,000 feet. A white-out blizzard. Subzero temperatures. 

           40 mph guts drive hale and snow. All we hear is the wind.

           Norman’s eyes flutter open. The first thing he sees is a 
           large section of the plane’s INSTRUMENT PANEL embedded 
           into the side of the mountain like an upended ship. 

           He’s still buckled into his seat, but his seat is no 
           longer in the plane. There is no plane. It’s pieces are 
           scattered all over the mountain top.

           Norman moves to unbuckle himself. The seat lurches. He 
           freezes as he realizes that his seat is teetering on the 
           precipice of an ICE CHUTE - a near-vertical ice-covered 
           slope lined with jagged rocks. Mine as well be a cliff.   

           Norman tries the buckle again. The seat falls. Plummets 
           into the chute. For a second, it looks like it’s all 
           over. But the seat hits the instrument panel and stops.  

           Norman knows he’s out of time. Now or never. He hastily 
           unclasps the buckle as the instrument panel gives way. 

           He jams his bare hand into the mountainside like an ice 
           axe just as the seat and panel fall into the chute. 

           Norman dangles by one hand. He watches as the panel hits 
           a sharp rock and explodes into a dozen pieces. The chair 
           plummets down the mountainside. Disappears into the fog.  

           Norman drives his other hand into the thick ice crust. He 
           winces at the pain as he does this over and over again in 
           order to climb out of the chute and up onto a plateau. 

           It takes him ten minutes to climb ten feet. He lies there 
           on the plateau. Catching his breath.   

           His teeth chatter as he looks around, trying to get his 
           bearings. The Peak rises all the way up into the clouds. 
           The thick fog makes it hard to see anything.   

           Through the fog, Norman sees the figure of a MAN lying in 
           the snow about a dozen yards away. He’s not moving.

           The man lies face down in the snow. From the back, it 
           appears to be the figure of Big Norm. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad...

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman moves toward him. He sees that the man is wearing 
           a BOMBER JACKET. It’s not his father. It’s Pilot Rob. 

           Norman is almost smiling with relief when he reaches Rob. 
           He stirs him. Rob doesn’t move.  

           He rolls him over and screams when he sees that Rob’s 
           nose is gone. His face gruesomely lacerated. He’s lying 
           in a pool of his own blood. Open lifeless eyes.

           Norman recoils in horror. He scrambles backwards away 
           from the body as fast as he can. In his haste, he slips, 
           falls and hits his head on a ROCK. A sickening thud. 

           The fall knocks him out. All we hear is the wind again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           Norman watches as his father, Bob Barrow and Al Freedman 
           load a brand-new Maytag WASHING MACHINE into the pickup.  

           An old SUITCASE is packed at Norman’s feet. Janice walks 
           over. Her eye looks better. 

           Big Norm picks up his suitcase. Janice wraps Norman in a 
           hug. Kisses the top his head.

                                 JANICE
                        I love you. Call me every night. 
                        Don't drink the water. 

           Norman follows his father to the truck. Janice watches 
           them go. Looking concerned. 

                                 JANICE
                        Behave yourself.

                                 BIG NORM
                        He always does.

                                 JANICE
                               (smiles)
                        I wasn’t talking to him.

           EXT. U.S./MEXICO BORDER -- DAY

           Hundreds of cars and trucks wait in plodding traffic to 
           be inspected by dozens of BORDER GUARDS. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman watches as an overweight Mexican PATROLMAN paces 
           around the pickup truck, checking boxes on a checklist. 

           The Patrolman sees the washing machine. His brow furrows. 
           He says something to Big Norm in mumbled Spanish.

           Big Norm takes out a twenty-dollar bill. He palms it to 
           The Patrolman in a handshake. He waves them through.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK (DRIVING) -- DAY

           The Border Checkpoint recedes in the side-view mirror. 
           Big Norm puts his wallet away. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Why'd you give that guy money?

                                 BIG NORM
                        He had a gun and a checklist and I 
                        didn't want to deal with either.

                                 NORMAN
                        You bribed him...

                                 BIG NORM
                        They prefer “tax”.

                                 NORMAN
                        Isn’t that illegal?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Yeah, but nobody got not hurt. The 
                        underpaid, overworked guard got 
                        twenty bucks. We didn't get 
                        hassled. Everybody won.
                               (off Norman’s 
                                skeptical look)
                        Don’t look at me like I stole your 
                        lunch money. Listen just 'cause 
                        something’s illegal, doesn't make 
                        it wrong. And vice versa. Like its 
                        legal for companies to dump trash 
                        and chemicals into the ocean which 
                        harms everyone, but it's illegal 
                        for Al to smoke a joint in his 
                        office at the end of a long day 
                        which harms no one. 

           Norman nods. Makes sense. 
           EXT. TRANSPENINSULAR HIGHWAY -- DAY

           The pickup truck speeds down this mostly deserted highway 
           that runs the entire length of the Baja Peninsula. 

           They stop to buy tamales from a toothless OLD WOMAN on 
           the side of the road.

           Norman sleeps. Big Norm drinks a large cup of coffee. 

           They drive along the coast. Norm sees a pack of SURFERS 
           floating out beyond the breakers. He pulls off the road.

           Big Norm and Norman change into their wetsuits, grab 
           their boards and jog down to the beach.

           They paddle out into the waves. Big Norm catches 
           everything he tries for. Norman misses a few and catches 
           a few. 

           INT. DIVE BAR -- NIGHT

           Norman and Big Norm are the only Caucasians in the place. 
           Their hair is still wet. 

           The REGULARS eye them curiously. A pretty WAITRESS brings 
           them drinks -- coke for Norman, pineapple juice for Norm. 

           Norman looks around at all the other men drinking beer.

                                 NORMAN
                        How come you don’t drink?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Never been able to rationalize a 
                        few hours of shit-faced fun for a 
                        whole day of feeling like shit.
                               (beat)
                        Why so curious? Have you started 
                        stealing Rick's beers already?

                                 NORMAN
                        No.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You can be honest. I won’t tell 
                        mom. I see you running around with 
                        Trafton. You must have had a beer 
                        or two at some point... 

                                 NORMAN
                        Honestly. No. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BIG NORM
                        I'd rather you were a functional 
                        alcoholic than a pathological 
                        liar. Know what I mean?

                                 NORMAN
                               (after a beat)
                        I've had beer. 

           Big Norm doesn’t look surprised or upset. He just nods.

                                 NORMAN
                        You're cool with it?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Of course not. But I know there's 
                        nothing I can do to stop you. Kids 
                        try things. You’re all hardwired
                        to do stupid stuff. I can tell you 
                        how ridiculous and pointless that 
                        stuff is, but you'll do it anyway. 
                        When I was your age, your grandpop
                        was militant about me never 
                        touching pot and that only made me 
                        want to try it more, so...

                                 NORMAN
                        So then shouldn't you be telling 
                        me to drink and stuff?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Yeah I’m pretty sure that’s not 
                        the moral of the story.

                                 NORMAN
                        If your dad telling you not to 
                        smoke pot made you want to it more 
                        than shouldn't you telling me to 
                        drink make me want to do it less? 

           Big Norm considers this. Can’t find a hole in the logic.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Drink alcohol. It's awesome. Your 
                        breath smells better, you'll never 
                        say anything that you’ll regret, 
                        and the police especially love it 
                        when you do it underage and in 
                        public. In fact, as your father, I 
                        insist that you drown as many 
                        brain cells as humanly possible in 
                        misbegotten booze. Are we clear?

           Norman laughs as the WAITRESS arrives with their food.

           EXT. TRANSPENINSULAR HIGHWAY -- DAY

           The pickup truck drives through the desert. Nothing but 
           sagebrush and cacti for miles and miles.

           They pass a SIGN that reads: Mar de Cortés - 15 millas

           EXT. SEA OF CORTEZ -- DAY

           The shimmering blue body of water that separates the Baja 
           Peninsula from mainland Mexico. 

           EXT. HARBOR -- DAY

           A chaotic, bustling SEAPORT. We see and hear a lot of 
           sunburned DOCKWORKERS yelling in Spanish.

           Big Norm guides the dust-covered pickup truck into a long 
           line of cars and trucks waiting to board a FERRYBOAT. 

           They reach an official-looking GUARD inspecting vehicles. 
           Big Norm hands him their tickets. He tears them. 

           The Guard notices the washing machine. He says a number 
           in Spanish. Big Norm sighs. He palms the Guard some cash.

           INT. FERRYBOAT -- CABIN -- DAY

           A small sleeping space. Just two beds and a bathroom. 
           Norman and Big Norm drop their bags off. 

           EXT. FERRYBOAT -- DECK -- SUNSET

           The AIR HORN blows as the ferry drifts out to sea.  

           Norman sits on the railing watching the shoreline recede. 

           Big Norm sits on a bench strumming his acoustic GUITAR. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Hey dad, check it out...

           He points a group of SURFERS down the coast catching some 
           pretty intense waves. They watch a surfer disappear 
           inside the break of wave for a few seconds then emerge 
           unscathed. Still on his board. It’s a thing of beauty.

                        They are giving out tube rides 
                        left and right down here. You’ve 
                        been tubed. Right?
                               (off Norman shaking 
                                his head)
                        We’re getting you one while we’re 
                        down here. We are not leaving this 
                        country until you get a tube ride.

           Norman watches a huge wave nearly wipe a SURFER out.

                                 NORMAN
                        What happens if you don’t make it 
                        out before the wave breaks?

                                 BIG NORM
                        You get crushed.

           Norman laughs. Big Norm doesn’t. Norman stops laughing.

           Big Norm notices a pretty twenty-something WOMAN alone on 
           the other side of the boat scribbling in a notebook.

           He starts playing Johnny Cash's "Flesh and Blood”. 

           Norman sings along. Until he forgets the words. He tries 
           to fake it, but finally gives up and starts laughing. 

           APPLAUSE coming from across the deck. It’s the Woman.

                                 WOMAN
                        Very good. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I thought I was a little off key 
                        and he was pitchy, but thank you. 
                               (off her smile)
                        I'm Norm. My friend is Norman.

                                 WOMAN
                        Your friend?

                                 BIG NORM
                        And my son. I lead with friendship 
                        because we chose it.

                                 WOMAN
                        I would drop a dollar in your case 
                        but I don't have one...

                                 BIG NORM
                        What do you got? We're not greedy.

           Kristie thinks. Then digs in her bag. Pulls out a BOX OF 
           CHOCOLATES with Dutch-writing on it. She holds it up.

                                 WOMAN
                        Belgian chocolate. From Belgium.
                        It’ll make you believe in God.

           EXT. FERRYBOAT -- DECK -- NIGHT

           Norman’s hands are covered in chocolate. The box is open 
           beside him. Big Norm and The Woman lean on the railing. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        So, Kristie, what's your story?

                                 KRISTIE
                        I'm a writer. Well. Aspiring. I 
                        kind of snapped and quit my job 
                        six months ago. Been traveling 
                        ever since. Just writing, looking 
                        for inspiration, finding mostly 
                        that I suck at writing. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad's a writer...

           She looks at him. Really? He shakes his head. Not really.

                                 NORMAN
                        He wrote a book.

                                 BIG NORM
                        One book. Hardly makes me a 
                        writer.

                                 KRISTIE
                        Well I've written no books, so, 
                        what does that make me? 
                               (off his smile)
                        What was it about?

                                 BIG NORM
                        I joined the FBI when I was 25. 
                        Quit at 26. Wrote about that year.

                                 KRISTIE
                        Why’d you quit?

                                 BIG NORM
                        I wanted to fight crime. I learned 
                        pretty quickly that fighting crime

                        Edgar Hoover’s FBI wasn't as 
                        important as the perception that 
                        we were fighting crime.

           She smiles. Impressed. Amused.

                                 KRISTIE
                        So? Any advice for a struggling 
                        young writer?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Don't be afraid to piss people 
                        off. Try to piss people off.

           A charged moment. Interrupted by Norman yawning from the 
           bench. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        That’s my cue. Thanks again for 
                        the chocolate.

           Norman walks off as Big Norm and Kristie shake hands.

                                 KRISTIE
                        My pleasure. And, if you want 
                        more, I’m in cabin twenty-seven.

           She holds his eyes. No mistaking that.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I got a lady.

                                 KRISTIE
                        Lucky lady...

                                 BIG NORM
                        That’s what I keep telling her.

           INT. FERRYBOAT -- CABIN -- NIGHT

           Norman sits up in his bed. Big Norm climbs into bed and 
           is about to turn off the light.

                                 NORMAN
                        Why did Sandra leave?

           The question catches Big Norm off guard. He leaves the 
           light on. We see the sadness in his eyes. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        She gets mad. She takes off.

                        the other night?

                                 BIG NORM
                        I don't know. Everything. Nothing. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Did you say something wrong? 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I didn’t say anything.

                                 NORMAN
                        Why was she so mad?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Sometimes the worst thing you can 
                        say to a woman is nothing.

           He reaches over and turns off the light. 

           EXT. HARBOR -- DAY

           The ferryboat in port. Big Norm guides the pickup down 
           the ramp. They find the nearest highway and head south. 

           EXT. MEXICAN OUTBACK -- DAY

           The highway cuts through a jungle. Canopied by branches. 

           They ride in silence. Big Norm just lost in his thoughts. 
           Norman starts to say something. Thinks better of it.

           The jungle gets thicker, greener. A stark contrast to the 
           bleak colorless desert of the Baja Peninsula.

           The highway devolves into just a narrow single-lane road 
           as they drive further and further away from civilization. 

           THUNDER CLOUDS loom on the horizon.  

           EXT. JUNGLE ROAD -- ‘CHECKPOINT’ -- EVENING

           A ROADBLOCK made of sandbags and a two-by-four cuts 
           across the only passageway. 

           Teenage SOLDIERS, wearing uniforms several sizes too big 
           for them, man the checkpoint. One of them is holding a 
           white flag. They are all holding semi-automatic rifles. 
           I/E. PICKUP TRUCK (DRIVING) -- EVENING

           They drive along that same jungle road. Big Norm sees the 
           checkpoint up ahead. There’s no away around it. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Shit. 

           Norman looks up at the Teenagers With Guns. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Don’t say anything. Don’t do 
                        anything. Just let me handle it.

           We hear the rumble of THUNDER as the pickup rolls to a 
           stop in-front of the two-by-four.

           The oldest and meanest-looking SOLDIER approaches the 
           driver's side window. The others surround the truck. 

           Big Norm shows him their passports. Norman can’t stop 
           staring at the guns.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Toll...

           The Solider says a number in Spanish. Big Norm laughs. 
           You’ve gotta be kidding? The Soldier glares. He’s not. 

           Big Norm says a different number. The Soldier’s eyes 
           narrow. He raises his rifle. The others do the same. 

           Norman terrified. Big Norm stays calm. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        It’s OK. We’re fine. Just empty 
                        your pockets. Slowly. 

           They empty their pockets and hand over all their money. 

           The Soldier counts it. He’s not satisfied. His eyes 
           flicker to the washing machine. He barks an order.

           His Men move to untie the machine. Big Norm protests. 

           The Soldier laughs in his face. His teeth are yellow. The 
           one with the white flag makes kissing noises at Norman.

           Big Norm turns red with rage. He’s had enough. 

           A huge CRACK OF THUNDER momentarily distracts The 
           Soldiers. Big Norm seizes on it. He drops the pickup into 
           gear. Slams down on the accelerator. The tires squeal.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Get down.

           Norman ducks as the pickup plows through the two-by-four. 

           The Soldiers yell in Spanish. Some of them raise their 
           rifles.  

           Norman hears the POP of gunshots. He ducks further.

           Big Norm keeps his head low until the gunshots fade into 
           the distance. He keeps the accelerator floored. 

           They speed through the jungle. Another crack of thunder. 
           Silver-dollar RAINDROPS splatter the windshield. 

           The sky opens up. Torrential rain. Curtains of it. The 
           windshield wipers can’t keep up. 

           They’re going 70 mph and they can hardly see a thing.

                                 BIG NORM
                        We gotta get off this road. Look 
                        for a turnout, a trail, anything. 

           Norman wipes the fog off his window. He looks around 
           frantically. He sees a DIRT TRAIL cut into the jungle.

                                 NORMAN
                        There!

           Big Norm slams on the brakes. The truck almost tips as he 
           makes the sharp right turn onto the road.

           The truck lurches and bounces as they drive deeper into 
           the jungle. Norman grips the seat with white knuckles.

           They drive like this for awhile. Finally, Big Norm slows 
           to a stop. He kills the engine and the headlights.

           It’s dark and quiet. The rain pours. Thunder rumbles. Big 
           Norm catches his breath. He turns to Norman who is still 
           shaking.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You OK? I’m sorry. That was a bad 
                        situation that was only gonna get 
                        worse. We had to do something.

                        We'll crash in the truck. Tomorrow 
                        we'll be in Puerto Vallarta. 
                        Someday this will all be a Hell of 
                        a story for you to tell.

           He smiles. 

                                 NORMAN
                        I'm never going anywhere with you 
                        again.

           His smile fades. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Try to get some sleep.

           Big Norm reclines his seat. Closes his eyes. Norman 
           watches his father sleep, listens to the thunder. 

           Norman CLOSES HIS EYES the truck.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- DAY

           Norman OPENS HIS EYES on the mountain. 

           BLOOD stains the rock and the wound on his head where he 
           landed on it. His blonde hair is dyed dark red.

           Norman sits up. Shakes off the cobwebs. Touches the 
           wound. It's still tender. He looks around, trying to get 
           his bearings. He sees Pilot Rob's body. Looks away. 

           He tries to stand. Wobbles. Sits right back down and 
           curls into a ball. He stays huddled against an evergreen 
           tree, trying to get warm, trying not to look at the body.

           The storm grows in intensity. The wind and snow pick up.

           Norman shakes uncontrollably, from fear, from cold. His 
           eyes keep darting to Pilot Rob's thick BOMBER JACKET. He 
           steels himself before crawling back over to the body. 

           Norman holds his breath as he takes off the dead man's 
           jacket. It's as horrible to watch as it sounds. 

           After a struggle, he gets it off. Wraps himself in it. He 
           stands up again. This time he doesn’t wobble. 

           Norman’s tennis shoes slip on the ice as he makes his way 
           across the mountain, towards THE CRASH SITE.

           Debris from the plane is everywhere. Cracked fiberglass. 
           Pieces of metal, torn and jagged, like crumpled tin foil.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NORMAN
                        Hello... Dad? Sandra? Anyone...

           No response. Just eerie silence and the wind. He keeps 
           searching. The fog is thick. He can’t see much at all. 

           Norman passes one of the plane wings imbedded into the 
           ice. That's the moment the fog dissipates just long 
           enough for him to see Big Norm. He's lying very still 
           beside a tree, just up a steep ice-slicked embankment.

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad!

           Norman scrambles up the embankment. He has to use his 
           bare hands as ice axes again, but he doesn't feel the 
           pain. By the time he reaches his father, he has bright 
           red scrapes on all ten of his fingers.

           Big Norm's eyes are closed. There's no blood or gore. He 
           just looks like he's asleep. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad?

           Norman shakes him gently. He doesn’t wake up. He shakes 
           him a littler harder. He slumps over. He checks his 
           breathing, listens for a heartbeat. Hard to tell. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad...

                                 NORMAN O/S 
                        Dad, wake up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK -- MORNING

           Big Norm asleep in the driver’s seat. Norman jostles him.

                                 NORMAN
                        Dad.

           Big Norm jolts awake. Finds Norman looking concerned.

                                 NORMAN
                        We got a problem.
           EXT. JUNGLE -- MORNING

           The pickup truck has SUNK down into the rain-softened mud 
           overnight. All four tires are completely submerged.   

           Norman stands to the side as Big Norm tries to drive 
           forward. Then reverse. The truck just sinks deeper.

           Norman pumps the accelerator as Big Norm pushes. The only 
           thing they succeed in accomplishing is splattering him 
           from head-to-toe in mud. He looks like Swamp Thing.

           Big Norm signals to cut the engine. Norman does. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        We’ll head for the coast. Find 
                        someone to pull us out.

           Norman looks up and down the road. Nothing but jungle.

                                 NORMAN
                        We're in the middle of nowhere. 
                        Who are we gonna find?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Whoever busted their ass cutting 
                        this trail.

           EXT. JUNGLE ROAD -- DAY

           They hike through ankle-deep mud carrying surfboards, 
           bags, Norm's guitar, anything anyone could run off with. 

                                 NORMAN
                        You think I could win a ski race 
                        this year?

                                 BIG NORM
                        You want to win a race this year? 

           Norman shrugs/nods. Big Norm stops in his tracks. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Think about it now. Once you say 
                        ‘yes’, you're setting a series of 
                        events in motion that cannot be 
                        stopped. We’re gonna train our 
                        asses off. So, I ask again, do you 
                        want to win a ski race this year?

                                 NORMAN
                        I do.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Then you will.

           EXT. JUNGLE ROAD -- DAY

           The sun is high in the sky. It gets hotter by the minute. 

           The mud keeps getting deeper. Big Norm and Norman are 
           both covered head-to-toe in it, both sweating profusely. 

           Big Norm uses his surfboard like a machete to cut through 
           the brush. Norman plods along. Exhausted. Cranky.

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s so hot... I'm tired... and 
                        hungry... and thirsty... 

           They keep walking. The brush keeps getting thicker.

                                 NORMAN
                        I could be at the arcade right 
                        now... drinking a slushie... I 
                        should be. This sucks. You suck.

                                 BIG NORM
                        We’re on an adventure.

                                 NORMAN
                        So was The Donner Party.

           They walk further and further. Big Norm chopping at the 
           palm fronds. Norman trudging along, sulking. Suddenly Big 
           Norm stops chopping and just listens. 

                                 NORMAN
                        What?

           Big Norm signals for him to be quiet and listen. He does. 
           Norman hears what sounds a lot like THE OCEAN. 

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           An idyllic cove formed by a coastal inlet and coral reef. 
           White sand. Blueberry water. A hidden paradise.

           Big Norm and Norman emerge from the stifling jungle 
           covered in caked-on mud. Their feet crunch on sea shells. 
           They stand there taking it in.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           They exchange a smile before dropping the bags and boards 
           and sprinting over the sand. They dive into the ocean in 
           their clothes. The mud leaves a stain in their wake.

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           Their wet clothes hang to dry over on a PAPAYA TREE. A 
           dozen hollowed out PAPAYAS are scattered all over. The 
           guys lie in the sand with full bellies. 

           The ocean is still swollen from last night’s storm. The 
           waves are big. Bigger than any we’ve seen so far.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’ll be damned...

           He nods to a channel formed by the reef where THE WAVES 
           are particularly large and unrelenting.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Out along the reef. Perfect left-
                        hand tubes, eight-footers...

           Way off shore the waves curl beautifully before smashing 
           into the reef.

                                 BIG NORM
                        A wave like that will change your 
                        life...

           A nine-foot wave drives a piece of driftwood into the 
           razor-sharp reef. The wood cracks in two.

                                 NORMAN
                        Or end it.

           Big Norm gets to his feet. Norman looks at him. You’ve 
           got to be kidding. 

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s too big...

                                 BIG NORM
                               (smiles)
                        No such thing.

           EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

           Big Norm and Norman paddle out over the breakers into the 
           channel. The waves look even bigger from the water.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman barely clears several monster swells as they make 
           their way out beyond the breakers to the line-up. 

           Big Norm sees one coming. He paddles hard and drops in 
           just as the nine-foot wave starts to crest. His form is 
           perfect, but the wave is bearing down fast. It breaks 
           right over top of him. He appears to wipe out. 

           Norman looks concerned. Until Big Norm shoots out the 
           other side of the break. Still on the board. Arms raised 
           in triumph. He lets out a primal howl. 

           By the time Big Norm has paddled back out to the line-up, 
           Norman looks like he’s going to be sick. He’s terrified.

                                 NORMAN
                        I can’t do it...

                                 BIG NORM
                        Remember: balance and patience.
                        Keep your back foot down and bail 
                        before the reef. You'll be fine.

                                 NORMAN
                        Seriously, I can't...

                                 BIG NORM
                        Hey. You’re The Boy Wonder. 
                               (smiles)
                        You can do anything.

           Doubt leaves Norman’s eyes. He looks out at the waves 
           like a big cat waiting to pounce.  

           A mountain of water rises out of the ocean. 

           Norman paddles as hard as he can. He drops in just as it 
           crests. Almost falls, but stays up. His left hand grazes 
           the water as he steadies himself. 

           The wave starts to break over top of him. He closes his 
           eyes. Waits to get crushed, but doesn't. His board fits 
           right inside the lip of the curl. A 'tube' of dark blue 
           water forms around him. The sound drops out.

           Norman opens his eyes. The wall of water has formed a 
           swirling cocoon around him. 

           The sound crashes back in as Norman shoots out the other 
           side of the break. He rides out the back of the wave.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Big Norm smiles. Never seen a prouder father. Norman 
           beams, he’s so caught up in the moment that he forgets to 
           bail out. Big Norm sees the jagged white-purple coral 
           heads of the reef bearing down on him. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Bail out. Bail out...

           Too late. The wave slams into the reef. The impact 
           pitches Norman up into the air like a rag doll. 

           He lands hard on the reef. The coral heads slice his 
           skin. The blueberry water turns red.

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           Big Norm helps Norman out of the water. There’s a DEEP 
           GASH on his back. BLOOD trails down his rib cage. 

           Norman is in a lot of pain. Big Norm grabs his tee shirt 
           off the papaya tree. Presses it against the wound to slow 
           the bleeding. The color has drained from Norman’s face. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Is it bad? It feels bad.

           Big Norm pulls the tee shirt away. The gash is still 
           bleeding. It’s just too deep.

           Norman sees the blood-soaked tee shirt. The look of 
           concern on his father’s face. He starts hyperventilating. 

           Norman is on the verge of a full-on PANIC ATTACK. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. 
                        Breathe. Find your rhythm. Find it 
                        and focus on keeping it. Don't 
                        think about anything but that...

           Norman’s eyes flicker to the almost completely blood-
           soaked shirt. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Don't look at it. Look at me. Come 
                        on. Just breathe... 

           Norman focuses. Calms. Gets his breathing under control.  

           A naturally-beautiful NATIVE GIRL, 13 or so, is out 
           picking papayas and placing them in a hand-woven basket.

           The Girl sees Norman bleeding down on the beach. 

           Big Norm sees her. He waves and calls out in Spanish.

           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE -- DAY

           Mud huts thatched with coconut palms just off the coast. 

           Dark-skinned VILLAGERS. The women and children wear 
           ragged clothes. The men wear colorful ponchos. None of 
           them wear shoes. Grey MULES pull a plow through a garden.

           The ‘Papaya' Girl leads Big Norm through the village. He 
           is carrying Norman. Everyone stares as they pass. 

           Norman looks woozy. Pale. He's lost a lot of blood.

           INT. HUT -- DAY

           An elderly MEDICINE WOMAN cleans and sews up the wound. 
           Norman squeezes his father's hand tight. Trying not to 
           cry as the needle goes in and out. 

           The ‘Papaya’ Girl enters with a clay cup filled with 
           coconut milk-based tonic. She gives it to Norman. He 
           looks at the grey liquid in the filthy cup warily. 

           She says something in Spanish. Big Norm translates.

                                 BIG NORM
                        For the pain...

           Norman drinks the tonic. It tastes awful but he forces a 
           smile for her.

           INT. HUT -- DAY

           Norman asleep on a straw mat. The wound has been 
           bandaged. He wakes up. His father is nowhere to be found. 

           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE -- DAY

           Norman walks outside. Finds the village empty. Eerily 
           quiet. He looks in huts. Finds nothing. No one. 

           He hears a COMMOTION down by the beach. 
           EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

           The entire village is on the beach. Big Norm is out in 
           the shallow water, teaching the NATIVE KIDS to surf. 

           The PARENTS look-on from the shore, cheering for the kids 
           as they ride their first waves. All smiles and laughter. 

           The villagers treat Big Norm like he’s one of the family. 

           Norman stands there watching him. How does he do that? 

           Big Norm sees him. He leaves the kids with the boards and 
           runs out the water.

                                 BIG NORM
                        How you feeling?

                                 NORMAN
                        Better. A lot better.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Good. You can help with dinner.

                                 NORMAN
                        What’s for dinner?

           EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

           A palm-woven net full of FISH is lifted out of the water. 

           Big Norm and Norman help the NATIVE MEN drag it to shore.

           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE -- NIGHT

           A fire illuminates empty clay plates of fish bones and 
           corn husks. The whole village sits around the fire.   

           Big Norm is talking with the MEN and WOMEN in Spanish. 

           A pudgy LITTLE KID walks up to Norman and starts touching 
           his hair. A few other KIDS do the same. All grinning in 
           awe and yammering to each other in Spanish.

                                 NORMAN
                        What are they saying?

                                 BIG NORM
                        They’ve never seen blonde hair 
                        before. Apparently they like it.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman is overrun by little hands petting his head. He 
           laughs.

           Norman keeps stealing glances at The ‘Papaya’ Girl. She 
           catches his eye and smiles. He blushes and looks away. 

           Big Norm saw the whole thing. He smiles to himself.

           The Pudgy Kid finds Big Norm’s GUITAR CASE amongst the 
           bags. He eyes it curiously. Big Norm sees him looking at 
           it. He takes out the guitar. Strums a few chords. The 
           Pudgy Kid likes it very much. He wants to hear more.

           Big Norm starts to play “Blue Eyes Cryin’ In The Rain”. 
           Conversations stop amongst the adults. They all listen.

           He sings the first verse in English. The Villagers all 
           enjoy it but are not fully engaged.

           He sings the second verse in Spanish. We start to see 
           smiles of recognition. Appreciation.

           By the time he sings the final refrain, most of the men, 
           women and children sing it with him.

           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE -- NIGHT

           Every star in the sky is visible. Norman scavenges for 
           PALM BRANCHES from all around the beach and jungle.

           Big Norm shows him how to use the fronds and branches to 
           build a LEAN-TO SHELTER. It’s like an all-natural cabana.  

           They lie on straw mats. Looking up at the stars. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        You should get her a gift...
                               (off Norman’s 
                                confused look)
                        The ‘Papaya’ girl. You like her.

           Even in the dark, he can see Norman’s cheeks flush.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Nothing to be embarrassed about. 
                        She's cute. You should give her 
                        something.

                                 NORMAN
                               (after a beat)
                        I can't just give her a gift for 
                        no reason. That's weird.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BIG NORM
                        The best gift is one that's not 
                        for anything. It says you were 
                        thinking about her. Subtext goes a 
                        long way with women. 

           Norman considers this. Big Norm closes his eyes.

                                 NORMAN
                        It was worth it. The 'tube'...

           Big Norm smiles. Nods. Keeps his eyes closed.

                                 NORMAN
                        Where do they come from? Waves.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Storms. Wind. It drives down on 
                        the water. Pushes them out. 

           Big Norm starts to drift off to sleep.

                                 NORMAN
                               (after a moment)
                        I'm glad you brought me down here.

           Big Norm snores in response. He’s out. Norman smiles. 

           He lies in the dark listening to the ocean, looking up at 
           the palm branch roof of the LEAN-TO SHELTER. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- DAY

           Norman finishes building a LEAN-TO SHELTER around his 
           father. He uses a piece of the WING for the roof. 

           The wind has died down but the snow has gotten worse.

           Norman clears the snow off Big Norm, lays the plane's 
           floor rug over him like a blanket. Sits next to him.

                                 NORMAN
                        It's OK... We’re OK... They're 
                        gonna come... They have to come...

           Norman checks his father's WATCH. Still ticking. It 
           reads: 10:37 a.m. We hear just the TICKING of the watch. 
           It gets louder and louder until it becomes the sound of 
           Norman's teeth chattering. The watch again: 11:21 a.m.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Norman huddled under the shelter. Shivering. He searches 
           the sky. Finds only thick clouds. The watch: 12:54 p.m.

           The tips of Norman's hair are frozen. He's freezing. 
           Fighting to stay awake. Big Norm's face has lost color. 
           He doesn't appear to be breathing. The watch: 1:48 p.m.

           Frostbite on Normans lips and hands. His eyelids are 
           heavy. He’s ready to succumb, but then he hears the 
           unmistakable sound of a HELICOPTER. Loud. Getting louder.

           Norman climbs out from under the shelter. The helicopter 
           is right over the treetops. The sound is deafening. The 
           wind from the rotors blows his hair, swirls the fog. But 
           it's just too thick. 

           Norman can't see the helicopter and it can't see him. He 
           jumps up and down. Waving his arms. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Hey! Down here... 

           The sound starts to fade. The wind dies down. Norman’s 
           relief morphs to horror as realizes what’s happening. 

           He just screams "No!" over and over again as the sound 
           fades completely. Just a truly terrible silence.  

           He stands there staring helplessly at the sky. It all 
           becomes too much. He starts crying. Trembling. He runs 
           over and desperately shakes his father's limp body.

                                 NORMAN
                        Wake up! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! 

           His tears freeze as they run down his wind-bitten cheeks. 
           He looks around. Wild eyed. He starts to hyperventilate. 
           Worse than before. 

           This time the PANIC ATTACK takes hold. He struggles to 
           breath. A moment feels like an hour. 

           He remembers. Closes his eyes. Focuses. Calms. Finds his 
           rhythm. His breathing returns to normal.  

           Norman opens his eyes. Looks around with purpose. Finds 
           that the Helicopter has disturbed the fog enough for him 
           to see just how high they are. It’s a long way down.

           He sees a CABIN at the base of the mountain. It looks 
           microscopic from the peak but not so far that he couldn’t 
           make it on foot. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           The problem isn’t the distance. It’s the impossibly steep 
           ICE CHUTE that makes up most of it. It would take a 
           professional climber with full gear hours to get down.  

           Norman has no gear but Big Norm has no time. He looks at 
           his father lying there in the snow. Makes a decision. 

           He starts to looks around for anything he can use to 
           insulate Big Norm before starting down the chute. 

           He picks up an EVERGREEN BRANCH. Runs his fingers through 
           the thick pine needles. Lays it on top of his father. 

           Norman scavenges the mountaintop for the biggest BRANCHES 
           with the thickest pine needles. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH -- SUNRISE

           Norman scavenges the sand for biggest and brightest 
           SEASHELLS. He sees what he’s looking for. 

           A perfect ABALONE SHELL. Norman picks it up. Smiles.

           EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE -- MORNING

           Norman and Big Norm join the natives for breakfast. The 
           ‘Papaya’ Girl sits with a group of KIDS her age. Norman 
           approaches. Gives her the abalone shell he found. 

                                 NORMAN
                        For you...

           She smiles. He smiles. It’s kind of awkward but sweet. 

           EXT. JUNGLE ROAD -- DAY

           The Villagers use their PLOW MULES to drag the pick up 
           truck out of the mud. 

           Norman and Big Norm say 'goodbye' and 'thank you' to the 
           Villagers. Big Norm gets in and starts the engine. 

           Norman starts to climb in. He sees The ‘Papaya’ Girl 
           running up the road. She’s carrying a colorful PONCHO. 

           She gives him the poncho. They share a smile. 

           Norman gets in the truck. Finds Big Norm grinning at him. 
           EXT. PUERTO VALLARTA -- DAY

           The mud-splattered pick up crosses the bridge into town. 

           Norman smiles as they drive up the coast. His clothes are 
           wrinkled, hair matted, he looks like Pig Pen with a tan.  

           EXT. PUERTO VALLARTA -- SUNSET

           Big Norm guides the pickup into a cobblestone driveway 
           that leads to a two-story STUCCO HOUSE overlooking the 
           bay. He honks the horn as they pull in.  

           Norman’s GRANDPARENTS come outside waving and smiling. 

           Big Norm shuts off the engine. Turns to Norman.

                                 BIG NORM
                        So maybe we don't tell Grand Mom 
                        and Grand Pop about getting shot 
                        at, or the bribes, and the reef...
                               (thinks about it)
                        You know what? When they ask how 
                        the drive was, just say ‘good’.

           INT. GRANDPARENTS HOUSE -- NIGHT

           The WASHING MACHINE has been installed and it’s working 
           on overdrive washing Norman and Big Norm’s dirty clothes.

           The guys sit at the dining room table, showered and 
           wearing GRAND POP’s oversized robes. 

           GRAND MOM serves an authentic Mexican FEAST that only a 
           grandmother could make. They eat ravenously.

           EXT. PUERTO VALLARTA -- SUNRISE

           Pre-dawn. Still and quiet. The WAVES are up this morning.

           INT. BEDROOM -- SUNRISE

           Big Norm in a deep sleep. Mouth open. Snoring. Norman 
           enters wearing his WETSUIT. He walks over and stirs him.

           Big Norm sees him standing there in his wetsuit. Smiles. 
           EXT. OCEAN -- MORNING

           Norman and Big Norm paddle out past the breakers. 

           They are the only surfers in the water. Norman has gained 
           confidence. He doesn't fall. Doesn't miss a wave.

           EXT. GRANDPARENTS HOUSE -- DAY

           Grand Mom brings out a tray of piña coladas to the boys 
           who are playing SEVEN CARD STUD. Norman is in a hand with 
           his Grandfather. Big Norm is coaching him. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        ...he’s had the same tell since I 
                        was your age. Just bet big and 
                        he’ll fold. 

           Norman looks at his Grandfather who is stone-faced. 
           Norman hesitates. Then pushes all his chips into the pot. 

           His Grandfather cracks a smirk. Shakes his head. Folds. 

           Norman counts up his winnings as the TELEPHONE rings.  
           Grand Mom goes inside to answer. She listens. Calls out. 

                                 GRAND MOM
                        Hey Norie, it’s Janice...

           Big Norm takes the phone with a smile on his face. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Janisimo! Listen I think we should 
                        forget skiing and surfing and 
                        focus all the kid's attention on 
                        poker. He's a natural... 

           He listens for a beat. His smile fades.  

           Big Norm’s face has lost a shade of color by the time he 
           walks back out to the deck. Something has happened. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        We gotta go back.

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           An EVICTION NOTICE from “The State of California” posted 
           on the Archer's front door. 

           The same notice is posted on every door on Topanga Beach.

           Heartbroken RESIDENTS pack up. Move out.

           Janice is out on her porch collecting the last of her 
           potted plants. She looks like she’s been crying. 

           The mud-splattered pickup comes screeching to a stop. Big 
           Norm and Norman jump out. They run over to Janice. 

           She starts crying as soon as she sees them. Big Norm 
           wraps her in a hug. She sobs. He comforts her.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’ll figure something out...

                        There’s nothing you can do. 

           Rick walks out carrying a cardboard box marked ‘living 
           room’. Janice and Big Norm let go of each other.

                                 RICK
                        We’re out of options. Time’s up. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I need to use your phone...

                                 RICK
                        You’re not listening to me. It’s 
                        been disconnected. Everyone's has.

                                 BIG NORM
                        It’s not over yet...

                                 RICK
                        What are you gonna do? Who are you 
                        gonna call? Tell me. What’s your 
                        magic bullet to save us? 

           Big Norm doesn’t say anything. There’s nothing to say.

                                 RICK
                        It's over. It's been over. 

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- NIGHT

           The last night. EVERYONE is on the beach. The party to 
           end all parties. A big bonfire. Food. Dancing. Booze. 

           The HOUSES are all empty. Awaiting Demolition. We see 
           CONSTRUCTION CONES and ‘CAUTION’ TAPE all over.

           A six-piece DIXIE BAND plays on the Archer’s empty porch.

           CONTINUED:

           Janice dances in a crowd with Bob Barrow, Al Freedman, 
           ‘Beer Can’ Larry and a bunch of other WOMEN. 

           Rick tends to a grill with a beer in-hand. He talks with 
           a couple of OLD TIMERS.

                                 RICK
                        ...found us a place up in The 
                        Palisades. Quiet neighborhood. 
                        It'll be good for Norman. He'll 
                        have some stability, we can set  
                        boundaries. Don't get me wrong, I 
                        love it here, but it's not the 
                        best environment to raise a ki...

           He trails off as Big Norm approaches and takes three one-
           hundred dollar bills out of his wallet. 

                                 RICK
                        You don’t have to...

                                 BIG NORM
                        Bet’s a bet.

           Big Norm places the money in Rick’s hand. He grabs a 
           BOTTLE OF VODKA and a glass and walks off down the beach.

           Norman sits around the bonfire with Trafton, Elly and a 
           few other TEENAGERS who are drinking and passing a joint. 
           None of the adults seem to notice or care.

           Norman sees his father sitting off by himself sipping 
           vodka on the rocks and staring blankly out at the ocean. 
           He walks down the beach. Sits in the sand beside him. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Can the state really just take 
                        anyone's house whenever they want?

                                 BIG NORM
                        They gotta have a reason, but they 
                        can always find one. And they have 
                        to pay you, but they get to decide 
                        how much... so, basically, “yes”.

                                 NORMAN
                        That’s bullshit.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Yeah. Well. Call your congressman.

           Big Norm takes a long sip of his drink.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 NORMAN
                        But they're not taking your house 
                        though. Right?

                                 BIG NORM
                        They just want the beach.

           Big Norm finishes his drink. Goes to refill his glass. 
           Norman doesn’t want that to happen. He notices THE WAVES.

                                 NORMAN
                        You want to go out? 

           Big Norm stops pouring. Looks at him. You kidding?

                                 BIG NORM
                        It’s too dark...

                                 NORMAN
                               (smiles)
                        No such thing.

           EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

           Norman and Big Norm go NIGHT SURFING. The fire reflects 
           off the water. Illuminates them in an orange glow. 

           They paddle out. Disappear into the darkness beyond the 
           breakers and reappear moments later on a cresting wave.

           Norman has a smile on his face every time. Big Norm never 
           does. His heart isn’t in it. His head is somewhere else. 

           Eventually he stops all together and sits floating on his 
           board out beyond the breakers. He looks numb.

           Norman paddles up beside him. Sits on his board. 

           They just float in silence for awhile, lit by firelight, 
           listening to the Dixie Band, watching the party.

                                 NORMAN
                        So, Rick was saying they're gonna 
                        make the beach into a park. So, we 
                        can still come down whenever we 
                        want. Go surfing, have fires. 
                        We're not even moving far. Just up 
                        the hill. So, I can skateboard 
                        down to your house any time...
                               (beat)
                        So. Really. Nothing has to change.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Big Norm starts laughing uncontrollably. A sudden jarring 
           sound. Norman watches him. Concerned. Confused.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Sorry. I'm not laughing at you.

           The laughter fades. He composes himself. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I wish I could see this thing 
                        through your eyes, kid. I really 
                        do. All you see is beach bums and 
                        some shitty houses with bad 
                        plumbing. You don't know what we 
                        had here, so you don't know what 
                        we're losing... 
                               (off the silence)
                        This place... wasn't just a beach. 
                        It was a whole community of people 
                        living their lives for themselves. 
                        I know that sounds basic. But, as 
                        you get older, it gets harder and 
                        harder to do. You'll see. It 
                        creeps up on you. Job. House. Car. 
                        Responsibilities. Schedules. 
                        Deadlines. Most people wake up one 
                        day and their lives aren't their 
                        own anymore...
                               (a sad smile)
                        People here get that you only get 
                        to do this thing once. Doctors and 
                        Drifters living side-by-side 
                        having only that in common and it 
                        was so much more than enough.

           Norman sees the tears in his father’s eyes. He can’t tell 
           if they’re from the saltwater.

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- NIGHT

           Big Norm and Norman walk out of the ocean carrying their 
           boards. The silhouette of a WOMAN walks up behind them.

                                 SANDRA O/S
                        You guys are nuts...

           Sandra steps out of the darkness. She looks beautiful.

                                 SANDRA
                        I mean I always knew you were 
                        nuts, but, surfing in the dark? 
                        Just a special kind of insanity.

           CONTINUED:

           Big Norm and Sandra hold a loaded look.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You heard?

           She nods.

                                 BIG NORM
                        That why you came back?

           She shakes her head. So much said with only their eyes. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’m sorry, about...

                                 SANDRA
                        Me too.

           The slightest of smiles. He goes to her. She meets him 
           halfway. They hug for a long time. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Let's get you a drink...

           The three of them begin back towards the party.

                                 SANDRA
                        I shouldn’t.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Oh if ever there was a night you 
                        should...

                                 SANDRA
                        I mean I can’t.

           Big Norm stops walking and looks at her. His eyes flicker 
           to her stomach. You saying what I think you're saying?

           Sandra smiles. Bites her lip. Nods ever so slightly. She 
           gives him a moment to process it all. 

                                 SANDRA
                        You good with that?

           Big Norm smiles for the first time in a long time. He 
           pulls her into a hug that lifts her off ground. 

           Norman has no idea what's going on but his dad is smiling 
           again and that's all that matters.
           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           That same sleepy subdivision in the hills of Malibu. A 
           MOVING TRUCK is parked outside the 1940's Craftsman Home.

           Rick, Janice and Norman help the MOVERS unload boxes.

           Norman stops to look around at his new neighborhood. 
           Observes the utter soul-crushing sameness of the houses 
           and yards. He's a stranger in a strange land.

           CAROL and BOB, middle-aged, overly-friendly, walk up the 
           driveway with big smiles. Carol carries a TUNA CASSEROLE. 
           Norman is the only one outside at the moment. 

                                 CAROL
                        Hi there! I'm Carol Calloway. This 
                        is my husband, Bob Calloway. We 
                        live just down the hill. The white 
                        house with the red shutters...

           They wait for him to say something. He doesn't.

                                 CAROL
                        What's your name?

                                 NORMAN
                        Norman. What’s that?

                                 CAROL
                        Just a little welcome to the 
                        neighborhood. My famous tuna 
                        casserole. Do you like tuna 
                        casserole?

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah. I love it.

           Carol smiles. What a sweet little boy.

                                 NORMAN
                        But it makes me shit my brains 
                        out.

           Carol’s plastic smile fades. 

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT

           BOXES everywhere. FURNITURE wrapped in plastic. 

           Janice and Rick unpack boxes. Norman was helping but now 
           he’s too distraught.

                        I don't want to go a new school.

                                 JANICE
                        It's how the districts are drawn. 
                        There's nothing we can do. It’s a 
                        really good school.

                                 NORMAN
                        But it’s not my school...

                                 RICK
                        This one's better. You might 
                        actually learn something. And they 
                        have a good little Pop Warner 
                        football team. Most middle schools 
                        don't even offer football.

                                 NORMAN
                        Who gives a shit about football?

                                 RICK
                        Watch your mouth.

                                 NORMAN
                               (after a beat)
                        You said nothing was gonna change.

                                 RICK
                        Life is a long series of 
                        disappointments and readjustments. 
                        Sooner you learn that the better.

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- EARLY MORNING

           Janice packs a bagged lunch. Rick is at the kitchen 
           table, drinking coffee and reading the newspaper.

           Norman walks in wearing the PONCHO he got from The 
           'Papaya' Girl. Rick chokes on his coffee.

                                 RICK
                        Really?

           Janice gives him a hard look. Leave him alone. 

                                 RICK
                        I just think for the first day...

           Norman takes the bagged lunch and heads for the door.
           INT. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

           The moment before the bell. A class of noisy SIXTH GRADE 
           KIDS talk, laugh, tell stories about their summers. 

           The kids are all well-dressed, preppy, wearing their best 
           outfits for the first day of school.  

           Norman walks into class wearing the poncho. The Kids all 
           turn and stare. It gets quiet. Norman’s cheeks flush.

           He sits and sinks down into his chair. The bell rings.

           INT. CAFETERIA -- DAY

           Norman eats his bagged lunch at a table by himself. He 
           sees another BOY across the room eating alone. 

           The boy is playing with little GREEN ARMY MEN. He’s 
           slight and shy. None of the other KIDS even look at him. 
           It’s like he doesn't exist. This is TIMMY. 

           Timmy seems perfectly content in his own little world.  

           Norman watches as ZACK, 12, biggest kid in class, crosses 
           the cafeteria to Timmy with a few little JOCK types. 

           Zack grabs one of the Army Men. He laughs as they play 
           keep away and Timmy tries desperately to get it back.

           Norman watches it happen. He looks like he wants to say 
           or do something but doesn't. 

           Finally Timmy manages to get the toy back. Zack and his 
           minions decides he’s had enough. 

           Zack sees Norman staring at him. He gives him a hard 
           look. You want some?  Norman looks away.

           I/E. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           Rick mows the lawn with a brand-new John Deere RIDING 
           MOWER. He looks content.

           Janice has just finished loading the DISHWASHER. She 
           can't get it to start. She looks frustrated.

           Norman walks into the kitchen carrying his overnight bag. 
           He watches his mother as she opens and closes the 
           dishwasher. Flips levers. Pushes buttons. Nothing works.
           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           A long, steep HILL connects The Suburbs to The Shore. 

           Norman SKATEBOARDS down the hill. He stays upright and 
           weaves back and forth to keep from going too fast. 

           Carol is in her front yard trimming her ROSE BUSHES. 
           Norman skates past. She shoots him a disapproving look.

           EXT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- DAY

           We can see BULLDOZERS flattening Topanga Beach from the 
           driveway. Most of the houses are already rubble. 

           Norman skates up just as the bulldozers bear down on The 
           Yellow Submarine House. 

           He watches until the pylons crack and the house collapses 
           in on itself. A dust cloud rises where it stood. 

           EXT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- SUNSET

           The bulldozers have stopped. It’s quiet. The sky is a 
           thousand different shades of orange. 

           Norman, Big Norm and Sandra eat Chinese takeout on the 
           porch overlooking the ocean. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        ...you don't weight enough to win 
                        the downhill. So unless you gain 
                        20 pounds or we find a loophole in 
                        the laws of gravity, the slalom is 
                        our best shot. 

           Sandra smiles through a mouthful of Kung Pao chicken.

                                 SANDRA
                        I vote for the weight gain. Misery 
                        loves company. 

           Big Norm pulls her into a kiss while she's still chewing. 
           She giggles. It's a sweet moment. Norman looks confused.  

                                 NORMAN
                        It doesn't matter what race we 
                        choose. I'm too little. I'll never 
                        be able to go fast enough to win.

                        True. On fresh powder, you don't 
                        have a chance. That's why we're 
                        not focus on powder...

                                 NORMAN
                        What are we gonna focus on?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Ice.
                               (beat)
                        The other kids will avoid it, 
                        you're gonna aim for it. If you 
                        can master ice, you level the 
                        playing field. 

           INT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- NIGHT

           Sandra brings in the last of the plates and glasses. She 
           starts to help them wash. She yawns. Big Norm sees it.

                                 BIG NORM
                        We got this. Don’t worry about it. 
                        Go. Lie down. Relax. 

           He gives her a tender kiss. She smiles. They kiss again. 
           She heads back to the bedroom. Norman look suspicious.

                                 NORMAN
                        What's going on around here? You 
                        guys are acting weird...

                                 BIG NORM
                        What do you mean 'weird’?

                                 NORMAN
                        I don't know. Like. Happy. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        We are happy.

                                 NORMAN
                        You haven't fought once since 
                        she’s been back. She's not 
                        drinking. You're doing stuff 
                        around the house. It's like a 
                        'Twilight Zone' episode...

           Big Norm tries to hide his smile but Norman sees it. 

                                 NORMAN
                        What’s going on?

           Big Norm takes a beat to find the right words.

                                 BIG NORM
                        How would you feel about having a 
                        little brother or sister?

           It takes Norman a moment to process what he means.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Don’t tell her I said anything. 

           INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Sandra has fallen asleep on top of the covers. The lights 
           are on and she’s still wearing her clothes. 

           Norman heads back to his room. Sees her sleeping. 

           She looks peaceful. He walks in and gently pulls the 
           BLANKET over her. He smiles and turns off the light.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- DAY

           The storm is starting to fade but so is the daylight.

           Norman has covered Big Norm from head-to-toe in a BLANKET 
           OF EVERGREEN BRANCHES. He places the last few on his 
           chest. Brushes the snow out of his hair. Takes a moment.  

                                 NORMAN
                        I'm gonna get help... 

           Big Norm doesn't move or make a sound. He’s pale. Doesn’t 
           appear to be breathing. Norman has tears in his eyes. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Just hang in a little longer... 
                        OK... Dad? Daddy? 

           He kisses his father’s forehead and wipes away his tears.

                                 NORMAN
                        Just a little longer.

           Norman moves to the edge of the ICE CHUTE. Looks down the 
           impossibly sheer face marked with rocks. Veiled in fog. 

           He studies the chute like a chess master reading a board. 
           A calm washes over. He starts to descend. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He jams his bare hands through the ice crust over and 
           over again. He’s not wincing anymore. No feeling left. 

           He always keeps an edge with his sneakers. His weight is 
           balanced. His movements deliberate and controlled. He 
           takes his time. Doesn’t rush. One foot after the other. 

           It’s slow going but he’s making progress until a sudden 
           strong GUST OF WIND nearly blows him off the mountain. 

           He waits for it to pass. It does. He is about to continue 
           down when he hears a series of loud CRACKS above him.

           He looks up just as one the EVERGREENS the plane crashed 
           into comes down. It crashes into the chute and takes off 
           like a missile. It’s headed right for him. 

           He swings out of it’s path just in time. The tree rockets 
           past. Hits a rock. Splinters. Disappears into the fog. 

           It’s quiet again. Norman catches his breath. Composes 
           himself. He starts to descend. Then stops when he hears 
           what sounds like a WOMAN’S VOICE calling out. 

           He turns toward the sound and, through the fog, sees the 
           silhouette of a WOMAN on the other side of the chute. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Sandra...

           He frantically climbs back up and across the chute to get 
           to her. Nearly slips several times in his haste.

           He finds Sandra still buckled into her seat. Shivering. 
           She’s just regaining consciousness. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Norman? ... Where’s Norm?

           Norman takes the bomber jacket off. Wraps it around her.

                                 NORMAN
                        He’s... OK. Knocked out. He needs 
                        help. I’m going to get help. 

           She moves to undo the buckle. Cries out in pain.

                                 SANDRA
                        My arm...

           Norman looks at her arm. It’s BROKEN in several places. 
           Ugly discoloration. Internal bleeding. It’s bad.

                                 SANDRA
                        Someone will come...

                                 NORMAN
                        No. They won’t. I have to go. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Don’t leave me.

                                 NORMAN
                        I can help you down. 

                                 SANDRA
                        No. Please. Just. Wait. For a 
                        little while. They’ll come.

           Norman looks at the sky. The daylight is fading fast. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Please. 

           He can see that she’s completely terrified. He sighs. OK.

           They huddle together for warmth. Sandra leans her head on 
           his shoulder and closes her eyes. 

                                 NORMAN
                        You gotta stay awake. If we fall 
                        asleep, we won’t wake up.

           Norman stares out at the sky. Lost in his thoughts.

           A heated shouting match between Rick and Janice at the 
           dinner table. Norman tries to ignore them.

                        This is normal. This is how people

                                 JANICE
                        I did. I hate it. I miss my house,

                                 JANICE
                        Maybe I will.

           She’s not kidding. Rick turns beet red. He’s about to 
           explode. Norman really doesn’t want that.

           Rick softens. Allows a little smile.

                                 RICK
                        Yeah. Sure.

           The bomb is diffused. They go back to eating in peace. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY

           A stoic Pop Warner FOOTBALL COACH presides over the 
           tryouts being run by his overzealous ASSISTANTS.

           A PUNT RETURN DRILL: The first few KIDS that go make it 
           less than ten yards before being taken down. 

           Norman is up. He’s wearing a helmet and pads that are way 
           too big. Zack and his Little Jock minions are among the 
           eleven kids that will try to tackle him. 

           Norman catches the punt on the run. He makes the first 
           tackler miss. Then the second. And third. And fourth.

           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           Janice is in the front yard PLANTING FLOWERS. 

           Norman sits on the step with his ski gear packed beside 
           him. They both hear the roar of the PORSCHE ENGINE before 
           they see it.

           The car stops in-front of the house. Big Norm gets out. 
           Sandra waves to Janice from the front seat. 

           Norman loads his gear as Big Norm approaches Janice. He 
           smiles as he takes in her new suburban surroundings.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Look at you. All domesticated. You

                        OK. Good start. Go again. And stay 
                        in the path you just carved. It’ll 
                        be slicker but you’ll go faster.   

           Norman runs the course again. Stays in his path. He’s 
           doing well until he hits an ice patch and wipes out. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Again...

           Norman goes again. This time he makes it a little further 
           but wipes out even harder. Big Norm resets the stopwatch. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Again.

           Norman doesn’t even make it to the first gate. He hits an 
           ice patch and slides into a bush. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Again.

           Norman makes it all the way through the course this time, 
           but only because he’s going almost comically slow. He’s 
           hesitant. Afraid. Taking turns wide. Staying upright. 

           Norman crosses the finish line. The STOPWATCH: “1:07.35” 
           Big Norm just shakes his head.

                                 BIG NORM
                        OK. New plan. We’ve gotta learn to 
                        crawl before you can walk.

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Big Norm uses the GROUNDSKEEPER’S hose to wet down a very 
           short, very steep hill that connects the ski lodge to the 
           parking lot. Confused SKIERS stare as they pass by.

           The short hill has frozen solid. It’s now a SHEET OF ICE. 
           Big Norm and Norman stand at the top. Both in ski gear.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Always keep an edge. It doesn't 
                        matter if you only slip a half 
                        inch, on ice, you'll never stop. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Big Norm sets his poles and takes off down the hill. He 
           does three perfect turns. Glides to a nice, easy stop.

           Norman nods to himself. Simple enough. He sets his poles 
           and takes off. He tries to turn. His skis go out from 
           under him. He falls hard on his ass and tumbles down the 
           hill. He lands in a crumpled heap at his dad’s feet.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Do I even need to say it?

           Norman tries again. He falls hard right away. Tumbles. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Keep an edge...

           Norman tries again. He makes one turn but loses the edge 
           on the second. His skis slide out and detach as he 
           tumbles.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Lean into the turns...

           Norman tries again. This time he just flies straight down 
           without turning and crashes into a parked car. He just 
           lies there.

                                 NORMAN
                        I can’t do it.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Well we're not leaving until you 
                        do, so...

           Norman starts to complain. Big Norm cuts him off.

                                 BIG NORM
                        It's not my job to choose your 
                        goals, but it's my job to make 
                        sure you meet them. Again.

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

           It’s dark. The lodge is closed. The street lamps are on. 

           Norman is still trying to get those three turns. Big Norm 
           is still giving him instructions, encouragement.

           The Porsche is the only car left in the parking lot. 

           Sandra sits in the front seat with the heat and radio on. 
           She watches Norman fall again. Rolls down the window.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SANDRA
                        Come on, Norm. That’s enough. Let 
                        him do it tomorrow. It’s freezing.

           Norman is at the top, sore, shivering, exhausted. He sets 
           himself and prepares to go again. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Listen to me. You're not skiing 
                        anymore, you're just trying not to 
                        fall. Don’t think. Just clear your 
                        head and trust yourself.

           Norman clears his head. A calm washes over. He takes off. 

           He does three perfect turns. Glides to a nice, easy stop. 

           Big Norm raises his arms in triumph. Sandra applauds from 
           the car. Norman smiles.

           INT. MOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Norman has just stepped out of a steaming HOT SHOWER. He 
           wears a towel around his waist. 

           He notices black-and-blue BRUISES running up the back of 
           his legs from the falls. They’re still tender. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Sandra is in bed, under the covers, reading a book. Big 
           Norm is waiting to get in the shower. 

           Norman steps out of the bathroom. A steam cloud follows. 
           He shivers as walks into the room.

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s freezing in here.

                                 SANDRA
                        I told you. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        You guys are wimps.

                                 SANDRA
                        Fine. We’re wimps. You’re tough. 
                        Just turn up the heat.

           Big Norm goes over to the thermostat. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NORMAN
                        You really don’t think it’s cold?

                                 BIG NORM
                        I am conditioned for all elements.

           Sandra and Norman exchange a look. Oh please.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Mind over matter. I’m not cold 
                        because I choose not to be cold.

           He smiles. Peels off his shirt and heads into the shower. 

           Sandra grows a mischievous smile.

                                 SANDRA
                        Want to test his conditioning?

           EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT

           Sandra and Norman fill two ice buckets with SNOW BALLS.

           INT. MOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT

           Big Norm is in a nice hot shower. STEAM fogs the mirrors. 
           The door opens slowly. Quietly. 

           Sandra and Norman sneak in with their buckets. They 
           coordinate the attack with eye contact and hand signals. 

           Norman sets his bucket on the counter. Tip toes over to 
           the shower curtain. 3... 2... 1... He pulls it back.

           Big Norm lets out a shriek as Sandra’s first snow ball 
           hits him straight in the chest. They unload on him. He 
           dances around yelping, laughing, begging them to stop.

           Big Norm gains the upper hand when wraps himself in the 
           shower curtain and starts forming the slush in the tub 
           into balls and throwing it back at them. 

           Norman and Sandra retreat to the room and laugh until it 
           hurts. They compose themselves. 

           Sandra suddenly realizes.

                                 SANDRA
                        I want pie.
           INT. 24-HOUR DINER -- LATE NIGHT

           Norman, Sandra and Big Norm are the only customers in the 
           restaurant. Big Norm sips coffee and watches Norman and 
           Sandra finish off two huge pieces of BOSTON CREAM PIE. 

           Sandra signals the WAITRESS for two more. Norman gives 
           her a high five. Big Norm shakes his head. 

           They look like a family.

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- DAY

           Norman skis the SLALOM PRACTICE COURSE. He’s brushing the 
           gates. Attacking the patches of ice. Really flying. 

           Norman crosses the finish line. The STOPWATCH: “53.10”   

           Norman skids to a stop in-front of Big Norm. He’s out of 
           breath. They’ve clearly been at this for awhile.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You’re gonna have to be under 50 
                        seconds to have a chance...
                               (beat)
                        How you feeling? Tired? Worn out?

           Norman nods. Still panting. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Completely, totally exhausted? 
                        Like there is absolutely no way 
                        that you can do another run?

           Norman nods emphatically.

                                 BIG NORM
                        OK. One more.

           Norman is still catching his breath as he gets back on 
           the chairlift.

           INT. SCHOOL -- DAY

           Picture Day. The SIXTH GRADERS wear their Sunday best.

           THROUGH A CAMERA LENS: A steady succession of cherubic 
           little FACES, each cuter than the last -- girl with 
           pigtails, boy with freckles -- all with perfect hair and 
           perfect smiles which makes it all the more jarring when:

           CONTINUED:

           Norman sits down. Windburned cheeks. Chapped lips. His 
           hair is matted like it's been under a wool cap for days. 

           He smiles but then yawns as the picture is snapped.

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Norman is asleep at his desk. He snores. Mouth open. A 
           little puddle of drool.

           His TEACHER wakes him up to give him his REPORT CARD. We 
           see a lot of the letter "D" and "F". 

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT

           Norman sits glumly at the kitchen table. Rick is holding 
           his report card. Janice paces back and forth. She’s mad.

                                 JANICE
                        ...you go to school. You come 
                        home. No Surfing. No skiing. No 
                        friends. Nothing. Just school.

           Rick nods in righteous agreement.

                                 NORMAN
                        What about football?

                                 JANICE
                        No.

           Rick stops nodding.

                                 RICK
                        Hang on. Let’s not be too rash. 
                        Football has been good for him. 
                        It's a school activity. He's 
                        learning discipline, teamwork, 
                        both things he sorely lacks. And 
                        he's just starting to make 
                        friends. Yes, this report card is 
                        unacceptable and he should be 
                        punished, I just think there's a 
                        bigger picture to consider.

           Norman gives her the best puppy dog look he can muster. 

                                 JANICE
                        Fine. School. Football. Home. 
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY

           Practice. Norman wearing pads and a helmet that fit now. 
           He is the starting RUNNING BACK. 

           Norman is by far the best athlete on the field. The whole 
           offense is built around getting him the ball.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

           Norman has showered and changed. He packs up his GYM BAG.  
           Zack and the JOCKS all respect him now. He’s one of them. 

           EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY

           Norman walks out carrying his gym bag. He finds Timmy 
           sitting on the steps, playing with his Green Army Men.

           Norman sits all the way on the other side of the steps. 
           Timmy looks at him. Norman keeps his eyes straight ahead.

                                 TIMMY
                        Hi. 

           Norman ignores him. Timmy is used to it.  

           The Porsche pulls up. Norman practically runs to it. He 
           sees Sandra in the car. SKIS loaded in the roof rack. 

                                 NORMAN
                        But mom said...

                        My weekend. My rules.

           Norman smiles. Goes to get in the car.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Not so fast. Go get your math 
                        book. You're studying the whole 
                        way up and back. And in the room.

           EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY

           Norman comes back outside carrying his MATH BOOK. 

           He is startled to find Timmy showing Big Norm his Army 
           Men.

                        and this guy is a Staff Sergeant, 
                        And even though The Corporal is 
                        bigger, he's outranked.
                               (off Timmy’s nod)
                        OK. I get it now. How do you know 
                        so much about this stuff?

                                 TIMMY
                        My dad was a Staff Sergeant... he 
                        won a medal... they gave it to my 
                        mom...

           Big Norm's smile fades. He sees Norman standing there.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You guys know each other?

           Timmy nods. Norman shakes his head. Big Norm gets it.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Nice talking to you, Timmy.

           The phone rings. Big Norm rolls over and answers. He 
           listens for a beat. Then sits up in bed with a smile.

                                 BIG NORM
                        We’re on our way...

           He hangs up. Nods to Norman. They both start putting on 
           their snow pants.

                                 SANDRA
                        Seriously? 

           They keep getting dressed.

                                 SANDRA
                        Can't you just go tomorrow? Come 
                        on. I’m tired, I don’t feel good. 
                        Don't make me get dressed and 
                        drive all the way over there... 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Stay. Finish the movie.

                                 SANDRA
                        You're just gonna leave me here 
                        all by myself?

           Big Norm puts on his coat. Sandra takes his hand. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Please. Just. Stay.

           He leans in and gives her a soft kiss. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Take a bath. We won't be long. 

           He zips up his coat and heads for the door. She sighs.

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- NIGHT

           HALOGEN LIGHTS illuminate the SLALOM PRACTICE COURSE. 

           Norman and Big Norm are the only skiers on the mountain. 
           They ride the CHAIRLIFT together. 

           They get off the lift and make their way to the top of 
           the hill. The course is covered in fresh powder. The RED 
           AND BLUE GATES are all buried, hardly visible

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BIG NORM
                        Decide where you're going before 
                        you go. Visualize every turn...

           Big Norm sets his poles. Prepares to take off.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You should do all your thinking up 
                        here, then let instinct take over. 
                        If you're thinking during the run, 
                        you're doing something wrong...

           Big Norm reads the course. Then explodes down the hill.

           Norman watches in awe as his father attacks the course. 
           Perfect form. No fear. Big Norm looks like an Olympic 
           racer. He stays low, brushes the gates within inches.

           Big Norm skids to a stop at the bottom, sends a plume of 
           powder into the air. He takes out the STOPWATCH.

           Norman sets his poles. Reads the course. Launches himself 
           down the hill. No hesitation. No fear. He’s really 
           flying. Carving. Staying low. Brushing the gates. He 
           drops into a racer’s crouch for the final hundred yards.

           Norman crosses the finish line. The STOPWATCH: “48.97”   

           Norman skids to a stop in-front of Big Norm who just 
           shows him the stopwatch with a proud smile. Norman reads 
           the time but doesn’t smile. 

                                 NORMAN
                        I can do better.

           Big Norm nods. Norman skis back to the chairlift. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- LATE NIGHT

           The snow has stopped. The CARS in the parking lot are all 
           covered. The Porsche pulls in. Chains on the tires.

           Big Norm and Norman walk to the room with their gear. Big 
           Norm also carries a BOSTON CREAM PIE from that diner.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATE NIGHT

           ON TV: Some random infomercial with an overzealous HOST. 

           Sandra is nowhere to be found. We hear WATER running. Big 
           Norm walks in first. Norman follows.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        Don’t be mad. We come bearing pie.

           Silence. Just the sound water and the infomercial. They 
           step onto the carpet. It squishes under their feet.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Sandra...

           They hurry into the bathroom where they find the bath tub 
           overflowing and Sandra UNCONSCIOUS on the floor. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Sandra?!

           Norman stares at the BLOOD running down her leg. 

                                 NORMAN O/S
                        Sandra, get up...

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- DAY

           Sandra drifts in and out of consciousness. Norman has to 
           keep jostling her to keep her awake.

                                 NORMAN
                        ...wake up. You can’t sleep.

           The daylight is almost gone. The temperature has dropped. 
           Sandra’s arm has swollen. The discoloration and bleeding 
           have gotten worse. She’s pale. Her lips are blue. 

           Norman’s eyelids are heavy. He catches himself drifting 
           off. That’s it. They can’t wait any longer. 

                                 NORMAN
                        We have to go. Now. Come on. Get 
                        up. We’re out of time.

           He gets to his feet. She stays curled under the jacket. 

           He looks for anything they can use. He sees a young 
           evergreen tree up the hill. He climbs up to it and breaks 
           off it’s sturdiest BRANCH. Strips the needles and twigs. 
           He climbs down to Sandra and gives her the branch.

                                 NORMAN
                        Use this like an ice axe...

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He shows her how to jam it into the ice crust and hang 
           from it. The branch holds his weight.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’ll go first and stay under you. 
                        Lean all your weight on me. 

           He helps her to her feet. She grimaces. Her broken arm 
           dangles. Norman uses his belt to make a sling for her. 

           Sandra takes one look at the ice chute, the jagged rocks, 
           the suffocating fog. She starts crying. Terrified.  

                                 SANDRA
                        I can’t do this...

                                 NORMAN
                        Just don’t look down. We’ll take 
                        it one step at a time... 

           She just keeps saying “I can’t” over and over again.  

                                 NORMAN
                        Hey. Look at me. I won’t let 
                        anything bad happen. I promise.

           She can see in his eyes that he means it. She calms. 

           They make their way to the edge of the chute. Norman goes 
           in first. He jams his bare hands through the ice. Keeps 
           an edge with his sneakers. Sandra uses her anchor branch. 

           She eases her weight onto his shoulders. They begin down.

           Norman’s muscles tremble under the strain. Sandra doesn’t 
           weigh much, but she weighs more than him. His HANDS turn 
           bright red as he rakes them in-and-out of the ice.   

           They make slow, steady progress. One step at a time. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- MORNING

           DOCTORS and NURSES go about their business. Norman is 
           asleep on a bench, still wearing his snow pants. 

           Big Norm walks out of the ICU. Physically and emotionally 
           drained. He doesn’t look like he slept at all. 

           Norman wakes up as Big Norm sits down beside him. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NORMAN
                        Can I see her?

                                 BIG NORM
                        She's resting...

                                 NORMAN
                        Can I see her when she wakes up?

                                 BIG NORM
                        She doesn’t want to see you...
                               (softens)
                        She doesn’t want to see anyone.

           Norman looks hurt. Big Norm fighting emotion. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        We're gonna have to put the 
                        training on a hold for awhile...

                                 NORMAN
                        OK.

           Norman sees his dad’s lip trembling, tears in his eyes.

                                 BIG NORM
                        I’m sorry, it’s just, she’s...

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s OK.

           He puts his hand on top of his dad’s hand. Big Norm 
           breaks down in tears. 

           Norman hugs him as hard as he can. 

           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           The neighborhood tress are bare. Bob Calloway is taking 
           down his over-the-top Christmas decorations. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY

           A Pop Warner PLAYOFF GAME. The stands are crowded with 
           cheering PARENTS. The SCOREBOARD: Q4 -- “0:09” -- “28-28”

           Rick and Janice are in the front row. Rick has a SUPER 8 
           VIDEO CAMERA set up on a tripod, recording the game.

           NORMAN’S TEAM has the ball on their own 15 yard line. 
           Time for just one more play. Norman lines up at tailback.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Zack - the quarterback - snaps the ball and pitches it to 
           Norman who sprints to the outside. The defense closes in.

           Norman stops on a dime, cuts back and runs all the way to 
           the other side of the field. Leaving would-be TACKLERS 
           diving at his heels. He scores with no time left.

           The crowd goes wild. Norman’s TEAMMATES rush him.

           INT. SHAKEY’S PIZZA -- DAY

           Norman, Rick and Janice eat a celebratory postgame pizza. 
           Norman still wears his mud-stained jersey and eye black.

                                 RICK
                        ...I know I'm biased 'cause he's 
                        my kid, but he's just so much 
                        better than the other kids.

           Janice smiles, mostly because he said ‘my kid’.

                                 RICK
                        I was down at USC the other day, 
                        catching up with Coach Robinson. 
                        He's a good friend. I told him 
                        about you. He said anytime you 
                        want to come down and watch a 
                        practice, maybe meet some of the 
                        players. You're welcome.

                                 NORMAN
                        Cool.

           Janice excuses herself to go to the girl’s room. Rick 
           clears his throat, searches for the right words. 

                                 RICK
                        I know things haven't always been 
                        great, with you and me, but... 
                        you’ve shown a lot of maturity 
                        these last few weeks, and... I 
                        just wanted you to know that I’ve 
                        noticed. 

           Rick goes back to his pizza. Norman smiles.

           EXT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           A familiar old VW BUS is parked out front. Trafton sits 
           on the hood smoking a cigarette.

           He tosses it as Rick guides the wood-paneled STATION 
           WAGON into the driveway. Norman, Rick and Janice get out. 

           Trafton smiles as he takes in Norman’s football jersey.

                                 TRAFTON
                        Boy Ollestad. Gone Sporto. Never 
                        thought I'd see the day...

           Norman laughs, suddenly self-conscious.

                                 TRAFTON
                        You know they reopened the beach a 
                        couple weeks ago...

                                 NORMAN
                        I heard. Been meaning to get down 
                        to check it out.

                                 TRAFTON
                        No time like the present.

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           Just looks like any other beach now. There’s no evidence 
           of the houses anywhere. It's like they were never there. 

           Norman and Trafton are out with a bunch of other SURFERS. 

           Norman sits on his board, beyond the breakers. He stares 
           in at the empty beach. Elly paddles up. Sees him staring.

                                 ELLY
                        Weird. Right?

                                 NORMAN
                        So weird. 

           She sits on her board. They float there for a beat.

                                 ELLY
                        Haven't seen you around in awhile?

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah. Been busy. School and stuff.

           She nods. A wave rises out of the ocean. 

                                 ELLY
                        You should come by more often. 
                        Trafton misses you.

           She smiles as she paddles hard onto the wave. He watches 
           her ride it all the way to shore.

           EXT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- SUNSET

           Norman walks up the driveway, carrying his yellow-railed 
           SURFBOARD. He leans it next to his dad’s ‘GUN’ BOARD.

           INT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- SUNSET

           Norman walks inside. The front door is open but there 
           doesn’t appear anyone home. He sees a few SYMPATHY CARDS 
           on the mantle, some DEAD FLOWERS with “get well” notes in 
           the trash, an open BOTTLE OF WINE on the counter.

           He finds Sandra sitting outback, sipping wine, staring 
           blankly out at the ocean. A light has gone out in her.  

           He sits beside her. He smiles. She doesn’t.

                                 NORMAN
                        Where’s dad?

                                 SANDRA
                        I don't know. Suing something? 
                        Defending someone? Just generally 
                        being a better person than I am...

           She finishes her wine in one gulp.

                                 SANDRA
                        So. Big race this weekend. You 
                        excited? 

                                 NORMAN
                        Are you gonna come up? Or...

                                 SANDRA
                        Wouldn't miss it. I mean you 
                        worked so hard. I know it means a 
                        lot to you. To both of you. 

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s just a race...

           She looks back out at the ocean.

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah.
           I/E. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           Rick is digging a FIRE PIT in the backyard. There are 
           cases of BEER stacked on the deck.

           Janice is in the kitchen on the PHONE. Smiling. She’s got 
           a list of names and phone numbers, some are checked off.

                                 JANICE
                        ...call it a reunion if you want, 
                        I just want to see everyone. You 
                        don't have to bring anything but 
                        yourselves.

           Norman sits on the steps with his SKI GEAR. The Porsche 
           pulls up. Big Norm gets out. Sandra stays in the car.

           Norman loads up his gear as Janice comes outside and 
           walks down to Big Norm.

                                 JANICE
                        So the party starts at six, try to 
                        be back by five...

                                 BIG NORM
                        We’ll be here.

                                 JANICE
                        I’m serious. Please don't be late. 
                        This is important to me...

                                 BIG NORM
                        We’ll be here, Jan.

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- DAY

           Norman skis the SLALOM PRACTICE COURSE. He’s taking wide 
           turns. Avoiding the patches of ice. He’s rusty. Timid. 

           Norman crosses the finish line. The STOPWATCH: “57.10” 

                                 BIG NORM
                        OK. Not bad. Let’s go again. Only 
                        this time do the exact opposite of 
                        everything you just did...

           INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Big Norm and Norman eat prime rib. Sandra has hardly 
           touched her salmon but is already on her second martini.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BIG NORM
                        You're hesitating out there. 
                        You’re not trusting yourself...

           Norman shrugs meekly. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        It's OK. We'll be ready. I'll 
                        figure something out.

           The three of them eat in silence. They look like 
           strangers in a cafeteria. Sandra eats an olive.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You like the salmon?

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s OK...

                                 BIG NORM
                        Now is that King Salmon or Sockeye 
                        Salmon? Can you tell the 
                        difference? People say they can, 
                        but I’ve never been able to...

                                 SANDRA
                        Who gives a shit?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Just making conversation.

           They go back to eating in silence. After a moment.

                                 SANDRA
                        Do you want to try again?

           Big Norm nearly chokes. Norman stops chewing.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Now is not the time to...

                                 SANDRA
                        It's a simple question. Yes or no. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        That's enough.

                                 SANDRA
                        What? Just making conversation.

           She gets up and walks out of the restaurant.
           EXT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Sandra sits on a bench by herself, smoking a CIGARETTE. 
           It’s well below freezing and she’s not wearing a coat. 

           Big Norm walks out and hands the VALET their ticket. 

           Norman follows carrying a woman’s WINTER COAT. He sees 
           Sandra sitting alone. He walks over and drapes it over 
           her shoulders. He sits and watches her smoke in silence.

                                 SANDRA
                        He doesn't want to talk about her 
                        and all I want to do is talk about 
                        her, so, that sucks...
                               (silence)
                        Funny thing is I never even wanted 
                        kids, now I don't know if I want 
                        anything else more in the world...

           She has tears in her eyes. He doesn’t know what to say.

                                 SANDRA
                        You know what the worst part is? 
                        We don't get any memories. No 
                        pictures, nothing to hold onto. We 
                        just get the pain and baggage...

                                 NORMAN
                        You have memories. Remember when 
                        we had that snowball fight in the 
                        motel? Then we went to that diner 
                        and you and me almost ate a whole 
                        Boston Cream pie by ourselves?
                               (beat)
                        She had pie too.

           Sandra smiles a sad smile. A few of those tears slip out. 
           Norman stands as the Valet pulls The Porsche around. 

           He holds out his HAND to help her up. She takes it.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- NIGHT

           Norman’s HANDS are bleeding from being driven into the 
           ice so many times. Bright red cuts on all ten knuckles.

           He and Sandra have made it several hundred yards down the 
           chute, still several hundred to go.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           It’s darker. The temperature drops by the minute. The FOG 
           has enveloped them. They can’t see more than a few feet. 

           Norman’s muscles tremble, he’s sweating, out of breath. 
           Sandra can tell he’s wearing out. She tries to put more 
           and more of her weight on the anchor branch. 

           They move slowly but methodically. One step at a time. 
           Sandra is calmer now. No longer scared. Almost placid.

                                 SANDRA
                        I blamed you...  

           She’s not really talking to him, more to herself.

                                 SANDRA
                        ...I don’t know why... I know it 
                        wasn’t your fault... 

           Sandra’s anchor branch slips out. Her full weight lands 
           on Norman’s shoulders. He almost loses his grip.

                                 NORMAN
                        It’s OK. Just. Focus.

           But she's not focused. Maybe it's the blood loss or the 
           broken arm, but she starts to look woozy. Out of it.

           They keep moving. Sandra can barely get the anchor branch 
           through the ice crust. 

           And then SHE SLIPS. It happens so fast. Norman has no 
           time to react. 

           One second she’s on his shoulders, the next she’s falling 
           past him. He tries to grab her arm, leg, anything, but he 
           can’t. She screams as she plummets down the chute.

           She disappears into THE FOG. Her scream dwindles away in 
           the wind. 

           Norman doesn’t think. He just takes off down the chute as 
           fast as he can. Screaming her name over and over again. 

           He slips and slides. Dragging his swollen, bleeding hands 
           through the ice to slow himself down. His RIGHT HAND 
           clips a rock. 

           The TRAIL OF BLOOD starts at a tree trunk. He follows it. 

           He flips onto his back. Sledding without the sled. He 
           uses his palms and heels to control his fall. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Finally, he reaches the bottom and the chute flattens 
           out. A long, drawn-out deceleration. A blown tire limping 
           to a stop.

           He lies there. Out of breath. He tries to move his right 
           hand. Can’t. He sits up and looks around. 

           He sees SANDRA’S BODY lying in an enclave of spruce 
           trees. A wound on the back of her head where she hit a 
           rock or tree. Blood forms a halo around her. 

           The incline is still steep but no longer so steep that he 
           can’t control his slide. He slides down to her. Her eyes 
           are closed. She’s not breathing. There’s no doubt.

           He starts to cry. Just says “I’m sorry” over and over. 

           He cries and cries. The strength and will power just sap 
           out of him. It’s over. He lies down beside her. His 
           breathing slows. His eyelids flutter. He’s at peace.

           He CLOSES HIS EYES and just waits for it all to end.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- DAY

           The BANNER that reads: “1979 SoCal Ski Championships” 

           RACE OFFICIALS sign in young SKI RACERS and pin red 
           numbers to their chests. COACHES go over last-minute 
           strategy. PARENTS help sharpen and polish skis.

           Norman sits by himself, wearing the same ski racing gear 
           we met him in. Through the lodge window, he can see 
           Sandra at the bar where we first found her. 

           Big Norm glides over on his SKIS. Norman is confused. 

                                 BIG NORM
                        Follow me.

           They ski over to an operating CHAIRLIFT where a RACE 
           OFFICIAL stops them from getting on.

                                 RACE OFFICIAL
                        Sorry, we’re not allowing any more 
                        warm up runs... 

                                 BIG NORM
                        I know.

                                 RACE OFFICIAL
                        This lift only accesses this hill. 
                        How are you planning to get down?

                                 BIG NORM
                        We’ll figure something out.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP -- DAY

           Big Norm and Norman get off the chairlift. They cross to 
           the undeveloped side of the mountain. 

           Norman finds himself staring down the same BACK-COUNTRY 
           SLOPE we first found him staring down but the stoic 
           composure isn’t there. He looks a little pale.

                                 NORMAN
                        You’ve got to be kidding me?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Desperate times... 

           Norman looks at the sheer slope, the rocks, the trees.

                                 NORMAN
                        I can’t do this.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Like you couldn't get a tube ride? 
                        Or learn ice? Or break 50 seconds?

           Big Norm sets his poles. Prepares to take off.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Trust yourself to know what to do.

                                 NORMAN
                        What if I don’t?

                                 BIG NORM
                        Than you haven’t been paying 
                        attention.

           With that, he launches himself down the slope. He weaves 
           between the evergreen trees and bushes, kicking up a 
           cloud of powder in his wake.

           Norman sets his poles. He studies the slope. Takes a deep 
           breath and takes off. The snow is deep. Up to his knees. 

           He almost falls right away. He catches himself. Stays up. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He’s hesitant. Skiing scared. Just trying not to fall or 
           hit anything. A CLOUD OF POWDER kicks up around him, 
           makes it hard to see. He almost crashes into a bush.

           And then it clicks. We can see the moment. He steadies. 
           The hesitation becomes determination. All the training, 
           the work, it all comes rushing back. He gets low.

           A smile is plastered to Norman’s face as he weaves easily 
           around obstacles. No fear. He sees Big Norm. Gets lower. 
           Catches up to him. They go back and forth for the lead.

           They come flying out of the woods and skid to stop in-
           front of an ACCESS ROAD that leads up to the lodge. They 
           stand there catching their breath for a moment.

                                 NORMAN
                        I want to do it again.

           Big Norm smiles. 

           EXT. BIG BEAR -- DAY

           A fellow RACER, much bigger and stronger than Norman, 
           attacks the slalom course as the CROWD cheers him on. The 
           Racer brushes every gate, stays low. The kid is flying. 

           The Racer crosses the finish line. Norman’s eyes find the 
           STANDINGS BOARD. After a few seconds the time is posted:

           “L. McCloud -- ‘46.70’ -- FIRST PLACE”

           Norman’s heart sinks. He is still in shock when the Race 
           Official comes over to tell him it’s his turn to go up. 

           Big Norm can see Norman’s concern.

                                 BIG NORM
                        Hey. Relax. The work is done. This 
                        thing is already over, these guys 
                        just don't know it yet. I've never 
                        won a court case in a courtroom, I 
                        win 'em before I walk in...

           Norman’s GROUP OF RACERS heads for the lift. The Race 
           Official is getting impatient. Big Norm meets his eyes.

                        Do me a favor. When you get off 
                        the lift, go look at that back 
                        country run again. If you can do 
                        that, you can do this.

                        course you can’t conquer, no

           Norman believing it because his father believes it.

                                 BIG NORM
                        You're the Boy Wonder. Remember 
                        that. Always remember that.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. ONTARIO PEAK -- NIGHT

           Norman OPENS HIS EYES. Sits up. Looks around. Not yet. 

           He crawls over to a spruce tree and breaks off two of the 
           sturdiest BRANCHES. Strips the leaves and twigs.

           Norman slides down the rest of the slope on his ass, uses 
           the branches like ski poles. He maneuvers around rocks, 
           trees. Bangs into a couple. Stabs of pain. He ignores it.

           The slope flattens and narrows into a sheer WALL OF ROCK. 
           A naturally-formed obstacle course. 

           Norman climbs over and down the rocks. He stumbles, slips 
           and falls a few times, but never stops climbing. He’s a 
           boy possessed, running on pure adrenaline.

           He jumps down off the last rock and lands in knee-deep 
           POWDER with a thud. He trudges along, like walking 
           through quicksand. Every step saps his energy.

           He’s panting by the time he comes to the CREEK, six-feet 
           wide, ice layer over top. He tests the ice. It cracks. He 
           looks for a way around. Nothing. No choice but to jump.

           He shorts the landing. Splashes into the ice-cold water. 
           Sloshes out. Wet clothes. Doesn't matter. Can't stop.

           Darker now. The wind picks up. The snow drifts.

           Norman trudges along. He stumbles into a maze of 
           BUCKTHORN BUSHES, razor-sharp thorns snag clothes, tear 
           skin. 

           He can't see where he's going. The bushes keep getting 
           thicker and harder to push through, but he does. 

           Finally, he emerges into a:
           EXT. MEADOW -- NIGHT

           Perfectly flat. Undisturbed snow. Beautiful in a way.

           Norman walks the perimeter. A towering wall of ten-foot 
           high buckthorn bushes. He looks for any sign of a trail 
           or path. Nothing. No entry or exit point. A tomb.   

           The panic starts to creep into his eyes. Then he sees it.

           A FOOTPRINT. Several. Leading into the bushes. Hope.

           Norman crawls into the buckthorn, following the trail of 
           prints. They cut a chaotic, circuitous along down a 
           HILLSIDE. Not as steep as the chute, but steep.  

           He follows the trail deeper and deeper into the brush 
           until the footprints cluster together and fade away. He 
           looks around. Frantic. Finds only undisturbed snow. 

           He has no idea which way to go. The panic again. He 
           starts moving quickly. Too quickly. He slips and falls.

           Norman tumbles down a hillside. Twisting in the vines. He 
           lands hard on the frozen ground. Tangled in buckthorn.

           He just lies there. Exhausted. Broken. Bleeding. Frozen. 

           His eyes flutter. All we hear is his slowing breathing. 

           EXT. BALDY VILLAGE -- NIGHT

           ONTARIO PEAK towers over the only short-order DINER in 
           the small mountain town of Baldy Village.

           INT. DINER -- NIGHT

           GLENN FARMER, 17, all-American, sips a cup of coffee. His 
           DOG, a skinny brown mutt, sits under the table. 

           The only WAITRESS, 17, pretty, approaches his booth.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Hey. I just got another table. I’m 
                        sorry. Can you wait 30 minutes?

                                 GLENN
                        For you? I’ll wait all night.

           She gives him a kiss and goes. He finishes his coffee. 
           EXT. BALDY VILLAGE -- NIGHT

           Glenn walks out of the diner. He whistles for the dog and 
           heads in the direction of a HIKING TRAIL.

           EXT. HIKING TRAIL -- NIGHT

           Glenn hikes up with a FLASHLIGHT. The beam dances over 
           the buckthorn bushes that line the trail. 

           The Dog runs ahead, BARKING and playing in the snow.

           Norman lies just off the trail. Hidden in the buckthorn. 
           Barely clinging to consciousness. He hears the dog, sees 
           the LIGHT dancing in the bushes. Glenn walks within a 
           dozen yards but doesn’t see him. 

           Norman starts to crawl. Branches CRACK. Brush RUSTLES.

           Glenn doesn’t hear it but The Dog does. He stops and 
           looks back. Barks. 

           Glenn turns around. His flashlight beam finds Norman 
           crawling out of the buckthorn. 

           EXT. CHAPMAN RANCH -- NIGHT

           PATRICIA CHAPMAN, 41, is outside collecting firewood when 
           she hears someone yelling “HELP!” in the distance.

           She looks up and sees Glenn running through her backyard 
           with Norman laying limp in his arms.  

           INT. CHAPMAN RANCH -- NIGHT

           Patricia opens the door. Glenn comes in with Norman. He 
           is barely clinging to consciousness.

           Glenn lays Norman down on a soft Indian rug next to the 
           FIREPLACE. Patricia comes in with a FIRST AID KIT.

           In the firelight, we get our first look at the full 
           extent of Norman’s injuries. Broken hand, black eyes, 
           bruising all over, deep cuts on his chin, above his eye. 

           The skin on all ten of his knuckles has been worn down to 
           the bone. 

           Patricia tends to the wounds. Norman looks at her. She 
           smiles warmly.

           The AMBULANCE SIRENS approach as Norman’s eyes close.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           The steady sound of MACHINES monitoring vital signs.  

           Norman lies asleep in a hospital bed, his right hand is 
           in a soft cast. His cuts are stitched, fingers bandaged. 

           Janice is at his bedside. Her eyes are red from crying. 
           Rick stands in the doorway talking quietly with a DOCTOR.

           Norman opens his eyes. Looks around. Sees Janice. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Hi mom...

           Janice throws her arms around him.

                                 JANICE
                        Hi baby...

           She can't stop hugging and kissing him. 

           Rick walks over and pats his shoulder with a smile.

                                 RICK
                        When you feel like you can eat, 
                        let us know. They want you to eat.

           Norman turns to his mother.

                                 NORMAN
                        Did they find dad?

           Janice starts crying.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Norman sits up in bed. Shell-shocked. Janice sits holding 
           his hand. Rick walks in.

                                 RICK
                        There are a bunch of reporters in 
                        the lobby. They wanna talk to you.

                        People want to know, they want to 
                        know how you did it. You don’t 
                        have to. We just thought you might 
                        want to tell them...

           Norman looks to his mother. She shrugs. 

           INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

           A press conference. Norman sits in a wheelchair. Dozens 
           of microphones and tape recorders lie on the table in-
           front of him. Janice and Rick are at his side. 

           REPORTERS surround them. PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures. 

                                 NORMAN
                        I never gave up... my dad taught 
                        me never to give up, so...

                                 REPORTER
                        Do you remember what was going 
                        through your head as you were 
                        coming down that ice curtain? 

           He sits there thinking. Bulbs flash. It comes to him. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Balance and patience.

           INT. CHURCH -- DAY

           Hundreds of PEOPLE attend Big Norm's funeral. 

           They stand in the aisles, overflow into the doorways. 
           Clients, colleagues, friends, family. All crying like 
           they just lost a family member. 

           Norman sits with Janice. He isn’t crying. He looks numb. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE BAR -- NIGHT

           The RECEPTION feels like that last night on Topanga. The 
           same six-piece Dixie Band plays softly. 

           The mood is more joyful than morbid. A lot of 
           storytelling, laughing and crying.

           Norman stands in a corner. Lost in his thoughts. Tearful 
           GUESTS keep coming up to offer their condolences. They 
           give hugs and kisses. He accepts them robotically. 

           Norman doesn't make much eye contact.

           Trafton and Elly approach. Trafton wears a suit that 
           doesn't fit. Elly wears a dress. She's been crying.

                                 TRAFTON
                        I don't know what to say, you 
                        know... 
                               (shrugs)
                        He was a legend.

           Norman tries to nod.  

                                 ELLY
                        Are you OK? Of course you're not 
                        OK, that was dumb, I'm sorry...
                               (welling up)
                        I’m really sorry.

           She hugs him. He hugs her back. The band starts playing 
           “Blue Eyes Cryin’ In The Rain”. 

           Norman lets her go and walks outside.

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY/NIGHT

           A parade of WELL-WISHERS come through the house. We won’t 
           hear anything through the following sequence.

           Rick greets them all with the same handshake and dutiful 
           nod. He knows they’re not here to see him.

           SOME Janice and Norman know -- Al Freedman, Bob Barrow, 
           The Yellow Submarine Surfers. OTHERS they meet for the 
           first time -- Poor People Big Norm represented Pro Bono. 

           They all have something to offer -- everything from a 
           simple home-cooked MEAL to deeply-personal MEMENTOS for 
           Norman -- and they all have a story to tell.

           Janice hangs on every word of every story, laughing and 
           crying. Norman wears the same emotionless mask through 
           every visit, occasionally nodding and forcing smiles.
           INT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           The FOOD has piled up on the kitchen counter - everything 
           from casseroles to freshly-baked banana bread.

           Norman stares with that same blank look. Janice walks in. 

                                 JANICE
                        You hungry? 

                                 NORMAN
                        No...

                                 JANICE
                        You sure? Did you eat lunch?

                                 NORMAN
                        Tuna casserole...

           He just keeps staring. Janice watches him. Concerned.

                                 JANICE
                        So. I think it would be a good 
                        idea for you to talk to someone.

                                 NORMAN
                        Like a shrink?

                                 JANICE
                        You've been through a lot. And...

                                 NORMAN
                        I don’t want to talk to anyone.

                                 JANICE
                               (beat)
                        OK.

           The doorbell rings. Janice goes to answer it. She comes 
           back carrying a UPS PACKAGE.

                                 JANICE
                        It’s for you...

           She cuts the packing tape. Norman opens the box and looks 
           inside. We don't see what’s inside yet, we just see how 
           he sees it. His face loses a shade of color. 

           He turns and walks out without a word.

           Janice reaches in the box and pulls out an engraved 
           TROPHY with a little ski racer on top.

           Norman crawls into bed. Pulls the comforter up over him.

           the window.

           INT. BIG NORM’S COTTAGE -- DAY

           Rick and Janice help Norman’s GRANDPARENTS go through and 
           box up Big Norm’s things.  

           Janice is packing up a closet full of clothes when she 
           comes across a BOX OF JUNK. Something catches her eye.

           She pulls out a dusty, old FRAMED PHOTO: of Big Norm 
           surfing at Topanga Beach with a ONE-YEAR-OLD BABY 
           strapped to his back in a canvas papoose.

           Janice has tears in her eyes as she sets it aside.

           INT. NORMAN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Norman watches out his window as Rick unloads BOX AFTER 
           BOX of his father’s things and stacks them in the garage.

           Norman watches him unload Big Norm’s SURFBOARD. He looks 
           walks away from the window. Gets back in bed. 

           EXT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           Trafton and Norman are in the driveway looking at his 
           yellow-railed SURFBOARD. 

           Norman’s cuts looks better and the bruises have faded, 
           but he’s still got that vacant thousand-mile stare.

                                 NORMAN
                        It's got a few scratches, but it's 
                        in pretty good shape.

                        It's in great shape. I can't

                                 TRAFTON
                        So you’re not sure.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m sure.

                                 TRAFTON
                        Don't sell yet. You’re going 
                        through some heavy stuff. Just...

                                 NORMAN
                               (snaps)
                        You want it or not.

           Trafton gets a glimpse of the anger simmering beneath the 
           surface. He pulls out a wad of cash and hands it to him.

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT

           Norman lies on the couch watching cartoons. Rick and 
           Janice are having a heated conversation in the kitchen.

                                 RICK
                        He has to go back some time.

                                 JANICE
                        I understand that but we don’t 
                        have to rush him.

                                 NORMAN
                        You know I can hear you guys 
                        talking. Right? 

           They walk into the living room. Rick turns off the TV.

                                 RICK
                        Do you want to go back?

                                 NORMAN
                        I never want to go to school.

                                 RICK
                        Do you feel like you're ready to 
                        go back?

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m fine.

                                 JANICE
                        You don’t have to go yet. You can 
                        take a few more days, I still 
                        think you should...

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m fine, mom.

           INT. SCHOOL -- DAY

           Norman through the hallway. He can feel the KIDS and 
           TEACHERS all staring at him, feeling sorry for him. 

           He ignores the looks and whispers. Unlocks his locker.

                                 ZACK
                        Ollestad...

           Zack approaches. Norman sighs. Braces himself. 

                                 ZACK
                        How are you, man?

                                 NORMAN
                        Great.

           Zack nods. Totally missing the sarcasm.

                                 ZACK
                        Sorry about your pops. Rough.

           Norman nods. 

                                 ZACK
                        Saw your picture in the paper. 

           Norman just looks at him. Fucking idiot.

           INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

           Norman sits at desk. Doodling. Lost in his thoughts.

           His TEACHER sets his report card on his desk. He looks at 
           it. We see a lot of the letter “B” and “C”

           Norman’s eyes go straight to the “A” in math.
           INT. CAFETERIA -- DAY

           Norman sits with Zack and the JOCKS. They’re all talking 
           about the inane bullshit sixth grade boys talk about. 
           Norman doesn’t say anything. Just picks at his food. 

                                 ZACK
                        Check out Soldier Boy.

           Timmy sits in his usual spot by himself, playing with his 
           Army Men. Zack grows a smile.

                                 ZACK
                        Watch this.

           Norman watches as Zack and a few of his minions cross the 
           cafeteria to Timmy. He goes straight for his ‘STAFF 
           SERGEANT’ ARMY MAN. 

           They do the usual keep away thing until Timmy is good and 
           distraught. Then Zack drops the Army Man on the ground at 
           his feet. Timmy reaches down to get it but before he can 
           Zack brings his foot down. Crushing it.

           Timmy just stays on the ground staring at his broken toy. 
           Tears welling in his eyes.   

           Norman doesn’t even seem conscious of what happens next. 
           He gets up out of his seat and walks straight across the 
           cafeteria to Zack who turns with a big smile. Until 
           Norman punches him in the face and he drops like a rock. 

           Norman isn’t done. He jumps on top of him and hits him 
           again. And again. And again. And again. 

           KIDS cheer for a fight at first, but the cheers quickly 
           turn to audible gasps as Norman pummels Zack’s face.

           All the rage comes pouring out. It takes two TEACHERS to 
           pull him off. 

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Rick and Janice meet with the PRINCIPAL and GUIDANCE 
           COUNSELOR behind closed doors. 

           Norman sits outside the office, holding an ice pack on 
           his hand. 
           INT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           Norman, Rick and Janice walk into the house together.  

                                 JANICE
                        Go to your room. Stay there. I’ll 
                        call you for dinner. 

           INT. NORMAN’S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Norman walks in and stops in his tracks when he sees the 
           ski racing TROPHY on display on a bookshelf. 

           His eyes narrow. He has no doubt who put it there.

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT

           Norman hasn't touched his dinner. Janice and Rick are 
           almost finished theirs. They eat in charged silence. 

           All we hear are utensils scraping plates. 

                                 RICK
                        You're gonna meet with the 
                        guidance counselor. Every day.

                                 NORMAN
                        For how long?

                                 RICK
                        However long it takes for her to 
                        be comfortable letting you around 
                        other children. You broke his 
                        nose, his parents are probably 
                        gonna sue us. You can’t just...

                                 JANICE
                        Rick.

           Janice just looks at him and shakes her head.

                                 RICK
                        Fine. You deal with it.

           Rick clear his plate and goes into the living room to 
           watch TV. He turns on one of those PBS Specials on Nixon.

           Norman and Janice stay seated at the table. She looks at 
           him. He looks at his food.

                                 JANICE
                        You know you can talk to me about 
                        anything...
                               (off his silence)
                        About your dad...

           Norman picks at his food. Janice lowers her voice so only 
           he can hear. 

                                 JANICE
                        I didn't know how to surf when I 
                        met him, so, on one of our first 
                        dates, he took me to Topanga. We 
                        hadn’t bought the house yet...

                                 NORMAN
                               (softly)
                        I don’t want to talk about this.

                                 JANICE
                        ...he wouldn't let me leave until 
                        I stood up on a wave. I thought he 
                        was kidding, but, three hours 
                        later, there I was, still...

                                 NORMAN
                               (explodes)
                        I said I don't wanna fucking talk 
                        about this.

           Janice quiets. Wounded. Rick jumps up out of his chair.

                                 RICK
                        God damn it. Enough is enough.

           He storms back into the kitchen. 

                                 RICK
                        You're not the only person to ever 
                        lose someone they love. You're not 
                        even the only person in this house 
                        who lost someone they love...

           Rick realizes he’s yelling. Calms. Lowers his voice.

                                 RICK
                        I am sorry about what you went 
                        through. I really am, but it 
                        doesn't give you the right to 
                        treat you mother like shit and 
                        beat kids half to death. Life 
                        isn't fair, but it goes on...

                        I know you've been through a lot.

           Norman gets up from the table and runs back to his room. 

           We hear the door slam. Rick and Janice exchange a look.

                                 RICK
                        He needed to hear it.

           Rick sits down in his rocking chair. Goes back to the TV.

           Janice starts clearing the table. A quiet moment passes. 

           Norman comes out of his bedroom carrying the ski racing 
           TROPHY. He walks right into the living room and throws it 
           through the TV SCREEN. Glass shatters. Janice screams. 

                                 NORMAN
                        You don’t know anything.

           Rick just stares at Norman who is trembling with rage.

                                 NORMAN
                        He thought you were a joke...
                               (ice cold)
                        You are a joke.

           Norman walks back to his room. Rick tries not look 
           affected but he is. The trophy falls out of the TV.

           INT. NORMAN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Norman lies on his bed, staring out the window. Janice 
           walks in. She's carrying that old FRAMED PHOTO: of Big 
           Norm surfing at Topanga with the baby on his back.

           She sits beside him. Norman doesn’t move or look at her. 
           She just sits there looking at the photo for a moment.

                                 JANICE
                        This was taken on your first 
                        birthday. That’s you...

           She points to the baby in the papoose. Norman sits up. 
           He's never seen this before.

                                 JANICE
                        I was so mad. Taking a baby that 
                        age into the ocean is dumb, 
                        surfing with a baby that age is 
                        criminally dumb.

                        But he didn't see it that way, he 
                        just wanted you to experience 
                        things. That's just how he was. He 
                        never stopped to think. He never 
                        stopped. He just lived...
                               (beat)
                        This picture sums up why I always 
                        loved him and why I couldn't be 
                        married to him. I mean he would 
                        take these crazy risks, and I'd be 
                        worried sick, and he'd say these 
                        dumb things with that big smile of 
                        his like "Well, if I die, I'll die 
                        with a smile on my face" and I 
                        remember thinking ‘good for you, 
                        but what about me?’...

           She looks at The Photo with a bittersweet smile.

                                 JANICE
                        He was crazy, absolutely out of 
                        his mind, but, he was so special, 
                        and he loved you so much...

           She looks up from The Photo and finds Norman with tears 
           in his eyes.

                                 NORMAN
                        I miss him.

           He finally breaks down. It all comes pouring out. He sobs 
           and sobs as his mother holds him. Rocks him.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           The neighborhood tress bloom. Carol Calloway meticulously 
           fertilizes her rose bushes. 

           A yellow SCHOOL BUS stops on the corner. 

           Norman gets off. His injuries are healed. The color has 
           returned to his face. 

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           A new TV and VCR have been installed in the living room.

           Rick is fiddling with the controls, trying to get a video 
           to play. Norman walks in as he finally gets it to work.

           ON TV: A highlight reel of the home videos Rick took at 
           Norman’s Pop Warner football games. The clips have been 
           edited together with music and titles.    

           Norman stands there watching himself on TV. He smiles.

                                 NORMAN

                        Friend of mine is an editor. I 
                        just bought him a case of beer.
                        Spring practice is starting up

                        use this to find things you want 
                        to work on, or...

           They watch Norman break a forty yard touchdown run.

                                 RICK
                        You like it?

                                 NORMAN
                        Yeah. This is really cool. Thanks.

                                 RICK
                        You’re welcome.

           Norman starts back to his room. Stops and turns back.

                                 NORMAN
                        You know I never really said I was 
                        sorry for...

                                 RICK
                        Don’t worry about it.
                               (beat)
                        I've been bugging your mom to let 
                        me get a new TV for years.

           They share a smile. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY

           The first day of spring football practice. Norman runs 
           drills with the rest of the OFFENSE. 

           Zack is there. The smirk is gone. Getting his ass kicked 
           seems to have been a character building experience.

           Norman finishes an agility drill and looks down the field 
           at the DEFENSE working on hitting drills. Looks like fun.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NORMAN
                        Hey Coach? You think I could try 
                        defense this year?

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- DAY

           Norman delivers a bone-crunching hit to a RECEIVER coming 
           across the middle. Like a mini-Lawrence Taylor.

           We watch him deliver HIT after HIT after HIT. Each more 
           vicious than the last. He’s a natural.

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Practice is over. Norman and the rest of the TEAM walk 
           off the field, heading for the locker room.

                                 ELLY
                        Hey Sporto...

           Norman sees Elly sitting in the first row of the empty 
           bleachers. He smiles and walks over to her.

                                 NORMAN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ELLY
                        I go to school here. 

                                 NORMAN
                        Since when?

                                 ELLY
                        Since somebody offered my dad a 
                        bunch of money for our ranch...

                                 NORMAN
                        Cool.

                                 ELLY
                        Not really. How are you?

                                 NORMAN
                        Good. Better. You?

                                 ELLY
                        I miss Moon Star...
                               (off his look)
                        My horse.

           They sit looking at the school, the suburbs around it.

                                 ELLY
                        You hear Trafton and the guys are 
                        having a bonfire thing Friday?
                               (off his nod)
                        Are you gonna go?

                                 NORMAN
                        I don’t know. Maybe.

                                 ELLY
                        You wanna, like, go together? 

           He looks at her. She’s trying not to blush. He smiles.

           INT. ARCHER HOME -- NIGHT

           ON TV: A local WEATHERMAN talks about a storm system 
           moving into the Greater Los Angeles area.

           Rick is watching the weather report intently. Janice is 
           gift-wrapping a cardboard JEWELRY BOX at the table.

           Norman is wearing his nicest pair of board shorts and 
           can't stop fixing his hair in the mirror.

                                 RICK
                        ...it never rains in this town and 
                        it's gonna rain for the damn game 
                        Unbelievable. Gonna have to bring 
                        your umbrella tomorrow, kid.
                               (off Norman)
                        Why do you keep messing with your 
                        hair?

                                 JANICE
                               (smiles)
                        He’s got a little date...

                                 NORMAN
                        Mom.

                                 JANICE
                        Sorry...

           She tries to stop smiling. Can’t. She finishes wrapping 
           the jewelry box and walks it over to Norman.

                        We're just going down to the 
                        beach. It's no big deal.

                                 RICK
                        Don't stay out too late. I want to 
                        leave early to beat traffic.

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- NIGHT

           The WAVES are up. Bigger than usual. Strong off shore 
           wind. A BONFIRE burns on the beach. 

           Mostly TEENAGERS sit around it. Playing guitar. Passing 
           joints. Talking. Dancing. Laughing.  

           Trafton and a few other SURFERS are out in the water, 
           surfing by firelight.

           Elly and Norman are the only ones that aren't drinking. 
           They sit in the sand. Watching the night surfers.

                                 NORMAN
                        I almost forgot...

           He takes out the jewelry box and gives it to her.

                                 ELLY
                        What's this for?

           She opens the box and finds a little CHARM BRACELET with 
           tiny horse pendants dangling off.

                                 NORMAN
                        I just saw it and thought of you.

                                 ELLY
                               (touched)
                        I love it. Thank you.

                                 NORMAN
                        It has horses...

           She smiles. I can see that. Trafton and the Surfers walk 
           out of the water carrying their boards. 

                                 TRAFTON
                        Is that Boy Ollestad? It can't be. 
                        Boy Ollestad doesn't come around 
                        anymore. I must be hallucinating. 
                        Who slipped me acid?

           Norman smiles. Get up and gives Trafton a handshake/hug.

                                 TRAFTON
                        You don't have a beer. You want a 
                        beer?

                                 NORMAN

                               (nods to the waves)
                        Pretty big out there tonight.

                                 TRAFTON
                        This is just warm ups. Tomorrow is 
                        gonna be epic. Steady sets of 10-
                        footers. I’m talking biblical 
                        shit. You gotta come out.

                                 ELLY
                        You should totally come out.

                                 TRAFTON
                        I'll rent you your board back. 
                        Give you a fair price.

                                 NORMAN
                        I can’t.

                                 TRAFTON
                        OK. Fine. You can use it for free, 
                        but don’t say I never did anything 
                        for you.

                                 NORMAN
                        I really can’t. 

                                 ELLY
                        Why not?

           The Surfers are all looking at him.

                                 NORMAN
                        I gotta go to this USC football 
                        thing with my step dad. We've been 
                        planning it for awhile. He's 
                        really excited about it.

                                 TRAFTON
                        They play football in spring now?

                                 NORMAN
                        It's like a scrimmage or something 
                        where the offense and defense play 
                        each other in full pads.

                        go hard. It should be cool. 
                        Charles White is playing, so...

           The Surfers just stare like he's speaking Chinese.

                                 NORMAN
                        Another time though. Definitely.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL COLISEUM -- DAY

           The 93,000 seat home of the USC Trojan Football Team.

           It’s POURING RAIN but that doesn’t dampen the enthusiasm 
           of the die hard FANS who have come out to watch the first 
           spring scrimmage.

           Head Coach JOHN ROBINSON presides over the proceedings.

           Rick and Norman sit under a giant umbrella. Rick provides 
           a running commentary on the various plays and players. 

           Norman can’t take his eyes off two-time All-American 
           running back CHARLES WHITE (#33). Impossibly fast and 
           strong. Far and away the best athlete on the field.  

           White takes a routine hand off up the middle. Breaks a 
           tackle. Than another. He explodes into the secondary. 
           Pure power and grace. 

           Rick and Norman cheer him all the way into the end zone.

           INT. LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL COLISEUM -- DAY

           Norman stands in the tunnel as the PLAYERS emerge from 
           the locker room. None of them really acknowledge him. 

           Rick walks over.

                                 RICK
                        Somebody wants to meet you...

           INT. COACH ROBINSON’S OFFICE -- DAY

           USC pride on every wall. Plaques. Rings. Banners. 

           Coach Robinson sits behind his desk. The rain comes down 
           in sheets outside his office windows.

                        So I hear you're quite the little 
                        running back...

           Rick and Norman sit across from him.

                                 NORMAN
                        I’m OK. I guess.

                                 COACH ROBINSON
                        Modest too. That's good. Rick 
                        tells me you want to play football 
                        for USC one day.

           Norman looks at Rick. I do? 

                                 NORMAN
                        I like football...

                                 COACH ROBINSON
                        These guys didn't get here by just 
                        liking it. They worked hard since 
                        they were young. Younger than you. 
                        You gotta eat, sleep, and breathe 
                        this game, son. It takes devotion. 
                        Sacrifice. It's not about who’s 
                        the biggest and the fastest, it’s 
                        about who wants it more. You need 
                        the right mind set. It’s not about 
                        you, it’s about what’s best for 
                        the team... never too early to 
                        learn that lesson.

           Norman just looks at him curiously. 

                                 COACH ROBINSON
                        Anything you want to ask me?

                                 NORMAN
                        Can I use your bathroom?

           INT. TROJAN LOCKER ROOM -- DAY  

           Norman walks in. The players are all gone. It’s quiet 
           save for the sound of the rain. 

           An EQUIPMENT MANAGER has just finished hanging the last 
           of the JERSEYS in the player lockers.

           The Man points to the back and leaves. Norman is alone.

           He walks around. Picking things up. Puts them down. 

           His eyes find THE PLAYER LOCKERS. Militantly organized. 
           The cleats. The pants. The Jerseys. All hung the same. 
           Everything has a place. Everything is in its place. 

           He stares for awhile. Then heads back to the bathrooms. 

           INT. COACH ROBINSON’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Rick and The Coach wait in awkward silence. Two men out 
           of things to say to each other.

                                 COACH ROBINSON
                        Did he fall in?

           INT. TROJAN LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

           Rick and The Coach walk in. Head back to the bathrooms.

                                 RICK
                        Norman?

           There’s no one in the stalls. The room is empty. 

                                 RICK
                        Norman...

           Rick’s eyes find a door marked 'EXIT'. It's ajar.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES -- DAY

           Norman runs out of the stadium through the pouring rain. 
           He jumps on a CITY BUS. Dripping wet.

           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           Norman gets off a DIFFERENT BUS. He runs down the street.

           EXT. ARCHER HOME -- DAY

           By the time he reaches the house, he’s soaked to the 
           bone. He runs straight into the garage. 

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He starts searching frantically through all the BOXES 
           marked “Norm”. He can’t find it. Where is it?

           Rick’s STATION WAGON squeals into the driveway. He jumps 
           out. Beet red. Furious.

                                 RICK
                        What the Hell was that? You just 
                        disappear?! Jesus Christ. I 
                        thought you'd been kidnapped. Hey. 
                        I'm talking to you...

           But Norman isn’t listening. He just keeps looking. And 
           then sees it. His DAD’S SURFBOARD. 

           He grabs the board. Grabs his SKATEBOARD and heads out.

                                 RICK
                        Where do you think you’re going? 

           Rick grabs his arm but Norman shakes free. He jumps on 
           his skateboard and heads off down the hill. 

           Rick jumps in the station wagon and goes after him.

           EXT. PACIFIC PALISADES -- DAY

           The long, steep HILL connects The Suburbs to The Shore. 

           Norman comes rocketing down on his SKATEBOARD. He stays 
           low in a racer’s crouch. Takes the turns tight. Flying.

           Rick gives chase in the station wagon.  

           EXT. TOPANGA BEACH -- DAY

           Furious, angry ocean. Wind. Monster swells. 10-footers at 
           least. Flat out The biggest WAVES we’ve seen. 

           It’s gotten so big that Trafton, Elly and the rest of the 
           SURFERS have gotten out of the water.

           Norman skateboards right onto the sand. 

                                 ELLY
                        Norman! You made it. You can’t go 
                        out right now. It’s too rough... 

           Norman strips off his shirt. No wetsuit. Doesn’t matter.

                                                            (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TRAFTON
                        Seriously, man. Not safe...

           The Station Wagon skids to a stop. Rick jumps out.

                                 RICK
                        Norman! Get back here...

           Norman grabs his dad’s board and charges out into the 
           ocean. He paddles as hard and fast as he can.

           Rick runs down onto the beach. Stops at the shoreline. He 
           can’t go any further

           The entire beach stops to watch Norman paddle out. 

           All nervous for him. He almost gets toppled by a couple 
           waves but he manages to make it out to the line-up.

           He floats there for a minute. Watching the ocean like a 
           big cat ready to pounce. He sees a wave coming. His wave. 

           Everyone holding their breath as the MOUNTAIN OF WATER 
           rises out of the ocean. 

           Norman paddles as hard as he can. He drops in just as the 
           ten-foot wave starts to crest. His form is perfect, but 
           the wave is bearing down fast. It breaks right over top 
           of him. 

           Rick looks concerned. Until Norman comes shooting out the 
           other side of the break. Still on the board. Arms raised 
           in triumph. He lets out a primal howl.

           Trafton and the surfers erupt in cheering and applause. 

           Elly looks so happy she could cry. Even Rick can't help 
           but smile as he stands there getting soaked.

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY

           Norman paddles back out beyond the breakers. 

           He sits on his board. Looking in at Topanga Beach. It 
           looks like just another beach now but it will always be 
           ‘his’ beach.

           Norman has tears in his eyes and a big smile on his face. 

           We can't tell if the tears are from the rain or the 
           saltwater but we know that smile is for his father.
