           EXT. CHICAGO INNER-CITY STREET/RAY’S BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

           Brisk winds send leaves and litter tumbling down a derelict 
           street lined with old storefront buildings. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger killed people for a living.

           A plain gray sedan parks near the curb. Illinois plates. 
           ROGER behind the wheel, wearing dark glasses and a skull cap 
           that matches his suit. He peeks at his watch then turns to:

           A BARBER POLE 

           Spinning. A neon “OPEN” sign glows in the storefront window. 
           A rotund, silver-haired BARBER sweeps the floor inside.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Never woman or child, and he assumed, 
                        never anyone who did not suspect they 
                        could someday be murdered. 

           INT. GRAY CAR - NIGHT

           Roger wraps a black scarf around his face, leaving only his 
           dark glasses uncovered. He clicks off the Jackson 5’s “I’ll 
           Be There” on the radio.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger used a silenced black Walther
                        P99 that held fifteen subsonic forty 
                        caliber rounds in the magazine, plus 
                        one in the chamber. 

           A silenced Walther P99 rests on his lap.

                                 NARRATOR
                        He did not know that it was the same 
                        gun used by fictional spy James Bond.

           Roger’s hand grips the gun.

           THE BARBER POLE 

           stops spinning. The neon “OPEN” sign buzzes as it blinks out. 
           The barbershop goes dark.
           Two big men exit the shop. BODYGUARDS. Scanning...

           The Craggy-faced guard, CRAIG, spots the gray car - across 
           the street, half a block down - takes his six shooter from 
           his holster and cautiously crosses toward the car. 

           Footsteps.

           The rotund barber, wearing a trench coat and hat, walks out 
           of the shop aided by a cane. He stands with the pock-faced 
           guard, PAUL, quietly watching Craig step toward the- 

           GRAY CAR

           The driver side window rolls down slow. 

           Craig stops and watches. Then: 

           pft-pft. Two whisper quiet bullets rip through him. He falls 
           dead in the street.

           Paul covers the barber, reaches for his gun. 

           pft-pft. Paul’s head explodes, blood and brain on the 
           storefront window, dead before he hits the pavement.

           The barber, dotted in blood, leans on his cane, staring at 
           the car. Defiant. 

           pft. SPLAT. Blood erupts from the barber’s neck. He drops in 
           a heap under the glow of a humming streetlight, gasping. 

           Gravel crunching footfalls approach. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Sometimes in the middle of killing 
                        someone, Roger would be struck by 
                        peculiar thoughts. For instance, while 
                        shooting the barber and numbers runner 
                        Raymond Jones, he deduced that nine 
                        out of ten people he’s killed would be 
                        considered obese. He wondered if 
                        corpulent men inherently got into more 
                        trouble because of their lack of self-
                        control. He’d never met a jolly fat 
                        person and thought that was bullshit.

           The barber fights for air, blood geysering through his 
           fingers from the bullet hole in his neck. 

           He squints at a pair of Chuck Taylor’s by his face then looks 
           up at the silenced barrel of a P99.
           pft. The shoes leave the dead barber and his dead eyes, 
           footfalls fading... 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger equated himself with men who 
                        work in factories or coal mines. He 
                        did not take pleasure in his work nor 
                        was it an infliction. It was a job. 

           The dead eyes of the dead barber TURNS THE SCREEN BLACK.

                                 NARRATOR 
                        ...It was just a job.

           The title over the black screen.

                              WATCH ROGER DO HIS THING

           INT. GRAY CAR - NIGHT

           Roger unwraps the scarf and takes off his dark glasses. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger shot and killed seven men in 
                        twenty-four hours. Three targets plus 
                        four bodyguards.

           A handsome but weathering face with brown naturally sad eyes, 
           he looks older than his 32 years. Roger’s phone RINGS.

                                 NARRATOR
                        His usual fee was fifty thousand 
                        dollars per kill, but he was not paid 
                        to kill these men. 
                          (then)
                        He killed them to save James.

           The name JAMES on caller ID as the phone rings. As Roger 
           presses IGNORE we CUT TO:

                                       JAMES

           INT. JULIET’S POOL HALL - NIGHT

           A needle drops on vinyl in an old fashioned banged-up 
           jukebox. “USE ME” by Bill Withers plays.

           Roger and JAMES, handsome under his Brillo pad five o’clock 
           shadow, seedy under his pale skin, share a booth with whiskey 
           and burning cigarettes in the otherwise empty pool hall. 
                                 ROGER
                        New York?

                                 JAMES
                        Rotten fucking apple.

                                 ROGER
                        Don’t mess with New York, James.

                                 JAMES
                        Already made my play. Found out which 
                        businesses were using street money, 
                        paid off their debts, then easy peasy, 
                        Japanesey, suggested they deal with me 
                        from now on.

                                 ROGER
                        You’re loaning out money to businesses 
                        in New York?

                                 JAMES
                        Doin what I gotta to survive, Roger. I 
                        won’t be Libi’s peon forever.

                                 ROGER
                        And you expect the shys out there to 
                        just let that happen?

                                 JAMES
                        Fuck ‘em. This is America. You don’t 
                        make money, you take money. 
                          (an invite)
                        Let’s take this money.

           Roger stands to leave.

                                 ROGER
                        I gotta go.

                                 JAMES
                        I need to talk to you, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        That’s why you called me here?

                                 JAMES
                        Could use some muscle. This can work.

                                 ROGER
                        Sorry. Not my thing.

                                 JAMES
                        I know it’s not your thing...
           Roger watches James nonchalantly take his pack of smokes 
           without asking, light one up. 

                                 JAMES
                        I’m offering you the opportunity to 
                        make it your thing.

                                 ROGER
                        Ever been to France, James?

                                 JAMES
                        Can’t say that I have.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m getting out of Chicago, taking 
                        Tracie and DJ Paris. 

                                 JAMES
                        I see. Mister family man over here.

                                 ROGER
                        You should consider that.

                                 JAMES
                        Not me. I got a thing for happily 
                        married chicks. All the sex, none of 
                        the commitment. Matter of fact, I’ve 
                        been seein a girl. Guess who she’s 
                        married to.

                                 ROGER
                        Do I wanna know?

                                 JAMES
                        Our fat-ass boss that’s who.

           Roger simply shakes his head.

                                 JAMES
                        She came to me. And you know who she 
                        looks like, right? Heather fucking
                        Locklear. Am I right? Not the TJ
                        Hooker, circa ‘85 Heather. The Melrose 
                        Place, circa ‘95 Heather. She’s just a 
                        little thicker. You think I’m passin
                        that up then you’re just not thinkin
                        at all.

                                 ROGER
                        Can I offer my opinion?

                                 JAMES
                        It’s a free country.
                                 ROGER
                        You’re being stupid. One, leave Libi’s 
                        wife alone. He’ll kill you if he finds 
                        out. Two, get your money out of New 
                        York like yesterday. That’s another 
                        death wish. And three, call my guy 
                        Sloan.

           Roger hands James a business card with SLOAN INVESTMENTS
           embroidered on it. 

                                 ROGER
                        Let him put your money to work. He 
                        made me a millionaire. 

                                 JAMES
                        Millionaire?... You?

                                 ROGER
                        Why do you think I’m done?

                                 JAMES
                          (surprised)
                        You’re done? Why? What happened?

                                 ROGER
                        I gotta wait for something to happen? 
                        I’m a year ahead of schedule but isn’t 
                        there something to be said about 
                        getting out on your own terms?

                                 JAMES
                        But why now?

                                 ROGER
                        Always been the plan. Make enough to 
                        live happy then that’s it. Game over. 
                        You should plan your escape, too.
                        While you still can.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m a gangster, Roger. I don’t make 
                        plans. I just hustle to live another 
                        day.

           WHAM! The door is KICKED OFF its hinges and a 77 year old, 
           turtle neck wearing HIT MAN with a long pistol aimed enters, 
           eyeing James and Roger. 

           For a moment, no one makes a move. “USE ME” is blaring.

                                 OLD HIT MAN
                        James Rayne? I got a message from-
           POW-BANG-POW! The hit man’s chest explodes. He falls, 
           cracking his jaw on the ground. His dentures fall out of his 
           mouth with a spot of blood.

           Roger, stunned, holds a smoking .38 Special. 

                                 JAMES
                        Son of a bitch. 

           James grimaces, wipes blood from his arm. The BANG between 
           the POWS was a bullet from the old hit man that grazed him. 

           James, cigarette dangling, limps over to the hit man, his 
           limp a permanent reminder of a past injury. 

           He pulls a wallet from the hit man’s pocket, takes out the 
           DRIVER’S LICENSE, snickers when he sees New York on it.

                                 JAMES
                        Give me the heater.

           Roger hands James the .38. They both stare down at the 
           bleeding, dead hit man and his dentures. We move in on Roger.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger believed that in the “killing 
                        people for money” business, you did 
                        not speak on the job unless it was 
                        absolutely critical to survival, a 
                        principle he thought was univer-

           POW! James shoots the dead hit man, startling Roger and 
           cutting off the narrator.  

                                 JAMES
                        You all right, jumpy?

                                 ROGER
                        Fine. Just, I’m thinking about writing 
                        a novel. Sometimes I drift, get a 
                        voice in my head.

                                 JAMES
                        Novel? Hey, if I’m in it, make sure 
                        I’m the hero. Fuck being the sidekick. 
                          (then)
                        You sure you’re not interested? We’d 
                        be 70-30 partners. You handle shit
                        like this, I handle the money.

           Roger’s non-reply is all the answer James is getting. James 
           tucks the .38 in his waistband. 
                                 ROGER
                        What’re you doin with that?

                                 JAMES
                        I got cops that’ll make this look like 
                        attempted robbery, self defense. Don’t 
                        worry about it. But you can’t be here.

           Roger takes a last look at the dead hit man then walks away 
           with contemplative eyes.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger concluded that the old hit man 
                        knew the “no speaking on the job” 
                        rule, but had decided, maybe even 
                        subconsciously, to sabotage himself, 
                        making his death as much a suicide as 
                        it was third degree murder.

                                 JAMES
                        Yo.

           Roger, ignoring or not hearing James, keeps walking.

                                 NARRATOR
                        He believed that the old hit man was 
                        exhausted from killing and was ready 
                        to die. And that made him feel good 
                        about his decision to walk away.

           A hint of a smile curls Roger’s lips.

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, millionaire! 
                          (Roger turns back)
                        I’ll have to pay off the cops.

           James gives Roger a give me some money look. Roger tosses 
           James a wad of cash from his pocket. James grins.

                                 JAMES
                        My man.

                                 ROGER
                          (goodbye for good)
                        Good luck to you, James.

           Roger, stepping on the SLOAN INVESTMENTS card he gave James, 
           walks out, leaving James with a dead body and a cold smirk.
           INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           James has SYLVIA LIBI, 30s, a chunkier version of Heather 
           Locklear, up against a wall, thrusting in and out of her. Her 
           moans say she loves it. Her eyes say she loves him.

           INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           James and Sylvia quietly get dressed. James puts a shoe on 
           his prosthetic right foot. Sylvia steals a soft glance at 
           him, unable to mask her feelings for him. He catches it.

                                 JAMES
                        What was that?

                                 SYLVIA
                        ...What?

                                 JAMES
                        What? You know what. We’re just havin
                        a good time, right? 

           Sylvia huffs, turns away. James forcibly grabs her arm.

                                 JAMES
                        I need to know where your head’s at.

                                 SYLVIA
                        Why? Are you afraid of Dominick?

                                 JAMES
                        If I was, would I be dickin his wife?
                          (then)
                        What are you thinking?

                                 SYLVIA
                        ...We’re just having a good time.

           She yanks her arm free and snaps on her bra. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Asshole.

           James’s eyes don’t trust her.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           The sign on top of the building reads LIBI FINANCIAL GROUP.
           INT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - LIBI’S OFFICE - DAY

           James sits in a cushy chair in the lounge of the exorbitant 
           executive office, opening a fresh pack of Newports, doing a 
           good job of hiding his nerves.

                                 JAMES
                        What’s this about, Nicky?

                                 LIBI
                        Quiet.

           DOMINICK LIBI, 60s, the boss in Armani and his bride Sylvia, 
           in a silky dress, sip wine on the couch opposite James, 
           Sylvia glowering at James who pays the beauty no mind. Libi 
           is studying a ledger book through thick glasses.

                                 LIBI
                        This number for Philips is right? This 
                        is what he owes me now?

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        It’s right, Mr. Libi.

           Libi glares at the ledger so hard a vein in his forehead is 
           about to pop.

                                 LIBI
                        That disrespectful mother-- Okay. Deal 
                        with it. And just to be clear, I don’t 
                        want money from him. I want him in the 
                        fucking ground.

           Libi turns his glare to James who, amused by Libi’s 
           agitation, smirks as he lights up as square.

                                 JAMES
                        Tough day, huh?

                                 LIBI
                        Benjamin took a look at your books.

                                 JAMES
                        Who the hell is Benjamin?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Me.

           BENJAMIN, 30s, slender and bookish in his euro-styled frames 
           and newsboy hat, stands at the entrance door.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        We’re doing some auditing. I noticed 
                        that you have a couple 60-days over. 
                        We want you to put our guy on it.

                                 JAMES
                        Our guy? We don’t have a guy anymore. 
                        He quit.
                          (then, dismissive)
                        What are you, some kind of assistant?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        As far as you’re concerned, I’m the 
                        boss. From now on everything you do, 
                        runs through me. 
                          (then)
                        Now what do you mean he quit?

                                 JAMES
                          (to Libi)
                        Nicky, come on. We’re together ten 
                        years, I gotta go through a middleman?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You work for Mr. Libi, James, not with 
                        him. He owns the bank, you just manage 
                        a neighborhood branch. We have ten 
                        “managers” just like you. What makes 
                        you special?

                                 SYLVIA
                        Some people just have no respect for 
                        authority. 

           Sylvia sips her wine and makes eye contact with no one. 

                                 JAMES
                        Is that how you see it, Nicky?

                                 LIBI
                        That’s how it is, James.

           James, feeling disrespected, hides it with a wry smile, ashes  *
           his cigarette in a wine glass, stands to leave.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, seeing that there’s no room for 
                        advancement here at Libi Financial, 
                        please accept my resignation. 

           A “fuck you” finger to Libi, then he turns to Sylvia.

                                 JAMES
                        You take care of yourself, Mrs. Libi.
           James limps toward the door where Benjamin waits. After a 
           short stare down, and a “let him go” nod from Libi, Benjamin 
           steps aside, letting James pass.

           Libi catches a doleful look on Sylvia’s face as she watches 
           James limp out. His dark eyes fill with suspicion. 

           CUT TO BLACK.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger spent most of his time alone 
                        watching television, his only 
                        companionship coming when he paid for 
                        it. He had gotten to know a few 
                        people, but it was usually so he could 
                        kill them later.

                                 THE GIRL FROM VEGAS
                                 (about a year ago)

           INT. UPTOWN STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

           Roger, hair and face a year younger, relaxes on a futon in 
           loose tube socks, eating chips and flipping the pages of 
           Stephen Kings’ ON WRITING book. A small TV is on near him.

           ON TV: a DISCOVER AMERICA commercial comes on, a montage of 
           American landmarks scored by sappy orchestral music. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger also enjoyed traveling.

           Roger is captivated by the commercial.

           EXT. MT. RUSHMORE - AVENUE OF FLAGS - NIGHT

           Roger, among other TOURISTS, strides toward the sculpted 
           granite, flanked by tall, lighted pillars holding flags 
           representing the 50 states.

                                 NARRATOR
                        He marveled at the nightly lighting 
                        ceremony at Mount Rushmore.

           INT. CIVIL RIGHTS MUSEUM - DAY

           Roger studies a collage of information on a wall titled 
           Voices of Struggle.
                                 NARRATOR
                        He was moved by the Civil Rights 
                        Museum in Memphis.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - RAINY DAY

           Rain attacks a window, blurring the view of the Space Needle. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        But he was underwhelmed by the Space 
                        Needle in Seattle.

           Roger sits on the edge of a bed in a terry cloth robe. He 
           pops two pills from a Xanax bottle and flips through TV 
           channels. He’s content, but contention melts into loneliness. 

           He stops at a “What Happens In Vegas” commercial.

                                 NARRATOR
                        In Las Vegas, Roger met Tracie. 

           INT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL & CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - DAY

           Roger, in a suit with no tie, strolls the floor, bombarded by 
           flashing lights and the intoxicating sounds of slot machines 
           paying out. None of it fazes him. 

           He stops and stares when his eyes find a sign: 

                                     GUN SHOW 
                                     TODAY ONLY

           Above the entrance doors of a convention hall. He considers 
           taking a peek - nah - starts to move on, when- 

           He’s bumped from behind by a 120 pound hurricane. TRACIE. A 
           provocative brunette in a short skirt and fishnet panty-hose 
           storming toward the doors of a convention hall.

           He watches her from behind as she stumbles. Not drunk. One of 
           her high heels snapped. She kicks off both shoes and carries 
           them on her determined path through the doors.

           Roger hasn’t blinked since he laid eyes on her...

           INT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL & CASINO - GUN SHOW - DAY

           Tracie, nervous hands, runny mascara making her look like a 
           sexy Alice Cooper, scowls at the DEALER behind his table.
                                 TRACIE
                        I have money. What’s the problem? My 
                        money not good enough?

                                 DEALER
                        Lady, I don’t care how you get your 
                        money, you don’t walk into a show and 
                        go home with a .22. There are laws. 
                        There’s a waiting period. Don’t like 
                        it, write your congressman. 

                                 TRACIE
                        Fine. You won’t sell me one? I’ll find 
                        someone who will.

           She turns to leave but bumps into Roger.

                                 TRACIE
                        Watch it.

           She starts to walk away.

                                 ROGER 
                        What’re you afraid of?

                                 TRACIE
                          (turns back)
                        ...What?

                                 ROGER
                        Don’t buy a gun because you’re afraid. 
                        Nothing good will come from that.

                                 TRACIE
                        It’s for protection. Why do you care?

                                 ROGER
                        Take a self-defense class.

                                 TRACIE
                        Self-defense?

           Roger nods.

                                 TRACIE
                        And what happens if he’s a better 
                        fighter than me?

                                 ROGER
                        What happens if he’s a better shooter?

           Tracie takes good look at Roger, sizing him up. 
                                 TRACIE
                        What are you hawking some kind of self-
                        defense course?

                                 ROGER
                        I saw you racin to get in here and I 
                        wondered why a girl as pretty as you 
                        would be in a big hurry to get to a 
                        gun show. Then I saw your eyes. 
                          (her brown eyes blink)
                        And I saw your hands.
                          (her hands shake)
                        Whatever’s got you scared, there’s 
                        nothin a .22 can do to make it better.

                                 TRACIE
                        If this is some kind of line, mister, 
                        you don’t have to work so hard, just 
                        make an appointment.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m not interested in making an 
                        appointment.

                                 TRACIE
                        Well you’re obviously not interested 
                        in guns, so what are you doing here?

                                 ROGER
                        ...Are you free for dinner tonight? 

           Tracie stares into his confident eyes, keeping her guard up, 
           trying to get a read on Roger.

           INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM DOOR - NIGHT

           Roger, in an impressive suit and tie, opens the door 
           revealing Tracie in a classy, killer dress.  

                                 ROGER
                        What’s your name?

                                 TRACIE
                          (considering a lie)
                        ...Tracie.

                                 ROGER
                        Tracie. I’m Roger.

           They stare. She’s a brick wall, arms folded, a mean scowl. 
           Roger unleashes a grin.
                                 TRACIE
                        Something funny?

                                 ROGER
                        You look like you’re mad I left the 
                        toilet seat up.

           She contorts her lips to compress her grin but Roger sees it.

                                 ROGER
                        Show me the town before dinner?

                                 TRACIE
                        It’s your dollar, mister.

           INT. MONTE CARLO - LANCE BURTON THEATER - NIGHT 

           Roger and Tracie sit in the audience of the magic show. 

           Tracie steals a glance at Roger as he flashes a smile and 
           applauds a trick with the audience. Her smirk says she’s 
           still skeptical.

           INT. CASINO ROYALE - CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

           Roger shakes dice then holds them in front of Tracie’s rouge 
           lips. Her brown eyes ask Roger why.

                                 ROGER
                        For good luck.

           She blinks coyly, blows on the dice and he lets them go.

           INT. GAMEWORKS - POP-A-SHOT - NIGHT

           Roger and Tracie frantically shoot baskets next to each 
           other. The clock running out. The buzzer BUZZES. Roger peeks 
           at her score. She crushed him.

                                 ROGER
                        Okay. Explain yourself.

                                 TRACIE
                        Starting point guard, Palmer High, 
                        Denver, Colorado.

                                 ROGER
                        You hustlin me, Tracie?
                                 TRACIE
                        Something has to be at stake for me to 
                        hustle you, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        Tell you what, best 2 out of 3. Winner 
                        gets to pick what we do next. 
                          (holds out hand for shake)
                        Deal?

           She accepts his hand with a grin.

                                 TRACIE
                        Deal.

           The handshake ends but they don’t let go. After a moment, 
           Tracie slowly retreats her hand.

           INT. PARIS CASINO - TOP OF THE EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT

           Roger and Tracie lean on the railing, watching the Bellagio
           fountain water show in the distance. 

                                 TRACIE
                        Someday I’ll touch the real Eiffel
                        tower.

                                 ROGER
                        Why haven’t you?

                                 TRACIE
                        I don’t know. I guess I just never 
                        wanted to go to Paris alone.

           Roger grins to himself. Tracie catches it.

                                 TRACIE
                        What?

                                 ROGER
                        Nothing. I was just thinking of this 
                        French film. “Breathless”.

           Now she grins to herself.

                                 ROGER
                        What?

                                 TRACIE
                        “À Bout De Souffle” is one of my 
                        favorite movies ever.
                                 ROGER
                        Jean-Paul Belmondo is amazing in it. 
                        Godard’s best film, right?

                                 TRACIE
                        I would have guessed you’d be more of 
                        a “Bande à Part” fan.

                                 ROGER
                        Good flick. I like it. Maybe a little 
                        violent.

           She just looks at him, watching him watch the water show. 
           She’s smitten, but wondering if she can trust her feelings. 

                                 TRACIE
                        I let you win at basketball, you know. 
                        You could have picked anything.

           Roger faces Tracie like he might say something profound.

                                 ROGER
                        Do you like cheeseburgers, Tracie?

                                 TRACIE
                          (smiling)
                        ...I do.

           INT. HARLEY-DAVIDSON CAFE - NIGHT

           Roger and Tracie, dressed too fancy for the room, eat burgers 
           and fries at the noisy bar, talking loud to hear themselves.

                                 ROGER
                        You never answered my question.

                                 TRACIE
                        What question?

                                 ROGER
                        What are you afraid of?

                                 TRACIE
                        You first.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m not afraid of anything.

                                 TRACIE
                        Everybody’s afraid of something. What 
                        about snakes or Komodo Dragons?
                                 ROGER
                        I don’t think so.

                                 TRACIE
                        My son is terrified of--
                          (catches herself getting 
                           too comfortable)
                        What do you do for a living?

                                 ROGER
                        I’m a consultant with Libi Financial 
                        in Chicago.

                                 TRACIE
                        If you’re not afraid of anything, why 
                        do you have such a boring job? 
                        Shouldn’t you be a stunt man or a lion 
                        tamer or something?

                                 ROGER
                        I have a plan. Work hard for five 
                        years, invest my money and, before I 
                        hit thirty-five, never have to work 
                        again. This is year three. Two to go, 
                        then I can do whatever I want.

                                 TRACIE
                        Which is?

                                 ROGER
                        Touch the real Eiffel Tower.

           Her body flutters. He playfully eats one of her fries. She 
           averts her eyes from him, timid about their connection.

                                 TRACIE
                        You know what? Our time is up. You can 
                        pay me, I’ll be on my way.

                                 ROGER
                        Something wrong?

                                 TRACIE
                        I have other appointments.

           But she’s not moving.

                                 ROGER
                        We’re getting along okay.

                                 TRACIE
                        It’s my job. I’m good at it. 
                                 ROGER
                        I’m not paying you, Tracie.

                                 TRACIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 ROGER 
                        I don’t wanna pay you. As much as you 
                        don’t really wanna be paid.

                                 TRACIE
                        I hope that’s your fucking ego talking 
                        and not your wallet.

                                 ROGER 
                        ...What’re you afraid of?

                                 TRACIE
                        Just pay me.

                                 ROGER 
                        You deserve better.

                                 TRACIE
                        Jesus. I bet you can give it to me, 
                        right?

                                 ROGER 
                        ...I think I would like to try.

           She looks at him, conflicted. Wants to trust him... But she 
           grabs her purse and stomps to the exit.

                                 TRACIE
                        Deadbeat motherfucker! 

           EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

           Tracie stomps toward a distant cab. Her heel snaps. She 
           sighs, not again, not now. 

           She picks up the broken heel and hops toward the cab. Too 
           late. Her bubbling eyes watch the cab disappear in traffic.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger was used to making quick 
                        decisions and dealing with risk. As a 
                        professional killer, the choices he 
                        made had to be swiftly analyzed in 
                        order to eliminate or minimize the 
                        effects of unfortunate events.  
           Roger steps up behind her. She turns to him, looking up at 
           this handsome, strong man, trying to hide her emotions.

                                 ROGER
                        I’ve been alone most my life, and I’ve 
                        always believed that’s what I’m meant 
                        to be. Until I saw you.

           Roger wipes away her tears.

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t know what I’m doin, don’t know 
                        how this works, but if you roll the 
                        dice with me, I promise that whatever 
                        it is you’re afraid of, you don’t have 
                        to be afraid of it anymore.

           Tracie stares like an Emperor deciding the fate of a 
           Gladiator.

                                 TRACIE
                        I wasn’t supposed to tell you my real 
                        name.

           Roger moves his lips closer to hers... They kiss as tourists 
           pass by and the strip flashes its lights.

                                 NARRATOR
                        When Roger asked Tracie to come to 
                        Chicago, she said yes, as long as she 
                        could bring her son, DJ. 
                          (then)
                        That was almost a year ago.

           INT. ROGER’S SUBURB HOUSE - BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY - MORNING

           Morning light sneaks in through the blinds. Roger, at ease,
           watches Tracie sleep. She’s a year older, but even more so 
           the knockout. He strokes hair away from her face.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Tracie and DJ lived with Roger in his 
                        suburban middle-class home. He did not 
                        tell them that he killed people for a 
                        living. Instead, he told them that he 
                        was a traveling consultant for a 
                        financial firm, earning a modest wage.  

                                 TRACIE
                        You’re gonna be late for work.

                                 ROGER
                        I quit yesterday.
           Tracie’s surprised eyes open. 

                                 TRACIE
                        What? You said two more years. It’s 
                        only been one.

                                 ROGER
                        It was time. 

                                 TRACIE
                        Just like that? 
                          (then)
                        Are they going to have a goodbye party 
                        for you? I never got to meet any of 
                        your work friends.

                                 ROGER
                        I was on the road, Tracie. I didn’t 
                        have any friends.

                                 TRACIE
                        I don’t believe you. Somebody has to 
                        care that you quit.

                                 ROGER
                        I was thinking we should start packing 
                        for our move to Paris.

           Tracie blinks, processing what she just heard.

                                 TRACIE
                        ...Are you serious?

                                 ROGER
                        I’m thinking about writing a novel.
                        Been putting some thoughts together 
                        lately. A lot of great American 
                        writers wrote in France.

                                 TRACIE
                        We’re really going, Roger?

                                 ROGER
                        I found a place to rent for awhile, 
                        see if we like it enough to stay.

           She smiles, in love with the guy. Roger continues to stare at  *
           her, making her blush.

                                 TRACIE
                        Why are you staring at me?

                                 ROGER
                        ...Your breath smells like old ham.
           Tracie playfully beats Roger up. He rolls her over, straddles  *
           her, gazes into her eyes then kisses those lips.

                                 TRACIE
                          (you love me)
                        Even when my breath is stinky?

                                 ROGER
                        Even when your breath is stinky.

           They kiss again. Tracie gets up, slides into a robe.

                                 TRACIE
                        I have to go tell DJ. We have to pack.

           Roger watches her excitedly leave the room. 

           His phone CHIMES. He takes it off the night stand, checks the  *
           text... Frowns.

           EXT. STATE STREET BRIDGE - DAY

           Benjamin, leaning on the railing overlooking the river, 
           holding a Starbucks coffee, turns to Roger, also leaning on 
           the railing, watching a tourist boat float by.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Better you hear it from us than any 
                        other way. In return, Mr. Libi trusts 
                        you will not speak on it or interfere.

                                 ROGER
                        If you kill James you wanna know if 
                        you’ll have to deal with me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I heard about what he did for you.

           Roger seems to drift and we CUT TO:

                                     INTERLUDE
                                   (4 years ago)

           INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - FOUR YEARS AGO - DAY

           A sign reads FUTURE HOME OF THE LIBI FINANCIAL GROUP. Another  *
           reads MUST WEAR HARD HATS. Loud machines, trucks and workers 
           construct the skeleton of what will be a skyscraper. 

           Amid the construction and noise, Libi introduces Roger to 
           James and a bitter grunt named EDGAR. 
                                 LIBI
                        Fresh off the boat from Afghanistan.

                                 JAMES
                        Marine?

                                 ROGER
                        Private contractor.

                                 EDGAR
                        Get a lot of work out there?

                                 ROGER
                        Fair share. Nothin more, nothin less.

           Above them, a crane raises a pallet holding long steel rods 
           to the top of the skyscraper.

                                 EDGAR
                        I was in Kuwait first time around. 
                        Barely broke a sweat.

                                 ROGER
                        Heard it was like that.

                                 EDGAR
                        Now, I keep Mr. Libi safe. I got that 
                        handled. It’s what I do. 

                                 ROGER
                        Well good for you, and Mr. Libi, too.

           Edgar, offended, mean mugs Roger. Roger sips his coffee.

                                 EDGAR
                        Who the hell is this guy, Nicky?

                                 LIBI
                        Settle down. He’s not after your job 
                        if that’s what you’re getting at. He’s 
                        the go to for the problems with my 
                        unlisted clients. He’ll do the heavy 
                        lifting.
                          (then, to Roger)
                        On that note, this’ll be the last time 
                        I see your face. James’ll let whoever 
                        needs to know about you know about you 
                        but I’ve never heard of you. Clear?

                                 ROGER
                        Crystal.
                          (then)
                        Which one is James?
                                 JAMES
                        That would be me. You got a name, 
                        friend?

                                 ROGER
                        I do. But you can call me Roger.

           James slowly grins then pats Roger on the back.

                                 JAMES
                        I like this guy already. Listen, I run 
                        a little hole in the ground called 
                        Juliet’s. Stop by if-

           An ungodly SCREAM cuts James off. The men look over to where 
           a worker has been skewered in the back by a steel rod. His 
           nearby co-worker doing the screaming over the dead body. 

                                 ANOTHER CO-WORKER (O.S.)
                        Look out!

           The men look up and see another rod rocketing down from the 
           crane, homing in like a heat-seeking missile. 

           James shoves Roger out of the way but stumbles.

           SLICE! The rod cuts through James’s leg, instantly relieving 
           him of his right foot. James SCREAMS.

                                 EDGAR
                        Oh, shit!

           Edgar’s last words. THUD! A rod pierces through the top of 
           his hard hat and lodges in his skull like a stick in a candy 
           apple. He crumbles to his knees, then hits the ground.  

           Edgar is dead.

           Roger and Libi look up. The pallet on the crane sways in the 
           wind, having lost three rods. 

                                 LIBI
                        ...Jesus.

           James screams and bleeds on the ground. Roger looks at him, 
           his eyes showing gratitude...

           BACK TO: EXT. STATE STREET BRIDGE - DAY

           Roger turns to Benjamin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        ...But this is business. 
                                 ROGER
                        This ain’t business. If Libi is 
                        feeling embarrassed, he should start 
                        with his wife.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Rest assured, Mrs. Libi has been dealt 
                        with. As for James, he’s been skimming 
                        for years. Mr. Libi gave him a pass 
                        because he’s good, maybe the best Shy 
                        in Chicago. But now, let’s just say 
                        it’s come to our attention that James 
                        was not content with his position. And 
                        as a discontent, he can’t be trusted. 
                          (then)
                        It’s business, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        What do you expect me to say?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Put your feelings for him aside. We 
                        know he lost a foot saving your life. 
                        That’s noble and worthy of your 
                        affection. But if tick came to tack, 
                        would you trust him? He knows things, 
                        Roger. About Mr. Libi. About you.

           Roger is mute, knowing Benjamin has a point. Benjamin takes 
           his time, sips his coffee, watches the boat.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        We were hoping maybe you’d postpone 
                        your retirement.
                          (then)
                        Mr. Libi would like to offer you the 
                        job, Roger. 

           Roger scowls hard at Benjamin.

                                 ROGER
                        You want me to kill James?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        He said no one can do it better.

                                 ROGER
                        ...Are we done, here?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Mr. Libi is willing to give you-

                                 ROGER
                        I said are we done?
           Benjamin faces Roger.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        It’s happening with or without you. 
                        Are we going to have trouble?

           They stare for a beat, Roger battling to clear his conscious.  *

                                 ROGER
                        James knew what he signed up for.

           And with that, Roger walks away, Benjamin shrinking behind 
           him, his SUV just up ahead.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger thought about what life would be 
                        like in Paris. He was excited to take 
                        Tracie and DJ to the Louvre and other 
                        French museums. He knew that 
                        assimilating to a foreign culture 
                        would be difficult, but probably not 
                        as difficult as killing people for a 
                        living. 

           Roger stops, rubs his temples like he’s trying to ease a 
           headache, then looks at his SUV just a step away.

           He wavers... walks back to Benjamin.

                                 ROGER
                        Does Libi have work?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What do you mean?

                                 ROGER
                        You know what I mean.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        There’s always work for you, Roger. 
                        Especially in this economy. 

                                 ROGER
                        I’ll put in some work, but I don’t 
                        want your money.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What is it you want?

                                 ROGER
                        Let James walk. 

           Benjamin looks Roger in the eyes, making sure he understands.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        You’re willing to take on his debt? 

                                 ROGER
                        And listen, when this is done, I don’t 
                        want to hear from Libi and I don’t 
                        want to see you. I’m through. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I’ll run it by Mr. Libi.

                                 ROGER
                        Fuck that. He sent you here. You speak 
                        for him, right?
                          (then)
                        Yes... or no?

           Benjamin turns back to the river, thinking...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Yi Lee, Joe Asher and Bobby Philips.

           A phone rings.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CUBICLE - MORNING

           Special Crimes Unit DETECTIVE BROCK, playing sodoku in a 
           workbook, ignores his ringing phone. 40s, mustache, wearing a  *
           suit a few hundred bucks above his pay grade.

           His dark-haired, bubblegum smacking, curvy partner VALENTINA,  *
           in the adjacent cube, shines her shield. 

                                 VALENTINA 
                        You gonna get that, detective?

                                 BROCK
                        Got enough problems right here.

           He waves his sodoku book. She smirks. The phone keeps 
           ringing. He sighs, weary, and still ignoring it. 
           INT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - LOBBY/ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Brock and Valentina stride past uniformed cops buzzing around 
           a crime scene and trying to keep the frenzied media at bay. 

           A CORONER examines a CHINESE MAN IN A TRACKSUIT on the floor 
           in the elevator. The blood spilling from his head wound is 
           still fresh.

           Brock and Valentina duck the yellow tape and step into the 
           elevator. Brock sips his morning orange juice.

                                 BROCK
                        Somebody finally caught up to that 
                        piece of shit Lee.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Is that a single shot?

                                 CORONER
                        40 caliber subsonic round. Close 
                        range. Why is S.C. on this?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Lee was smuggling underage girls from 
                        overseas and selling them to the 
                        highest bidder. For whatever reason 
                        that falls under “special crime”. 

                                 CORONER
                        Well, you can close your file on him. 
                        He’s deader than Elvis.

                                 BROCK
                        Good. Homicide finds whoever granted 
                        him his permanent vacation, let me 
                        know. I’d like to shake his hand.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Or her hand.

           Brock looks at Valentina like she’s nuts.

           EXT. MCMANSION - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Late afternoon sun shines on three fully dressed dead bodies, 
           floating in the blood-stained pool. The one in the middle is 
           on his back with a bullet hole in his forehead, the other two 
           float on their bellies. 

           Brock, Valentina and a couple uniformed cops look at the 
           bodies from the edge of the pool while detectives do 
           detective work all around them.
                                 VALENTINA
                        Admit it, you’re sexist.

                                 BROCK
                        You name me one time you heard about a 
                        woman shooting a man that wasn’t 
                        domestic. Give me one example.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Aileen Wuornos.

                                 BROCK
                        The prostitute that shot rapists with 
                        her .22? That’s your example?

                                 VALENTINA
                        You can’t prove Lee’s killer wasn’t a 
                        woman, Brock.

                                 BROCK
                        Maybe not, but let me ask you this:
                        how big would you say the hole in 
                        Asher’s head is?

           They look in the pool at the guy shot in the head.

                                 VALENTINA
                        I don’t know. 9 millimeter big?

                                 BROCK
                        Not a bad guess. But I’d bet my life 
                        on 40 caliber big.

                                 VALENTINA
                          (putting it together)
                        ...Like Lee?

                                 BROCK
                        Exactly like Lee is my hunch.

                                 VALENTINA
                        What’s the connection? 

                                 BROCK
                        Can’t call it yet, but if I’m a piece 
                        of shit, I’m on the lookout for a man 
                        carrying something that shoots .40 
                        caliber bullets. 
                          (then)
                        It’s serial, Valentina. Which 99.9% of 
                        the time means it ain’t a woman. Which 
                        means we just eliminated half of 
                        Chicago as suspects.
           Valentina frowns. A fedora floats by in the pool.

                                 BROCK
                        Look at that... That’s a nice hat.

           EXT. CHICAGO INNER-CITY STREET/ RAY’S BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

           A LITTLE BOY standing under the glow of a streetlight points 
           at Raymond Jones’ dead body near the curb. Jones’ pock-faced 
           guard Paul is nearby, Craggy-faced Craig is in the street.

                                 NARRATOR
                        The original list given to Roger was 
                        Yi Lee, Joe Asher and Bobby Phillips. 
                        When Philips could not be found, Libi 
                        replaced him with barber and numbers 
                        runner Raymond Jones.

           Brock and Valentina are flanked by uniformed cops as they 
           approach Jones from their cars which are flashing red and 
           blue lights. The uniformed cops have their guns ready.

           Brock kneels to Jones’ body.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Too bad. I liked Ray.

                                 BROCK
                        Ray was good people as far as pieces 
                        of shit go. Very generous.  

                                 VALENTINA
                        40 caliber?

                                 BROCK
                        Afraid so. Maybe we’ve got our very 
                        own David Berkowitz, ‘cept David used 
                        a 44, hence the monicker “.44 caliber 
                        killer”. He almost got a cousin of 
                        mine, but cuz got away. True story.

                                 VALENTINA
                        So it’s probably not a woman. But that 
                        doesn’t mean a woman’s not capable.

                                 BROCK
                        Look, I’ll admit that women can be 
                        serial killers, but they don’t go 
                        around shooting people. They’ll poison 
                        old ladies in nursing homes, but they 
                        don’t put bullets in bad guys. Can we 
                        agree on that?
                                 VALENTINA
                        ...I guess. 

                                 BROCK
                        Good. Now, about these seven bodies, 
                        our problem when they were breathing. 
                        Now? Let’s mourn our loss at Lou’s.

                                 VALENTINA
                        You said yourself this might be 
                        serial. 

                                 BROCK
                        So?

                                 VALENTINA
                        So, Super just made unsolved multiples 
                        special crimes... That’s us.

           Brock looks at Valentina like she just shit in his OJ.

                                 BROCK
                        ...I hate this fucking job.

           INT. ROGER’S UPTOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Roger stands at the door signing papers attached to a 
           clipboard. He signs JOHN CRAYTON. A stumpy LANDLORD waits.

                                 LANDLORD
                        You were a good tenant, John. Never a 
                        complaint, always paid your rent on 
                        time. Hate to see you go. 

           Roger hands the landlord the clipboard, shakes his hand.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m gonna miss this place. But it’s 
                        time to move on.

                                 LANDLORD
                        Well, she’s still yours till the end 
                        of the month. You take care now.

           The landlord leaves. Roger turns away from the door, takes a 
           good, long look at the lifeless studio apartment. A futon. A 
           coffee table. A small TV. Not much else.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger was ready to commit to his life 
                        with Tracie and DJ.
           INT. ROGER'S UPTOWN APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Wrapped in a post-shower towel, Roger brushes his teeth in 
           front of the medicine cabinet mirror in the cramped bathroom.   *
           His chiseled chest showing off an old battle wound.

                                 NARRATOR
                        He would no longer need his secret 
                        uptown apartment or his Walther P99.

           He notices gray hairs on his head. Touches them, like he 
           can’t believe it. 

           He opens the medicine cabinet. A single bottle of 
           prescription pills: Xanax. For Anxiety. He grabs the bottle.

           INT. ROGER'S UPTOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Roger takes a note pad and pen from the coffee table where 
           his P99 takes a much needed breather. 

           On the note pad, the names: LEE, ASHER, PHILIPS, JONES.

           He strikes out JONES, leaving PHILIPS unmarked. 

           He stares at the note pad... Scribbles. Glowers. Scribbles 
           harder. Scowling. Faster. Angry. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And though it required a few bad guys 
                        to die, Roger would take solace in the 
                        fact that he repaid his debt to the 
                        man that lost a foot saving his life. 

           Roger slaps the note pad on the coffee table next to the P99,  *
           the name PHILIPS remains unblemished. 

           BLACK, then:

                                ROGER AT THE WEDDING

           INT. ROGER’S SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Half packed moving boxes on the floors and counters. A sticky  *
           note on the fridge. Roger steps over to it, reads it.

                                 TRACIE’S VOICE
                        Went to B-B-Q at the Engelstad’s. 
                        Please come... Please.

           Roger sighs, he’s not into it. His phone chimes. He checks 
           the text... dismisses it with a smirk, walks away.
           EXT. ENGELSTAD HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           TIM, a lanky suburbanite, affable like your favorite uncle, 
           flips burgers on the grill in his Hawaiian shirt. 

           Tracie and Roger stand near Tim. Roger fidgets with his 
           plastic red cup. Tracie peeks at him, offers a grin. He grins  *
           back but she sees through it. He’s uncomfortable.

                                 TIM
                        So, Roger, Paris in a couple days, 
                        huh? You excited?

                                 ROGER
                        Pretty excited, yeah. 
                          (a hint to Tracie)
                        Still have a lot of packing to do.

                                 TRACIE
                        But we have some time to hang out. 
                        Thanks for inviting us, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Of course, neighbor. We’re going to 
                        miss you on our morning power walks.

                                 TRACIE
                        I know. Me, too. Sorry I missed the 
                        last few mornings. I’ve just been so 
                        tired lately.

                                 TIM
                        Kids incoming!

           Adults step aside as a bunch of laughing and screaming kids 
           run by. Roger’s eyes stay on DJ, chubby, on the verge of fat,  *
           bringing up the rear, moving slow and panting hard.

                                 TIM
                        I just wish you weren’t moving. I 
                        wanted to hit Roger up for some 
                        financial advice so I can retire, too. 
                        Maybe move to Maui.

                                 TRACIE
                        He couldn’t help you with that. He 
                        didn’t really deal with money.

                                 TIM
                        Really? So what does a financial 
                        consultant do?

           They see that Roger is still looking at DJ, not paying 
           attention. Tim taps his arm.
                                 ROGER
                        What’s that?

                                 TIM
                        At work. What did you do?

                                 ROGER
                        Mostly handled delinquent accounts.

                                 TIM
                        Like a collector?

                                 ROGER
                        They called me when the collector 
                        couldn’t get the job done.
                          (then)
                        Excuse me.

           Tracie and Tim watch Roger walk over to- 

           DJ 

           leaning on a tree, struggling to catch his breath.

                                 ROGER
                        You okay, DJ?

           DJ nods. He’s fine. Tracie watches from near the grill.

                                 ROGER
                        Have some water.

           Roger offers DJ his red cup. DJ takes it, downs the water. 
           Roger notices DJ’s round belly poking out of his shirt a bit.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger was careful with how he dealt 
                        with DJ. When he offered advice, he 
                        would begin with placating phrases 
                        like “I think,” or “In my opinion”. He 
                        feared that if he grew too close to 
                        DJ, DJ could end up like him. A loner
                        with only a gun as a friend.

                                 ROGER
                        DJ?

           DJ’s eyes find Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        I think you should try yogurt for 
                        breakfast instead of Frosted Flakes. 
                        It’ll help your stamina. 
           DJ, shamed, a bit confused, nods. 

                                 DJ
                        Okay.

                                 ROGER
                        Go have fun with your friends.

           DJ runs off. Tracie, grinning, steps up to Roger.

                                 TRACIE
                        He all right?

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, he’s fine. He just-

           POW! POW! Roger jumps in front of Tracie, instinctively
           protecting her. His tense eyes dart.

           POW! A backfiring rust bucket passes by on the nearby street.  *
           Roger relaxes.

           Tracie looks at him, a hint of suspicion in her eyes. He 
           looks right back, his eyes revealing nothing.

                                 TRACIE
                        Maybe we should go home. I’m getting a 
                        headache.

           A familiar CHIME from Roger’s phone. He checks the text. 
           Pauses. Thinking...

                                 TRACIE
                        Who is it?

                                 ROGER
                        Work. 

                                 TRACIE
                        Why? What do they want now?

                                 ROGER
                        Probably nothing. It’s my fault for 
                        not giving them enough notice. 

           Roger kisses Tracie’s cheek.

                                 ROGER
                        I’ll be home soon.

                                 TRACIE
                        You don’t have to go, you know. 
           Roger looks at her, her cute, pouty face, knowing she’s 
           right, but ignoring the feeling. He takes her hands.

                                 ROGER
                        Two more days. We’ll be in Paris. All 
                        this bullshit will be behind us.

                                 TRACIE
                        That a promise?

           Roger kisses her lips to confirm his promise, walks away, his  *
           frown returning. Behind him, Tracie’s suspicions linger.

           EXT. NAVY PIER - PIER PARK - SUNSET 

           Lights illuminate the Ferris wheel, spinning high into the 
           orange sky. Roger, in shades, walks the midway with Benjamin 
           who eats cotton candy.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        We wanted to thank you for the 
                        exceptional work you’ve done. 

                                 ROGER
                        I asked you not to contact me.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        We’re ready for the last one.

           Roger stops. Benjamin stops with him.

                                 ROGER
                        Last one? What last one?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Bobby Philips. We found him.

                                 ROGER
                        What does that have to do with me?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Well... It completes our deal.

                                 ROGER
                        The deal was three. I did three.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Who said the deal was three, Roger? 

           Roger sneers with “fuck you” in his eyes.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        The deal included Philips. When we 
                        couldn’t find him we gave you an 
                        additional job. But now that we have-

                                 ROGER
                        You’re gonna dick me? You’re gonna
                        make me do this? 

           Benjamin takes a wedding reception invitation from his coat, 
           hands it to Roger. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        His son is getting married tonight. 
                        You’re invited to the reception.

           Roger stares at the invitation.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What do you know about Bobby Philips?

                                 ROGER
                        I’ve heard things.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Forget what you’ve heard. 
                          (then)
                        A kid busts into a house over in 
                        Winnetka.

           The CLACK-CLACK of a pump-action shotgun slide:

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT (BLACK AND WHITE)

           A SCOWLING KID holds the shotgun as he stomps up the stairs 
           of the house, kicks in the door with his high-top Nikes.

                                 BENJAMIN (V.O.)
                        Probably thinking he’s about to score 
                        some jewelry, maybe an XBox, but the 
                        first thing he sees-- 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT (BLACK AND WHITE)

           Kid stands in the doorway gaping at cash and coke on the 
           floor and an OLD GUY wearing a visor like an old bookkeeper, 
           sending stacks through a cash counter. 

                                 BENJAMIN (V.O.)
                        Coke and cash mountain high.

           Old Guy puts his hands up. Kid starts collecting the goods.
                                 BENJAMIN (V.O.)
                        The kid leaves with five hundred grand 
                        and two keys. He hit the jackpot.

           INT. METRO TRUCKING - GARAGE - NIGHT (BLACK AND WHITE)

           Semi-truck cabs parked in the immense garage. A row of seven 
           people, adults to kids, with black sacks over their heads sit 
           on their knees, hands cuffed behind their backs.

                                 BENJAMIN (V.O.)
                        Later that night - we’re talking mere 
                        hours after the robbery - the kid, his 
                        mother, father, sister, uncle, aunt, 
                        cousins all rounded up by a man who 
                        works for Philips known as “The Good 
                        Doctor” and his Mexican partner Jose. 
                        Jose’s hobby is bomb making. 

           Snakeskin cowboy boots step down to the line. 

           The last person, the kid, not wearing a sack, begs for his 
           life through tears. 

           THE GOOD DOCTOR, bald, wearing a surgeon’s mask, kneels to 
           him and strokes his head, comforting him.

                                 BENJAMIN (V.O.) 
                        Most of their body parts were never 
                        recovered.

           The Good Doctor reveals a buck knife. The kid freaks out.

           EXT. NAVY PIER - SUNSET

           Roger looking at the reception invite, half listening.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I know that none of us is without sin, 
                        Roger, but Philips... He is the devil. 

           Roger chews it over... Then tries to hand the invite back.

                                 ROGER
                        No... Not enough time. 

           Benjamin ignores the invite.

                                 BENJAMIN 
                        He’s proven elusive. Tonight could be 
                        our only chance.
                                 ROGER
                        A hundred people’ll be there. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Maybe more. But we’re sure you’ll find 
                        a way to make that advantageous. 

                                 ROGER
                        He’ll have security.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Nothing you haven’t seen-

                                 ROGER
                        It’s his son’s wedding!
                          (then)
                        I won’t do it.

           Benjamin nonchalantly eats the last of his cotton candy.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Mr. Libi won’t force you to do this, 
                        but please, consider what it could 
                        mean for James... and for you.

                                 ROGER
                        For me?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You think a guy who knows what you 
                        know, who has done what you’ve done, 
                        is usually allowed to walk? You’re 
                        standing here tonight because Mr. Libi 
                        respects you, Roger. Don’t make him 
                        lose that respect.

           Benjamin walks away leaving Roger fuming, holding the invite.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger did not rely on extravagant 
                        gadgets to do his job.

           INT. ROGER'S UPTOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           Roger opens a closet door, takes out a retro-style tux, bow 
           tie and shoes to match, then a thin bulletproof vest. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        His only guns were his P99 and an M21
                        sniper rifle that he had fired once. 

           Roger smooths out the tux and bulletproof vest on the bed.
           BATHROOM

           Roger, wearing the tux, opens the medicine cabinet, takes two 
           Xanax, then slides open a hidden door where a mannequin head 
           wearing a puffy wig and fake facial hair hides. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        On the occasions he feared being 
                        noticed, Roger wore a disguise.

           LIVING ROOM

           The windows are covered with dark shades and blinds. Roger, 
           transformed in the tux, the wig and the goatee, sits on the 
           futon with his head down, possibly praying, gripping his P99. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        In his disguise, he reminded myself of 
                        his father, a decorated Green Beret 
                        who abandoned him when he was only 
                        ten. He never knew his mother, but 
                        hoped to find her someday.

           He screws on the silencer. 

           INT. WEDDING RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           A string quartet plays a slow song in the dimly lit hall.

           Well-dressed onlookers watch a YOUNG BRIDE dance under a 
           glimmering chandelier with her portly, affable and nervous 
           new husband, DAVID PHILIPS. 

           Roger, holding a glass of champagne, joins the onlookers at 
           the edge of the dance floor, mixing in well with the crowd.

           He glimpses BOBBY PHILIPS on the other side of the floor. 
           50s, a pit bull in a tux, holding a glass of champagne. 

           Bobby catches Roger’s gaze. Stares.

           Roger, feeling the stare, averts his eyes. 

           Bobby, eyes still on Roger, downs his bubbly and walks off.

           Roger peeps Bobby stepping into the restroom.
           INT. WEDDING RECEPTION HALL - RESTROOM - DAY

           Roger steps into the big restroom. He pulls his P99 from his 
           back and scans, see’s Philips’s pants around his ankles in a 
           stall.

           HUNTZ and GRISSOM, private security guards, both too muscular 
           for their bad suits, rush into the restroom, surprising Roger 
           who swings his gun, too late.

           Grissom POPS Roger in the head with his Glock, opening a cut. 
           He takes the P99 and pulls Roger to a mirror wall. 

           Huntz guards the closed door. The quartet music seeps in. 

                                 GRISSOM
                        Hands on the mirror.

           Roger puts his hands on the mirror, his back to the door. 

           Grissom presses the P99 against Roger’s left temple and his 
           Glock against Roger’s right temple, sandwiching Roger’s head 
           between cold steel. 

                                 GRISSOM
                        You have five seconds to tell me why 
                        you’re here. Five... 

                       NARRATOR
                                                    GRISSOM
                                          Four... 
                                          Three... 
                                          Two........... 
                                          One.
           Roger was comforted by the 
           knowledge that whenever he 
           heard a countdown as a 
           threat, the gunman had no 
           real intention of shooting.

           Grissom freezes after one. Through the mirror, Roger sees 
           that Grissom has taken his eyes off of him for a split 
           second, all the time he needs.

           Roger spins and CRACK! Hits Grissom with a jaw-rattling 
           elbow, knocking him out. Roger catches Grissom and his 
           airborne P99 before they hit the floor. 

           POW-POW! Huntz fires his echoing .45 at Roger. The bullets 
           rip up Grissom’s back, Roger using Grissom as a shield. 

           pft-pft. Roger puts two silenced P99 shots in Huntz who 
           crumbles to the floor. Then, for a moment, only the faint 
           music from the quartet is heard.

                                 ROGER
                        You can come out now, Bobby.
           A toilet flushes. Bobby Philips slowly steps out of a stall, 
           faces Roger...

           RECEPTION HALL 

           The wedding party reacts to the gunfire. David, about to cut 
           a slice of wedding cake, cocks a brow.

           RESTROOM

           Roger looks into the venomous eyes of Bobby Philips.

                                 PHILIPS
                        ...You better kill me-

           pft-pft-pft! Three .40 cal bullets blast Philips in the 
           chest. He falls to the floor.

           Roger steps over to him, leveling his P99 for the kill shot. 

           The restroom’s door swings open. A glint catches Roger’s eye. 

           pft!

           A bullet hits David Philips in the gut. 

           A shiny CAKE CUTTER drops from his hand, bounces on the floor 
           in SLO-MO. 

           David weakens. His melancholy eyes find Roger, then he falls 
           on top of his father.

           Roger is frozen, but stoic... He snaps out of it, finds a 
           window above the mirror wall.

           He quickly but thoroughly wipes his prints off the mirror, 
           jumps on a urinal, bounces to the window and climbs through 
           as a GROUP opens the door and gasps at the fallen bodies.

           The bride pushes through the group, sees Philips and David 
           lying in still-spilling blood at her feet and SCREAMS.

           INT. ROGER’S SUBURB HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tracie lies alone in bed, looking at a home pregnancy test, 
           her eyes welling up with happy tears. 
                                 NARRATOR
                        Whenever Roger returned to his middle 
                        class home from killing someone, he 
                        would never bring any evidence of his 
                        work. He would usually go to his 
                        uptown apartment to drop off his P99. 

           The test is positive. 

           Roger steps into the room. Tracie quickly hides the test 
           under the bed.

                                 NARRATOR
                        On the night he shot Bobby and David 
                        Philips, Roger decided to keep his P99
                        with him.

           Roger sits on his side of the bed and covertly slides his P99
           under it. He unbuttons his shirt. 

                                 TRACIE
                        Be home soon, huh?

           Roger says nothing. Somewhere in the dark a phone RINGS.

                                 TRACIE
                        That’s your phone.

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t care.

           Tracie looks concerned as the phone continues to ring...

           INT. JULIET’S POOL HALL - NIGHT

           James sits at the bar with his ringing phone to his ear. 
           ROGER on the phone’s screen. The phone rings and rings...

                                 JAMES
                        Shit.

           POP! James is punched in the face by a fist wearing brass 
           knuckles. He’s knocked to the floor.

           James spits blood then sneers up at the EL-AMIN BROS, three 
           thugs in long coats staring down at him. FREEZE FRAME: 

                                 THE NEW YORK THING

           UNFREEZE: BROOKLYN, the lead thug in the middle, stands over 
           James wearing the knuckles.
                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN
                        Shoulda never fucked with New York.

                                 JAMES
                        I can get your money.

                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN
                        You don’t go into another man’s yard 
                        and shake the apples from his apple 
                        tree, James. You just don’t do that.

                                 JAMES
                        I can get it. I just need to talk to 
                        my guy. He’ll float me.

                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN
                        Same guy who won’t answer your calls? 
                        Some guy, James.

           Brooklyn kneels closer to James.

                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN
                        What to do?... What to do?... 
                          (thinking...)
                        Because I’m a fan of this great city 
                        and I haven’t been here since Ryne
                        Sandberg played second base for the 
                        Cubbies, I think I’ll take a day or 
                        two to relax. That enough time to get 
                        my five hundred grand, James? 

                                 JAMES
                          (incredulous)
                        How much?

                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN
                        Five hundred. In a day or two.

                                 AMIR EL-AMIN
                        What if he runs?

                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN
                        Good question, brother. Let me tell 
                        you why James won’t run since I’m sure 
                        he’s considering it. I would warn 
                        James that if he does run, he better 
                        be ready to do it for the rest of his 
                        life. That means looking over his 
                        shoulder with every step, sleeping 
                        with one eye open every night, 
                        wondering if his car might explode 
                        whenever he starts it, shit like that. 
                                 BROOKLYN EL-AMIN (CONT'D)
                        Because whether it’s Kalamazoo or 
                        Timbuktu, we’ll find his ass, and when 
                        we do, he won’t be happy about it.
                          (to James)
                        When you see 7-1-8 come up on your 
                        phone, you answer, and we’ll handle 
                        this like businessmen. Cool?

           Brooklyn gives James a SLAP, walks out with his brothers. 

           James, on the floor, face bloody, fishes a cigarette from his 
           pocket and lights it, cool under his blood-stained face. 

           He turns and his eyes focus on the Sloan Investments business  *
           card that Roger gave him, sitting on the floor. 

           He stares at it, exhales cigarette smoke.

           INT. LOU MITCHELL’S RESTAURANT - MORNING

           James, in dark glasses that barely cover the eye bruise 
           provided by Brooklyn’s brass knuckles, drinks coffee and 
           drowns scrambled eggs in hot sauce.

                                 JAMES
                        I got an idea last night. Actually at 
                        the time it was more a thought than an 
                        idea. A guy I know claims he’s a 
                        millionaire. Could he be bullshitting
                        me? Could be. But I don’t have a 
                        reason to think he would. See, despite 
                        his profession, the dude’s got more 
                        dignity than your day-to-day 
                        bullshitter. Anyway, he keeps his 
                        money with this guy-

           James slaps Sloan’s business card on the table. He takes a 
           big bite of eggs, chews it like it’s gum.

                                 JAMES
                        Now, it just so happens I’m in deep 
                        shit and I need money. A lot of money. 
                        Fast. And since I’m pretty sure my 
                        millionaire buddy won’t approve me for 
                        a loan, I believe that my quickest and 
                        best option is to take it from him. So 
                        I’m-

           A waiter freshens James’s coffee with a smile. James nods his 
           appreciation and the waiter leaves.
                                 JAMES
                        I’m up till the ass crack of dawn 
                        tryin to figure a way to do that. Take 
                        his money. A nice clean way, where 
                        it’ll never come back to me. I got 
                        nothin. Not even a hint of a clue. So 
                        I start thinking about places I can 
                        hide, praying that I can get away
                        because I’m screwed. Then, this is 
                        dropped on my doorstep.

           James sets a Chicago Tribune on the table. Headline:
           ROBERT AND DAVID PHILIPS SURVIVE SHOOTING AT RECEPTION

                                 JAMES
                        The millionaire I mentioned? I’d bet 
                        my life he did that. And because he 
                        didn’t kill them, I have a way to 
                        relieve him of his funds and making 
                        him believe Philips did it. But I need 
                        some help. And it has to be now.

           Brock and Valentina stare at James from the other side. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        You wanna steal money from a hit man?

                                 JAMES
                        That’s correct. And this guy-
                          (taps business card)
                        Is our golden ticket.

           James sips coffee as Brock grins, intrigued.

           INT. ROGER’S SUBURB HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           DJ sits at the table, grimacing at a small cup of yogurt. 
           Roger, eyes heavy from lack of sleep, sits opposite with a 
           steaming coffee. A Chicago Tribune between them.

                                 DJ
                        You gonna read that?

           Roger shakes his head. DJ pops open the paper.

                                 ROGER
                        What section do you like?

                                 DJ
                        Comics.

           Roger nods and grins, happy with that. 
                                 ROGER
                        I never liked comics.

           Over the rim of his coffee mug, Roger’s eyes find the 
           newspaper. Headline:

           ROBERT AND DAVID PHILIPS SURVIVE SHOOTING AT RECEPTION

           He gapes at the bad news. The coffee mug trembles, then, his 
           phone CHIRPS and VIBRATES on the table. 

           He grabs it, reads the text: 911! He shoots out of his seat 
           and yells-

                                 ROGER
                        Tracie!

           The yell startles DJ. Tracie hustles in.

                                 TRACIE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ROGER
                        Take DJ and go to Beth’s. Wait to hear 
                        from me. 
                          (then)
                        Get up, DJ.

           DJ stands. Roger is ushers them out of the kitchen.

                                 TRACIE
                        Why? What’s-

                                 ROGER
                        Just take him and go... Now!

           Tracie stands her ground.

                                 TRACIE
                        No! Not until you tell me what’s going 
                        on, Roger.
                          (then)
                        What is it?

                                 ROGER
                          (a confession)
                        ...We have to run.

           Tracie’s hard glower turns into worry.
           EXT. ROGER’S SUBURB HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Tracie and DJ drive away in Roger’s SUV. Roger, in the 
           doorway, presses a speed dial number on his phone...

           Valentina watches Roger from a civilian Ford Focus across the 
           street. She blows a bubble with bubblegum. 

           INT. SLOAN’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           TANNER SLOAN, 50s, a prim and proper Brit, reads the WSJ at 
           his breakfast nook, CNBC scrolling a stock ticker in the bg. 
           “God Save the Queen” shakes his phone. He picks up.

                                 SLOAN
                        Tanner Sloan, Sloan Investments.

                                 ROGER (FILTERED)
                        Time to cash me out.

           EXT. SLOAN’S BWM 750 - DAY

           Doing 80 on I94...

           INT. SLOAN’S BWM 750 - CONTINUOUS

           Sloan drives. Roger rides shotgun.

                                 ROGER
                        Minus your fee, where’s that leave me?

                                 SLOAN
                        Last we checked it was north of a 
                        million. We invested wisely, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        How soon can I have it?

                                 SLOAN
                        All it takes is your signature and 
                        mine on a transfer form, and a quick 
                        fax overseas. An hour, maybe two.

                                 ROGER
                        Good. You bring the form?

                                 SLOAN
                        That comes from the bank. I’ll have to 
                        send for it.
                                 ROGER
                        Two hours?

                                 SLOAN
                        Likely less, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        Good. Get my money, Sloan.

                                 SLOAN
                        A year earlier than we discussed.

                                 ROGER
                        Things changed.

                                 SLOAN
                        You’re sure?

                                 ROGER
                        Don’t ask questions. The only thing on 
                        your mind should be making sure I get 
                        my money in a timely fashion. 
                        Everything hinges on this.

           Roger’s phone CHIRPS. A text message. He reads it: MICHIGAN 
           AND MONROE 20 MIN. Sloan glimpses the worry in Roger’s eyes. 

                                 SLOAN
                        I’m not one to pry, it’s just if 
                        there’s anything I can do... As far as 
                        I know, you’re one of the good guys.

           Roger rides in silence, honestly thinking about that...

                                 ROGER
                        There are no good guys.

           EXT. BETH SWEETS BAKERY - DAY

           A storefront bakery/restaurant with window paint offering 89 
           cent coffee and donuts. Roger’s SUV is parked out front.

           Sloan’s BMW pulls up. Roger steps out. The BMW drives away.

           Roger steps over to his SUV, punches an unlock code in the 
           door and opens it. He leans inside the SUV and a moment later 
           comes out holding a roll of cash.

           INT. BETH SWEETS BAKERY - DAY

           Roger steps in and scans. 
           BETH, the 70 year old baker/cashier, slicing a chocolate cake 
           at the display counter, nods toward a booth where Tracie and 
           DJ sit, the only customers here. 

           Tracie sees Roger approaching, her face a mixture of relief 
           and anger. DJ is playing Grand Theft Auto on his PSP.

                                 ROGER
                        I need to talk to your mom alone. Go 
                        wash up.

           DJ stares at Roger, then looks at mom for the okay. She nods. 
           DJ grabs a slice of apple pie as he stands.

                                 ROGER
                        Leave the pie, DJ.

           DJ rolls his eyes, puts the pie down and slogs away. Roger 
           sits in the booth opposite Tracie, lowers his voice.

                                 ROGER
                        You’re going to have questions and I 
                        promise they’ll be answered soon. But 
                        right now we don’t have time to waste. 

                                 TRACIE
                        You’re not a financial consultant.

           Roger sets the roll of cash in front of Tracie.

                                 ROGER
                        That’s ten grand. Take DJ and go. 
                        Don’t answer any calls unless they are 
                        from me. 

           Tracie eyes the money, then Roger.

                                 TRACIE
                        ...Who are you?

                                 ROGER
                        I haven’t been honest with you.
                          (then)
                        I kill people for a living. 

           Tracie stares at him, not believing it. Then, that disbelief 
           morphs into fear.

                                 TRACIE
                        You’re a--
                          (softer)
                        You’re a hit man?
                                 ROGER
                        I’ve never killed anyone who didn’t 
                        expect to be killed. These were not 
                        good men. But on my last job I made a 
                        mistake.

                                 TRACIE
                        What mistake?

                                 ROGER
                        I didn’t kill him.

           Roger’s nonchalance scares Tracie even more.

                                 TRACIE
                        ...DJ!

           Beth the baker gives the booth a concerned look. Tracie heads 
           toward the restroom. Roger grabs her arm, stopping her.

                                 ROGER
                        Hey... Hey, look at me, Tracie.

           She snatches her arm away.

                                 TRACIE
                        Let go of me.
                          (then)
                        I wanted to trust you. I needed to.

                                 ROGER
                        If you want -- will you look at me? 
                        Please, Tracie?
                          (she finally does)
                        If you want out, I won’t stop you. If 
                        you’ll feel safer without me, I’ll 
                        disappear from your life for good. But 
                        no matter what you decide, I will 
                        never, ever let anyone hurt you.

           Tracie recognizes the love in Roger’s eyes, her fear 
           beginning to wane. Roger’s phone CHIMES, text message. He 
           peeps it: YOU’RE LATE.

                                 TRACIE
                        ...I don’t want to be afraid.

           Roger reaches for Tracie’s hand.

                                 ROGER
                        You don’t have to be.

           She’s hesitant, but gives him her hand. Her eyes glisten as 
           she struggles to get her words out.
                                 TRACIE
                        I’m... I’m pregnant, Roger. 
                          (then)
                        I don’t want to leave without you.

           Roger freezes, the news rocks him...

                                 TRACIE
                        Say something.

                                 ROGER
                        Don’t move an inch until I come for 
                        you. You’ll be safe here.

           EXT. MICHIGAN AND MONROE (PAY PHONE) - DAY

           RINGS. Roger dashes to the phone, grabs it mid-ring.

                                 ROGER
                        Hello?

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        What time is it?

                                 ROGER
                        I’m here, what’s it matter?

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        It matters. What time?

                                 ROGER
                          (checks his phone’s clock)
                        ...Almost noon.

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        Let’s call it noon. 
                          (then)
                        You don’t look too well.

           Roger scans high and low for Benjamin who could be anywhere.

                                 ROGER
                        I’ve had better nights.

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        I imagine you have.
                          (then)
                        We have some info that can help you 
                        finish the job.

                                 ROGER
                        I’ve done all I’m gonna do for Libi. 
                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        He won’t like that. 

                                 ROGER
                        He’ll have to get over it. 
                          (then)
                        Have a nice life.

           Roger is about to hang up, when:

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        In anticipation of that response, I 
                        was told to make you aware of another 
                        option.

           Roger puts the phone back to his ear.

                                 ROGER
                        ...I’m listening.

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        Mr. Libi has put a monetary value on 
                        James’ transgression, on the debt you 
                        willingly took on.

                                 ROGER
                        How much?

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        One million dollars.

                                 ROGER
                        Bullshit. That’s Bullshit.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        That’s the best we can do, Roger. Pay 
                        Mr. Libi or kill Philips. The choice 
                        is yours.

                                 ROGER
                        And if I don’t pay or kill?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Let’s be honest. We both know that 
                        before this is done, someone will pay 
                        or someone will kill. 
                          (then)
                        You have 47 hours and 58 minutes.

           The line disconnects. Roger slams the phone down... 

                                 ROGER
                        FUCK!... FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!
           A black Mercedes speeds by and throws a small box at the 
           phone booth. The box pings off the booth.  

           A jewelry box. Roger picks it up, opens it. A plastic 
           wristwatch counts down from 47:57:30. 

           Roger stares at it and we CUT TO:

                                THE MAN WITH THE GUN

           EXT. ROGER’S SUBURB HOUSE - DAY

           Roger’s SUV parks in the driveway. 

           INT. ROGER’S SUBURB HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY 

           Roger creeps open the front door, his shadow stretching 
           across the hardwood floor. He treads lightly into the house. 

           DJ’S BEDROOM

           Roger enters with a duffel bag, passing all the spoils a ten
           year old could have. 

           He opens a drawer, takes out kid underwear and socks, 
           stuffing them into the bag. He pauses when he finds a cache 
           of candy and a Playgirl magazine hiding under the underwear.

           Roger looks at the naked man on the cover, baffled. 

           Then, he notices a photo strip of Tracie and DJ making silly 
           faces tacked to a bulletin board. The doorbell RINGS. 

           ENTRYWAY

           Roger tiptoes down the stairs, his P99 at his side. 

           A curvy silhouette waits outside the frost glass window. 

           Roger stops before he gets too close to the door.

                                 ROGER
                        Can I help you?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Roger? Hey, I work with Tanner Sloan. 
                        I have a package for you.

           Roger, suspicious, looks- 
           THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE 

           Valentina is holding an envelope.

           Roger hides his P99 hand behind his back, cracks the door. 

                                 ROGER
                        Sloan?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Yes sir.

           Roger’s cell phone RINGS. He pays it no mind. 

           He eyes Valentina, no idea she’s a cop, but he can feel that 
           something’s not right. He looks past her at her Ford Focus. 

           His finger inches toward the trigger of his gun as his phone 
           rings again.

                                 ROGER
                        What’s your name?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Janet.

                                 ROGER
                        What do you do for Sloan?

                                 VALENTINA
                        This and that. Kinda like a personal 
                        assistant. Just started last week. 

           Rrriiing. 

                                 ROGER
                        You got I.D.? 

                                 VALENTINA
                        I’m sorry?

                                 ROGER
                        Let’s see some I.D., Janet.

           Valentina pats herself down. Rrriiing.

                                 VALENTINA
                        I don’t think I have my-

           Before she can finish, Roger has his P99 pointed at her.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Whoa!
                                 ROGER
                        Shut up. 
                          (then)
                        Who sent you? Libi or Philips?

                                 VALENTINA
                          (genuinely scared)
                        What?

           Rrriiing. Roger racks the slide of the P99, a threat.

                                 ROGER
                        Do better, Janet.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Sloan sent me. He said he’d call you. 
                        I swear he sent me.

           Roger looks at Valentina for a beat, then takes out his 
           ringing phone. He spies the caller ID -- answers.

                                 ROGER
                        Sloan?

           INTERCUT INT. SLOAN’S HOME OFFICE 

           CLOSE ON Sloan, jittery and sweaty, but somehow his voice 
           remains cool and collected when he speaks.

                                 SLOAN
                        Hey. Change of plans. I’m sending the 
                        transfer papers over. That’ll speed 
                        things up for us.

                                 ROGER
                        Who’s bringing ‘em?

                                 SLOAN
                        My assistant Janet.

           Roger squints at Valentina... Lowers his gun. Valentina 
           exhales, relieved. 

                                 ROGER
                        She’s here.

           Roger motions for Valentina to give him the envelope. She 
           hands it to him with a pen.

                                 ROGER
                        Listen, things have changed since we 
                        last spoke. If I needed it fast before 
                        I need it light speed now.
                                 SLOAN
                        Just sign by the X. I’ll call you in a 
                        half hour, forty five minutes.

                                 ROGER
                        No need to call. I’m comin to you soon 
                        as I’m done packin. 
                          (then)
                        We got a number yet?

           A WIDER SHOT OF SLOAN shows a rope around his neck.

                                 SLOAN
                        Turned out to be a little over two 
                        million after my fee. But we’ll talk 
                        details later.

           Roger’s face twitches, trying to smile.

                                 NARRATOR
                        A stoic disposition had ruled Roger’s 
                        life, though an occasional grin was 
                        not unheard of. But when he felt like 
                        smiling, he could not easily get the 
                        muscles on his face to correspond.

                                 ROGER
                        See you soon, Sloan.

           SLOAN 

           drops the phone. He’s standing on a chair with a noose around 
           his neck. His pleading eyes look off screen at Brock.

                                 SLOAN
                        Now let me go.

           Brock looks as if he’s considering it, then KICKS the chair 
           from under Sloan. Sloan’s legs kick wildly, weaken, then 
           gently sway as he strangles to death. Brock walks away.

           ROGER

           opens the envelope and flips through the pages looking for 
           the X. Valentina waits.

                                 ROGER
                        Sorry about the gun. 
                                 VALENTINA
                        I’ve never seen a real one before.
                          (then, with wry grin)
                        It’s kind of hot.

                                 ROGER
                        Let me ask you somethin. If you had 
                        two million dollars, would you pay a 
                        million for peace of mind?

                                 VALENTINA
                        I look to God for peace of mind.

                                 ROGER
                        You’re a religious girl?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Never miss a service.

                                 ROGER
                        That explains the Chi Rho tattoo.

           She admires the religious symbol tattooed to her hand.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Reminds me that only God can judge me.

           Roger signs by the X, hands the papers back to Valentina.

                                 ROGER
                        You think He will forgive me?

                                 VALENTINA
                        “If we confess our sins to him he is 
                        faithful and just to forgive us and to 
                        cleanse us from every wrong.” 
                          (then)
                        That’s what I think.

           She smiles and walks to her car. Roger watches, then:

                                 ROGER
                        Janet...

           She stops, pauses a split second before turning back. Roger 
           is walking toward her.

                                 ROGER
                        Here you go.

           He hands her a fifty dollar bill, a peace offering.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Thanks.
           She drives away. 

           Roger looks at the plastic wristwatch, now on his wrist, 
           counting down 47:10:05... Plenty of time. 

           He punches in a text on his phone: UNION STATION. 2HRS. Then 
           goes back into the house, closing and locking the door.

           EXT. SLOAN’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           Roger rings the doorbell, waits...

           He pounds on the door, waits....

           He looks at the windows. The blinds are closed. 

           He takes out his phone, dials SLOAN, cups his ear by the 
           door. He hears a musical ringtone.

           Pounds on the door again... No answer.

           He takes his P99 from his back, covers his other hand with 
           his sleeve and twists the doorknob. The door opens...

           INT. SLOAN’S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Roger steps in, P99 by his side, the ringtone is louder, 
           coming from across the house. It’s “God Save the Queen”.

           Roger moves toward the ringtone. He stops at- 

           HOME OFFICE 

           staring inside at SLOAN’S DEAD BODY hanging from the noose. 

           Roger, keeping cool, examines the room from the doorway with 
           sharp eyes, looking for clues. The phone on the floor repeats 
           “God Save The Queen”.

           His eyes circle the room until he’s back to Sloan, his mind 
           trying to piece together what happened.

           INT. CHICAGO UNION STATION - GREAT HALL - DAY

           A few commuters amble about, tourists marvel at the 
           Corinthian columns, a couple of people wait on the benches, 
           one being Benjamin, reading the world section of the Tribune. 

           He looks up from his newspaper. Roger is approaching. 
           Benjamin grins as Roger takes a seat close to him. 
                                 ROGER
                        You’re aware that I carry a gun and 
                        that when it comes to using it, I’m 
                        better than average.

           Benjamin’s grin fades.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        ...What?

                                 ROGER
                        I’m also good with knives. Not great, 
                        but I get the job done just the same.

           Benjamin cocks a curious brow at Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        But my hands... I was trained to kill 
                        with my hands. I can’t say how good I 
                        am with them because I’ve never had to 
                        use them. I preferred shooting people.

           Benjamin realizes how close Roger is to him.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Why did you call me here?

                                 ROGER
                        To give you your money.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        I don’t understand. Where is it?

           Roger sneers at Benjamin for a beat.

                                 ROGER
                        Did Libi steal my money, asshole?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        ...Steal your money?

                                 ROGER
                        So I’d have no choice but to go after 
                        Philips. That’s what he really wants, 
                        right? He knew I would give him the 
                        million, so he found my money guy, 
                        killed him and took my two million 
                        plus, leaving me with one option.

           Benjamin, amused, tries not to grin.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Do you really believe that?
                                 ROGER
                        Keep a million. It’s yours. But give 
                        the rest back. 
                          (then)
                        Or we can see how good I am with my 
                        hands.

           Benjamin folds his newspaper.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Mr. Libi would be very disappointed to 
                        know you think so little of him. 
                        Especially considering how much he 
                        respects you.

                                 ROGER
                        If not Libi, who?

           Benjamin looks at the plastic watch on Roger’s wrist. 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Clock’s ticking.

           Benjamin tucks his paper under his arm and walks away. Roger 
           ponders his next move.

                                 ROGER
                        ...Wait.

           Benjamin turns back, sees the fire in Roger’s eyes.

                                 ROGER
                        Give me the info you have on Philips.

           INT. JULIET’S POOL HALL - DAY

           Brock holds a glass of OJ at the bar, Valentina next to him 
           with a shot of whiskey. James, behind the bar, pours a shot. 

                                 BROCK
                        To the man with the plan.

           They clink glasses and drink.

                                 JAMES
                        How long before your guy converts it?

                                 BROCK
                        Soon. I’ll let you know.

                                 JAMES
                        Two mill, right? Divided by three.
                                 VALENTINA
                        Six hundred and sixty-six grand each. 
                        But I’m taking six-sixty-five. You two 
                        can split the difference.

                                 BROCK
                        6-6-6. She’s superstitious. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        I’m spiritual, there’s a difference.

                                 BROCK
                        Different toilet, same shit. ‘Course 
                        we could cut James out all together 
                        and become instant millionaires, 
                        rendering your voodoo moot.

           James frowns, wondering if Brock is serious.

                                 BROCK
                        Fuckin with you, guy. Lighten up. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        I thought Roger made me for a second. 
                        He pulled that P99, I damn near pissed
                        myself. Didn’t even have to act.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, we’re not dancing at home plate, 
                        yet. We still have to deal with him.

                                 BROCK
                        We, James? 

                                 JAMES
                        You can put your dick back in your 
                        pants, Brock. You know what I mean.

                                 BROCK
                        I’m just sayin, from where I sit, 
                        looks like I’m the only one’s done any 
                        killing. 

                                 JAMES
                        Cuz that’s what I needed you to do.

                                 BROCK
                        Like you’re runnin shit, huh?

                                 JAMES
                        You’re five minutes away from 
                        retirement because of me. I’m the 
                        captain of the ship. I am running 
                        shit.
                                 BROCK
                        Yeah? Maybe you think you deserve more 
                        than a third.

                                 JAMES
                        Maybe I do.

                                 BROCK
                        Well, here’s your chance, captain.

           Brock un-holsters his gun, holds it out to James.

                                 BROCK
                        All you gotta do is kill me and my 
                        partner and it’s all yours. The whole 
                        two million.

           James stares at the gun, bounces his eyes back and forth 
           between Brock and Valentina. 

                                 BROCK
                        Come on, captain. 

           James lights a Newport, doesn’t have the nerve.

                                 JAMES
                        Fuck you, Brock.

           Brock smirks, re-holsters the gun.

                                 BROCK
                        That’s my point. You might’a been the 
                        man with the plan, but I’m the man 
                        with the gun. And the man with the gun 
                        says there’s been a mutiny. 

           James sneers at Brock.

                                 BROCK
                        From here on out, what I say goes. And 
                        what I say is you get word to your 
                        Philips connect about where Roger can 
                        be found. Let them deal with each 
                        other and we walk away with the cash. 
                        Simple as a baby pimple.

                                 JAMES
                        We don’t know where Roger is.

                                 BROCK
                        True. But we know where his family is.

           James looks conflicted as Brock crunches on some nuts.
           EXT. CHICAGO INNER CITY - INTERSECTION - DAY 

           POV SPY SCOPE: A CRACK FIEND limps over to a teen wearing the 
           latest cool street clothes, a CLOCKER. 

           The clocker slaps a vial of crack into the fiend’s bony hand.

           The scope whips ACROSS THE STREET, the same thing is 
           happening. Crackheads doing hand-to-hands with clockers.

           INT. ROGER’S SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Roger watches the action half a mile away through a monocular 
           spy scope, rubbing his tiring eyes, trying to stay alert. 

           He checks the countdown on the wristwatch: 41:50:05. He’s 
           been on this stakeout for hours.

           He turns on MUSIC to keep alert. ...41:01:01...

           Yawns. Cracks the window for air. ...40:05:09...

           He spots something...

           INTERSECTION - SUNSET

           A BLACK PRE-TEEN with a blue backpack exits a tenement and 
           inconspicuously walks by the clockers and fiends, down the 
           block and steps on a city bus. 

           The bus drives. A moment later, Roger’s SUV not far behind.

           INT. ROGER’S SUV - SUNSET

           Roger follows the city bus through inner-city Chicago. The 
           slow drive through the city makes him anxious. He pops a 
           couple of Xanax.

           EXT. ROGER’S SUV - CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Street lights pop on as the evening darkens the sky. The SUV
           navigates traffic, keeping pace with the bus.

           INT. ROGER’S SUV - SUNSET

           The mix of anxiety and fatigue, and now the Xanax kicking in, 
           bends Roger’s world. He tries to stay focused as objects and 
           faces blend and stretch. 
           He looks up as the rear of the city bus comes into focus. 
           Just in time, he hits the brakes and skids, almost crashing 
           into the bus. That wakes him up. 

           He cranes his neck to see who exits the bus.

           EXT. BUS - SUNSET

           The pre-teen steps off the bus without the backpack. 

           Roger watches the kid give a BUSHY-HAIRED WHITE TEEN a subtle 
           hand slap as he passes him.

           The bushy-haired teen gets on the bus. The bus drives off.

           EXT. CITY BUS/HIGHLAND PARK - NIGHT

           The bus stops in Highland Park, an upper/middle-class suburb. 

           The bushy-haired teen steps off with the blue backpack. He 
           dashes across the street. 

           INT. SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Roger watches the teen carry the backpack to the neighborhood 
           park across the street. The teen DROPS THE PACK ON A BENCH 
           then runs and plays soccer under park lights with other kids.

           Roger looks at his watch [39:10:59], anticipating. 

           A SUBURBAN MOM pushing a baby stroller approaches the bench.

           EXT. HIGHLAND PARK PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           The mom scoops up the pack and puts it in the stroller. She 
           strolls away, no idea that not too far behind her, Roger 
           follows on foot.

           EXT. MAX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The woman leaves the backpack on the steps of a colonial 
           style home, rings the bell twice, a signal, then leaves. 

           MAX, a petulant asshole wearing a KISS THE COOK apron and 
           holding a spatula, looks both ways in the doorway. Nobody’s 
           watching. He picks up the backpack and closes the door.
           INT. BETH SWEETS BAKERY - BOOTH - NIGHT

           Tracie, zoned out, sits with her arm around DJ who has his 
           eyes on a comic book store across the street. 

           Tracie flinches as the bells on the entrance door chime. 

           A MOTHER and her TEENAGED SON order from Beth at the counter. 
           Tracie exhales, checks her watch.

                                 DJ
                        Mom can I go to that comic store?

           Tracie looks out the window at the comic store, considering 
           it. A PICK UP TRUCK with a confederate flag sticker on the 
           back window parks, blocking her view. She quints at it...

                                 DJ
                        Mom?

           Tracie’s eyes never leave the truck. She watches a pair of 
           snakeskin boots step out, glimpses a gun handle breaching the  *
           waist of Wrangler jeans.  

           DJ notices that Tracie is suddenly jittery.

                                 DJ
                        Mom, what’s wrong?

           Tracie quickly finds an EXIT sign above a door in the rear of  *
           the bakery, turns back to DJ.

                                 TRACIE
                        We gotta go. Now.

           INT. MAX’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Industrial style, shiny stainless steel and reflective chrome  *
           appliances. Max stands over the gas stove, sautéing sausages. 
           The blue backpack sits on a counter behind him. 

           A small dog barks off screen.

                                 MAX
                        Quiet, Peanut!

           As Max flips the sausage, he glimpses movement reflecting off 
           the pan hanging above him. Through the reflection, he sees an 
           intruder, distorted, nonchalantly opening the backpack.

           Max takes his time... slides his hand into the pocket of his 
           Kiss the Cook apron and pulls a snub-nosed revolver. He 
           whirls, aiming the gun. No one there. Then:
           CLANG! Roger, now on the side of Max, hits Max in the head 
           with a skillet. Max drops the gun. It slides away.

           Roger grabs Max by the neck and drags him over to a chopping 
           block where a set of sharp knives wait. 

           Peanut, Max’s tiny Papillon, barks at Roger’s ankle. Roger 
           quizzically looks at the small dog.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger did not understand the affinity 
                        people had for dogs. He did not 
                        believe they made for a good companion 
                        or adequate protection. He’d rather 
                        have his P99.

           Roger puts Max’s palms on the chopping block, takes two 
           knives and simultaneously stabs the hands. 

           Max shrieks and bleeds as Roger hammers the knives through 
           his hands with a meat tenderizer. 

           Roger picks up tongs, takes a sausage from the frying pan and 
           stuffs it in Max’s mouth, muffling him and burning the hell 
           out of his tongue. 

                                 ROGER
                        Shut up and chew. 

           Max chews the sausage. The juices burn his mouth. Roger 
           waits. For a man with time constraints, he’s very leisurely. 
           Max swallows the last bite.

                                 MAX
                        You’re dead! You’re dead! You know who 
                        the fuck I am?

                                 ROGER
                        Your mail says you’re Max Garrett. I’m 
                        looking for the money your boss took 
                        from me, Max.

                                 MAX
                        Boss? Nobody’s my boss.

                                 ROGER
                        Bobby Philips. 

           Max grins a painful grin.

                                 MAX
                        You know what this is -- whose this 
                        is, and you still have the balls to-
           SLAP. Just a good old-fashioned pimp slap.

                                 ROGER
                        What do you do for Philips? You some 
                        kind of middle man?

                                 MAX
                        I’m an accountant. I keep track of 
                        things.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah? You any good? Philips killed my 
                        guy, so I need a new one.

                                 MAX
                        What?

                                 ROGER
                        Just tell me where I can find my 
                        money, I’ll be on my way. 

           Max goes mute. Maybe from the pain, probably being bold.

           Roger moves over to the stove, takes the hot skillet filled 
           with grease from the flame and steps back over to Max.

                                 MAX
                        You don’t scare me.

           Roger holds the skillet over Max’s balding head and pours a 
           touch. Max SCREAMS as his hairs singe, head sizzles.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m not gonna kill you, Max. You’ll 
                        wish you were dead. You’ll wish.

                                 MAX
                        You motherfucker!

           Roger pours a steady flow on Max’s head. Max ROARS IN AGONY. 
           The grease trailing down his face like burning sweat, 
           blistering almost instantly.

                                 MAX
                        He, he, he --

                                 ROGER
                        Relax.

                                 MAX
                        He - I don’t -- I, I don’t know where 
                        he is. I don’t know. 
                                 ROGER
                        I don’t care where he is. All I want 
                        is my money.

                                 MAX
                        He... He keeps money in stash houses. 
                        T-t-ten houses, all within a ten mile 
                        radius in Orland Park.

                                 ROGER
                        How much?

           Max regains control of his breathing. 

                                 MAX
                        He’s gonna kill you. Know that. You 
                        and anybody you care about.

           Roger lifts the skillet, ready to pour. Max jumps in-

                                 MAX
                        Up to five hundred in each. That’s as 
                        much as he keeps before we clean it.

                                 ROGER
                        Let’s start with you. Where’re you 
                        hiding it?

                                 MAX
                        No. I’m just a numbers guy. I keep 
                        track of things. The houses you want 
                        are sealed tighter than Fort Knox. 

                                 ROGER
                        You keep track of things?

                                 MAX
                        I’m a numbers guy. That’s all. 

                                 ROGER
                        Give me the houses, Max.

           Max bites his lip, angry with himself for giving up info.

                                 ROGER
                        Come on, Max. Don’t do this to 
                        yourself.

                                 MAX
                        It doesn’t make sense. You’re sayin
                        Philips stole money from you? He’s got 
                        more money than God. 
                                 ROGER
                        Would it make sense if I told you I 
                        was the guy who shot him and his son?

           Max’s eyes grow more fearful, but he’s still not talking.

           CHOP! Two of Max’s fingers no longer belong to his hand. Max 
           howls. Blood squirts like streams from cheap water guns.

                                 NARRATOR
                        When Roger looked away, as he often 
                        did when blood was spilled, he was 
                        surprised to see a box of Frosted 
                        Flakes in the cupboard. He thought of 
                        DJ and couldn’t help but wonder about 
                        the Playgirl magazine.

                                 ROGER
                        The stash houses, Max. 

                                 MAX
                        I can’t... I can’t...

           Roger takes out his P99. Max panics. 

                                 MAX
                        I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t...

           Roger aims the barrel a couple of inches away from Max’s 
           temple. He pauses, spotting a blinking light out of the 
           corner of his eye. 

           He lowers his P99, walks over to an iPhone charging on a 
           counter, its LED light blinking. 

           He powers it up, types ORLAND PARK in the search and sees 
           what he’s looking for: 

           A list of addresses and phone numbers in Orland Park. 

           Behind Roger, Max uses his teeth to jimmy the knife nailed 
           into his right hand, painful, but necessary to get free.

           Roger pockets the iPhone then: 

           CLANK. A knife bounces off his back, rattles on the floor. 

           Roger turns, looks at the knife, then looks at Max...
           MAX’S INDUSTRIAL OVEN - LATER

           Max is stuffed in the oversized oven, tied and gagged like a 
           pig ready to be roasted. Roger closes the oven door, cranks 
           the heat to 500 as Max screams muffled screams.

           Roger starts to leave. Peanut the dog barks at him. Roger 
           looks down, feeling sorry for the puppy. He drops some 
           sausage on the floor. Peanut goes at it.

                                 ROGER
                        Make it last, mutt.

           Roger’s phone RINGS. Caller ID: UNKNOWN. He answers.

                                 ROGER
                        Hello?

           A deep, Texas-twangy voice.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR (FILTERED)
                        Hello, Roger. Before we get started, I 
                        gotta tell ya, this Beth makes the 
                        best damn apple pie I’ve ever tasted.

                                 ROGER
                        ...Who is this?

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR (FILTERED)
                        This is the Good Doctor, Roger. And 
                        I’m afraid I have terrible news...

           Roger’s heart races, his hands shake.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR (FILTERED)
                        ...They’re not gonna make it.

           The call disconnects. Roger is catatonic for a beat...

           EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - ROGER’S SUV - NIGHT

           Other cars seem to be still as the SUV zooms by them.

           The SUV weaves in and out of traffic, runs red lights, 
           narrowly avoids honking cars and scowling pedestrians.

           The SUV speeds past a COP on a parked POLICE MOTORCYCLE. 

           ROGER’S SUV - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

           Roger, a blend of fury and determination, glimpses flashing 
           police lights in his rearview mirror. 
           The police motorcycle wails its siren, pulls even with the 
           SUV, screaming PULL OVER through a loudspeaker. 

           Ahead, HEAVY INTERSECTING TRAFFIC looms. Roger guns the SUV, 
           taking the lead. 

           EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           The SUV whizzes through the congestion causing cars to 
           abruptly stop, skid into street signs and rear-end each 
           other, blocking the intersection. 

           The cop slowly navigates between the stopped and crashed 
           cars, continues to chase the SUV.

           EXT. BETH SWEETS BAKERY - NIGHT

           The SUV stops outside the bakery. Roger jumps out and full 
           out sprints toward the- 

           BoOm! 

           The bakery blows, sending Roger flying backwards with glass 
           and debris. He crash lands on the hood of his SUV, rolls off, 
           wind knocked out of him. 

           The motorcycle cop pulls up, jumps off his bike and draws his 
           gun. Seeing the bakery burn, he screams into his radio.

                                 MOTORCYCLE COP
                        Unit 12 calling-

           BOOM! Another explosion from the bakery shakes the earth, 
           knocking the cop to his ass.

           Roger staggers to his feet and watches the bakery burn, ready 
           to run inside until:

                                 MOTORCYCLE COP
                        Don’t move! Don’t you goddamn move!

           Roger spins with his hands up to see the gun wielding cop 
           stepping toward him. 

                                 ROGER
                        My family’s in there! 

                                 MOTORCYCLE COP
                        On the ground, now!

           Tires BURN RUBBER on asphalt. Roger’s eyes widen as he looks 
           out at the street. 
           The PICKUP TRUCK with the confederate flag is coming. Fast. 

           Roger focuses on the truck, on the Illinois license plate, 
           memorizing those numbers, muttering them. 6281878.

           The cop looks over his shoulder, following Roger’s gaze.

           JOSE, a chubby Mexican with an affinity for homemade 
           explosives, tosses a small sticky bomb out of the passenger 
           side window of the pickup. 

           The bomb sticks to the back of the cop. 

                                 MOTORCYCLE COP
                        What the fuh-?

           BOOM! The cop explodes into fleshy shrapnel. The bloody 
           explosion knocks Roger down.

           The pickup speeds off, then, the only sound is burning wood 
           popping. Roger and body parts from the motorcycle cop lie on 
           the ground, motionless. 

           Sirens wail in the distance, drawing nearer. Pedestrians 
           begin to gather, looking at the dead cop and Roger.

           Roger moves. A little, then more. He has to get up..

           He crawls to his SUV, hops in and drives away as the sirens 
           come on full blast and we FADE TO BLACK.

                                       ROGER

           OVER BLACK

                                 BROCK
                        I need to count it?

           EXT. BIG WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 

           On the porch, Brock shakes hands with a biker named BRUCE.

                                 BRUCE
                        Can you count to two million?

                                 BROCK
                        If it’s a dollar short I’ll come back 
                        and fuck you up. I’m serious.
                          (then)
                        Tell Helen hello for me.

           Brock picks up a gym bag then struts to the driver’s side of 
           the Ford Focus in the driveway.
           INT. FORD FOCUS - NIGHT

           Valentina sits shotgun, chewing bubble gum.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Can I see it?

           Brock tosses her the bag and gets in the car. She unzips it 
           and there it is: Two million neatly bound dollars.

                                 BROCK
                        Not bad for a day’s work.
                          (then)
                        You hungry?

           Valentina is quiet, looks like she’s having doubts.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Didn’t it almost go too easy?

                                 BROCK
                        I see you’re worried.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Make me feel better.

                                 BROCK
                        It’s probably thinking of James that’s 
                        got you all bothered. You figure he’s 
                        likely to get busted for somethin, 
                        maybe not this, but somethin, and when 
                        he does, you know he’s got two crooked 
                        cops in his back pocket to bargain 
                        with. How much shit have we covered up 
                        for him? He owns our asses.

                                 VALENTINA
                        You’re not helping.

                                 BROCK
                        Look, all you need to think about is 
                        where you wanna spend your one million 
                        dollars. I’ve decided that we’ll be 
                        splitting the money two ways. James 
                        won’t be needing it where he’s goin.

           Valentina still unsure as Brock answers his vibrating phone.

                                 BROCK
                        Detective Brock... How many?... Jesus, 
                        hate to hear that... You need us?... 
                        We can do that, be there in ten.

           Brock ends the call, looks at Valentina.
                                 VALENTINA
                        What happened?

                                 BROCK
                        Bodies at Sweets Bakery. Three inside, 
                        a patrol cop outside. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        Jesus.

                                 BROCK
                        Yep... Guess Philips got the tip.

           Brock puts the car in drive, drives away.

           EXT. JAMES’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           An unassuming rambler with a detached single car garage.

           SMASH!

           Roger’s SUV crashes into the garage.

           James steps out of the house wearing a robe and holding a 
           shotgun. Sylvia Libi, half dressed, stands in the doorway. 

                                 JAMES
                        Get dressed and get the hell out.

           She turns away in a huff. James approaches the SUV with the 
           shotgun aimed. Looks inside and sees Roger passed out. 

           After a stunned beat, James says “fuck” under his breath.

           INT. JAMES’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Roger’s eyes open. He’s lying on an old couch. The room is 
           bright from morning sunshine.

           Roger sits up and surveys his surroundings. A massive 
           headache forces him to wince. 

           He spots a photo of James proudly standing behind the bar at 
           Juliet’s and realizes where he is.

           Clanking comes from the kitchen, grabbing Roger’s attention.
           INT. JAMES’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Roger enters the kitchen to see James sitting at a table in 
           front of Roger’s plastic watch, Roger’s cell phone, Max’s 
           iPhone and Roger’s black Walther P99 with a silencer. 

           James tries to read him. Roger’s cold eyes give away nothing.

                                 ROGER
                        Give me my phone.

           James tosses Roger his phone. The screen is cracked. Roger 
           tries to turn it on, no go. He shatters it on the floor. 

                                 ROGER
                        That other one.

           James tosses Roger the iPhone. Roger powers it on. It works. 

           Roger punches in a phone number, listens... The phone is 
           immediately picked up by TRACIE’S VOICE on VOICE MAIL. 

           Roger disconnects the call and stares at the floor, plotting.

           James keeps an eye on him, still not sure what Roger knows.

                                 ROGER
                        I shouldn’t have come here. 

                                 JAMES
                        Why did you?

           Roger looks up at James.

                                 ROGER
                        Bobby Philips killed my family. I 
                        didn’t have anywhere else to go.

           After a beat, Roger takes his P99 and the plastic watch from 
           the table then heads for the door. 

           A phone RINGS. It’s James’. He looks at the area code: 718. 
           His eyes can’t hide his panic as it rings again. He hits 
           ignore, looks up at Roger who is almost out the door.

                                 JAMES
                        Hey...
                          (Roger turns back)
                        Let me grab my guns.

           Roger gives James a look, considering it.
           INT. LUXURY HOTEL - DAY

           Amir, the slender El-Amin, holds a cell phone to his ear as 
           he looks at Brooklyn who watches Good Morning America on TV.

                                 AMIR EL-AMIN
                        He’s not picking up. You want us to 
                        find him?

           Brooklyn, in a terry cloth robe, keeps his eyes on the TV as 
           he eats room service.

                                 BROOKLYN
                        Give him another day. He’ll either 
                        come through or he won’t. And if he 
                        don’t, we’ll just go ahead and kill 
                        him and take the loss on the money. I 
                        don’t think I like him enough to make 
                        him work it off.

           Amir sits with Brooklyn and watches the show.

           EXT. JAMES’S HOUSE/MUSTANG SHELBY - DAY

           Roger walks to the powerful sports car, the late morning sun 
           shining behind him as he tucks his P99 in his back.

           James, his open jacket exposing a shoulder holster with two 
           harnesses holding two .45s, emerges behind Roger, strutting 
           to the car with darting eyes looking for bad guys. 

           INT. JAMES’S MUSTANG - DAY 

           James in the driver’s seat. Roger, shotgun, peeks at the 
           countdown on his plastic wristwatch as it turns to 26:00:00.

           James fires up the car. VROOM-VROOM! And they’re off.

           INT. METRO TRUCKING - GARAGE/WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Semi-truck cabs are parked inside. Also, the pickup with the 
           6281878 plates. 

           The Good Doctor deals playing cards to Jose and a TRUCKER at 
           a folding table. They eat fast food breakfast as Doc deals. 

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        A man walked by a table in a hotel and 
                        saw three men and a dog playing cards. 
                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        The dog was holdin his hand, the man  
                        goes, "That’s a smart dog." "Not that 
                        smart," they said. "Every time he gets 
                        a good hand he wags his tail."

           Jose and the trucker shrug, they don’t get it. Doc puts a wad 
           of chewing tobacco in his mouth.

                                 ROGER (O.S.)
                        Excuse me...

           They all crane their heads to Roger, standing near them. 

                                 ROGER
                        I’m looking for the good doctor.

                                 TRUCKER
                        You got an appointment?

           The trucker and Doc laugh. Jose is deadpan. Roger even grins 
           a little.

                                 ROGER
                        Let him know I’m here to kill him.

           That silences the laughter. The trucker steps up to Roger.

                                 TRUCKER
                        Boy, you better start explain-

           Roger violently head butts the trucker then grabs him by the 
           head and SNAPS his neck. If you blinked, you missed it.

           The trucker drops, his face almost even with his spine. 

           Doc stares at Roger, then stands. For the first time we see 
           how beastly gigantic this bald, redneck is.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        Don’t you look at my cards, Jose.
                          (then, to Roger)
                        I’m who you’re looking for.

           Roger takes a swing at Doc. Doc blocks it, then catches Roger 
           with a well-placed kidney punch. 

           Roger folds over. 

           Doc grabs Roger, lifts him off the ground and body slams him 
           on the pavement, WWE style, a back-breaker. 

           Roger stirs and squirms on the floor. Doc and his snakeskin 
           cowboy boots stand over him. Jose is still at the card table.
                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        Jose?

                                 JOSE
                        Si?

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        Could I trouble you to run get my buck 
                        knife and my surgeon’s mask? 

                                 JOSE
                        I have a new small explosive I would 
                        like to try out.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        Can you try it after I cut him?

                                 JOSE
                        Si. But alive would be better.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        Next time, Jose. Go on.

           Jose walks off. 

           Doc spits tobacco juice on Roger's face.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        You’re the one shot Bobby, huh? I 
                        thought Jose blew you up last night.

           A FLICK-FLICK. Doc looks to where the sound is coming from. 

           James, leaning on the entrance door frame, looking cool with 
           his .45s showing, is trying to light a smoke with a Bic. 
           Flick... flick... FLAME. He takes a drag of the Newport.

                                 JAMES
                        Don’t mind me. I’m just here to watch 
                        Roger do his thing.

           Roger KICKS Doc in the balls. Hard. Doc staggers. 

           Roger makes it to his feet and pops Doc in the jaw with a 
           haymaker, making him wobble but not fall. 

           He kicks Doc’s kneecap. The CRUNCH is enough to know that Doc 
           won’t walk for awhile. Doc falls to his stomach, in agony.

           Roger grabs Doc by the collar with two hands and drags his 
           heavy ass to a semi-truck cab near a diesel gas pump.
           CLANG! Roger bangs Doc’s head on the step bar. CLANG, CLANG, 
           CLANG-- Doc is knocked out, a giant gash in his forehead 
           spills blood. 

           Roger lets him fall to the ground, looks across the garage, 
           and sees Jose standing with a big-ass buck knife and a small 
           plastic explosive. 

           Jose charges with a YELL. 

           Roger picks up a folding chair, waits... 

           Jose getting close, faster, still yelling-

           Roger heaves the chair at the floor in Jose’s path. 

           Jose trips over the chair and falls, STABBING HIMSELF IN THE 
           HEART and dying instantly. The plastic explosive lands in 
           front of him.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger started to say, “My heart bleeds 
                        for you,” or some other movie-esque
                        cliche, but decided against it. He 
                        often wondered how he would be 
                        portrayed if a movie were to be made 
                        about him, though he was sure they 
                        would make him a good looking guy with 
                        a Beretta, a catchphrase and a 
                        convoluted character arc.

           Roger slaps Doc, trying to wake him up. 

                                 ROGER
                        Hey!... Hey, look at me!

           Roger shakes Doc. He’s unresponsive. James walks over with 
           his cigarette almost gone.

                                 JAMES
                        Try this.

           James unhooks the pump from the diesel fuel tank and sprays 
           Doc. Doc coughs awake, focuses on Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        Where’s Philips?

           Doc smirks. He’s not talking. Roger’s fist sends Doc back to 
           dreamland.

                                 JAMES
                        Not the best way to get info, Roger.
           Roger realizes Doc is out cold again, shakes him to wake him. 
           Tries more diesel fuel, splashing it all over the place. It’s 
           not working. He looks at Doc, puts his ear to his mouth...

                                 ROGER
                        He’s not breathing.

                                 JAMES
                        Then that’s that. Let’s go.

           James heads for the exit. Roger pauses, thinking... He 
           performs CPR on Doc. James looks back, incredulous.

                                 JAMES
                        ‘The hell you doin?

           Roger pumps Doc’s chest. James shakes his head.

           Doc coughs awake, again. Looks at Roger, manages a grin.

                                 ROGER
                        Philips.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        ...Just a guess, but I’d wager you can 
                        find him on his boat. He had us move 
                        some things there. 

                                 ROGER
                        What kind of things?

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        His kind of things. Money and coke.

           James, standing by the exit, lights up, interest piqued.

                                 ROGER
                        What boat?

           Doc looks Roger in the eyes, not liking what he sees.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        That info seems to be my ace. You want 
                        it, you gotta set me free.

                                 ROGER
                        Okay, Doc. Give me something useful, 
                        I’ll let you go. But before we get to 
                        that; the woman and the boy in the 
                        bakery, were they alive when you blew 
                        them up?
                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        I was just doing my job, brother. You 
                        know how that goes.

                                 ROGER
                        My job’s never been to kill anyone who 
                        didn’t deserve it or see it coming. 
                        Answer the question.

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        ...Yeah. They were alive... Barely.

                                 ROGER
                        Thank you. And thank you for the 
                        offer. But I’m gonna pass.

           Doc, suspicious, watches Roger pick up the small explosive 
           just in front of Jose’s dead body. 

                                 THE GOOD DOCTOR
                        What about the boat?

           Roger tosses it near Doc. It makes a splash as it lands in a 
           puddle of diesel fuel. 

                                 ROGER
                        Fuck the boat.

           Doc’s eyes widen. He desperately tries to crawl away from the 
           explosive with his bad knee and dizzy head.

           Roger walks to the exit where James is waiting, then turns, 
           silhouetted by the sun. He takes his silenced P99 from his 
           back and aims it at the explosive.

           Doc can’t crawl fast enough. His leg is for shit, his head is 
           bleeding but he digs deep. He doesn’t want to die.

           Roger, finger on the trigger, squeezes and- 

           BOOM! 

           Doc’s limbs separate from his body like fleshy fireworks. The 
           diesel fuel on the ground ignites into a roaring fire, the 
           fire moving closer to the diesel pumps and the semi-trucks.

           EXT. METRO TRUCKING - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Roger and James sprint to the Mustang, parked among semi-
           trucks with trailers attached. They jump in. Too late...

           KA-BOOM! The garage/warehouse erupts in fiery smoke. Debris 
           rains from the sky. 
           A moment later, the Mustang heroically emerges from the fire, 
           dodges a flying semi-truck tire, and speeds to safety. 

           INT. JAMES’S MUSTANG - DAY

           James drives. Roger, in the passenger seat, searches the 
           contacts on Max’s iPhone. 

                                 JAMES
                        Think he was telling the truth about 
                        the boat?

           Roger finds contact info on “Your Highness”.

                                 ROGER
                        Belmont Harbor, Lincoln Park.

           James nods, puts the pedal to the metal...

           EXT. BELMONT HARBOR, YACHT DOCK - DAY

           A luxury yacht dubbed “YOUR HIGHNESS” moored to a dock. Roger 
           and James stand just off the dock, look over the yacht, then 
           move toward it. 

           A SECURITY GUARD watches from a distance as they climb on the 
           yacht. He unclips his radio walkie-talkie from his belt.

           INT. YACHT - BELOW DECK - DAY

           A skylight/hatch illuminates the swanky lower deck. Roger 
           goes right, James left, checking the rooms like cops on a 
           search warrant, no nook or cranny left undisturbed.

                                 JAMES
                        What do you think something like this 
                        costs?

                                 ROGER
                        Maybe if you would have saved your 
                        ends you could have had this by now.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, I should save money. Then I go 
                        to work one night, things go bad, I’m 
                        dying, screaming, “Lord don’t take me. 
                        I got all that money in mutual funds.”

                                 ROGER
                        You make a plan. Set yourself up for a 
                        nice life then you get out.
                                 JAMES
                        Like you did.

                                 ROGER
                        Like I did.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, and how’d that work out?

           Roger lets that go.

                                 JAMES
                        That’s the difference between you and 
                        me, Roger. I know the truth.

                                 ROGER
                        What truth?

                                 JAMES
                        Once you live in this shit, you die in 
                        this shit. You can’t make plans. The 
                        only thing you can do is whatever you 
                        have to do to stay alive.

           Roger and James converge in the back, having found nothing.

                                 JAMES
                        This is futile. Philips is probably on 
                        some desert island rollin in the 
                        wheelchair you put him in. 
                          (then)
                        What’s your next move?

           Roger ignores James. He’s staring at the hardwood floor, at a 
           plank that is slightly askew. 

           James follows Roger’s stare.

           Roger kneels, inspects the plank, then moves it aside. 

           Another. Then another. Removing the flooring.

           James helps. His eyes grow as he stands back, looking down...

           They are standing over BRICKS OF COCAINE AND MORE CASH THAN 
           BRICKS TRUCK CARRIES. Millions, tightly wrapped in plastic. 

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, yes... Hell yes.

           Roger’s stoic face doesn’t share James’ enthusiasm. 
           EXT. YACHT DOCK - DAY 

           The security guard points two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN to 
           Philips’s yacht. They move toward it.

           INT. YACHT - BELOW DECK - DAY

           Roger is typing something into Max’s iPhone as James looks 
           for something to put the cash in.

                                 ROGER
                        What’re you doin?

                                 JAMES
                        We can’t carry it out in our hands. 
                        That’s gotta be at least five mil. 
                        Grab your two, I’ll take the rest.

           James finds a fishing bag and starts filling it with cash. He 
           notices Roger isn’t moving.

                                 JAMES
                        A little help. 

                                 ROGER
                        We’re leaving the money, James.

                                 JAMES
                        What...? The fuck we are.

           Roger faces James.

                                 ROGER
                        Put it back.

           James pauses, stares at Roger. Roger stares back. 

                                 JAMES
                        Seems we have different objectives at 
                        the moment. Care to explain yours?

           SQUEAK.

           Their heads snap up to the ceiling. The floor above them 
           SQUEAKS again. 

                                 #2 COP (O.S.)
                        Chicago police! Come out with your 
                        hands high or we’re comin down.

           James, panicky, looks at Roger. Roger stays cool.
           INT. YACHT - UPPER DECK - DAY 

           The policemen wait a beat then nod to each other. They pull 
           their guns, move down the stairs...

           INT. YACHT - BELOW DECK - CONTINUOUS

           The policemen creep down the stairs, weapons drawn. They see 
           the floor pulled up. The coke, cash and fishing bag. 

           #2 signals for #1 to quietly check the rooms. #1 peeks into 
           the empty rooms.

           #2 looks up at the skylight. The hatch is open. Gestures for 
           #1 to go back up the stairs. #1 nods, obliges.

           #2 spots something blinking on the coke and cash. An 
           electronic device. Moves closer. Curious... 

           UPPER DECK

           #1 scans as he walks toward the bow, sees no one. But we do:

           Roger and James hang onto a ridge over the edge of the yacht. 
           James hangs on with one hand, a .45 in the other. 

           They hear the footsteps.

           James is ready to shoot. Roger stringently shakes his head, 
           nods toward the water: We gotta jump.

           James smirks, fuck you, I’m shooting. 

           Roger pulls his P99 on James, fuck you, we’re dropping! 

           Both hanging from the edge one-handed with their guns out. 

           #1 stops at railing blocking him. He would have to duck under 
           the railing to look over the edge at:

           Roger and James, waiting, hearts pounding, arms weakening. 

           #1 looks out at the lake. If he looks down he’ll see 
           discolored hands hanging on for dear life. He never does, 
           turns and walks back the way he came.

           Roger gives James a look. James gives him a look back. Their 
           arms shake. Roger lets go, dropping into the cold water. 
           James reluctantly does the same.

           #1 stops. Turns back. A splash?... Nah. He keeps moving.
           BELOW DECK

           #2 closely inspects the electronic device. Max’s iPhone, 
           practically gift-wrapped on top of the coke and cash. He 
           picks it up as #1 comes down the stairs, joins him. 

                                 #2 COP
                        I think we just caught a big fish.

           On the phone, we see the addresses for Philips’ stash houses 
           in Orland Park, tagged on Google Maps.

           INT. JAMES’S MUSTANG - DAY

           James drives through downtown Chicago. Roger rides shotgun. 
           Both are drenched. Roger cleans his P99, James fishes a soggy 
           Newport from a wet pack.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger considered telling James why he 
                        had to kill Philips. He’d tell James 
                        that it was all for him. That Tracie, 
                        DJ and the one on the way died so he 
                        could have a chance to live. But Roger 
                        knew that was a lie. He did not do it 
                        for James. He did it for himself, for 
                        his own conscience. And he would have 
                        to live with that.

                                 ROGER
                        Pull over here.

           James parks on a busy street outside of Roger’s apartment 
           building. Roger tucks away his P99. James looks out at the 
           building small complex.

                                 JAMES
                        That your building?

           James spies the apartment window with dark curtains.

                                 ROGER
                          (ignoring the question)
                        I never thanked you, James. 

                                 JAMES
                        For what?

           Roger motions toward James’ prosthetic foot.

                                 JAMES
                        My foot?... Shit, you think...? 
                          (then)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        Roger, I slipped trying to get myself 
                        out of trouble. 

           James tries to light a soggy Newport. It won’t catch.

                                 JAMES
                        You were just in the fucking way.

           Roger takes a look at James and the realization that he saved 
           James’ life for nothing hits him. He exits the car. 

                                 JAMES
                        Hey...
                          (Roger looks back)
                        Good luck to you.

           Roger just walks away. James takes off in the mustang.

           EXT. MILLENNIUM PARK - BP BRIDGE - DAY

           James and Brock lean on the stainless steel panels, people 
           watching as they talk. Brock sips from a bottle of OJ.

                                 BROCK
                        ...You were with him all day? How’d
                        that happen?

                                 JAMES
                        He showed up at the house after the 
                        thing at the Bakery last night. I 
                        thought he came to kill me. 

                                 BROCK
                        Why did he come?

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t know. Guess he had no where 
                        else to go, his family dead and all.

           James lights a dry cigarette.

                                 BROCK
                        So what you’re telling me is you 
                        coulda dealt with him.

                                 JAMES
                        I made the call to my Philips connect. 
                        They’re sending a guy over to Roger 
                        now. He’s as good as dealt with.

                                 BROCK
                        How much you wanna bet?
                                 JAMES
                        You know somethin I don’t?

                                 BROCK
                        Roger didn’t touch the money on the 
                        boat, right?

                                 JAMES
                        Still can’t believe it.

                                 BROCK
                        And he left a phone for the cops...

           James notices the admiration in Brock’s eyes.

                                 JAMES
                        ...What is it?

                                 BROCK
                        They picked up Philips an hour ago, 
                        James. All his shit was on that phone. 
                        That, plus the coke and the cash, 
                        enough to put him away for good.

           EXT. MEN’S CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT

           Roger, in dry clothes, stares pensively at a mannequin posed 
           in Hugo Boss in a storefront window. 

                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        Why would Roger want Philips in jail?

                                 BROCK (V.O.)
                        You don’t stay in jail. Not when you 
                        have money and lawyers like Philips. 

           Roger walks into the store.

           EXT. DIRTY ALLEY - NIGHT

           The gray car pulls into a dirty back alley, parks.

                                 BROCK (V.O.)
                        He’ll have his bond hearing today and 
                        be out by tonight.

           EXT. HIGH RISE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY

           Roger looks over the edge of the rooftop at the William J. 
           Campbell courthouse, about 3 football fields away.
                                 JAMES (V.O.)
                        ...And Roger’ll be waitin.

           Roger opens a rifle case at his feet. Inside, his M21 sniper 
           rifle is disassembled. He puts it together.

           BACK TO: EXT. MILLENNIUM PARK - BP BRIDGE - DAY

                                 BROCK
                        Now you’re gettin it.

                                 JAMES
                        What’s that got to do with us?

                                 BROCK
                        Nothin. I was just taking a moment to 
                        appreciate the move Roger made.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, he’s a genius. 
                          (then)
                        So where’s my money?

                                 BROCK
                        We’re gonna celebrate tomorrow at the 
                        Ritz. That work for you?

                                 JAMES
                        No, that don’t work for me. You gonna
                        protect me till then?

                                 BROCK
                        Protect you?... James, having you dead 
                        would be in my best interest.

                                 JAMES
                        Fuck you, Brock. That’s not funny.

                                 BROCK
                        Look, this shit takes time. You ever 
                        transfer two million dollars to an off 
                        shore account then try to turn it into 
                        cash in the States before? It’s not 
                        easy. Tomorrow at noon. The room will 
                        be under the name Janis Joplin.

           James gives Brock a hard look.

                                 JAMES
                        I swear to god, you orange juice 
                        drinkin prick, don’t try to dick me.
                                 BROCK
                        Come on, James. It’s a little late in 
                        the game not to trust each other.
                          (then)
                        Try to stay alive till tomorrow, huh?

           Brock, drinking his OJ, walks away from James. James scans 
           his surroundings, a little paranoid. He walks away in the 
           opposite direction with his head down.

           INT. ROGER’S UPTOWN APARTMENT - DAY

           WHAM! The door is kicked open by ABNER, a big, James 
           Gandolfini looking motherfucker holding an Uzi. 

           Abner searches the closets and the bathroom, then back to the 
           living room to think, Roger nowhere to be found. 

           He spots the phone, picks it up, hits REDIAL... As it rings, 
           he notices a notepad. 

           He raises the pad to the light. In the light, he can see the 
           embossment of the words: 5:00, William J. Campbell. 

           A female voice picks up his call.

                                 SERVICE DESK (FILTERED)
                        William J. Campbell courthouse.

           Abner hangs up- 

                                 ABNER
                        Shit.

           -Quickly pulls out his cell phone and dials...

           EXT. WILLIAM J. CAMPBELL COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A throng of cameramen and reporters back out the door. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger remembered the look on his face 
                        when he heard about the Beltway 
                        Snipers, John Allen Mohammad and the 
                        other one. Like most people, he was 
                        surprised to learn they were black.

           POV RIFLE SCOPE - CONTINUOUS

           A cross hair watches three bodyguards try to keep the media 
           away from Philips as he’s wheeled out of the courthouse.
                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger thought that if he were black, 
                        the element of surprise would give him 
                        a great advantage in doing his job.

           INT. ROGER’S UPTOWN APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Abner tensely holds the ringing phone to his ear.

                                 NARRATOR
                        He could walk right up to an arrogant 
                        delinquent who would certainly dismiss 
                        him, and shoot him in the head.

                                 ABNER
                        Come on. Pick up!

           EXT. COURTHOUSE 

           A GRUFF guard, one of the three guarding Philips, takes his 
           ringing phone from a pocket, looks at it...

                                 NARRATOR
                        It was the rare scenario where no one 
                        would suspect the black guy.

           INT. ROGER’S UPTOWN APARTMENT

           Abner holds the ringing phone. A gruff voice answers.

                                 GRUFF GUARD (FILTERED)
                        Yeah?

                                 ABNER
                        He’s there! The shooter is there!

           EXT. COURTHOUSE

           Gruff, head on a swivel, looks up and RIGHT AT ROGER, on the 
           roof three hundred yards away, aiming the M21 sniper rifle. 

                                 GRUFF GUARD
                        GET HIM TO THE CAR!

           Gruff whips out an automatic rifle and RAT-TAT-TAT at Roger, 
           like a starting gun, sets off a race of panic. 

           Reporters and cameramen SCREAM and SCATTER. The other guards 
           cover Philips like secret service covering a president, 
           quickly move him down the stairs toward a waiting black SUV. 
           Police try to keep order, tackling and cuffing Gruff. He 
           fights it.

                                 GRUFF GUARD
                        The roof! There’s a shooter on the 
                        roof!

           The two guards hurriedly dump Philips into the black SUV, hop 
           in the back with him and the SUV burns rubber.

           INT. BLACK SUV - CONTINUOUS

           The NERVOUS CHAUFFEUR clocks sixty in a thirty five. Philips 
           sits between the two guards in the backseat.

                                 BODYGUARD 1
                        You okay, Mr. Philips?

           Philips just holds a scowl.

           STEEL-TOE BOOTS STOMP STEEL STAIRS 

           A SWAT TEAM races up the stairs, to the top and break through 
           a door at-

           EXT. HIGH RISE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Weapons drawn, yelling “Drop your weapon,” SWAT converges on 
           Roger holding the rifle at the edge of the roof. 

           When they get closer, they lower their weapons, realizing 
           it’s a mannequin wearing Hugo Boss and holding the M21. 

           Dumbfounded, they shrug at each other.

           INT. BLACK SUV - NIGHT

           Philips dials a number on his phone when- 

           Pft! Pft!

           The two guards flanking him slump over, shot in the back of 
           the head. 

           The chauffeur’s eyes grow, looking in the rearview mirror. 
           Roger, in the cargo section of the SUV, presses his P99 on 
           Philips’ head.

                                 ROGER
                        Look at me.
                                 PHILIPS
                        Fuck.

           Philips slowly turns his head. Roger puts his finger on the 
           trigger, ready to squeeze, then the chauffeur DIVES out of 
           the moving SUV. It squeals and veers into oncoming traffic.

           Roger and Philips can only watch through the windshield as

           EXT. BLACK SUV/INTERSECTION - NIGHT

           The SUV is about to make out with a MASSIVE GARBAGE TRUCK. 
           The truck lays on its horn.

           CRASH! 

           Sparks fly. The garbage truck sends the SUV twirling sideways 
           in the air. 

           The SUV lands on its side, SCREECHING like nails on a 
           chalkboard as metal scrapes asphalt, sliding down the street. 

           It stops as it knocks over a fire hydrant, then- 

           SWOOSH! The hydrant shoots up water like Old Faithful, 
           blasting into an through the SUV. 

           INT. BLACK SUV - CONTINUOUS

           The strong water quickly fills the SUV. Roger, drenched, sees 
           that Philips is knocked out. He tries to climb out the back. 

           Pause. A tire iron is IMPALED IN HIS LEG. 

           Though great pain and mighty force, Roger, accompanied by a 
           echoing yell, jimmies the iron out of his leg, opening up a 
           hell of a wound and leaving a bloody mess.

           EXT. BLACK SUV/STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Roger climbs out the back door and collapses. One good leg 
           not enough to keep him up. And then, SIRENS. Coming his way.

           No time for pain, Roger crawls to his feet and hops away.

           EXT. DIRTY ALLEY - LATER

           Roger, dragging his busted leg, ducks into the alley just as 
           flashing lights speed by, shaking, out of breath.
           He catches his wind against a dumpster. His leg is on fire. 

           Panting and anxious, he reaches into a pocket, comes out with 
           two Xanax pills, fumbles them to the dirty ground. 

           He searches the ground, like a fiend desperate for a hit. A 
           rat scurries by, startling him. 

           Roger finds the pills, dry swallows those dirty bastards, 
           then, after a moment calms down... staring, getting his air. 

           He looks it his leg wound. It’s ugly. The frustration on his 
           face is undeniable. He punches the dumpster. 

           He stares at GRAFFITI on a wall. Indecipherable at first.

           Sirens wail. Not too close. 

           Roger continues to stare at the graffiti until he makes it 
           out. Within the wild scribble on the brick wall, a symbol. 
           Familiar. The CHI RHO. Under which it says: God Is Watching. 

           Roger is pensive, an idea coming to him. The sirens are 
           closer. He stands, runs/hops to his plain gray sedan at the 
           other end of the alley. 

           INT. BROCK’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A posh, modern kitchen. Brock neatly puts his million dollars 
           in a garbage bag as he speaks into his phone. His old bulldog 
           eats from a dish.

                                 BROCK
                        Run it again.

           INTERCUT: INT. VALENTINA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Valentina, slipping into a silky nighty, talks on the phone, 
           pops chewing gum.

                                 VALENTINA
                        We got a call from our C.I. James 
                        Rayne to meet him at the Ritz hotel 
                        about a case. 

                                 BROCK
                        What case?

                                 VALENTINA
                        He said he could connect Bobby Philips 
                        to that thing that happened at Sweets. 
                                 VALENTINA (CONT'D)
                        So anyway, we go in, he’s jittery, not 
                        really talking, and it must have 
                        slipped his mind that he had a bag of 
                        cocaine on the table. 
                          (then)
                        You do have the coke, right?

                                 BROCK
                        I got it. Keep goin.

                                 VALENTINA
                        We ask him what it is, he goes 
                        bonkers, pulls out his jammy, but he 
                        was slow and we shot first.

                                 BROCK
                        Who shot first?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Me. He pulled on you, I didn’t have a 
                        choice.

                                 BROCK
                        Run it just like that, you’ll get your 
                        face in the paper and retire a hero.

                                 VALENTINA
                        You should meet me at church in the 
                        morning. It would be good for you.

                                 BROCK
                        Church on a Wednesday morning. Jesus.

                                 VALENTINA
                        People go to the gym before work to 
                        get their bodies right, why not start 
                        your day at church to get your soul 
                        right? 

                                 BROCK
                        You realize you’re going to kill a guy 
                        later that day.

                                 VALENTINA
                        I didn’t say I was the best Christian, 
                        detective. But I’m trying.

                                 BROCK
                        How’s it feel being a millionaire?

                                 VALENTINA
                        Truth?... 

           She squirms, trying to break in the stiff mattress. 
                                 VALENTINA
                        A little uncomfortable.

           A church bell tolls and we HARD CUT TO:

                                     FORGIVEN

           EXT. GOOD SHEPHERD CHURCH - MORNING

           The CHI RHO symbol is painted on a bell tower.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger had not been inside of a church 
                        since 1987. His father was not a 
                        believer so as a child, Roger would 
                        sneak off to a Lutheran service to 
                        hear the minister preach. He enjoyed 
                        theology and had planned to talk to 
                        Tracie about joining a congregation in 
                        Paris.

           PAN DOWN: A few men and women, enter. Valentina, casually 
           dressed, walks toward the church from across the street. 

                                 PASTOR (O.S.)
                        "Blessed is the man that walketh not 
                        in the counsel of the ungodly, nor 
                        standeth in the way of sinners..."

           INT. GRAY CAR - DAY

           Roger, in the gray car from the prologue, wearing dark 
           shades, watches Valentina park her Ford Focus in the church 
           parking lot, exit and head toward the church.

           INT. GOOD SHEPHERD CHURCH - DAY

           The pastor stands at the pulpit, reading from his bible.

                                 PASTOR
                        "...The LORD knoweth the way of the 
                        righteous-

           Valentina, sitting on a middle pew, follows along in her 
           bible. 

                                 PASTOR
                        But the way of the ungodly shall 
                        perish.”
                                 ROGER (O.S.)
                        -The way of the ungodly shall perish.

           Valentina freezes, recognizing that voice. She looks over her 
           shoulder to see Roger sitting behind her, then faces forward 
           with a “I can’t believe this” smirk. Roger whispers: 

                                 ROGER
                        There’s only two churches in Chicago 
                        with the Chi-Rho. I prayed that I 
                        picked the right one.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Having a prayer answered is a sign 
                        that you have been forgiven.

           Roger’s face turns hard.

                                 ROGER
                        ...You haven’t.

                                 PASTOR
                        Now, let us pray with our hearts that 
                        our souls remain righteous.

           The few scattered heads bow throughout the church. Roger and 
           Valentina keep their heads up. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        I was just a messenger.

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t care. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        There’s gotta be something we can work 
                        out. Let’s go to Lou’s, get some 
                        coffee and donuts and talk about it. 

           Roger considers...

                                 VALENTINA
                        I’ll tell you everything I know.

                                 ROGER
                        Ladies first.

           Valentina slides by Ian then hustles down the aisle. 

           Roger tries to slide by the bowed heads of the homeless lady, 
           then the fat couple blocking his way, trying to keep an eye 
           on Valentina who disappears out the sanctuary doors. 
           He finally makes it past, fast-limps down the aisle on his 
           bum leg. Ian watches him, curious.

           EXT. GOOD SHEPHERD CHURCH - PARKING LOT - DAY

           A few scattered cars in the lot. Valentina, already at the 
           far end of the lot, ducks behind a truck and pulls a handgun. 

           She peeks up and from her POV, sees: 

           Roger, way at the other end of the lot, holding his P99, his 
           head on a swivel. He stops when he sees Valentina aiming her 
           gun at him. He quickly ducks behind a car.

           VALENTINA crawls to a better angle, using cars as cover.

           ROGER 

           crawls closer to where Valentina was. 

           HIGH ANGLE shows the cat and mouse as the two circle each 
           other in the labyrinth of cars and empty spaces. 

           VALENTINA 

           squats on the side of a car and listens. She adjusts the side 
           mirror and sees Roger in the distance, moving closer. 

           She takes a breath, stands, whirls and BANG-BANG-BANG! 

           The bullets shatter the windows of a car, setting off a high-
           pitched alarm. Roger is nowhere in sight. 

           VALENTINA

           turns to run but BOOM! Crashes right into a forearm, a brutal  *
           clothesline, crushing her windpipe.

           She falls hard on her back, gasping, barely able to breathe. 
           Roger stands over her, his P99 inches from her nose. 

                                 VALENTINA
                        I’m... I’m a *GASP*.

           Between the blaring car alarm and her crushed windpipe, Roger  *
           can’t understand a word she’s saying.

                                 VALENTINA
                        Ka’op!... Kahh-puh!

           Roger cocks a brow, thinks she’s trying to say “cop”. 

           A reviving car engine draws near.
           Roger looks up and away as a church security van with 
           flashing yellow lights on its roof speeds his way. 

           He looks back down. Valentina is gone. Shit! After a cursory 
           look around, Roger ducks away just as the van passes. 

           INT. GRAY CAR - DAY

           Roger, wearing his dark shades, patiently watches the church 
           parking lot. 

           In the lot, Valentina creeps to her Ford Focus, hops in and 
           drives by the gray car. 

           Roger puts the car in gear and follows.

           INT. RITZ HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

           Roger steps in. He covertly watches Valentina get on an 
           elevator across the lobby. The numbers above the elevator 
           door light up, stopping on the 30th floor.

           Roger limps to the elevator.

           INT. RITZ HOTEL - ELEVATOR

           Roger presses the button for the 30th floor. It doesn’t 
           register. He needs a key card. He steps off the elevator.

                                 ROGER
                        Excuse me, sir.

           A concierge looks curiously at Roger. 

           INT. RITZ HOTEL - HALLWAY/ELEVATOR - DAY

           The numbers above the elevator light up. 29 then 30. 

           DING. The doors open. Roger drags the unconscious concierge 
           off the elevator and into a door labeled VENDING. 

           He steps out with the concierge’s key card, slides it into 
           the suite door, pulls his P99 and bursts in.

           INT. RITZ HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           A male dead body and a closed briefcase by the couch AND a 
           female dead body by the bathroom door. The bodies face down.
           Roger steps toward the couch. 

           As the door closes behind him, a figure with a sharp, bloody 
           knife in its hand is revealed behind the door.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger deduced that the guy was quietly 
                        killed by the couch while the girl 
                        used the bathroom. And, he imagined, 
                        the girl was murdered in a similar 
                        fashion when she came out. 

           Roger bends down to the first dead body. It’s Brock, still 
           bleeding from a slit across the throat but long dead. He 
           checks Brock’s wallet, looks at his shield. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        He believed that he would have made a 
                        good detective.

           Roger moves over to the next body: Valentina, throat slit, in 
           a pool of blood. He checks her badge: Det. Maria Valentina. 

           Roger squints, putting it together. A shadow falls over him.

           Roger spins and CLANG! He’s hit in the head with a lamp base. 
           CLANG! He’s hit again, falls on his face, knocked out. 

           James tosses the lamp aside and focuses on the briefcase. 

           He pops the case open and his face twists into confusion... 

           A lonely bag of cocaine is inside the case. 

           Now James smirks, getting that he was being set up.

                                 JAMES
                        Shoulda known. I shoulda...

           He angrily kicks Brock’s corpse, ad-libbing insults until 
           he’s out of breath. 

           He composes himself, lights a cigarette, dials a number on 
           his cell phone, speaks into it.

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, listen, I got the guy Philips is 
                        looking for... No shit, this time, I 
                        got him right here. But if he wants to 
                        know where “right here” is, he has to 
                        handle a little New York thing for me.

           James looks at Roger, shrugs, puffs his cigarette.
                                 JAMES
                        What the fuck can I say?

           Roger stirs angrily, trying to wake. James kicks him in the 
           head, knocking him out again. 

           The watch on Roger’s wrist counts down from three seconds 
           then beeps and flashes 0:00:00.

                                                         FADE OUT:

           The sound of a car starting.

                                SOME KIND OF ASSHOLE

           INT. ABNER’S CAR - TRUNK - DAY

           Roger wakes up in the dimly lit trunk, sunlight sneaking in 
           through cracks. He bounces as the car hits bumps. His eyes 
           searching for a way out that never comes.

           INT. ABNER’S CAR - DAY 

           Abner, wearing aviator glasses and a bomber jacket, drives. 
           He pulls over on a narrow two-way highway in a wooded area in 
           the middle of no man’s land.

           EXT. ABNER’S CAR - DAY

           Abner pops the trunk. Roger is tied up and gagged inside. 

           INT. WOODS - LATER 

           Abner aims his Uzi at Roger as they trek through the woods. 
           Roger bleeds from the head and limps on his broken leg.

           Footsteps approach from the opposite direction. David Philips 
           pushing his father in a wheelchair.

           They meet in a CLEARING dotted by fallen leaves and walled in 
           by trees. Other bad men are probably buried here.

           Philips stands from the wheelchair, punches Roger in the 
           face. Roger stands strong, spitting blood.

                                 PHILIPS
                          (to Abner)
                        Give David your gun.
                                 ABNER
                        This one was on him. Try it out.

           Abner offers Roger’s P99 to David. David takes the gun. 

           Philips smacks Roger several times until he falls to his 
           knees. Roger doesn’t fight back. 

                                 PHILIPS
                        There. Shoot him. 

           David grips the P99, aims it at Roger’s head. Roger looks up 
           at David, stoic. David hesitates. This is his first time.

                                 PHILIPS
                        Kill him, son. 

           Roger reads David. He’s shaky, eyes watery. 

                                 PHILIPS
                        Put a hole in that bastard’s face.

           David starts to lower the gun. 

                                 DAVID
                        No.

           Roger, like lightning, snatches the P99 and swings it at 
           Abner, pfft-pfft, two in the head. Rat-tat-tat-tat, Abner 
           lets off wild Uzi rounds as he falls dead. 

           Birds take flight from naked tree branches, scared off by the 
           echoing gunshot sounds. The woods are suddenly eerily quiet.

           Philips is slumped in his wheelchair drenched in blood, holes 
           in his body from Uzi bullets, no longer breathing. 

           David is on the ground, twitching, shot in the chest, 
           gasping. His eyes show a familiar melancholy. The same look 
           he had when Roger shot him on his wedding night.

           Roger stands from a prone position. He watches David squirm, 
           limps over to him, cocking his P99, ready to kill. 

                                 DAVID
                        I... I... I’m not like my... I’m not--

           Roger looks in David’s eyes as David fades.

                                 ROGER
                        You’re not like your father.

           David manages to nod. Roger lowers the P99...
                                 ROGER
                        I’m sorry you died because of him. I’m 
                        sure he would have rather died for 
                        you.

           ...and walks away, leaving David to die.

           INT. VALENTINA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Smiling pictures of Valentina. Some in police uniform. The 
           door is kicked open. James hurries in, starts to tear the 
           place up, looking for the money. 

           BEDROOM 

           James rummages through the dresser drawers, throws the covers 
           off the bed, tosses clothes from the closet.

           BATHROOM

           Checks cabinets, the toilet, bathtub. Frustration growing...

           KITCHEN

           Every cabinet door open, the fridge, microwave, stove. 
           There’s nothing here. James kicks a can of beans.

           LIVING ROOM

           Looks like a tornado hit it. James sticks his hand up the 
           fireplace, then his head, coming out with nothing but ash. 

           BEDROOM

           James looks at the destroyed room and gives up, taking a seat 
           on the bed. It doesn’t bounce like it should. He tries again. 
           No give. He stands, looks down at the mattress and snickers.

           He cuts the mattress with a knife revealing a million plus 
           dollars stacked neatly inside.

           INT. BROCK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           James jimmies the door open and steps inside. The place is 
           spotless with expensive luxuries. Brock’s old bulldog 
           scurries to James. James pets it.

           KITCHEN

           James takes a beer from the fridge, cracks it open and eyes 
           the kitchen as he drinks, getting ready to search. The 
           bulldog is at his feet.
                                 JAMES
                        So, where’s my money, Fido?

           James notices a box of hefty bags on the table.

           He looks in the garbage can, seeing nothing but trash. He 
           tips the garbage can over. The trash spills out revealing the 
           cash bag on the bottom.

           James grins like he’s smarter than everyone else.

           EXT. JAMES’S MUSTANG - NIGHT

           Parked down the block from Juliet’s. James, burning a 
           cigarette, watches the pool hall, making sure it’s clear. 

           He exits the car with two bags, carefully makes his way 
           toward Juliet’s.

           INT. JULIET’S POOL HALL - NIGHT

           James hurries in with two bags of cash. It’s dark. He flips 
           on a light to see Roger sitting at the bar, sipping dark 
           liquor, holding his P99. 

                                 ROGER
                        Some advice: If the people looking for 
                        you know where you’ve been, don’t go 
                        back.

           James, stunned, sets the bags of cash down, leans on the edge 
           of a pool table.

                                 ROGER
                        Why?

                                 JAMES
                        This New York thing. It’s--

                                 ROGER
                        No. Why me? WHY! ME?!

                                 JAMES
                        ...It wasn’t personal, Roger. You just 
                        had something I needed.

           Roger raises his P99. James yells.

                                 JAMES
                        I could have killed you! Anytime! I 
                        could have! Those cops wanted you 
                        dead. I just wanted you to go away.
                                 ROGER
                        That’s the difference between you and 
                        me.

                                 JAMES
                        What do you want? Huh? Your money? 
                        Alright, okay, it’s right here. But I 
                        need to borrow like five hundred 
                        thousand. 

                                 ROGER
                        ...You’re serious?

                                 JAMES
                        Damn straight. I’ll pay you back.

           The door opens. Benjamin enters the pool hall holding a 
           rolled up newspaper, as poised as ever in the doorway. James 
           turns, squints at him. 

                                 JAMES
                        The fuck do you want?

           Roger’s eyes ask the same, but he keeps his gun on James.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Time’s up. 

                                 ROGER
                        Philips is dead. That was the deal.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        You wouldn’t lie to me, would you?

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t care enough to lie to you, but 
                        you can drive out to Forrest Park and 
                        see for yourself.

                                 JAMES
                        You killed Philips? Shit, that means-

           Brooklyn and the El-Amin Brothers walk in. James swallows 
           hard, trapped. 

                                 JAMES
                        I got the money right here, Brooklyn. 
                        Plus some vig for being late. 

           Brooklyn starts to take the bags of money from James’s grip, 
           but Roger swings his gun on him. 

                                 ROGER
                        Slow up, Brooklyn.
           Brooklyn freezes as his brothers whip out guns and show the 
           barrels to Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        That money doesn’t belong to you or 
                        James.

           Brooklyn turns his gaze from Roger, sneers at James with 
           contempt, disrespect. 

                                 BROOKLYN
                        Are you shittin me?

           James sort of shrugs, “what can I say?”

                                 BROOKLYN
                        Jesus. You are some kind of asshole. 

           James, resigned to defeat, tries to grin, lights a Newport. 
           His hands shaking like it’s having a seizure.

                                 JAMES
                        Fuck it... I had a good run.

           Brooklyn considers the bags of money, then looks at Roger who 
           is still holding the gun on him.

                                 BROOKLYN
                        Take your money and go.

           Roger limps up to James and takes his car keys from him... 

                                 JAMES
                        Be cool to my car, Roger.

           Roger grabs the money bags from Brooklyn then nonchalantly 
           approaches Benjamin and JABS him in the nose, hard enough to 
           break it. Benjamin drops his newspaper and holds his nose. He  *
           was hiding a gun under the paper.

                                 ROGER
                        We square?

           Benjamin, wiping his bloody nose, nods. Roger starts to head 
           out, but notices the newspaper on the floor. The bottom fold 
           has a picture of Beth Sweets, burned to a skeleton. 

           EXT. JULIET’S POOL HALL/MUSTANG - NIGHT

           Roger leans on the Mustang and unfolds the newspaper under a 
           flickering streetlight. He squints to read the top fold. 
                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger killed people for a living.

           Roger gapes, swallows his heart. He drops the newspaper, hops  *
           in the Mustang and burns rubber as he peels out.

           On the ground, the headline: THREE SURVIVE BAKERY EXPLOSION

           A picture of the victims: smiling mother Debra Jenkins and 
           her teenaged son Oliver on the front page (the mother and son  *
           Tracie saw enter Sweets.) Also, a picture of Beth.

                                 NARRATOR
                        He believed that somewhere in the 
                        Paris, Tracie, her son DJ and the one 
                        on the way were waiting for him.

                                       PARIS

           EXT. PARIS, FRANCE - THE EIFEL TOWER - DAY

           A petite woman and her chubby son stare at the tower amid 
           wide-eyed tourists, their backs to us.

                                 NARRATOR
                        Roger searched until he found them.

           Roger steps up behind the woman and her son. 

                                 ROGER
                        Hey...

           Tracie turns and sees Roger. She’s stunned. Her eyes red and 
           her nose running from a recent cry. DJ stands with her. 

                                 TRACIE
                        ...Roger?

           Roger looks her in the eyes, ready to confess one last thing.

                                 ROGER
                        My name is not Roger. 

           Tracie blinks at him, then slowly grins. She understands. 

           Roger gently touches her belly, kisses it, then kisses and 
           hugs her. 

                                 NARRATOR
                        And then, Roger was done.

                                                           THE END
