          May 18, 2011
           FADE IN:

           INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - STINSON BEACH - DAY

           TIM FORRESTER, handsome, if slightly drained, stands 
           amongst the old furniture, dishes, knick-knacks and doo-
           dads that vie for space in the dusty, cramped store. He 
           has a BASEBALL HAT pulled low on his head. 

           The CLERK, a middle-aged hippie, with MUTTON-CHOPS, 
           stands behind the counter, occasionally glancing up...

           ...as Tim calmly stares at SOMETHING UNSEEN on one of the 
           shelves. 

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        There are times a man finds 
                        himself wondering - “What am I 
                        doing? Is this really what my 
                        life's become?”

           REVERSE ANGLE and we finally see what Tim is staring at - 
           a ceramic FLAMINGO. Twelve inches high, painted a tacky 
           bright PINK, the bird’s wings are raised up, as if ready 
           to take off from a patch of green ceramic grass.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        These are difficult questions. 
                        (beat) By the way, “flamingo” 
                        comes from the Latin word for 
                        flame.

           With that, Tim GRABS the flamingo and RUNS for the exit.

                                 CLERK
                        HEY!!

                                                             SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ANTIQUE SHOP - STINSON BEACH - SECONDS LATER

           Tim bursts from the store, the flamingo clutched in his 
           hand, while the Clerk follows in close and angry pursuit.

                                 CLERK
                        Stop! Stop! Get back here you son 
                        of a bitch!

           But, Tim continues his sprint for freedom, raising the 
           stolen flamingo aloft, a broad adrenalized SMILE crossing 
           his face... 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        WOOOHOOO!!

           FREEZE ON this image, as we INSERT a superimposed title 
           card - THE FLAMINGO THIEF. Then, we MOVE TO...

           INT. WILLIAMS-SONOMA STORE - NIGHT

           FOUR MONTHS EARLIER

           Wearing a dark suit and tie, Tim and his pretty wife 
           STELLA stroll the aisles of the ubiquitous kitchenware 
           store. This one happens to be located in THE VILLAGE AT 
           CORTE MADERA, Marin County’s favorite outdoor mall. It’s 
           a post-work evening of shopping and dinner.

           As Stella absentmindedly looks at some COPPER PANS...

                                 TIM
                                 (business-like)
                        So, I told the client, these are 
                        depositions and depositions take 
                        time, there’s a process here. 
                        We’ll file a motion--

                                 STELLA
                        Tim, I want a divorce.

           Tim pauses, trying to shift gears from the intricacies of 
           corporate litigation to what his wife has just told him.

                                 TIM
                        What?

           Stella is calm, but not emotionless. She’s knows the 
           impact of what she’s saying...

                                 STELLA
                        I want a divorce. (beat) I was 
                        going to talk to you when we got 
                        home, but, then... here we are 
                        shopping for a new espresso 
                        machine, I’m pretending to look at 
                        paella pans, and the thought of a 
                        restaurant and holding it in 
                        through dinner... it was just 
                        weighing on me too heavily.

                                 TIM
                        I’m sorry.

                                 STELLA
                        You’re sorry?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        That it was weighing on you.

           Stella doesn’t know how to respond - it’s so Tim, to 
           apologize when he’s the one getting left. 

                                 STELLA
                                 (back on track)
                        I’ve been unhappy for a long time, 
                        Tim. Confused, lonely... I didn’t 
                        even know how sad I was until I 
                        met Derek.

                                 TIM
                        Derek?

           Head spinning, Tim glances at the other shoppers browsing 
           nearby, oblivious to the drama just a few feet away.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Who’s Derek?

                                 STELLA
                                 (delicately)
                        Derek Trotter. He’s a realtor. I 
                        met him at the tennis club.

           It’s all coming at him so quickly...

                                 TIM
                        Wait... you play tennis?

                                 STELLA
                        No. I was meeting a friend for 
                        lunch. She plays tennis... that’s 
                        not the point. (beat) I’m going to 
                        move in with Derek.

           Just then energetic SALESWOMAN approaches with a boxed 
           ESPRESSO MACHINE...

                                 SALESWOMAN
                        There you are. Bad news, we’re out 
                        of the Nespresso Citiz with 
                        automatic milk frother. I can 
                        order it for you, or I do have the 
                        Essenza C100. No milk frother, 
                        but...

           The Saleswoman trails off, noticing the expressions on 
           the faces of Tim and Stella. Stella is clearly 
           uncomfortable, Tim dazed and disoriented...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TIM
                                 (confused)
                        You know, I’m... not sure. (beat, 
                        to Stella) Should we order? 

           Stella just looks at him in disbelief. Really?

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (to the Saleswoman)
                        Actually, can we get back to you 
                        on that? 

                                 SALESWOMAN
                                 (cautiously)
                        Sure, I’ll just... put this behind 
                        the counter. It’ll be there if you 
                        need it.

           As the Saleswoman backs away, we see Tim’s hollow 
           expression, the color draining from his face, and hear...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I’ve loved Stella since the first 
                        day we met.

           EXT. UC BERKELEY CAMPUS - 18 YEARS AGO - DAY

           Through the soft-focussed, sun-dappled lens of MEMORY, we 
           see college-aged Tim sitting on edge of the SPROUL PLAZA 
           fountain, studying. 

           He looks up, as the lovely, college-aged Stella sits down 
           with a book bag and a copy of the school paper. Their 
           eyes meet...

                                 TIM
                        Hi.

                                 STELLA
                        Hi.

           Just those TWO WORDS, then Tim goes back to his studying 
           and Stella opens her paper. A moment later, his gaze 
           returns to Stella. Tim catches her eye and smiles warmly. 
           She smiles back and it’s a moment of undeniable 
           connection, then WE HEAR...

                                 STELLA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be moving my things out over 
                        the next few weeks.

           Which brings us back to...
           INT. WILLIAMS-SONOMA STORE - NIGHT

           PRESENT DAY. The Saleswoman has gone. Tim and Stella 
           stand where we’d left them, as Stella continues...

                                 STELLA
                        I’ll do it when you’re not there, 
                        I don’t want to make this any more 
                        awkward than it has to be.

                                 TIM
                        Right, that makes sense...

           Tim studies his wife for a silent beat, then...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Now, there are many ways a man can 
                        react in a situation like this...

           Tim suddenly grabs a tray of glassware and THROWS it 
           against a wall. The glass EXPLODES on impact.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Where is Derek Trotter?! He’s a 
                        fucking dead man!
                                 (beat, to customers)
                        What the hell are you looking at?! 
                        A man’s wife leaves him, he can’t 
                        get upset?!

           Then we’re back to normal. No shattered glass, no stunned 
           customers. Tim is still looking at Stella... 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You can’t do this, Stella. Please, 
                        I’m begging you. I don’t know what 
                        I’ll do. I’ll... I’ll... 

           Suddenly, Tim grabs a KNIFE from the cutlery shelf and 
           slashes it across his wrist, blood SPLATTERING, as 
           customers SCREAM.

           Then we’re back to normal - Tim just standing there, like 
           a man lost at sea in an engine-less boat, storm waves 
           washing over him. 

                                 STELLA
                                 (burdened)
                        I’m sorry, Tim. I don’t know how 
                        else to do this. There’s no easy 
                        way...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Stella continues talking, but the sound of her voice 
           fades away, as Tim just blankly stares forward...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        It was obvious to me I didn’t have 
                        the luxury of responding 
                        irrationally. With Stella clearly 
                        not thinking straight, I vowed not 
                        to do anything I’d regret and to 
                        remain calm and clear-headed for 
                        the both of us.

           As Stella continues talking, even though we can’t hear 
           her words, it’s clear she couldn’t be more rational or 
           clear of thought...

           The BUZZ of an alarm clock takes us to...

           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           The BUZZING alarm clock reads 5:30, but Tim’s eyes are 
           already open, staring at the empty half of the bed - 
           Stella’s half, which has clearly not been slept in. Tim’s 
           blank expression does not change as he climbs from bed 
           and turns off the alarm.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And so, I kept to the normal 
                        routine...

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN

           A quiet neighborhood in Mill Valley, filled with good-
           looking homes inhabited by successful professionals. 
           Coated in sweat, Tim jogs the streets, just as he does 
           every morning...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And went about my daily 
                        schedule...

           IN A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS--

           We see Tim...

           - Showering.

           - Putting on a dark suit and tie.

           - Eating a bowl of cereal, watching the morning news.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           - Driving his AUDI SEDAN over the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE to 
           work in San Francisco.

           - Winding through the spiralling parking garage of a 
           large OFFICE BUILDING.

           - Walking the halls of his law firm - PETTIS, RAUTH & 
           SILVERBERG - nodding politely to his fellow attorneys.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Just as I always had. No 
                        deviation, no detour...

           We now see Tim... 

           - Driving home from work.

           - Parking in the driveway of his nice house.

           - Eating a sensible dinner at the table.

           - On the couch reviewing documents for work, while 
           watching TV.

           - Going to bed, never straying from his side of the 
           mattress.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Waiting patiently for the 
                        inevitable moment when Stella 
                        would see the error of her ways, 
                        adjust her course, and return 
                        home.

           We see the routine of Tim’s life play out in FASTER CUTS - 
           alarm clock, jogging, shower, dressing, breakfast, 
           driving to work, parking, working, driving home, eating 
           dinner, reviewing documents, going to bed...

           Throughout, Tim’s face betrays no emotion and we notice 
           only the smallest variances in the patterns of his life - 
           different running shorts, different versions of dark 
           suits and neckties, different cars surrounding him on his 
           commute, co-workers dressed differently.

           The only noticeable change - as we move through time - is 
           that MORE AND MORE ITEMS are DISAPPEARING from the house. 
           Stella, as she said she would be, has been moving out her 
           possessions, slowly stripping away the items and feminine 
           touches that had once made this house a home.
           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tim sits on his couch, prepping for the next day’s legal 
           work. Art is missing from the walls, bookshelves half-
           emptied, plants missing, pieces of furniture gone.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And when Stella did come back, I 
                        would be there to welcome her back 
                        with forgiveness and open arms.

           Tim takes a slow look around his house, taking it all 
           in... then BURSTS INTO TEARS. The first emotion we’ve 
           seen from him since Stella gave him the news.

           EXT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - MILL VALLEY - NIGHT 

           A two story craftsman home, nestled in the towering trees 
           of one of Mill Valley’s canyons.

           GEORGE, Tim’s older brother, opens the front door to find 
           Tim standing on his doorstep, bawling.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (stunned)
                        Tim?

                                 TIM
                        She’s gone.

                                 GEORGE
                        What?

                                 TIM
                        Stella left me.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh God, Tim...

           George goes to his brother and takes him in his arms. As 
           Tim sobs on George’s shoulder, a 12 year old girl, JOY, 
           appears in the foyer.

                                 JOY
                        Dad, what’s wrong with Uncle Tim? 
                        Did somebody die?

                                 GEORGE
                        Nobody died, Joy. (then, to 
                        someone off screen) Laurie, get 
                        down here! (to Tim) Come on, 
                        Timmy, let’s go inside...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           George gently guides Tim into the house...

           INT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Still distraught, Tim sits on the couch next to LAURIE, 
           George’s wife. Dressed in YOGA CLOTHES, Laurie clasps 
           Tim’s hand, while George stands at the wet bar, pouring a 
           large glass of wine. At the doorway to the room, we’ll 
           see Joy occasionally poking her head in, listening with 
           concern for her devastated uncle.

                                 TIM
                        She said she’d been unhappy for a 
                        long time and that it wasn’t any 
                        one thing... just an accumulation 
                        of distance and isolation and... I 
                        don’t know, there were all these 
                        words coming at me and I was 
                        trying to think and... oh, God.

           Tim’s tears burst forth again.

                                 LAURIE
                        Tim... I’m so sorry.

           George comes over, putting the wine glass and bottle in 
           front of Tim.

                                 GEORGE
                        She did this tonight?

                                 TIM
                        No, four and a half weeks ago.

           Laurie and George exchange a look of surprise.

                                 GEORGE
                        Four and a half weeks ago? And 
                        you’re just telling me now? Jesus, 
                        Timmy, I’m your brother...

                                 TIM
                        I thought she’d change her mind.

           With that, Tim downs his wine in a long gulp. As he pours 
           himself another glass... 

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You saw us, did we seem unhappy? I 
                        mean, were there any signs?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LAURIE
                        It’s hard to know what’s in 
                        somebody’s heart, Tim. 

                                 GEORGE
                                 (re: Tim’s situation)
                        Fucking bitch.

                                 LAURIE
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come on, you just expect me to sit 
                        here? Look at what she’s done to 
                        him. I’ve got to express myself 
                        somehow. (beat, frustrated) Fine, 
                        I’m done.

           As George grabs another glass and pours himself some 
           wine, Tim sees Joy peeking into the room.

                                 TIM
                                 (wiping tears)
                        I’m sorry you have to see me like 
                        this Joy.

           Her parents turn with surprise...

                                 GEORGE
                        Come on, Princess... didn’t we 
                        tell you to go upstairs?

                                 JOY
                        Sorry. I just couldn’t leave.

                                 TIM
                        It’s fine, George. Let her stay. 
                        It’s out of the bag now. Might as 
                        well be open, right?

           With that, Tim downs his wine and we MOVE TO...

           INT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Joy sits next to her mother. Tim has another bottle in 
           front of him and is now quiet drunk. Leaning back on the 
           couch, emotionally wide open...

                                 TIM
                        She left me for a fucking realtor. 
                        Derek fucking Trotter.

           Laurie and Joy shake their head, feeling so much for Tim.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GEORGE
                        If it’s any consolation, Derek 
                        actually is a pretty good guy.

           Laurie turns to her husband - did he really say just 
           that?

                                 LAURIE
                        Not now, George.

                                 GEORGE
                        What? He golfs at the Club, I’ve 
                        played with the man. Hell of a 
                        player, by the way. (beat) I mean 
                        he’s an a-hole for doing this, 
                        obviously, but--

                                 JOY
                        Dad, seriously...

                                 GEORGE
                                 (flustered)
                        I’m sorry, I’m trying to offer 
                        comfort. I’m grasping at straws 
                        here...

           Laurie puts her hand on Tim’s shoulder

                                 LAURIE
                        Tim, we are always here for you. 
                        You know that, right?

                                 TIM
                                 (touched, nodding)
                        You guys are so good to me. I 
                        should have told you earlier.

                                 JOY
                        You told us when you were ready.

           A kind beat between Joy and Tim, then...

                                 TIM
                        Yeah... (beat) Look, I need to get 
                        going. I’ve got an early partner 
                        meeting and--

           Tim tries to stand up, but the wine has left him wobbly.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh boy...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 GEORGE
                        Whoa, okay... maybe you shouldn’t 
                        drive. Why don’t you spend the 
                        night here?

                                 TIM
                        No, no... I need to wake up in my 
                        own bed. Just let me get my 
                        equilibrium and I’ll be good.

           But, it’s clear, Tim’s equilibrium won’t be back for 
           awhile.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (to Laurie)
                        I’ll drive Tim home in his car. 
                        Can you guys pick me up?

                                 TIM
                        No, no... that’s too much. I can’t 
                        let you do that.

                                 LAURIE
                        It’s okay. 

                                 JOY
                        We’re fine, Uncle Tim.

                                 TIM
                                 (drunk, warmly)
                        Look at her. She’s fine. You’re 
                        fine. Everybody’s fine. (beat) 
                        Everybody except me...

           And with that, Tim starts crying again.

           INT. TIM’S AUDI - NIGHT 

           George is driving. Tim slumps in the passenger seat.

                                 TIM
                        I’m sorry. I must seem like an 
                        idiot.

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you kidding? You’d be an idiot 
                        if you weren’t getting drunk and 
                        crying. I’m just glad we could be 
                        there...

           Tim pauses for a thoughtful beat, then... 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        Do you know where he lives?

                                 GEORGE
                        Who?

                                 TIM
                        Derek fucking Trotter. Do you know 
                        where his house is?

                                 GEORGE
                                 (warily)
                        I might... why?

                                 TIM
                        I’d like to see it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh no... Tim, I’m a Radiologist, 
                        not a Psychologist, but I really 
                        can’t see how that’s going to do 
                        you any good.

                                 TIM
                        I just want to see it. My wife 
                        moves out, I can’t be curious 
                        about where she’s living? Is it a 
                        nice house? Big? Architecturally 
                        pleasing?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s nice. Not too big, big-ish...

                                 TIM
                        See, you know these things and I 
                        don’t. That’s bothersome. I don’t 
                        know anything...

           George studies his wounded younger brother, then...

                                 GEORGE
                                 (relenting)
                        Fine...

           With that, George makes a quick left turn and guides the 
           car up a winding road...

           EXT. DEREK TROTTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           A beautiful CUL-DE-SAC. George pulls the Audi in front of 
           an impeccably maintained example of Northern California 
           mid-century modern architecture. One or two lights are on 
           in the house, but no one is visible.
           INT. TIM’S AUDI - SAME TIME

           Behind the wheel, George watches Tim staring thoughtfully 
           across the street at Derek’s house...

                                 GEORGE
                        Was it what you were expecting?

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know what I was expecting. 
                        (beat, wistfully) So, he’s a good 
                        guy, huh?

                                 GEORGE
                                 (carefully)
                        What do you want me to say?

           Tim considers what he’d like to hear, then, with a shrug, 
           he decides on...

                                 TIM
                        What’s with the flamingos?

           He points to TWO LARGE PINK PLASTIC FLAMINGOS on the back 
           edge of the front lawn. The two birds are grouped 
           together, almost like a happy couple.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (unsure)
                        Maybe they’re supposed to be 
                        ironic.

                                 TIM
                        Ironic flamingos? Who does that?

           George can only shake his head. A silent beat, then...

                                 GEORGE
                        Can we go now? Laurie and Joy are 
                        probably already at your place.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, yeah... it’s fine. Thanks 
                        for doing this.

           As George drives away, Tim gives a quick glance back at 
           the house and the two flamingos on the lawn.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           George pulls Tim’s car onto the driveway. Laurie and Joy 
           are waiting in Laurie’s Toyota Land Cruiser.

           Tim walks George to their car, the two brothers HUG, then 
           George climbs in with his family. As they drive off...

           ...Tim’s PHONE goes off. He pulls it from his pocket to 
           see a TEXT MESSAGE from Joy - “UNCLE TIM, WE LOVE YOU!” 

           Through the Land Cruiser’s back window, Tim sees Joy 
           WAVING to him. Touched, he waves back.

           INT. TIM’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           In pajama bottoms and a gray CAL T-shirt, Tim stares at 
           his bed, contemplating the space he once shared with 
           Stella. Suddenly, he PUSHES HER PILLOW off the mattress 
           and boldly stakes claim to the middle - new territory.

           Tim lies there for a moment, but it’s just not working. 
           He pulls his pillow back to his side of the bed, puts her 
           pillow back and settles into his normal position. 

           But, this isn’t working either. Tim lies there for a 
           frustrated beat, then a DETERMINED look crosses his face 
           and the sound of a RACING Audi engine takes us to...

           EXT. DEREK TROTTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Tires SCREECH, as Tim’s Audi comes to an ABRUPT STOP in 
           front of the house, which is totally dark, save for the 
           soft glow of a streetlight. 

           Tim JUMPS out of the car and SPRINTS across the lawn. A 
           PORCH LIGHT goes on, as if triggered by a sensor, but Tim 
           can’t be stopped... he’s on a mission. 

           He YANKS the two FLAMINGOS from the ground and SPRINTS 
           back to his car. TOSSING the birds into his trunk, he 
           JUMPS in his car, pulls a SCREECHING U-turn in the cul-de-
           sac, and RACES away.

           A few LIGHTS go on in the house, but Tim is already long 
           gone. It’s a boldly efficient crime.

                                 TIM (O.C.)
                        Wow!!
           INT. TIM’S AUDI - CONTINUOUS

           Tim buzzes on the PURE ADRENALINE of what he’s done. 
           Pounding the steering wheel with his hand...

                                 TIM
                        Wow!! WOW!!

           There’s a BEAMING SMILE across his face - the first real 
           pleasure we’ve seen him experience - and it’s like he’s 
           soaring above the Earth, free of all the pain of the last 
           four and a half weeks, like a man who has suddenly found--

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (panicked)
                        Oh shit!

           Tim almost misses a sharp turn in the road. He cranks the 
           wheel, the car squeals and skids, and barely manages to 
           get back on course.

           His smile is still there, blended with some panic, not 
           quite as triumphant... but definitely still there.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (softly)
                        Wow...

           The BUZZING of an alarm clock takes us to...

           INT. TIM’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The buzzing continues, as Tim sleeps - the clock reads 
           7:23, long passed his established wake up time. Slowly, 
           he emerges from his slumber and focusses on the time on 
           the clock...

                                 TIM
                                 (startled)
                        Oh, Jesus...

           He jumps from his bed, his hand shooting to his aching 
           head, as he feels the after effects of the previous 
           night’s wine. Then, he sees the two flamingos he’d stolen 
           from Derek and Stella’s yard and the full events of the 
           evening rush back to him...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Jesus!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tim grabs the flamingos and shoves them into his closet, 
           closing the door to hide them. He disappears into the 
           bathroom, we hear the shower go on and MOVE TO...

           INT. TIM’S AUDI - LATER

           Tim desperately negotiates MORNING TRAFFIC with one hand, 
           while tying his tie with the other.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER

           Tim’s car weaves through the spiraling garage, then pulls 
           into a spot. Tim jumps from the car and hustles for his 
           building...

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim emerges from the elevator and hurries towards the 
           CONFERENCE ROOM, where large glass windows reveal a long 
           table, surrounded by seated ATTORNEYS in the middle of a 
           PARTNER MEETING. Tim quickly enters the room...

           INT. OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ART PETTIS and DICK RAUTH, the firm’s stately FOUNDING 
           PARTNERS, sit at the heads of the table, as Tim makes his 
           way to an empty chair. For the first time in his 
           professional career, Tim is visibly frazzled and he can 
           feel the weight of the eyes lingering on him...

                                 PETTIS
                                 (coolly)
                        Good morning, Tim.

                                 TIM
                                 (contrite)
                        Good morning. Sorry I’m late. 
                        Running a little behind. Won’t 
                        happen again.

           Pettis watches Tim takes his seat, then turns his 
           attention to another attorney...

                                 PETTIS
                        Now, Paul, suppose you were able 
                        to demonstrate a pattern of non-
                        compliance, tying in both...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As Art continues addressing PAUL, we see Tim glancing at 
           his fellow partners, spinning under the weight of his 
           tardiness, the lie he’s just told, and the turmoil in his 
           personal life. Suddenly...

                                 TIM
                                 (blurting out)
                        My wife left me.

           The meeting screeches to a halt. All eyes turn to Tim.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        She moved out 4 1/2 weeks ago and 
                        is living with a man named Derek 
                        Trotter.

           Off their dumbfounded faces...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (sinking)
                        I’m sorry, it’s the first partner 
                        meeting I’ve been late to in 4 
                        years... I thought my tardiness 
                        deserved an explanation. Maybe 
                        not. I don’t know. It’s been a 
                        confusing time...

           Tim trails off and there is a long, silent beat, as 
           everyone stares at him. Particularly, Art Pettis.

                                 PETTIS (O.C.)
                        The collapse of a marriage is one 
                        of the most traumatic things that 
                        can happen to a person.

           INT. ART PETTIS’S OFFICE - LATER

           Pettis paces behind his desk in mid-lecture. Tim is 
           seated in a chair across from him.

                                 PETTIS
                        It can burn a hole in a man, leave 
                        him questioning his past, his 
                        future, even the purpose of his 
                        daily existence. (beat) Your 
                        outburst in the conference 
                        concerned me.

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding)
                        Like I said, it’s been a confusing 
                        time. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Pettis settles into the chair behind his large desk.

                                 PETTIS
                                 (softening)
                        So, Derek Trotter... the realtor?

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding)
                        I didn’t even know she knew him.

                                 PETTIS
                        Well, he’s a good man, if that 
                        helps. And a wizard with a putter. 
                        (beat, realizing) Probably doesn’t 
                        help, though.

           Tim shakes his head - “Doesn’t help.”

                                 PETTIS (CONT’D)
                        Were you at least getting some 
                        action on the side? Sometimes that 
                        takes the sting off it. A woman 
                        who understands discretion and the 
                        pressures of a man in your 
                        position. A bosomy confidant, 
                        perhaps?

                                 TIM
                        There was no one on the side. 

                                 PETTIS
                        Hmm...

           Pettis considers this for a beat. Then, he leans forward, 
           as if about to confide something very personal.

                                 ART PETTIS
                        Tim, I want to tell you a story 
                        about another promising attorney. 
                        This was 35 years ago, but, in 
                        many ways you and he aren’t that 
                        different...

           Tim nods solemnly, as Pettis continues...

                                 ART PETTIS (CONT’D)
                        Like you, he was a legal dynamo, 
                        practically billed more hours than 
                        the rest of the firm combined... 
                        he lived and breathed the law. 
                        Hell, in many ways, he was the 
                        law.

           CONTINUED: (2)
                                 ART PETTIS (CONT’D)
                        (beat) Until the day he married 
                        the most beautiful woman he’d ever 
                        seen - half Hungarian, half Navajo 
                        - with long dark hair, eyes like 
                        jewels and legs that went on for 
                        miles. She also had a thirst for 
                        booze that could put a seaman on 
                        shore leave to shame. (beat, 
                        wistful) That young attorney never 
                        stood a chance...

           Tim is trying to figure out where this story is going...

                                 TIM
                        Were you the attorney?

                                 ART PETTIS
                        No, I wasn’t the attorney. For 
                        Godsakes, Beverly Rose was the 
                        love of my life for 42 years! You 
                        know that!

                                 TIM
                                 (flustered)
                        I’m sorry. It’s just the way you 
                        framed the story... I thought the 
                        use of 3rd person was a narrative 
                        device.

           Pettis SLAMS his hand down on his desk.

                                 ART PETTIS
                        There’s no device, Tim! Come on, 
                        I’m talking about Pat Rainey! 
                        (beat) Rainey was a partner here 
                        back when we were called Pettis, 
                        Rauth, Rainey & Silverberg. One of 
                        the best attorneys I’d ever seen. 
                        (beat, softening) I swore I’d jump 
                        through fire for that man...

           Another long pause, as Pettis reflects sadly on those 
           bygone days. The SILENCE gets uncomfortable.

                                 TIM
                                 (prompting)
                        Did you?

                                 ART PETTIS
                        Did I what?

                                 TIM
                        Jump through fire for him?

           Pettis shakes his head matter-of-factly.

                        Never had the chance. That 
                        Hungarian-Navajo harlot he called 
                        a wife left him for some saxophone 
                        player and Rainey lost it. We 
                        found him three days later riding 
                        a city bus wearing high heels and 
                        women’s lingerie.

           Tim swallows hard, the impact of another man’s demise 
           cutting close to the bone.

                                 TIM
                        Wow, that’s not good.

                                 ART PETTIS
                        No, it wasn’t. We had his name off 
                        the firm’s letterhead within 24 
                        hours. 17 years of legal expertise 
                        down the tubes...

           Pettis rises from his chair to emphasize his next point.

                                 ART PETTIS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done some great work for 
                        this firm, Tim. You’re our 
                        youngest partner, you bill the 
                        most hours, handle our biggest 
                        clients... that’s the kind of 
                        thing that gets a man’s name on 
                        the front door. Don’t let this 
                        setback in your personal life 
                        jeopardize that. Promise me you 
                        won’t be like Rainey...

           Still unsure what to even make of the Rainey story, all 
           Tim can offer is...

                                 TIM
                                 (flatly)
                        I promise.

           Then, as Pettis continues on about Tim’s “responsibility 
           to his clients” and the firm’s “legacy of service and 
           professionalism”, Tim’s eyes are drawn to something on 
           Pettis’s bookshelf.

           CLOSE ON the shelf - we see books, honorary awards, 
           various other items befitting a man of accomplishment, 
           and a ceramic COFFEE MUG featuring a BRIGHT PINK 
           FLAMINGO. 

           Tim is transfixed by the bird, no longer listening to 
           Pettis’s continuing speech. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I must have sat in that office a 
                        hundred times before and never 
                        seen that flamingo.

           INT. TIM’S OFFICE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Shaken, Tim exits Pettis’s office. He blankly passes his 
           co-workers, almost as if he doesn’t see them.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Was it new? Had it been there all 
                        along and I’d just never noticed? 
                        Why was I suddenly seeing 
                        flamingos? Was it all just 
                        coincidence? Possibly... 

           INT. TIM’S OFFICE - LATER

           Still shaken, we see Tim at his desk, doing some research 
           on his computer...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        On the other hand, a quick Google 
                        search and a couple of Wikipedia 
                        entries revealed Carl Jung, the 
                        founder of Analytical Psychology, 
                        and his Principle of 
                        Synchronicity, which states 
                        coincidences are often the result 
                        of the unseen interdependence 
                        between what may seem like two 
                        disparate and independent events.

           As Tim stares at his computer, trying to process what 
           he’s read, we MOVE TO...

           INT. HALLWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

           The office is empty, it seems everyone has gone home for 
           the night... 

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t even entirely sure what 
                        Carl Jung meant by that.

           Suddenly, the door to MR. PETTIS’S OFFICE opens and Tim 
           steps out carrying his briefcase and HOLDING SOMETHING 
           wedged underneath his jacket. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        But, I did know I wanted that 
                        bird.

           Tim hurries for the safety of the elevator.

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           As the elevator descends, Tim pulls the mug from his coat 
           and studies the painted flamingo, an ADRENALIZED SMILE - 
           the same smile from the first theft - spreading across 
           his face.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        That night, I dreamt about 
                        Stella...

           INT. CHURCH - 16 YEARS AGO - DAY

           The church doors open, revealing a YOUNG STELLA in her 
           wedding dress. She’s backlit by radiating sunlight.

           On the altar, Tim is AWESTRUCK, as he locks eyes with his 
           beautiful, smiling bride.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        ...and how our life once seemed so 
                        wide open, full of ideas and plans 
                        - forgoing children so we’d be 
                        free to travel across Europe, live 
                        on a houseboat, learn to cook 
                        Chinese food...

           INT. CLASSROOM - HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL - 14 YEARS AGO - DAY 

           Tim sits in a classroom full of law students. Tim raises 
           his hand, is called on by the professor...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        But there was also law school to 
                        finish, student loans to pay, the 
                        bar exam...

           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S SAN FRANCISCO APARTMENT - 11 YEARS 
           AGO - NIGHT 

           Tim, still in his dress shirt and tie after a long day, 
           sits at their kitchen table, hard at work prepping for 
           the next day’s work. Legal briefs, depositions, etc.

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        The usual pressures of the law 
                        profession...

           In an oversized PFIZER 1999 TOP SALES PERFORMERS T-shirt 
           and underwear, Stella hands Tim a cup of tea, kisses his 
           forehead and heads for the bedroom. Buried in work, he 
           doesn’t look up until she’s already moving away from him.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And Stella had her own successful 
                        career as a pharmaceutical rep... 

           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - 7 YEARS AGO - NIGHT 

           They’ve now upgraded their lifestyle to the nice home in 
           Mill Valley. We see a spare bedroom, converted into a 
           makeshift art studio, filled with canvasses and paints. 
           Stella works on new piece - it’s raw, derivative, 
           modernist - clearly the work of someone just learning how 
           to use her instrument.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        ...which she eventually left to 
                        pursue her growing interest in art 
                        and painting.

           Tim appears in the doorway, drained from another long day 
           and lengthy commute. Proud, Stella steps back from her 
           canvas, Tim nods and smiles - but he has no idea what 
           he’s even looking at.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I guess things just sort of got 
                        away from us.

           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - 6 YEARS AG0 - NIGHT 

           In their well-appointed kitchen, Tim and Stella stand 
           over a hot pan of boiling oil, several hand-rolled 
           DUMPLINGS ready to be cooked.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        To be fair, we did try cooking 
                        Chinese food a few times.

           Stella drops one dumpling into the oil, which splatters, 
           burning Tim...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (in pain)
                        Oh, shit... hot, hot!
           INT. TIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Tim is in bed, exactly as we last saw him, except now his 
           eyes are open, staring at the three stolen flamingoes.

           We hear a RINGING PHONE, then...

                                 STELLA (O.C.)
                        Hello...

           EXT. SAUSILTO DOCK - DAY 

           CLOSE ON - Tim, walking with his cellphone to his ear.

                                 TIM
                        Well, I finally did it, Stella. 
                        You know that houseboat we always 
                        talked about living on? Well... I 
                        just leased one.

           PULL BACK to reveal Tim standing on a dock staring at a 
           brown shingled houseboat, with flower baskets hanging 
           from the eaves. Several moving boxes are gathered by the 
           front door.

           This is the famed houseboat community of Sausalito, 
           California. Across the bay, San Francisco shines in the 
           afternoon sunlight.

           INT. ART STUDIO - DAY 

           Now, in an art studio all her own, Stella wears a paint 
           splattered shirt. Canvases and paintings are spread 
           around the room, but we only see glimpses of the work.

                                 STELLA
                        What? Tim? Why are you calling me 
                        about this?

           INTERCUT TIM AND STELLA AS NECESSARY.

           Tim stares at the houseboat.

                                 TIM
                        You should see it, Stella. It’s 
                        like a floating cottage. Fully 
                        furnished, kind of a nautical 
                        theme. (beat) And don’t worry, I 
                        found a nice Asian couple to rent 
                        our place... they’re so excited 
                        about the house.

                        I chose not to mention our recent 
                        bumps there, didn’t want to dampen 
                        their enthusiasm any, but it’s 
                        okay, because couples hit rough 
                        patches sometimes and these storms 
                        can also pass and... (beat, re: 
                        the view) Stella, it’s  so 
                        peaceful out here. We really 
                        should have done this years ago.

           Stella pauses, carefully choosing her next words...

                                 STELLA
                        Okay, Tim... uh, I’m not exactly 
                        sure how to say this, but... 
                        you’re not doing this houseboat 
                        thing because of me are you? 
                        (beat, gently) Because it... it 
                        won’t change anything.

           Not exactly what Tim was hoping to hear.

                                 TIM
                                 (flustered)
                        Who said I wanted change? I just 
                        want to live on the water... like 
                        we always talked about. Because 
                        I’m one of those guys who when he 
                        says something, he does it. Boom, 
                        cross it off my list. (beat) 
                        Besides, I assumed you and Derek 
                        were very happy up there on your 
                        woodsy cul-de-sac in the hills.

                                 STELLA
                        So, you know where we live? 

           Oops.

                                 TIM
                        Uh, well... Mill Valley has lots 
                        of woodsy streets, many  of them 
                        cul-de-sacs. Just sort of threw it 
                        out there...

                                 STELLA
                        Right. (beat) Tim, a couple weeks 
                        ago, we had something stolen from 
                        our front yard. Did you do it?

                                 TIM
                        Steal from you? No, I didn’t do 
                        it. (beat) What kind of something, 
                        by the way? Just out of 
                        curiosity...

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know anything about it.

           Stella pauses thoughtfully, then...

                                 STELLA
                        Well, I figured it was probably 
                        just some teenagers. But, then, 
                        when you said you knew what our 
                        street looked like, it seemed a 
                        little strange...

                                 TIM
                        Okay, fine... truth is, I Google 
                        Earthed you. Wrong, I know... but, 
                        I guess it’s just the natural 
                        curiosity of a man whose wife is 
                        living with another man. I’m 
                        sorry.

                                 STELLA
                        Okay, well... I didn’t think you 
                        were the stealing type. But, you 
                        never know...

                                 TIM
                        True. Just like I never knew you 
                        were the flamingo type. Until 
                        now...

                                 STELLA
                        They were meant to be ironic.

           Tim nods. Of course they were.

                                 TIM
                        By the way, I hear lovely things 
                        about Derek. They say he’s a fine 
                        golfer.

           The comment hangs there for an awkward beat, then...

                                 STELLA
                        Goodbye, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Bye, Stella.

           Deflated, Tim hangs up the phone and stares again at his 
           houseboat, the wide expanse of bay, and the city 
           shimmering on the other side.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           From behind Tim, a man’s VOICE...

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Ahoy, neighbor. Can I interest you 
                        in a mai tai?

           Tim turns to see OLAF, whose white beard and wool sweater 
           makes him look like some kind of Norwegian sea captain. 
           In his hand, his afternoon cocktail.

                                 OLAF
                                 (re: his drink)
                        On sunny days, I find a little 
                        taste of the South Pacific helps 
                        transport the mind.

                                 TIM
                                 (flatly)
                        I’m sure it does, but... no 
                        thanks. I’ve got some unpacking I 
                        should probably get to...

                                 OLAF
                        Well, welcome to our floating 
                        neighborhood. You’ll never find 
                        more peace than living on the 
                        water.

           With a broad sweeping motion, Olaf gestures to the bay.

                                 TIM
                                 (sinking)
                        You don’t say...

                                 OLAF
                        By the way, the name’s Olaf.

           But, Tim has already turned, heading for his new home.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        The truth is, I’ve always hated 
                        boats.

           INT. HOUSEBOAT - TIM’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           The furnished boat is decorated with an eye for NAUTICAL 
           kitsch. Tim is in BED, staring miserably at the ceiling, 
           as a low, but constant, HUM echoes through the boat.

                                 TIM
                        Ugh... what is that?!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Desperate to find a way to sleep, Tim finally rolls over 
           and folds the pillow over his head.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But, in the absence of other 
                        viable living arrangements, I 
                        decided to put on a brave face...

           CLOSE ON Tim, head pressed sadly in a pillow sandwich. 
           His face anything but brave.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ... and vowed to make the best of 
                        my new life on the water.

           EXT. HOUSEBOAT - MORNING

           Tim emerges from his boat, dressed for work. A look of 
           disgust crosses his face.

                                 TIM
                        What the hell...

           REVERSE ANGLE to reveal that the waters of the bay have 
           pulled way back and the once floating boats are now mired 
           in a disgusting brown MUCK, cluttered with muscles and 
           clumps of algae. The bright sunlight of the previous 
           afternoon has been replaced by a dull gray marine layer.

           Tim sees his neighbor, Olaf, sitting on his dock drinking 
           coffee and reading the morning paper.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Olaf, what happened to the water?

                                 OLAF
                        Low tide. Beautiful, isn’t it? 
                        Mother Ocean pulling back to 
                        reveal the treasures hidden 
                        beneath...

           Tim looks out at the “treasures”. He SNIFFS the air...

                                 TIM
                        Kind of smells. (beat) How often 
                        is this going to happen?

                                 OLAF
                        Only twice a day. That smell is 
                        dying algae...

           Olaf INHALES deeply, drawing strength from the odor.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OLAF (CONT’D)
                        Invigorating, isn’t it?

                                 TIM
                                 (decidedly not 
                                 invigorated)
                        It’s lovely...

           Tim starts up the dock, then turns back...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear a noise last night? 
                        Kind of a--

                                 OLAF
                        -- humming noise? Like a low 
                        flying plane in the distance?

                                 TIM
                        Exactly, yeah... you heard it?

                                 OLAF
                        Humming Toadfish. That’s their 
                        mating call. Whole section about 
                        it in your lease contract. (beat) 
                        Don’t worry, you’ll get used to 
                        it.

           Tim looks weak, as he turns to the festering mud flats...

                                 TIM
                        Oh, God... what have I done?

           INT. ART PETTIS’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tim and a co-worker, MARK ROSENBLATT, are seated, in mid-
           conversation with Pettis. Tim and Rosenblatt each hold a 
           folder of documents, while Pettis paces behind his desk.

                                 TIM
                        I’ve filed the counter motion, 
                        still awaiting a response. (beat) 
                        They’re not letting on, but I 
                        think they want to settle...

                                 PETTIS
                        Of course they want to settle. 
                        They always want to settle. We’re 
                        a country of set...

           Pettis trails off, his attention drawn to the items on 
           the shelves behind his desk. Tim watches warily, as 
           Pettis stares for a long beat.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        Art?

                                 PETTIS
                        Hmm?

           Another long pause, then...

                                 ROSENBLATT
                                 (gently reminding)
                        Zeus Juice vs. California Plum...

           Pettis turns back to Tim and Rosenblatt.

                                 PETTIS
                                 (distracted)
                        Right. So... they want to settle?

                                 TIM
                                 (carefully)
                        I believe an offer is coming, yes.

                                 PETTIS
                                 (uninterested)
                        Well, I’m sure you’ve got it 
                        handled. Keep me in the loop...

           Meeting over. The distracted Pettis turns back to his 
           shelves, leaving Rosenblatt confused... and Tim very 
           concerned.

           INT. OFFICE - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

           Tim and Rosenblatt step out, closing Pettis’s door.

                                 ROSENBLATT
                        That was a waste. He hardly said 
                        anything. (beat) We can still bill 
                        the client for that though, right?

                                 TIM
                                 (unsettled)
                        Of course...

           Tim turns and walks past the long window into Pettis’s 
           office. Pettis is searching through the items on his 
           shelf. Now, Tim is really concerned...

           Frustrated, Pettis turns and heads for his office door. 
           Tim quickly ducks into his own office...
           INT. TIM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Tim hides in the doorway and peers back into the hallway, 
           as Pettis approaches the desk of his secretary, CATHY.

                                 PETTIS
                        Cathy, did you move anything in my 
                        office?

                                 CATHY
                        No, sir. You were very clear about 
                        that in my interview. I can touch, 
                        but not move...

           Pettis nods, acknowledging his mandate. Then...

                                 PETTIS
                        Did the cleaning crew mention 
                        breaking anything?

                                 CATHY
                        As a matter of fact, they did.

           Cathy pulls a cracked PICTURE FRAME from her desk.

                                 CATHY (CONT’D)
                        The photo of you and Mr. Rauth at 
                        Pebble Beach. Rosa, the one with 
                        the shakes... she knocked it over 
                        when she was dusting. (beat) I was 
                        going to re-frame it for you.

           Pettis glances at the PHOTO - he and his law partner 
           standing on the tee box of Pebble’s famed 18th hole - but 
           his mind is still elsewhere. 

                                 PETTIS
                        There was a mug on my shelf... 

           Pettis trails off, thinking - When was the last time he’d 
           seen the mug? How long had it been gone? Days? Weeks? Why 
           hadn’t he looked at it more often? 

                                 CATHY
                        Mr. Pettis?

           Pettis just shakes his head and returns to his office, 
           leaving Cathy totally perplexed.

           CLOSE ON Tim, as he ducks back into his office. What has 
           he done? 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        Shit...

           INT. OFFICE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Attorneys and staff are leaving for the night. Tim heads 
           down the hallway, passing Pettis’s office. 

           Through the window, Tim can see Pettis at his desk, lost 
           in troubled thought...

           As Tim takes this in, we hear the low sound of the 
           Humming Toadfish...

                                 GEORGE (O.C.)
                        What the hell’s that noise?

           EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           George and Tim sit on deck chairs, a SIX PACK of beer on 
           a table between them. The HUMMING continues... 

                                 GEORGE
                                 (annoyed)
                        Do you hear it?

           Staring out at the water, Tim nods. 

                                 TIM
                                 (glumly)
                        That’s the Humming Toadfish, 
                        George. Apparently, I missed it in 
                        the least contract.

                                 GEORGE
                        I thought lawyers were good with 
                        contracts...

                                 TIM
                                 (with a shrug)
                        Don’t tell Pettis. He’s already 
                        warned me about slipping...

           George listens to the Toadfish for another beat, then...

                                 GEORGE
                        How often do they do this?

                                 TIM
                        Oh, just all night. (beat) Olaf 
                        swears I get used to it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tim has clearly not gotten used to it. George settles 
           back and opens a new beer.

                                 GEORGE
                        So, you really thought moving onto 
                        this boat would get her back?

                                 TIM
                        I’m not sure what I thought. 
                        (beat) Maybe I should have shown 
                        more interest in her painting. We 
                        could have travelled more... maybe 
                        had kids. I don’t know...

           Tim hangs his head...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        God... I’m so lost, George. 

           George rests a comforting hand on Tim’s shoulder.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey, hey... come on, I’m here for 
                        you. Let me help...

                                 TIM
                                 (shaking his head)
                        You don’t even know the half of 
                        it, George. (beat) I just want 
                        things to be normal again. Can you 
                        help with that?

                                 GEORGE
                        Make things normal? I’m not even 
                        sure what the word means. 

           George takes a pull on his beer.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Happy? I might be able to assist 
                        you there. Help you get your mind 
                        off Stella? Sure. But, normal? 
                        That’s beyond my job 
                        description...

           Tim doesn’t understand, he just wants the pain to go 
           away...

                                 TIM
                                 (confused)
                        What are you talking about, 
                        George?

           George pauses for a beat, then...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 GEORGE
                        Would you like to go to an orgy?

           OFF Tim’s stunned expression, we MOVE TO...

           INT. GEORGE’S BOXSTER - NIGHT

           George is behind the wheel of his PORSCHE BOXSTER. Tim 
           sits next to him. A live GRATEFUL DEAD CD plays softly on 
           the stereo.

                                 TIM
                        How long have you been going to 
                        orgies?

                                 GEORGE
                        About a year and a half now. And 
                        it’s not “orgies”, it’s one 
                        “orgy”, once or twice a month, at 
                        a nice home in San Rafael. A 
                        Radiology colleague told me about 
                        it. Good, professional crowd... 
                        you’ll feel very at home there.

                                 TIM
                        Does Laurie know about this?

                                 GEORGE
                                 (nodding)
                        She understands. (beat) Look, I'm 
                        a sexual guy, I need stimulation.  
                        Laurie, not so much.  She likes to 
                        be held. Cuddling, sharing the 
                        morning paper, conversation... 
                        yes. Sex? Not really a priority. 
                        And I don't blame her. It's just 
                        how she's wired. 

                                 TIM
                        What about all the yoga she does? 
                        The deep breathing, the 
                        flexibility... I thought yoga 
                        people were very sexual.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (slightly bitter)
                        Some are sexual. Others are just 
                        really into yoga. (beat) You know, 
                        she’s writing freelance for Yoga 
                        Journal now? 50,000 words on 
                        Downward Dog as a metaphor for 
                        life.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        That’s a lot of words. Must be a 
                        long metaphor.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (dismissive)
                        A long something. (beat) Anyway, 
                        Laurie and I worked out an 
                        agreement - I go to this swinger 
                        party a few times a month, enjoy 
                        myself in a safe environment with 
                        other like-minded individuals and 
                        get things out of my system. Is it 
                        normal? Who knows? Is it better 
                        than me futilely dry humping her 
                        leg while she’s trying to sleep? 

                                 TIM
                                 (considering)
                        I guess it would be.

                                 GEORGE
                        Laurie agrees...

           With that, George pulls the car over to park along the 
           wooded road. Several other cars are also parked. Up 
           ahead, we see a LONG DRIVEWAY and the lights of a house.

           We hear the DING DONG of a doorbell and MOVE TO...

           EXT. ORGY HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door opens halfway, revealing a normal looking 
           MAN in an ADIDAS SWEATSUIT...

                                 SWEATSUIT MAN
                        Yes?

           George and Tim stand together on the front step.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hi, does Joe Montana live here?

           The man smiles and opens the door wider...

                                 SWEATSUIT MAN
                        Welcome, friends.

           As they enter...

                                 GEORGE
                                 (to Tim)
                        Great password, huh? 
           INT. ORGY HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Tim follows George inside the house. George pauses to 
           hand the sweatsuit man some money.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (to sweatsuit man)
                        For both of us. (to Tim, 
                        explaining) The money’s just for 
                        refreshments and the DJ. The group 
                        sex is free...

                                 SWEATSUIT MAN
                        Enjoy your night, gentlemen.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thanks, Ken.

           As George leads Tim deeper into the house...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll see Ken out by the pool 
                        later. Guy loves to eat pussy.

                                 TIM
                        Great. I’ll make sure to look for 
                        that.

           Tim glances back at Ken, who gives a smiling “thumbs up”. 
           Down the hall, behind closed doors, we HEAR the sound of 
           the party.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come on, you sarcastic bastard, 
                        let’s get you out of these clothes 
                        and join the festivities.

           With that, George ducks into a bathroom and motions for 
           Tim to follow...

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A large bathroom, with a shower and several CABINETS 
           where party-goers can store their clothes.

           George and Tim take off their clothes and put them in one 
           of the cabinets. Tim folds his neatly, George simply 
           balls his up and throws his in.

                                 TIM
                        So what’s the protocol here?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GEORGE
                        The only protocol is “be cool”. 
                        Ask before you touch, wear a 
                        condom, and respect everyone’s 
                        boundaries. These are good people - 
                        accountants, dentists, teachers...

           George trails off, as he sees his brother naked.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Damn, you’ve got a good orgy body.

           Tim looks down, as if seeing it for the first time.

                                 TIM
                        Really? What makes a good orgy 
                        body?

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, your flat stomach for one. 
                        I’ve got to walk around sucking 
                        mine in the whole time, it’s 
                        exhausting. (beat) And you’ve got 
                        great testicles.

                                 TIM
                                 (looking down)
                        Hmm, I’d never really given them 
                        much thought.

                                 GEORGE
                        I think about mine all the time. 
                        Probably because they dangle 
                        unevenly. It’s awkward. Especially 
                        dancing...

                                 TIM
                        You dance here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sometimes. Hey, it’s a party.

                                 TIM
                        A party where everyone’s naked.

                                 GEORGE
                        And a lot of people are screwing, 
                        yeah. Don’t worry. You’ll love it.

           Tim considers this for a beat, then...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TIM
                                 (thoughtfully)
                        Thanks, George... for bringing me 
                        here. It’s kind of weird, but...

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey, you know what’s weird? 
                        Normal’s weird. Now let’s go make 
                        some friends.

           As George throws his arm around his brother, we STAY ON 
           Tim’s thoughtful face and hear...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        At that moment, it occurred to me 
                        this was exactly what I needed to 
                        get my mind off Stella... 

           INT. ORGY HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           SLOW MOTION HERO SHOT - two WOODEN DOORS open and Tim and 
           George stride into a large room full of mingling NAKED 
           PEOPLE, tasteful decor and San Francisco 49er 
           memorabilia. Porn plays on the television, while a woman 
           gives a man a blow job on a nearby couch.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Something really out of the 
                        ordinary - not illegal or 
                        involving the petty theft of 
                        someone’s property - but something 
                        that would snap me out of the rut 
                        I was in and get me back on track.

           George waves to people he recognizes from previous 
           events, while Tim scans the room with new confidence.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        With my flat stomach and great 
                        testicles, this was the kind of 
                        thing that could redefine Tim 
                        Forrester.

           EXT. ORGY HOUSE - NIGHT

           The party is in FULL SWING. Swingers socialize, dance, 
           and couple off in a myriad of sexual combinations, while 
           a nude DJ spins records at a nearby turntable.

           Tim sits smiling in the JACUZZI, drinking a margarita, 
           oblivious to several COUPLES in the water with him. The 
           couples are all in various STATES OF COPULATION.

                        I was a swinger.

           Tim takes a satisfied sip of his margarita, when, 
           suddenly, a WOMAN next to him, who was busy pleasuring a 
           MAN with her hand, reacts with disgust...

                                 WOMAN
                        Oh, my God... he’s peeing!

                                 MAN
                        What?!

                                 WOMAN
                        He’s peeing on me. This asshole’s 
                        peeing on me.

           Tim realizes they are talking about him - he’s the 
           asshole.

                                 TIM
                                 (horrified)
                        Whoa, no... it’s not like that. I 
                        was relaxing--

                                 MAN
                                 (to Tim)
                        Did you ask her? (to the woman) 
                        Did he ask you?

                                 WOMAN
                        No, he didn’t ask! He just started 
                        peeing!

                                 TIM
                                 (horrified)
                        It slipped out, I swear. This is 
                        my second margarita and the water 
                        was so warm, I was relaxed, it 
                        just started flowing. But, I would 
                        never purposely--

           Another man in the jacuzzi takes notice.

                                 MAN #2
                        What happened?

                                 MAN
                                 (angry, protective)
                        This jackass just peed on 
                        Michelle.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TIM 
                        Accidently, I swear. I never meant 
                        to upset your wife.

           Another man breaks off from the woman he was coupling 
           with in the jacuzzi...

                                 MAN #3
                                 (even angrier)
                        She’s my wife, dude. And she’s not 
                        into piss play.

                                 MAN #2
                        Respect people’s boundaries.

                                 TIM
                        I do. I love boundaries, believe 
                        me. I don’t want any problems...

           As the offended woman moves into her husband’s arms...

                                 MAN
                        You didn’t think peeing on his 
                        wife would be a problem?

                                 TIM
                        Well, to be fair, I didn’t pee on 
                        her. Just near her.

                                 WOMAN
                        Yeah, but it got on me. And I’m 
                        not into it.

                                 MAN #3
                        You heard her. She’s not into it.

           All the women and men in the jacuzzi stare at Tim like he 
           has committed the ultimate sin.

                                 MAN
                        This is really not cool.

           HOLD ON Tim’s mortified face...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And that’s when I was asked to 
                        leave the party. 
           EXT. ORGY HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           A chastened Tim walks back to the house. Behind him, the 
           angry members of the jacuzzi watch his retreat past the 
           other oblivious party-goers, who are still mingling, 
           dancing, and coupling.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Apparently, the swinging lifestyle 
                        is built on a foundation of trust. 
                        And if a woman can’t feel safe in 
                        the knowledge that she won’t be 
                        peed on and/or near...

           Tim reaches the sliding glass door and opens it.

           INT. ORGY HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tim crosses the room, passing more oblivious orgiers...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        ...then the whole delicate 
                        structure of the orgy collapses. 
                        (beat) In a way, it makes sense.

           Tim reaches the wooden doors at the other end of the 
           room, starts to open them, then pauses... as if finally 
           PROCESSING SOMETHING. 

           He hurries back to the center of the room and stares in 
           stunned recognition at the bookshelves - there, below a 
           framed, autographed photo of Joe Montana, is a 10” 
           porcelain figurine of a BRIGHT PINK FLAMINGO.

           Tim’s eyes dart back and forth, from the flamingo to the 
           naked orgiers filling the room, his mind racing - What is 
           it with all these flamingos? Why is this happening to me? 
           I can’t possibly take it, can I? Tim takes a final look 
           at the bird, then...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        No. That’s crazy.

           With that, Tim walks from the room. We STAY ON the wood 
           doors as they CLOSE behind him, HOLDING for a beat, then 
           watch as they OPEN AGAIN and Tim reenters the room.

           He goes straight to the flamingo, PLUCKS it from the 
           shelf, then marches quickly out of the room, SMILING the 
           whole way. A seamless theft, the orgiers never notice.
           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Now dressed, Tim leans against George’s car, staring at 
           the stolen flamingo and smiling... still in the 
           adrenalized afterglow of the theft.

           In the distance, we see George emerging from the driveway 
           of the orgy house.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (calling out)
                        What the fuck happened? Did you 
                        touch someone without asking?

           Tim slips the flamingo into his coat before his brother 
           is close enough to see it.

                                 TIM
                        No, I accidently urinated in the 
                        jacuzzi. It drifted onto some 
                        woman...

                                 GEORGE
                        Dammit, Tim. Nothing kills the 
                        mood of some hot group shower 
                        action like someone coming 
                        upstairs to tell me my brother has 
                        just been asked to leave the 
                        party.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, well... sorry to ruin your 
                        shower.

                                 GEORGE
                        I wasn’t in the shower. I was 
                        watching the group in the shower. 
                        I’m a watcher, not a toucher - 
                        that’s my thing. But, still... 
                        news like that is a major 
                        buzzkill.

                                 TIM
                        Look, I said I was sorry.

           George shrugs with forgiveness.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ah, hell... who am I to lecture 
                        you? At my first swinger party, I 
                        accidently farted during a 3-way. 
                                 (MORE)

           CONTINUED:
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        (beat) It’s funny, a man will let 
                        you watch his wife getting tag 
                        teamed, but pass gas while you’re 
                        watching and suddenly you’re 
                        persona non grata. It’s a tricky 
                        trail we tread...

           Tim, the flamingo still clutched under his jacket, 
           watches his brother ponder the elusive contradictions of 
           the swinger lifestyle, then...

                                 TIM
                        Can we go home now?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, sure... of course. (beat) 
                        Hey, we tried, right?

           Tim allows himself another small smile, as George pats 
           him on the back and they get in the car.

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT -  EXTRA BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tim flips on the light, revealing a sparsely furnished 
           room - a table, a lamp, and his three STOLEN FLAMINGOS. 

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Maybe it was just the adrenaline 
                        rush - the thrilling moment during 
                        the theft when I forgot about 
                        Stella and the hole in my heart.

           Tim places the stolen orgy flamingo with the other birds, 
           then steps studying his growing flock. As a SMILE creeps 
           across his face...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe Carl Jung was right and  
                        it was the Principle of 
                        Synchronicity.

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Meal finished, a WAITRESS brings the change for his bill, 
           as Tim sips the last of an iced tea and idly flips 
           through a Bay Area MAGAZINE. He pauses in disbelief...

                                 TIM (V.0.)
                        Whatever it was, one thing was 
                        certain... 

           CLOSE ON magazine - a profile of local wine critic, 
           CHARLES ANGLEY. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           We see photos of Angley in his beautiful home. In the 
           background of one photo - a stunning ART DECO FLAMINGO, 
           nearly FIVE FEET TALL.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ... this many flamingos do not 
                        enter a man’s life by chance.

           Tim takes the magazine and heads for the exit. Then, 
           passing the HOSTESS STATION, something catches his eye - 
           a FLAMINGO TOOTH PICK HOLDER - can this really be 
           happening?

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        There was simply no point in 
                        denying it. 

           In ONE SWIFT MOVEMENT, Tim palms the tooth pick holder 
           and slips it into his pocket, SMILING as he walks out.

           INT. STORE - DAY

           Tim purchases a pack of dark DRESS SOCKS. The SALESGIRL 
           hands him a RECEIPT to sign and a pen - atop the pen, a 
           BRIGHT PINK FLAMINGO.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And the more open I was to that 
                        fact... 

           Tim signs the receipt, then quickly pockets the pen. 
           Another SMILE.

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY 

           Tim walks through the garage, briefcase in hand, pausing 
           when he notices a RUBBER FLAMINGO on someone’s car 
           ANTENNAE.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        The more flamingos just seemed to 
                        appear.

           Tim plucks the flamingo from the antennae and continues 
           on his way. And, yes, he’s SMILING.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Tim drives down a wet street in a drizzling rain. He 
           passes a BUS STOP SHELTER featuring a LARGE POSTER of a 
           FLAMINGO - an ad for the Flamingo Exhibit at the San 
           Francisco Zoo. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        It was almost like the universe 
                        was trying to tell me something.

           Tim whips his Audi to the side of the road. He jumps out, 
           opens his trunk, grabs a SCREW DRIVER, then runs through 
           the drizzle to the shelter, where he pops open the 
           plastic case and PULLS OUT THE POSTER.

           As he runs back to the car, another adrenalized SMILE 
           spreads across his face...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And though I couldn’t quite 
                        understand what the universe was 
                        saying...

           EXT. ZOO - DAY

           Tim stands with a group of people in front of the 
           FLAMINGO EXHIBIT. About 20 pink flamingos stand together 
           in the muddy recreation of a salt water lagoon. 

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I was doing my best to listen.

           A chipper ZOO GUIDE addresses the group.

                                 ZOO GUIDE
                        Another amazing flamingo fact - 
                        the joint in the middle of their 
                        leg, often mistaken for their 
                        knee, is actually their ankle 
                        joint. So when walking or standing 
                        they are really on their toes, not 
                        their feet.  

           As Tim stares in amazement at the flamingos, a MAN next 
           to him shakes his head.

                                 MAN
                        That is one weird ass bird.

           Tim flashes an ANNOYED look at the man, then turns his 
           attention back to the flamingos.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Excuse me, sir? Can I help you 
                        with something? 
           INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - DAY

           This is the same cluttered, dusty shop from our opening - 
           in fact, we’ve rejoined that first scene.

                                 TIM
                                 (startled)
                        Huh?

           Tim finds the mutton-chopped Clerk from the opening 
           standing a few feet away from him.

                                 CLERK
                        Looking for anything specific?

                                 TIM
                        Me? No, no specifics. Just 
                        browsing. Taking it all in...

           The Clerk eyes him suspiciously for a beat, then...

                                 CLERK
                        Alright... let me know if you need 
                        anything.

                                 TIM
                        Will do.

           As the Clerk heads back to his post behind the counter, 
           Tim turns to a 12 INCH CERAMIC FLAMINGO perched on a 
           crowded shelf - the same flamingo from the opening theft.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        So, getting back to my earlier 
                        question, when a man asks - “What 
                        am I doing? Is this really what my 
                        life’s become?” - I think it’s 
                        safe to say... the answer’s 
                        complicated. 

           And with that, Tim flashes a quick look at the clerk, 
           then GRABS the flamingo and DASHES for the exit.

                                 CLERK
                        HEY!!

           The clerk takes off after Tim, who is already running out 
           the open door.

           Unlike the first time we were in this scene, we now 
           linger in the empty store for a BEAT, listening to the 
           action we’ve already seen play OFF CAMERA...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CLERK (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Stop! Stop! Get back here you son 
                        of a bitch!

                                 TIM (O.C.)
                        WOOOHOOO!!

           EXT. STINSON BEACH - SECONDS LATER

           We rejoin the chase to the sound of Tim’s POUNDING 
           FOOTSTEPS and the enraged store Clerk pursuing him with 
           ad libbed EXCLAIMS. This is one hippie you DON’T mess 
           with.

           Tim darts across the street, cars SCREECHING to avoid him 
           and the pursuing Clerk.

           Pedestrians react with shock, as Tim jumps to the 
           sidewalk and runs past them. 

                                 CLERK
                        Stop him! He’s a thief!

           A bold MAN steps out to block Tim’s path...

                                 TIM
                                 (to the man)
                        Don’t stop me, stop him. He’s out 
                        of his mind!

           Now confused, the Man doesn’t know what to do and Tim 
           races by, followed by the livid Clerk.

           - Tim darts past a burger stand, tries to leap over a 
           table, but catches his foot and comes down with a THUD. 
           He manages to keep the flamingo from hitting the ground 
           and jumps back to his feet, continuing his escape. 

           - Tim races through a basketball court, startling the 
           players who are in mid-game. The Clerk is still in hot 
           pursuit.

           - Tim cuts across a grassy picnic area, racing past 
           groups of people sprawled out on blankets... and runs 
           SMACK INTO Joy, who is holding a CAMERA.

                                 JOY
                                 (shocked)
                        Uncle Tim?

           Startled recognition yanks Tim from the adrenalized rush 
           of the escape...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        Joy...

           But, there’s no time to talk. The Clerk is bearing down. 

                                 CLERK
                        Stop him!!

           Tim takes off again, the Clerk continues chasing... and 
           Joy is completely baffled.

           - Tim sprints onto the beach, which is littered with 
           surfers, kite flyers and dog walkers. Legs churning 
           through the sand, he’s finally able to put some distance 
           between himself and the furious Clerk.

           - Glancing back, Tim sees the Clerk collapse exhausted to 
           his knees, chest heaving. The Clerk holds up a futile 
           middle finger...

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, asshole!

           Tim simply raises the stolen flamingo aloft...

                                 TIM
                        WOOHOO!

           ...and continues to run off down the beach, an 
           exhilarated smile stretched wide across his face, the 
           bird held high like some kind of trophy.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It was the best theft yet. And the 
                        whole time I was running, I forgot 
                        how much I missed Stella and how 
                        alone I was.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. BEACH - MINUTES LATER

           Tim is still running, across what is now barren sand. The 
           town and the beach crowds are long behind him. 

           Eventually, he slows to a stop, as if emerging from a 
           daze. Chest heaving, he looks down at the flamingo, then 
           at his leg - his PANTS ARE TORN and his skin is BLEEDING 
           from his crash at the picnic table. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Finally, Tim looks at the deserted stretch of beach - the 
           only sound is his HEAVY BREATHING and the CRASHING of the 
           windswept Northern California surf. Realizing just how 
           isolated he’s become, he suddenly remembers...

                                 TIM
                                 (sinking)
                        Oh God, Joy...

           As he slowly starts trudging back to town, we MOVE TO...

           EXT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - LATER 

           Tim pulls onto the driveway. He parks, slips the newly 
           stolen flamingo into the glove compartment, then climbs 
           out and heads for the house, limping on his injured leg.

           Tim rings the doorbell. A moment later, Laurie opens the 
           door.

                                 LAURIE
                        Tim, hi... how are you?

           She doesn’t wait for his answer, just immediately puts 
           her arms around him.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s so good to see you. 

                                 TIM
                                 (carefully)
                        Good to see you, Laurie.

           An awkward beat, as Tim tries to gauge if she knows 
           anything about his earlier run-in with Joy.

                                 LAURIE
                                 (confused)
                        Are you here for George? Because 
                        he’s still down at the Club...

                                 TIM
                        No. Actually... I’m here to see 
                        Joy. 

                                 LAURIE
                        Joy? 

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I was in the neighborhood, 
                        so I figured I’d stop in, say hi. 
                        Is she around?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LAURIE
                        Sure, Joy will be thrilled to see 
                        you. She just got home. (beat) 
                        She’s out back with her camera. 
                        You can just cut through the 
                        house...

           Laurie motions for a relieved Tim to follow her inside... 

           INT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As Tim steps into the house...

                                 LAURIE
                        I’d join you guys, but I’m on 
                        deadline for this article I’m 
                        freelancing. Confining myself to 
                        my office...

                                 TIM
                        Oh, right... the Yoga Journal 
                        piece. Sounds interesting. George 
                        told me about it on the way to the 
                        orgy...

           Laurie looks at Tim for a long beat, then...

                                 LAURIE
                        Yeah... so, anyway, I’ll be busy 
                        writing. 

                                 TIM
                        No problem, Laurie. Good luck with 
                        it.

           Then, as he heads for the back door, Laurie notices 
           something...

                                 LAURIE
                        Tim? Are you limping?

           Tim nods without turning around.

                                 TIM
                        Yes I am. And bleeding.

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim descends the stairs and enters the WOODS that 
           surround George and Laurie’s hillside home.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        Joy? Are you out here? It’s Uncle 
                        Tim.

                                 JOY (O.C.)
                        I’m down here...

           Tim makes his way through the trees, down to a little 
           CREEK BED, where he sees Joy with her camera, quietly 
           snapping photos of leaves, trees, clouds, and twigs 
           floating in the creek. He sits down on a fallen log and 
           watches her for a beat, then...

                                 TIM
                        What are you doing?

                                 JOY
                        Project for my photography class. 
                        We’re supposed to pick a theme 
                        first, then take the photos, but 
                        I’m kind of doing it backwards...

           Tim nods, as she turns and SNAPS a photo of him.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                                 (smiling)
                        Don’t worry, I won’t include that 
                        one in the project.

                                 TIM
                        Thanks. (beat) Look, about our 
                        little run-in today...

           Joy shrugs, no big deal.

                                 JOY
                        I was just down there with a 
                        friend from school. Her mom 
                        brought us. Don’t worry, I didn’t 
                        tell them I knew you. They just 
                        thought you were some guy... 
                        running with a flamingo. And being 
                        chased.

           The accuracy, and strangeness, of that description just 
           hangs there...

                                 TIM
                                 (carefully)
                        Did you tell your mom?

           Joy is almost offended at the suggestion.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JOY
                        Uncle Tim...

                                 TIM
                                 (relieved)
                        Right... well, I guess I should 
                        probably explain it to you.

                                 JOY
                                 (sincerely)
                        You don’t have to. I know you’re 
                        going through something.

           Tim nods and they share a gentle smile, as Joy takes a 
           seat next to him on the log.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        My dad told me you moved to a 
                        houseboat.

                                 TIM
                        It’s true, I did. (beat) They say 
                        a change of setting can be good.

                                 JOY
                        Is it?

                                 TIM
                        Sometimes. When I forget.

                                 JOY
                        Do you forget a lot?

           Tim can only shrug - how does he explain? Then...

                                 TIM
                                 (thoughtfully)
                        What do you think about flamingos, 
                        Joy?

                                 JOY
                        Flamingos? Never really given them 
                        much thought. I know they’re pink. 
                        Like to stand on one leg.

           Tim nods...

                                 TIM
                        You know, they do it to conserve 
                        body heat, so only one leg has to 
                        be in the water at a time. 
                        Scientists just figured that out 
                        recently.

                        (beat) And flamingos are the only 
                        birds to eat with their heads 
                        upside down. I’ve tried that, by 
                        the way. Very difficult.

                                 JOY
                        You’ve tried eating with your head 
                        upside down?

           Tim pauses, realizing how strange that must sound.

                                 TIM
                        Flamingos have been kind of a big 
                        deal for me lately.

           Joy gives this thoughtful consideration, then...

                                 JOY
                        I used to eat my hair when I was 
                        young.

                                 TIM
                        You still are young.

                                 JOY
                        You know what I mean. (beat) It 
                        was a nervous thing, I guess. I 
                        used to have a lot of anxiety... 
                        would chew it off in big clumps. 
                        Drove my mom crazy.

                                 TIM
                        I bet it did.

           It’s a tender moment of shared understanding, then...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        See, the thing is... I’ve been 
                        holding all this inside and I 
                        think I would like to explain it 
                        to someone. (beat) Can I show you 
                        something?

           EXT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY 

           Tim walks with Joy to his car. She still has her camera 
           around her neck, as Tim opens the car, then the glove 
           compartment, and pulls out the newly stolen flamingo.

                                 TIM
                        What do you think?

                        I think it’s very pink. (beat, 
                        carefully) You stole this?

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding)
                        I have others. Also stolen.

                                 JOY
                        Really?

                                 TIM

                        No, I’m kidding. I don’t. (beat, 
                        regretting the dishonesty) 
                        Actually, I do.

                                 JOY
                        Wait, you do have others, or you 
                        don’t?

                                 TIM
                        I do. (beat) Lately they just seem 
                        to be popping up.

           Joy turns her thoughtful gaze from her uncle, back to the 
           bird. She’s not judging, just intrigued. Then, as Joy 
           sets the flamingo down on the ground and focusses her 
           camera to photograph it...

                                 JOY
                        I should probably have a stronger 
                        opinion about this.

                                 TIM
                        So should I. Although, I do think 
                        they might be here for a reason.

                                 JOY
                        Who? The flamingos?

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding)
                        It’s complicated, but there are 
                        theories that back me up.

           He watches her SNAP a couple of photos, then...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever heard of Carl Jung’s 
                        Principle of Synchronicity?

                        No...

           Just then, George’s car pulls onto the driveway. Joy 
           quickly grabs the flamingo and slips it under her shirt 
           before her father notices.

           Climbing out of his car...

                                 GEORGE
                        Timmy, hey... I didn’t know you 
                        were coming by. I just finished 18 
                        down at the Club.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, well, it was kind of a spur 
                        of the moment stop. I--

                                 GEORGE
                        By the way, I wasn’t playing with 
                        Derek Trotter. Just, you know, in 
                        case you were wondering...

                                 TIM
                        I wasn’t wondering.

                        I saw him, though. Son of a

                                 TIM
                        I thought you said he was a good 
                        guy.

                                 GEORGE
                        Relatively speaking, for a wife 
                        stealer. (beat) You know that smug

                        six-iron all day... birdied two

           Then, before George can drift too far into the private 
           hell of his tortuous golf game...

                        Dad, can I sleep over on Uncle

                        would be okay.

                                 GEORGE
                        What?

           Joy flashes Tim a look.

                                 TIM
                                 (covering)
                        Joy’s never seen the boat. I 
                        thought maybe she could spend the 
                        night.

                                 GEORGE

                        Right... okay, uh, that could be 
                        good. Let me talk to your mom and 
                        we’ll pack a bag. (beat) Is she 
                        still working on that article? 
                        Downward Dog as a metaphor for

                                 JOY
                        You know, Dad, some people say 
                        golf is a metaphor for life.

                                 GEORGE
                        With the way I’m playing? God, I 
                        hope not.

           As George moves for the house, as Joy hangs back for a 
           beat. Handing the stolen flamingo back to Tim.

                                 JOY

           OFF his smile, we MOVE TO...

           EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

           Tim leads Joy down the dock. He carries her OVERNIGHT BAG 
           in one hand, in the other the stolen flamingo, which he’s 
           covered with his jacket. 

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           Tim opens up the front door...

                                 TIM
                        Alright, here we are...

           Joy follows him, taking in the maritime-themed decor.

                                 JOY
                        I like it. Very nautical.

                                 TIM
                        I know you’re just saying that, 
                        but thank you. The furniture came 
                        when I rented it.

           Tim leads her down the hall and flips on the lights in an 
           empty bedroom.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        This can be your room. Not much 
                        here, but we can get some pillows 
                        and blankets and fix a bed. Or, I 
                        can make up the couch...

           Joy smiles as she sets her bag down.

                                 JOY
                        No, no. This room’s fine.

           Returning the smile, Tim pulls the towel from the 
           flamingo he’s still holding in his hand.

                                 TIM
                        Okay, ready to see the others?

                                 JOY
                        Ready.
           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - FLAMINGO ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens into the pitch black room. Tim flips on 
           the lights and Joy’s eyes widen, as she takes in the 
           flock, which now includes Tim’s latest thefts - the 
           TOOTHPICK HOLDER, the FLAMINGO PEN, the ANTENNAE FLAMINGO 
           and the bus stop POSTER. 

                                 JOY

                                 TIM
                        You could say that...

           Tim places the Stinson Beach flamingo in with the others, 
           then points to the birds he stole from Stella and Derek.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        These were my first two. I took 
                        them from Derek and Stella’s front 
                        lawn... I call them Uno and Dos. 
                        (beat, re: the flamingo mug) This 
                        was my third, I got him from my

                                 JOY
                        And you call him Tres...

                                 TIM
                        No. I only named the first two. I 
                        don’t know why... 

           Tim places his latest theft in with the others, then 
           steps back.

                                 JOY
                        They look like a family.

                                 (nodding)
                        I thought the same thing. (beat) 
                        So you don’t think this is crazy?

           Joy shrugs.

                                 JOY
                        I’m 12. My feelings on crazy 
                        aren’t fully formed yet. (beat) 
                        Isn’t that why you told me?

                                 TIM
                        No, I just thought you’d have the 
                        best chance of understanding.

           Honored to be chosen, Joy slips a comforting hand into 
           Tim’s.

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - KITCHEN - LATER

           Joy sits at the kitchen table, while Tim stands near the 
           stove making HOT CHOCOLATE.

                                 JOY
                        Okay, here’s one last question and 
                        then I’m with you... what if 
                        Stella and Derek had lawn gnomes? 
                        Would you have taken those?

                                 TIM
                        Why would I steal lawn gnomes?

                                 JOY
                        Why would you steal flamingos?

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know. They were just 
                        sitting out there, so out of 
                        place, so pink... I just couldn’t 
                        stop thinking about them.

                                 JOY
                        What if the lawn gnomes were pink?

                                 TIM
                        But, lawn gnomes aren’t pink.

           The hot chocolate is ready. Tim comes to the table with 
           two MUGS. Taking a seat across from Joy.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Look, here’s the thing - were 
                        those first two birds a petty 
                        attempt to lash out at Stella and 
                        Derek? Partially, maybe. 

                                 JOY
                        But, then, when the other 
                        flamingos started popping up... 

                                 TIM
                        It occurred to me something larger 
                        might be happening.

                                 JOY
                                 (trying to follow)
                        The Principal of Synchronicity...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        Exactly. The hidden connection 
                        linking separate events. A greater 
                        meaning...

                                 JOY
                        But, why flamingos? Why you?

                                 TIM
                        That’s what we need to figure out. 
                        (beat) Luckily, I have some 
                        books...

           With that, Tim reaches back to the bookshelf and takes 
           down several REFERENCE BOOKS from National Geographic and 
           The Audubon Society...

           MONTAGE:

           We DISSOLVE THROUGH a series of images, alternating 
           between shots of Tim and Joy reading to one another, 
           exchanging facts about flamingos and shots from the pages 
           of the books - photographs of flamingos, drawings of 
           flamingos, flamingo eggs, flamingo babies, flamingos in 
           flight, flamingos at rest.

           All while hearing...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        That night we learned everything 
                        we could about the flamingo - the 
                        six different species, their 
                        locations, life spans, migration 
                        patterns, nesting habits, mating 
                        rituals. We discovered that 
                        flamingos are actually born white 
                        and it’s the pigment in their diet 
                        that turns them pink. And, we 
                        learned that the flamingo has no 
                        natural defenses, safety in 
                        numbers is its only protection. 

           We see an IMAGE of a large flock of flamingos, bravely 
           standing together in a marshy lagoon, as crocodiles and 
           hippos roam the banks.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. WATER - MORNING

           We move slowly across the marshy low tide line, right at 
           water level. At first you might even think this was a 
           flamingo pond... 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        It was hard to comprehend such an 
                        animal, standing defenseless on 
                        one leg, every day growing 
                        brighter, more pink, unyielding to 
                        the dangers in the world around 
                        it. To me, it seemed insane...

           REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Tim, who has waded out into the 
           water of the bay. He is standing on one leg, the rows of 
           docked houseboats behind him.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        But, Joy saw it differently. She 
                        called it fortitude.

           The RINGING of a BELL calls Tim to turn back towards his 
           houseboat. Joy is ringing the SHIP’S BELL on his porch. 

                                 JOY
                        Uncle Tim, my dad’s here...

           Tim waves to George, who stands near Joy on the porch, 
           then makes his way back to the boat.

           EXT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - DAY

           Tim sloshes through the mud, then climbs up the steps to 
           the houseboat, where Joy stands with her father. George 
           has a NEWSPAPER tucked under his arm. 

                                 GEORGE
                        What the hell were you doing out 
                        there?

                                 TIM
                        I was wading. I’ve seen the 
                        neighbors do it. Figured I’d give 
                        it a try...

           As Tim hoses his feet off, George glances to the 
           neighboring boats, the only neighbor visible is Olaf, who 
           quietly reads the paper on his boat’s porch. As Olaf 
           waves...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (to George)
                        Thanks for letting Joy stay last 
                        night. It was fun.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GEORGE
                        Anytime. Happy to do it. (beat, to 
                        Joy) Did you hear the Humming 
                        Toadfish, Princess?

                                 JOY
                                 (nodding)
                        All night.

           George bends down to pick up Joy’s bag, then...

                                 GEORGE
                        You know, Tim... I’ve been 
                        debating whether or not to say 
                        anything to you, but... Stella is 
                        having an art opening at a gallery 
                        in Mill Valley Wednesday night. I 
                        know the owner, so... I got an 
                        invite. (beat) You’d mentioned you 
                        should have paid more attention to 
                        her painting, I don’t know... but, 
                        if you want, you and I could go. 

           Tim exchanges a look with Joy, who shrugs, unsure...

                                 TIM
                        Can I think about it?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure. Let me know. 

           George puts his arm around Joy...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Joy, you ready to go? (beat, 
                        to Tim) Oh, by the way... here’s 
                        your paper. I picked it up on the 
                        dock...

           George hands Tim the newspaper he had tucked under his 
           arm. It’s the local paper, THE MARIN INDEPENDENT JOURNAL.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Be careful, there’s a flamingo 
                        thief on the loose...

                                 TIM
                        What?

           Tim and Joy exchange a quick look of alarm.

                                 GEORGE
                        Check it out, front page...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Tim opens the paper, in the lower left corner a headline 
           reads - FLAMINGO THIEF STRIKES STINSON SHOP.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                                 (to Joy, explaining)
                        Apparently, this guy goes into a 
                        store, grabs a 12-inch flamingo 
                        right off the shelf, and runs out. 
                        The clerk chases him all over town 
                        and the whole time the guy is 
                        holding the bird aloft and 
                        hooting.

                                 TIM
                        Holding it aloft and hooting... 
                        the whole time? That sounds like 
                        an exaggeration. (beat, off a look 
                        from Joy) I’m just saying... it 
                        would be hard to run like that, 
                        wouldn’t it?

                                 JOY
                        It does sound a little far-
                        fetched, Dad.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe... I don’t know, I’m just 
                        telling you what I read. Funny 
                        story. And it makes you think... 
                        of all things, why steal a 
                        flamingo? 

           Then, George just shrugs... he’s a doer, not a thinker. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Princess, what do you say we 
                        hit the record store on the way 
                        home, pick up some Grateful Dead 
                        bootlegs.

                                 JOY
                        Please say we won’t...

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh, come on, you love extended 
                        jams.

           Joy shakes her head - no she doesn’t. Then turns to her 
           uncle...

                                 JOY
                        See you later, Uncle Tim. I’m 
                        really glad we did this.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Joy and Tim share a warm hug.

                                 TIM
                                 (sincerely)
                        Me too. And next time, I’ll have 
                        the room fixed up for you.

           As Joy and George step off the boat and onto the dock...

                                 GEORGE
                        See you later, Timmy. Hang in 
                        there.

                                 TIM
                        Will do, George.

           A final wave, then George and Joy head up the dock and 
           Tim turns back to the newspaper. 

           Sinking as he scans the article, he glances to Olaf, 
           still sitting on his deck, reading the exact same paper. 
           Tim looks very worried...

           ... when a passing SAILBOAT suddenly catches his eye. The 
           name on the boat - FORTITUDE. Tim stares in awe - 3 
           months ago, he wouldn’t have believed it, but now...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Even a blind man could see where 
                        this was going. Joy, the 
                        flamingos, the rushes of 
                        adrenaline, and the Principle of 
                        Synchronicity - they were all 
                        leading me to the same place...

           Tim quickly turns and steps back onto the dock, calling 
           out after George...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        George, hey... you know what? 
                        Maybe I will go to that gallery 
                        opening.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (surprised)
                        You sure?

                                 TIM
                        Definitely. I’ll pick you up.

           With that, Tim steps confidently back onto his houseboat, 
           looking back to the bay and the passing boat - FORTITUDE.
           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - FLAMINGO ROOM - NIGHT

           As Tim adjusts a few of his flamingos...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        That night, I thought about Stella 
                        and the way our bodies would 
                        always return to one another...

           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - 2 YEARS AGO - 
           NIGHT

           Tim and Stella lie in bed, carefully kissing and touching 
           one another like two people making their way blindfolded 
           through a room of strange furniture.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Even after weeks, sometimes 
                        months, of scheduling obstacles, 
                        work conflicts and disparate 
                        sleeping habits... we would 
                        eventually make our way back in 
                        blissful reunion.

                                 STELLA
                        Ow.

                                 TIM
                        I know, I’m sorry. It’s an awkward 
                        angle...

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. TIM AND STELLA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim is on top of Stella, his head next to hers on the 
           pillow, angled awkwardly, like a swimmer drawing a 
           breath. His eyes squeezed shut, he makes soft GRUNTS with 
           each thrust of his body.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        She was so unselfish in bed - 
                        quiet, gentle, never requiring her 
                        own orgasm...

           Underneath him, Stella stares blankly at the ceiling...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The missionary position was our 
                        favorite.

           CONTINUED:

           We hear the classic fuzz guitar intro to George 
           Harrison’s WHAT IS LIFE and MOVE TO...

           INT. TIM’S CAR - DAY 

           Tim drives his car to work, singing merrily along with 
           the song - one of the most cheery and upbeat songs of 
           romantic longing ever recorded.

                                 TIM
                        Tell me what is my life without 
                        your love? Tell me who am I, 
                        without you by my side? 

           Tim’s singing trails off, as he turns to see a bus stop 
           bench with a REAL ESTATE AD and the handsome, smiling 
           face of the REALTOR, DEREK TROTTER. Tim’s face falls...

           Just then, a car HONKS, causing Tim to turn and see - a 
           bright pink VW square back with a personalized license 
           frame - FLAMNGO.

           Spirits buoyed, we see Tim smile and resume his singing, 
           while we hear...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny, the way life works, 
                        when you can finally see what it’s 
                        trying to show you...

           INT. LAW FIRM - DAY

           Tim sits at a conference table, surrounded by other 
           lawyers. He gets a TEXT MESSAGE on his phone. It’s from 
           Joy - “You’re right, they really do keep popping up.” 
           She’s attached a photo of a FLAMINGO on the back of a 
           woman’s T-shirt.  

           Tim smiles and we MOVE TO...

           INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - SAN ANSELMO - DAY 

           An old farm house, now converted into a store, the shop 
           is filled with rare and eclectic furniture pieces - a 
           testament to good taste and a keen eye for quality.

           Tim stands in the middle of the store, staring mesmerized 
           at a GLASS VASE with several PINK FLAMINGOS painted on 
           it. The vase is perched on a high shelf.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Are you him?

           Startled, Tim turns to see MARIE, the attractive owner of 
           the shop.

                                 TIM
                        Am I who?

                                 MARIE
                        The Flamingo Thief. (beat) Don’t 
                        you read the paper? Crazy story...

                                 TIM
                        Oh, right... I did see something 
                        about that. Weird, huh? (beat, 
                        quickly) Anyway, I’m actually 
                        looking for some furniture for my 
                        niece. I’m fixing up the guest 
                        bedroom on my houseboat for her 
                        and I was hoping to find something 
                        nice. She’s 12.

           Marie smiles warmly.

                                 MARIE
                        I have a few things that might 
                        work, let me take a look in back. 
                        Do you mind waiting?

                                 TIM
                        No, I’ve got time.

           Tim watches her retreat to the back of the store, taking 
           in the gentle flow of hair cascading over her shoulders 
           and the soft rippling of the loose folds of her skirt. 
           Then, as soon as she is gone, he looks back to the 
           flamingo vase. We HOLD ON his focussed gaze, then...

           INT. ANTIQUES STORE - MINUTES LATER

           Marie comes from the back of the store, carrying an oval 
           MIRROR with a MOTHER OF PEARL in lay. She smiles...

                                 MARIE
                        You’re still here.

           Tim stands in the middle of one of the aisles, idly 
           looking at a small music box.

                                 TIM
                        Were you testing me?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARIE
                                 (coyly)
                        I might have been. (beat) So, do 
                        you think your niece would like 
                        this?  

           Tim studies the mirror, running his fingers over the 
           shining mother of pearl. It’s beautiful.

                                 TIM
                        She’ll love it.

           Moved by the care with which Tim studies the mirror...

                                 MARIE
                                 (gently)
                        I’m Marie, by the way. And I think 
                        I’ve got a few more pieces she 
                        might enjoy--

                                 TIM
                                 (smiling)
                        I’ll take everything.

           Marie is surprised, but Tim seems like a man who knows 
           what he wants...

           EXT. ANTIQUES STORE - LATER

           Marie helps Tim load the Audi with several items of 
           furniture, including a DRESSER, BEDSIDE TABLE, a CHAIR 
           and the MIRROR. Each item is completely charming and 
           totally unique... and the Audi can barely fit everything. 
           The dresser and chair are tied to the roof, the bedside 
           table lashed inside the trunk, which is unable to close.

           As Marie helps Tim tighten the ropes around the 
           dresser...

                                 MARIE
                        These are lovely pieces. Your 
                        niece is a lucky girl.

                                 TIM
                        One of the best people I know. 
                        (beat) My wife and I separated a 
                        few months back. Joy’s been very 
                        sweet.

                                 MARIE
                        I’m sorry to hear that... about 
                        your wife I mean. (beat, offering) 
                        I was divorced two years ago.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Her glow momentarily dims, reflecting on bygone pain.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                                 (thoughtfully)
                        You know, in a way... it’s a form 
                        of death. And you have to go 
                        through the same stages of grief.

           Tim considers her theory, then...

                                 TIM
                        Fortitude.

                                 MARIE
                                 (nodding, impressed)
                        That certainly helps, yes.

           Marie gives a gentle smile, suggesting a beat of 
           connection... but one of them still has more to travel.

                                 TIM
                        The universe has a way of giving 
                        us the answers we need. (beat) 
                        Stay strong, Marie... you’ll find 
                        yours.

                                 MARIE
                                 (surprised)
                        Oh, I wasn’t meaning me. I was 
                        talking about y...

           She doesn’t finish, as Tim is already waving goodbye and 
           climbing into his car. All she can do is return the wave 
           and offer a warm smile...

           As Tim drives off in the overloaded Audi...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I remember thinking how nice 
                        Marie’s smile was and hoped she’d 
                        find happiness one day. (beat) 
                        But, we each have our own journey 
                        in life... and I couldn’t worry 
                        about that now.

           PULL BACK so in one shot we can see Tim’s disappearing 
           car and Marie watching him for a thoughtful, concerned 
           beat, then turning and heading back to her store.

           The CLINKING of GLASSES and the HUM of CONVERSATION takes 
           us to...
           INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT 

           The well-dressed crowd MINGLES with the excitement of 
           opening night. The energy in the room signals Stella’s 
           first showing is quite a success.

           Tim and George enter, Tim wearing one of his typical gray 
           suits, George in a sweater and slacks. Tim surveys the 
           crowd, as George grabs two glasses of champagne from a 
           passing waiter.

                                 TIM
                        I’m glad we’re doing this, George. 
                        I don’t want to put too much 
                        pressure on the night, it’s just a 
                        start, but I think Stella will see 
                        how I’ve changed. The break has 
                        done us good...

                                 GEORGE
                        Right. But, be cool, okay? You’ve 
                        been talking a mile a minute since 
                        you picked me up. It makes me 
                        worried when you get like this.

                                 TIM
                        But, I never get like this. This 
                        is the new me.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s what worries me. Be cool.

           But, Tim, already scanning the crowd, isn’t listening.

                                 TIM
                        Where is she? Do you see Stella?

           George grabs an hors d’ouvres from a passing waiter, then 
           glances around the gallery. We see him react to 
           something, then, as his eyes move across the room, grow 
           increasingly ALARMED.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (urgently)
                        Tim, we need to get out of here.

                                 TIM
                        What?

                                 GEORGE
                        Let’s go. Now.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Just then, Tim sees Stella standing with a group of well-
           wishers. Tim waves...

                                 TIM
                                 (brightly)
                        Stella...

           Stella reacts with surprise, then concern, at seeing Tim.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come on, Tim. Leave...

                                 TIM
                        Why? We just got here. Stella is--

                                 GEORGE
                        The paintings, Tim. The fucking 
                        paintings. This was a mistake...

           George grabs Tim’s arm, pulling him towards the door, but 
           Tim is now, for the first time, noticing the artwork...

           ...which is a series of SELF PORTRAITS of Stella - half 
           of them gray and morose, showing a woman alone, in empty 
           rooms and deep sadness, like the work of Edward Hopper 
           only more visceral. The other half show a woman reborn, 
           raw, sexual, bursting with color and the occasional form 
           of a male lover. It’s incredible work, suggest the two 
           lives of Stella, one dead and one alive...

           As Tim’s eyes dart back and forth, we see the paintings 
           in faster and faster cuts. Dazed, he takes an unsteady 
           step...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Tim...

           Tim looks over at Stella, who watches from across the 
           room with compassionate eyes. Coming in to stand at 
           Stella’s side, an oblivious Derek Trotter flashes a smile 
           and puts his arm around her.

           EXT. GALLERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Tim bursts through the gallery doors and VOMITS in the 
           parking lot. George hurries out there after him...

                                 GEORGE
                        What the fuck was that in there? 
                        Who paints that kind of shit? 
                        Depressing, then sexy... that’s 
                        not art.

           CONTINUED:

           Still hunched over, Tim tries to catch his breath.

                                 TIM
                        I’m such an idiot. What was I 
                        thinking? I thought tonight would 
                        be good for us...

                                 GEORGE
                        You never saw her paintings?

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know. Some of the stuff is 
                        new. The other stuff... I guess I 
                        never looked that closely, it was 
                        a lot of gray colors, women 
                        sitting around in shadows... I’m 
                        not an art guy, okay?

           Tim uses a handkerchief to wipe his mouth, George looks 
           up and sees Stella approaching.

                                 STELLA
                                 (carefully)
                        Hi, George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Stella...

           Tim turns to see her.

                                 TIM
                        Hello.

                                 STELLA
                        Hi, Tim. (beat, to George) Do you 
                        think Tim and I could have a 
                        moment?

           George glances and Tim, who nods...

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure. Why don’t I go and grab 
                        another drink...

           As he passes Stella.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                                 (softly)
                        Powerful work in there. Very 
                        moving.

           As George exits, there is an awkward pause, then...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TIM
                                 (lamely)
                        Crowd seems to be enjoying your 
                        paintings. Feels like a major 
                        triumph...

                                 STELLA
                        I’m so sorry you had to see them 
                        like this, Tim. I had no idea 
                        you’d be here.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah... it was kind of a spur of 
                        the moment decision. I’ve been 
                        making a lot of those lately. 
                        (beat) So, those paintings, the 
                        sad ones... that was you when we 
                        were together? (beat, off her nod) 
                        I had no idea...

                                 STELLA
                                 (gently)
                        For a long time, neither did I. 

           Tim shakes his head, tears running down his face...

                                 TIM
                        I should have been more aware... I 
                        understand that now. But, I 
                        couldn’t see. And I thought maybe 
                        if I came tonight, saw your 
                        work... and you saw me, maybe...

           He trails off, realizing the stupidity, then cuts to the 
           heart of it.

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        When did you stop loving me, 
                        Stella?

           All she can do is shake her head and open her arms to 
           him, as he buries his head in her shoulder...

                                 STELLA
                        It wasn’t you, Tim. I just stopped 
                        loving us.

           Tim nods, clinging to her, showing more emotion than he 
           ever showed the night she left him. And her gentleness 
           shows she harbors no bitterness and remembers that there 
           had once been goodness between them. A sweet moment, 
           until...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           ...Tim tries to kiss her. Stella immediately pulls 
           back...

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        Tim, don’t.

           Awkward. Any warmth has immediately slipped away.

                                 TIM
                        Is this because I just threw up? 
                        Or do you really have no interest 
                        in kissing me again?

           Stella looks at him for a sympathetic beat, then, placing 
           a hand on her stomach...

                                 STELLA
                        I’m pregnant, Tim.

           As the blood drains from Tim’s face, we MOVE TO...

           INT. TIM’S CAR - NIGHT 

           Tim drives in devastated silence. George is next to him.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (stunned)
                        Pregnant... wow. (beat) Do we know 
                        it’s not yours?

                                 TIM
                                 (broken)
                        Do the math, George.

           George can only shake his head...

                                 GEORGE
                        The spawn of Derek Trotter. (beat, 
                        bitter) You should have seen him 
                        in there, going on about Stella’s 
                        use of light and her 
                        “Rembrandtian” overtones. Club 
                        Champion, realtor, patron of the 
                        arts, father-to-be... he’s a 
                        goddamn renaissance man.   

                                 TIM
                        I think I’m going to throw up 
                        again.

           George quickly turns on the air conditioning...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay, okay... let’s just get some 
                        air going. You’ll be fine. Just 
                        breathe... keep breathing...

           Tim draws some deep breaths, it seems to help a bit. 
           George’s thoughts drift to other matters...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                                 (absent-mindedly)
                        I think the Flamingo Thief’s a 
                        swinger.

           This gets Tim’s attention...

                                 TIM
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GEORGE
                        Remember the guy from the paper? 
                        The Flamingo Thief?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, yeah... I remember.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, it’s funny, because the 
                        other day, the orgy hosts sent out 
                        a group email - apparently a 
                        flamingo was stolen from the house 
                        during one of the events.

                                 TIM
                        Do they know when?

                                 GEORGE
                        They’re not sure. There’s been 8 
                        events this month and... somewhere 
                        in that time, 4 pairs of high 
                        heels were left behind, one 
                        Stanford g-string, a used condom 
                        was stuck in their freezer and 
                        somebody made off with a porcelain 
                        flamingo.

                                 TIM
                        That’s disgusting.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t think it was worth very 
                        much, but, apparently, there was 
                        some sentimental value...

                                 GEORGE
                                 (as if considering 
                                 for the first time)
                        Yeah... that is gross. We live in 
                        messed up times. (beat, 
                        thoughtfully) Flamingos. At least 
                        the guy knows what he wants, you 
                        know? 

           Tim studies his brother...

                                 TIM
                                 (carefully)
                        What are you getting at, George?

           George shrugs with confusion.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who knows? I’m a 47 year old man 
                        who enjoys watching other people 
                        have sex... I could be getting at 
                        anything.

           George pauses for a heavy beat, then...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                                 (unloading)
                        Laurie has no idea about the 
                        swinger parties.

                                 TIM
                        What?!

                                 GEORGE
                        I lied before, I’ve never 
                        discussed it with her.

                        Oh, Jesus... George.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know. See what I mean? It’s a 
                        messed up world - freezer condoms, 
                        flamingo thieves, orgies. (beat) I 
                        haven’t been back since, FYI, but 
                        I figured I’d better come clean 
                        with you... at least so you won’t 
                        say anything to Laurie.

           Tim smacks the steering wheel.

                        Goddamnit, George. I already did 
                        tell her.

                                 GEORGE
                        What?! How did she react?!

                                 TIM
                        She had no reaction. And I didn’t 
                        think anything of it. Because I 
                        assumed she knew!

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh, God... no reaction?! See how 
                        cold she is? She’s internalizing 
                        it... she internalizes everything!

                                 TIM
                        You told me she wasn’t sexual and 
                        the two of you had an agreement! 

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, she’s not sexual... and we 
                        do have an agreement. It’s just a 
                        different agreement than me being 
                        allowed to go to orgies. More like 
                        the opposite of that agreement. 

           Then, as Tim turns onto George’s driveway...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, in my defense, I never 
                        touched anyone. I’m a watcher, not 
                        a toucher. You know that...

           Tim brings the car to a stop and rests his head on the 
           steering wheel...

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know anything, George. 
                        Just please... get out of the car.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fine, fine... I’m getting out. I 
                        thought I’d get a little 
                        understanding from you. But, 
                        apparently, that’s not going to be 
                        the case tonight.

           With that, George exits the car and starts for the house. 
           Tim quickly rolls the window down...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (4)

                                 TIM
                        Flamingos mate for life, George. 
                        Did you know that?! They mate for 
                        life!

                                 GEORGE
                        What?

           But, the distraught Tim is already backing off the 
           driveway, and the ROAR of the engine taking us to...

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Tim’s Audi races along the winding highway.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        It was like everything had 
                        suddenly caved in on me...

           INT. TIM’S CAR - SAME TIME

           Tim’s drained face stares blankly ahead as he drives. 

                                 TIM
                        ...and I could only think of one 
                        thing. (beat) Well, that’s not 
                        true. I did have a slight pang of 
                        guilt...

           EXT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY 

           A shot of Marie, from the day Tim visited her store. She 
           stands smiling at him, the Marin County sun matching her 
           glow, as she brushes a strand of hair from her face.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        ...and a quick vision of Marie and 
                        her smile.

           INT. TIM’S CAR - NIGHT 

           Tim squeezes his eyes shut, erasing the unwanted vision. 

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        But, the fact is, this had nothing 
                        to do with her...
           EXT. ANTIQUE STORE - NIGHT 

           Tim’s empty car is parked in front of Marie’s store. For 
           a beat, there is no sign of life in the darkened store - 
           then a side window SLIDES OPEN and Tim crawls out 
           clutching the glass vase with the flamingo painted on it - 
           the same one he’d been staring at days earlier.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I just really needed that 
                        flamingo.

           Tim runs to his car and drives off into the night.

           INT. OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Tim walks down the hallway, carrying a folder of 
           documents, a notepad and an open magazine.

           CLOSE ON the magazine - we see it’s the same one Tim was 
           reading weeks earlier in the restaurant, the profile of 
           wine critic Charles Angley.

           Tim studies the photo displaying Angley’s 5 FOOT TALL 
           FLAMINGO, as he opens a door to a dark conference room...

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Tim steps into the room and flips on the light - and is 
           STARTLED by the sight of Art Pettis, seated at the head 
           of the conference table.

                                 TIM
                        Whoa, Art... didn’t know you were 
                        in here.

                                 PETTIS
                        Just enjoying the darkness. And 
                        the solitude.

                                 TIM
                        Right... I guess I’m a little 
                        early for our department meeting, 
                        why don’t I give you your time...

           Tim reaches for the lights, ready to exit...

                                 PETTIS
                        No, no... you’re here. Sit. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Damn. Tim carefully takes a seat at the other end of the 
           long conference table. Pettis pauses for a long, dramatic 
           beat, then...

                                 PETTIS (CONT’D)
                        Pride is a fascinating thing, 
                        isn’t it, Tim? The way it drives a 
                        man, leads him to cross oceans, 
                        build empires... but, can it also 
                        be a curse? His undoing?

           Tim has no idea where this is going.

                                 TIM
                        I’m not sure, Art. Not much of an 
                        authority on pride at the moment.

           Pettis studies him for a thoughtful moment.

                                 PETTIS
                        A man needs to look inside 
                        himself. (beat, more insistent) We 
                        all do things. Things are done to 
                        us and we do things... but what is 
                        the statute of limitations on a 
                        man’s pain?

                                 TIM
                        I’m... not sure I’m following. 
                        (beat) Are you talking about my 
                        pain?

           Pettis doesn’t respond and instead rises from his seat.

                                 PETTIS
                                 (thoughtfully)
                        At the end of the day, we’re just 
                        men. Nothing more, nothing less.

           As Pettis heads for the door, Tim’s mind spins, then...

                                 TIM
                                 (cautiously)
                        Art... is there a reason you’re 
                        telling me this?

           Pettis pauses to put a hand on Tim’s shoulder. He lingers 
           for an uncomfortable beat, then exits the conference 
           room. Tim can only stare after him... flabbergasted. 
           Then, as Tim’s gaze drifts back to the magazine and the 5 
           FOOT FLAMINGO...

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        The following day, the San 
                        Francisco Chronicle ran two 
                        articles of interest...

           And we CUT TO...

           INSERT SHOT - The San Francisco Chronicle Arts Section.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The first was an Arts review 
                        hailing the stunning debut gallery 
                        showing of painter Stella 
                        Moriarty. She used her maiden 
                        name.

           CLOSE ON - The newspaper’s photographs of two of Stella’s 
           paintings. One shows an isolated, lonely woman. The 
           other, a woman reborn... sensual, passionate, alive and 
           naked. Both are self-portraits.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Her use of light and the emotion 
                        in her work, the product of a 
                        dying marriage, was hailed as a 
                        major triumph.

           INSERT SHOT - The San Francisco Chronicle, now turned to 
           another page, where a headline reads “Flamingo Thief 
           Strikes Stinson Beach”.

                        On page 19, they ran a story 
                        they’d picked up from The Marin 
                        Independent Journal. (beat) One 
                        marriage, two stories.

           INT. YOGA JOURNAL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           A group of women, and a few new-agey men, stand around a 
           group of desks, applauding as a FEMALE EDITOR proudly 
           holds up a copy of the new issue - it’s opened to 
           Laurie’s article “Downward Dog: A Metaphor For Life”. 

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Laurie’s article also appeared in 
                        Yoga Journal that week.

           A beaming Laurie stands next to the female Editor. 
           CHAMPAGNE bottles pop, celebratory glasses are poured...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Apparently, it was very well 
                        received in the yoga community.

           LATER

           The group is smaller now. Just Laurie, the female Editor 
           and about six others, but they are still celebrating. 
           They’ve now switched to WINE. A younger man and woman 
           share a JOINT.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        And toasted repeatedly at Yoga 
                        Journal Headquarters.

           LATER

           It’s just Laurie and the female Editor now. They stand 
           very closely, as the Editor pours Laurie another glass, 
           then leans in and kisses Laurie on the lips. At first 
           it’s tentative, Laurie tries to stop it, then relents as 
           the kiss grows deeper.

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Later, Laurie would claim it was a 
                        desperate response to George’s 
                        orgies. Which George claims were a 
                        desperate response to the state of 
                        their relationship.

           Finally, Laurie pulls away from the kiss and steps back. 
           She’s flushed, panting, confused...

           EXT. CHARLES ANGLEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Standing in a wooded grove at the end of a gravel drive, 
           the dimly lit home is a beautiful modernist take on a 
           traditional Sonoma farmhouse.

           Tim stands next to the house, slowly sliding a window 
           open. As Tim starts to climb through, we...

           ANGLE ON a view into the house, where we see a 5 FOOT 
           TALL FLAMINGO standing in the middle of the room. It’s 
           the same flamingo from the magazine profile of wine 
           critic Charles Angley. This is his house.
           EXT. DOCK - LATER THAT NIGHT

           It’s dark. The only sounds are the gentle creaking of the 
           docks, the soft DRONE of the Humming Toad Fish and Tim’s 
           footsteps, as he carries a large object covered by a 
           blanket towards his boat. He strains under its weight.

                                 OLAF (O.C.)
                        Ahoy, neighbor...

           Tim looks like he’s about to have a heart attack.

                                 TIM
                                 (startled)
                        Olaf, hi...

           Awkward silence. Olaf puffs on a pipe, watching Tim 
           struggle with the weight of his hidden object. Finally...

                                 OLAF
                        You know, the houseboating 
                        community believes an individual’s 
                        right to privacy is sacrosanct. 
                        (beat) I just need to know that’s 
                        not a human body under there.

                                 TIM
                        It’s not a body.

           Olaf nods, satisfied.

                                 OLAF
                        Have a good night.

           With that, Olaf returns to the shadows of his darkened 
           houseboat. Relieved, Tim continues down the dock.

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens and Tim lugs the covered object inside. He 
           pauses for a beat, then pulls the blanket off, 
           revealing... 

           ...the FIVE FOOT TALL FLAMINGO. The bird’s varnished, 
           pink paint glows with an alabaster smoothness. 

           It’s a remarkable flamingo and Tim stares at it in awe, 
           the familiar SMILE crossing his face...

                                 PETTIS (O.C.)
                        Oh, dammit! Dammit all to hell!
           INT. OFFICE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Tim and a few shocked co-workers stare into Pettis’s 
           office as their head partner swipes his forearm across 
           his desk, sending papers and pens and documents flying.

           Pettis notices everyone staring at him and quickly goes 
           to the window, snapping the shade closed.

           As his co-workers disperse, Tim catches the eye of 
           Pettis’s secretary, Cathy.

                                 TIM
                        Is he alright?

                                 CATHY
                                 (troubled)
                        He’s been like this ever since his 
                        mug went missing. (beat, 
                        clarifying) It was a gift from his 
                        grandson.

                                 TIM
                        Oh...

                                 CATHY
                                 (nodding)
                        Mr. Pettis and his son don’t 
                        speak, so he doesn’t see the boy. 
                        It’s a complicated web...

           He glances back at Pettis’s office, now obscured by the 
           drawn shade... but Tim seems to have a new understanding.

                                 TIM
                                 (softly)
                        What is the statute of limitations 
                        on a man’s pain?

                                 CATHY
                        Excuse me?

           But, Tim just shakes his head, as the RUMBLE of a Porsche 
           engine MOVES US TO...

           EXT. DOCKS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tim stands waiting as George pulls up. Joy sits next to 
           her father and Tim WAVES as she climbs out with her 
           overnight bag.

                        Hi, Uncle Tim...

                                 TIM
                        Hi, Joy.

           George looks out through the open driver side window.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thanks for doing this, Tim. I know 
                        it’s short notice, but she really 
                        wanted to come tonight. Change of 
                        scenery is probably good for her 
                        right now... 

           Tim nods with understanding.

                                 TIM
                        How are things with Laurie?

                                 GEORGE
                        Things are fucking messy, Tim. How 
                        do you think they are? I sleep on 
                        an air mattress in the garage.

                                 TIM
                        I’m sorry, George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ahh, it wasn’t your fault. You 
                        didn’t know...
                                 (beat, to Joy)
                        Have fun, Princess. Your mom will 
                        pick you up.

                                 JOY
                        Bye, Dad.

           Joy waves and we sense a touch of awkwardness between 
           father and daughter. Then, as George drives of, Tim turns 
           to his niece... 

                                 TIM
                                 (kindly)
                        How are you doing?

                                 JOY
                        Can we put a pin in that question?

                                 TIM
                                 (confused)
                        Okay...

                        Have you seen tonight’s news?

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

           Tim and Joy sit in front of the TV, watching a local news 
           report that is in mid-broadcast.

           ON THE SCREEN - A female REPORTER speaks into her 
           microphone. Next to her, Charles Angley (who we recognize 
           from the earlier magazine) holds a photo of the 5 foot  
           flamingo.

                                 REPORTER
                        Mr. Charles Angley, of 
                        Healdesburg, is the owner of the 
                        stolen flamingo and has offered a 
                        personal reward of 10,000 dollars.

           The reporter leans her microphone towards Angley, who 
           holds up the photograph... almost like a parent appealing 
           for the return of a stolen child.

                                 ANGLEY
                        Whoever has done this, please 
                        reconsider your actions. This is 
                        not about justice or the U.S. 
                        Penal Code, but about the unique 
                        sentimental and emotional power of 
                        a beloved inanimate object. All I 
                        want is a safe, no questions 
                        asked, return of this one of a 
                        kind piece of art.

           The reporter nods solemnly and brings the microphone back 
           to her mouth.

                                 REPORTER
                        Police refuse to speculate if this 
                        crime is related to a theft in 
                        Stinson Beach 3 weeks ago by a man 
                        newspapers have dubbed the 
                        Flamingo Thief.

           Joy turns to Tim, who looks like he wants to THROW UP.

                                 JOY
                        It is related, isn’t it?

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding, softly)
                        He’s in with the others...
           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - FLAMINGO ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy studies the new bird, running her hands over its 
           smooth varnished body, while a crumbling Tim stands 
           against the wall. The reality of his crime sinking in...

                                 TIM
                                 (weakly)
                        Did you tell anyone else about 
                        this?

           Joy shake her head, a little disappointed he had to ask.

                                 JOY
                        Uncle Tim... I thought we’d been 
                        over that.

                                 TIM
                        Right...

           As Tim sinks to the floor, Joy looks back to the bird.

                                 JOY
                        The first news report said the 
                        bird was originally commissioned 
                        by Frank Lloyd Wright. You know 
                        how much it must be worth?

           Tim swallows hard, the repercussions of his theft clearly 
           racing through his mind.

                                 TIM
                        No idea. A lot. Thousands... 
                        probably more. Definitely a 
                        felony. (beat, explaining) Look, 
                        you know I didn’t do it for the 
                        money. Charles Angley is a wine 
                        critic, there was an article about 
                        him and I saw the flamingo in a 
                        photo of his house. I couldn’t 
                        take my eyes off it...

                                 JOY
                        So, you broke in and took it?

                                 TIM
                        No, I’d never break in... I found 
                        an open window. Fine line, I know, 
                        but... (beat, at rock bottom) My 
                        God, Joy... what have I done?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOY
                        I don’t know, but you’re in real 
                        trouble, Uncle Tim.

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding, broken)
                        Even more than you think...

           Tim buries his face in his hands. Joy looks at him with 
           equal parts compassion and concern, then comes over and 
           sits next to him. Putting her hand softly on his...

                                 JOY
                                 (gently)
                        I heard Stella’s pregnant...

           Tim nods slowly.

                                 TIM
                        I guess she did want a family. She 
                        just didn’t want one with me.

           For a moment, they just sit there, then...

                                 JOY
                        You can unpin that question now. 
                        The one where you ask how I’m 
                        doing...

                                 TIM
                        Okay... how are you doing?

           Joy pauses a beat, then shakes her head sadly...

                                 JOY
                        You know, I watch these people in 
                        my house, the yelling, the crying, 
                        the doors slamming, and it’s like 
                        this isn’t my mom and dad... I 
                        don’t recognize them. I don’t even 
                        think they recognize each other. 
                        And all I keep thinking is “this 
                        isn’t our family, this isn’t 
                        us”... (beat) It’s not us, right? 
                        It can’t be.

           And then Joy starts crying. All her maturity and 
           confidence, draining away, as Tim pulls her close.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                                 (through tears)
                        The old us is still there, isn’t 
                        it? It can’t just be dead.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Tim’s own eyes fill with tears.

                                 TIM
                        Sometimes people don’t realize 
                        they’re dead, until it’s too 
                        late...

                                 JOY
                        But, we can come back, right? From 
                        being dead? I mean the flamingo 
                        knows all they have is each other, 
                        why can’t we?

                                 TIM
                                 (softly)
                        I don’t know, Joy. I just don’t 
                        know...

           And there’s nothing else to say. Tim and Joy can only 
           cling to one another, watching the silent flock of 
           birds...

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - JOY’S ROOM - LATER

           The room is wonderfully furnished with the items from 
           Marie’s store. From the doorway, Tim watches Joy sleeping 
           - exhausted by the pain and complexity in her world.

           Tim studies her for a SAD, THOUGHTFUL beat, then steps 
           from the room...

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Tim moves quietly down the hall...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        That night, I thought about Frank 
                        Lloyd Wright and flamingos and how 
                        it had all gone so wrong...

           He pauses at the flamingo room to study his flock...

                                 TIM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I thought about Charles Angley and 
                        the police and Stinson Beach and 
                        Carl Jung and the Principle of 
                        Synchronicity...

           Tim turns the light off, only the vague shadows of the 
           birds still visible, as he moves down the hall. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        But, mostly, I thought about Joy 
                        and George and Laurie. And orgies 
                        and Joe Montana and women who kiss 
                        women at Yoga Journal 
                        headquarters. And pregnant artists 
                        and real estate agents and women 
                        who have grieved and sell mother 
                        of pearl mirrors and powerful men 
                        who miss their grandsons... 

           As, Tim recounts this list, we JUMPCUT through FLASHING 
           IMAGES of everything he mentions and THE FLAMINGOS which 
           correspond to each event.

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - TIM’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           We’re back on Tim now, standing in the middle of his 
           room, slowly unbuttoning his shirt...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And I tried thinking about what it 
                        takes to come back from the dead.

           Tim pauses with confusion on this last beat, clearly AT A 
           LOSS...

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Tim lays in bed, eyes wide open. We hear the soft BUZZ of 
           the Humming Toadfish...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Finally, I just stopped thinking 
                        and listened to the Humming 
                        Toadfish. (beat) I still hadn’t 
                        gotten used to it...

           EXT. SAUSALITO BAYFRONT - NEXT MORNING

           Establishing shot. We see the row of houseboats, the calm 
           water and the gray blanket of the morning marine layer. 
           The PURR of passing boats is the only sound...

           EXT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - DAY

           Tim steps onto the porch with Joy’s overnight bag, as 
           Laurie walks down the dock and arrives at his boat.

                        Good morning, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Joy’s just finishing up. I made 
                        her breakfast...

           Laurie smiles sadly and leans against the porch railing.

                                 LAURIE
                        You’re very good to her, Tim.

                                 TIM
                        So are you...

           Laurie’s not so sure. The burden of her troubled marriage 
           and the effect it’s having on her child weighs heavily. 

                                 LAURIE
                        There was nothing between me and 
                        that woman. 

           Tim nods with equal sadness and takes a spot next to her 
           on the rail.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        It was just a kiss... a strange, 
                        surprising, exciting, then awkward 
                        and embarrassing, regrettable 
                        kiss. (beat) I don’t know why I 
                        even told him. I guess I wanted 
                        him to feel something. Like I did 
                        when you told me about the orgy...

                                 TIM
                                 (feeling guilty)
                        I thought you knew. (beat) If it 
                        helps, he was a watcher not a 
                        toucher.

                                 LAURIE
                        So, I’ve heard... 

           Laurie wipes a tear, resting her head on Tim’s shoulder.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s all gone to hell, hasn’t it?

                                 TIM
                        Feels that way sometimes...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           They linger for reflective beat, then Joy steps onto the 
           patio and Laurie straightens up...

                                 LAURIE
                                 (putting on a brave 
                                 face)
                        Joy... hi, honey.

                                 JOY
                        Hi, Mom. (beat) Thank you, Uncle 
                        Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Good bye, Joy.

           Tim puts his arms around her... and she pulls him tight, 
           WHISPERING in his ear.

                                 JOY
                                 (softly)
                        I think you need to return that 
                        bird.

           Tim nods with resignation...

                                 TIM
                        I know. (beat) I think I need to 
                        return all of them.

           Joy nods with agreement and a shared understanding of the 
           huge task before him. Then, Laurie picks up Joy’s 
           overnight bag, takes her daughter’s hand and, together, 
           they step off the boat, onto the dock...

           As they walk away, Tim looks to the bay, recognizing a 
           PASSING BOAT...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                                 (pointing)
                        Joy, look... Fortitude.

           Joy and Laurie look out and see the boat. Laurie is 
           confused, not quite sure what Tim means, but Joy sees the 
           name and understands perfectly. She’s finally able to 
           manage a smile.

           INT. TIM’S HOUSEBOAT - FLAMINGO ROOM - DAY

           We see Tim preparing his flock for their return...

           - Carefully wrapping some of the smaller, fragile 
           flamingos in paper so they won’t break, labelling them, 
           and placing them in a box with the other small flamingos.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           - Placing Marie’s flamingo vase into another box.

           - Rolling up the poster.

           - Covering the Frank Lloyd Wright flamingo with a 
           blanket.

           - Putting Stella and Derek’s flamingos, his first birds, 
           into a black duffel bag. Pulling the zipper closed...

           EXT. DOCK - DAY

           Tim heads up the dock, duffel bag over his shoulder, 
           while carrying the large blanket wrapped flamingo. He 
           strains under its weight...

           His neighbor Olaf suddenly appears on the side of his 
           boat, observing Tim’s load.

                                 OLAF
                        You sure that’s not a human body?

                                 TIM
                        I’m very sure. 

                                 OLAF
                                 (nodding)
                        That’s all I needed to hear. Enjoy 
                        your day...

           With that, Olaf disappears back into his boat and Tim 
           continues up the dock.

           INT. TIM’S CAR - DAY

           Tim drives with the boxed flamingo vase and the rolled up 
           poster on the seat next to him. The large, blanket-
           wrapped flamingo is in the backseat, along with the black 
           duffel bag.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        The plan for the returns was 
                        simple...

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Tim strolls by the counter, pulls the flamingo TOOTHPICK 
           HOLDER from his pocket, places it back on the hostess 
           stand, then heads for the exit...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        I would get each bird...

           INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY 

           Tim puts the RUBBER FLAMINGO on the ANTENNAE of the car 
           it had once called home.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Back to its rightful owner...

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Tim places the FLAMINGO PEN back on the counter next to 
           the register...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        As quickly...

           EXT. BUS STOP SHELTER - DAY 

           Tim pops open the poster case, then unfurls the flamingo 
           poster and tapes it back into place.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And quietly as possible...

           INT. STINSON BEACH ANTIQUE SHOP - DAY

           The site where Tim’s dramatic chase originated. Tim 
           strolls the aisles, as the mutton-chopped Clerk, the one 
           who had chased him, peers from the counter, where he 
           rings up another CUSTOMER’s purchase. But, he doesn’t 
           recognize Tim without the baseball hat.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Hopefully without being seen, 
                        chased or arrested.

           Tim rounds a corner, blocked from view, pulls the CERAMIC 
           FLAMINGO from his jacket, places it on a shelf, then 
           walks from the store.

           EXT. ORGY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 

           Tim walks up to the house, the stolen flamingo hidden 
           inside his jacket, and knocks on the door.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Of course, there were certain 
                        hurdles to overcome...

           The door opens, revealing a man dressed conservatively in 
           a YELLOW POLO SHIRT and KHAKI PANTS.

                                 KHAKI PANTS POLO GUY
                        Yes?

                                 TIM
                        Does Joe Montana live here?

                                 KHAKI PANTS POLO GUY
                                 (smiling)
                        Welcome, friend.

           He opens the door, allowing Tim to step into the house.

           INT. ORGY HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Tim hands Khaki Pants Polo Guy twenty dollars for 
           refreshments and the DJ, then pauses, a look of concern 
           on his face...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Hurdles like... how exactly does a 
                        man return a flamingo to an orgy?

           INT. ORGY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The wooden doors open, Tim steps into the room. Naked. 

           He waves to a few friendly swingers, grabs a drink from a 
           passing tray - his hands hold no flamingo. Where is it?

           ANGLE ON a rearview of Tim - where we see the flamingo 
           gripped between his butt cheeks.

           Keeping his “front” facing the party, Tim inconspicuously 
           slides along the edge of the room. He sips his drink, 
           samples a baby carrot from an appetizer tray... until he 
           reaches the bookshelves. With the autographed Joe Montana 
           photo looking down on him, Tim reaches back, unwedges the 
           flamingo and returns it to the shelf...

           As Tim quickly leaves, a small smile crosses his face...

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Each return had it’s own small 
                        sense of exhilaration...
           EXT. ANTIQUE SHOP - SAN ANSELMO - NIGHT 

           We see Tim pry open one of the old farmhouse windows and 
           climb inside the DARK shop with the glass flamingo vase.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        And the hope that, maybe, I could 
                        erase whatever it was I had 
                        done...

           INT. ANTIQUE SHOP - SAN ANSELMO - NIGHT 

           A soft glow from the moon is the only light, as Tim 
           stands on a stool, returning the flamingo vase to its 
           high shelf.

           Tim steps down and heads back to the open window. 
           Suddenly, a shadow appears behind him, a woman SCREAMS, a 
           TAZER GUN CRACKLES, then Tim SCREAMS and falls back - 
           body tumbling out of frame, followed by the sound of 
           several THUMPS and BUMPS and CRIES of pain.

           THE LIGHTS GO ON - revealing Tim CRUMPLED at the bottom 
           of a short wooden staircase, near a door which must lead 
           to some kind of basement/store room. Blood trickles from 
           a wound over his eye and another on his chin.

           Marie appears at the top of the stairs, the tazer still 
           gripped in her hand...

                                 MARIE
                                 (stunned)
                        Tim?! Oh my God...

                                 TIM
                                 (panicked)
                        Oh shit... 

           Clearly in pain, Tim struggles to his feet, looking for 
           an escape route. He tries the basement door, but it’s 
           locked. He SHAKES the handle desperately...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Come on, come on...

           Marie starts down the stairs.

                                 MARIE
                        Tim, stop! 

                                 TIM
                        I can’t, Marie. I’m sorry. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Tim slams himself against the door, wincing in pain...

                                 MARIE
                        Tim, please... stop!

                                 TIM
                        I can’t! You don’t understand...

           Tim jumps for a high, NARROW WINDOW, trying to pull 
           himself up and undo the latch...

                                 MARIE
                        Stop!!

           Then she JABS him again with the tazer. Tim SCREAMS, his 
           battered body dropping to the floor, where he lies in a 
           helpless heap.

                                 TIM
                                 (in pain)
                        Ow, why did you do that?

                                 MARIE
                        Why didn’t you stop? I said stop.

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know... I couldn’t. (beat, 
                        defeated) Oh, God... are you going 
                        to call the police?

           OFF Marie looking at him with kindness, we MOVE TO...

           INT. ANTIQUE STORE - SAN ANSELMO - LATER

           A hurting Tim sits on a chair, while Marie carefully 
           bandages his facial wounds...

                                 TIM
                                 (humiliated)
                        So, were you hiding in the dark 
                        the whole time?

                                 MARIE
                        I was in the back room going over 
                        bills and I heard a noise. With 
                        the lights off, I couldn’t tell 
                        who it was... (beat) What did you 
                        think you were doing?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know. I thought maybe if I 
                        put the flamingos back, I could 
                        undo things, or at least one 
                        thing... it’s all just gone so 
                        wrong. 

                                 MARIE
                        What has?

                                 TIM
                        Everything. With everybody. And 
                        it’s been wrong for so long... I 
                        just never knew. (beat) I couldn’t 
                        even see I was losing my wife and 
                        I loved her so much. How did I get 
                        so numb, Marie? 

                                 MARIE
                                 (gently)
                        I don’t know, Tim.

           Marie steps back, then sits down, thinking. Finally, with 
           a sigh... 

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        I do know nobody teaches us how to 
                        love. We give what we're capable 
                        of and sometimes it just isn't 
                        enough. Sometimes we get lost and 
                        we hurt people when we don't mean 
                        to, or we can't be the person they 
                        need when they need it most. And 
                        sometimes people grow sad, they 
                        become distant, and people leave. 
                        And, the worst part is... 
                        sometimes, you just don't know and 
                        there's nothing you can do about 
                        it.

           It's a terrifying notion... one of the loneliest and 
           hardest realities of the human experience.  

                                 TIM
                        God... if you believe that, how 
                        can you go on?

                                 MARIE
                        How can you not? We still have to 
                        love. Without that we’re dead...

           Tim nods thoughtfully, as the weight of this sinks in. 
           Then, apropos of nothing...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TIM
                        I think my ribs are broken.

           EXT. ANTIQUE STORE - SAN ANSELMO - NIGHT 

           Marie helps Tim to his car. His facial wounds are 
           bandaged now, but he’s limping and clearly still in pain.

                                 MARIE
                        You know, there was a part of me 
                        that always hoped you were the 
                        Flamingo Thief.

                                 TIM
                        Why? So you could jab me with a 
                        tazer?

                                 MARIE
                        Well, you did steal from me.

                                 TIM
                        Fair point. 

           They pause at the car, Marie noticing the blanket-wrapped 
           object in the back seat. Tim sees that she’s noticed...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        This all must seem so strange to 
                        you. 

           Marie shakes her head.

                                 MARIE
                        I wanted it to be you because I 
                        think any man who only steals 
                        flamingos must have an amazing 
                        story... 

                                 TIM
                        Or he’s lost his mind.

                                 MARIE
                                 (softly)
                        I don’t think that’s true.

           They look at each other for a long beat, Tim sensing that 
           she knows exactly what he’s going through. She’s always 
           known...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        You know, when we first met, you 
                        tried to tell me about the stages 
                        of grief. I probably should have 
                        listened...

           Marie smiles thoughtfully, then gently places her hand on 
           his.

                                 MARIE
                        I’m glad you’re returning the 
                        flamingos, Tim. But, you can’t 
                        undo the past. All you can ever do 
                        is let it go. That’s the last 
                        stage.

           She gives him a quick, but gentle kiss on the cheek. As 
           Tim stands there looking at her, absorbing her warmth, 
           it’s like he finally understands.

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                                 (re: his injuries)
                        Are you going to be okay?

                                 TIM
                                 (re: everything)
                        I hope so. (beat) Thank you, 
                        Marie.

           The sound of POUNDING moves us to...

           EXT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tim stands on his brother’s driveway, POUNDING on the 
           garage door...

                                 TIM
                        George? Are you in there? It’s me, 
                        Tim...

           The garage door GOES UP, revealing George in a pair of 
           surgical scrub pants and a Grateful Dead T-shirt. Behind 
           him, we see an AIR MATTRESS, a small TELEVISION and 
           scattered PERSONAL ITEMS. George stares at Tim’s battered 
           and bandaged appearance.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (stunned)
                        What the hell happened to you?

           Ignoring the question...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TIM
                        George, I need you to help me 
                        return a flamingo.

           Now, George is even more stunned...

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh, my God... you’re the thief!

           Tim nods.

                                 TIM
                        Except now I’m taking them back. 
                        Will you help me?

                                 GEORGE
                        Hell yes, I’ll help you... let me 
                        get my shoes.

           As George runs back to a pile of clothes near his air 
           mattress...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                                 (re: his living 
                                 arrangements, 
                                 ashamed)
                        So what do you think of my set-up 
                        out here? Not much to look at, I 
                        know...

                                 TIM
                                 (understanding)
                        Have you talked to Laurie today? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Talked? No... we’re in a silent 
                        phase now. Beats the yelling, I 
                        guess. (beat) She dropped off a 
                        space heater this afternoon...

                                 TIM
                        That’s positive.

                                 GEORGE
                        Or a sign I’ll be out here all 
                        Winter. (beat) Joy gave me this 
                        hot plate. Makes a mean Cup of 
                        Noodles if you’re hungry...

                                 TIM
                        No, I’m good, George. We should 
                        get moving...

                        Right, right... (beat, holding up 
                        his shoes) Found ‘em.

           Then, as he hustles towards Tim and his waiting car...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        My brother the Flamingo Thief... 
                        this is so cool.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

           Tim’s Audi speeds along the winding highway towards 
           Healdsburg and Charles Angley’s house.

           INT. TIM’S CAR - NIGHT 

           Tim is driving. George sits next to him. The large, 
           blanket-covered flamingo is still in the back seat.

                                 GEORGE
                        God, I have so many questions for 
                        you. The how’s, the why’s... 
                        (beat, thinking) Flamingos... I 
                        mean, it’s clearly some form of 
                        acting out, right? Re-channeling 
                        the sense of loss in your personal 
                        life into--

                                 TIM
                        Wait, are you asking me why? Or 
                        telling me why?

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, neither. Because, a large 
                        part of me still believes a man’s 
                        reasons are his business...

           A beat of silence, as George acts as if he’s content to 
           leave his questions unanswered. But, Tim shakes his head, 
           he knows his brother all too well...

                                 TIM
                        Don’t worry, George. Someday, I’ll 
                        explain it to you.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (relieved)
                        Thank God. I’m going to hold you 
                        to that, Timmy.

                                 TIM
                        I know...

           A smile between the two broken brothers and we MOVE TO...

           EXT. CHARLES ANGLEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A gravel drive cuts through a wooded grove to Charles 
           Angley’s house. The house is dark.

           Tim’s car slowly pulls up, stopping about 200 yards short 
           of the house.

           We see his headlights go off...

           INT. TIM’S CAR - SAME TIME

           George is buzzing with excitement, the adrenaline 
           overtaking his own personal sadness...

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh yeah, exactly how I pictured 
                        it. Tense, dangerous... (beat) You 
                        don’t know how into the Flamingo 
                        Thief I’ve been, Tim. I followed 
                        everything - the articles, news 
                        reports. Something about a man 
                        with an obscure passion, living 
                        outside the law... it really spoke 
                        to me. I just kept asking myself, 
                        who was this person? (beat) I 
                        always pictured you as taller, by 
                        the way. Huskier. And possibly 
                        European...

                                 TIM
                        Sorry to let you down. 

                                 GEORGE
                        No, no. In a way, this is better. 
                        (beat, excited) So what do we do 
                        now...

                                 TIM
                        Now? Now we take the bird up to 
                        the house and leave it.

           A silent beat...

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s it?

                                 GEORGE
                        The paper said it’s a 20,000 
                        dollar bird. I just thought 
                        there’d be a little more to it. 

                                 TIM
                        The guy said no questions asked, 
                        George. I’ve already wedged one 
                        flamingo between my ass cheeks, 
                        been tazed, fallen down a flight 
                        of stairs and possibly broken 
                        three ribs. We just need to get it 
                        back in one piece and end this 
                        thing. Can you help me lift?

                                 GEORGE
                                 (wanting so much 
                                 more)
                        Fine...

           OFF George’s relenting nod, we MOVE TO...

           EXT. CHARLES ANGLEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tim and George each hold one end of the large flamingo, 
           carrying it down the gravel path towards the house. Their 
           feet SCRUNCHING softly in the gravel...

                                 GEORGE
                        How are you doing?

                                 TIM
                                 (straining)
                        Hanging in. Let’s get it onto the 
                        porch... that’ll be enough.

           They carry the bird up WOODEN STEPS to the darkened 
           SHADOWS of the back porch and set it down. They pause for 
           a final look at the magnificent creature.

                        You know, if we were really smart, 
                        we’d ask for the reward. They 
                        don’t have to know you were the 
                        guy who stole it, right?

                                 TIM
                        Good idea, George. (beat) Do your 
                        patients know you have thoughts 
                        like this?

                        That’s the beauty of Radiology, I 
                        don’t really see patients. I just 
                        read their X-rays--

                                 CHARLES ANGLEY (O.C.)
                        Don’t move, assholes!

           Tim and George turn to see the angry owner of the bird 
           standing twenty feet away from them. He’s holding a 
           SHOTGUN.

                                 TIM
                        Whoa, whoa... okay, let’s be cool. 
                        No need for the gun. Your bird is 
                        safe, just like you wanted. And 
                        now we’re on our way...

           Angley pumps the gun.

                                 CHARLES ANGLEY
                        Stay where you are. Do you have 
                        any idea how much anguish you’ve 
                        caused me? The pain? This bird is 
                        one of a kind...

                                 TIM
                        I’m sure it is... and I never 
                        meant for any pain. But, you did 
                        mention a “no questions asked” 
                        policy when you were on TV, so--

                                 CHARLES ANGLEY
                        I’m not asking questions, I’m 
                        calling the cops.

           The gun in one hand, still trained on Tim and George, 
           Angley pulls a cellphone from his pocket and dials...

                                 GEORGE
                        Ah, this is fucked...

                                 CHARLES ANGLEY
                                 (into the phone)
                        Hello, yes... this is Charles 
                        Angley and I need officers at my 
                        home right away...

           As Angley continues, Tim realizes something...

                        The shadows... he can’t see our 
                        faces. He doesn’t know who we are.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s that mean?

                                 TIM
                        It means... RUN!

           Tim and George turn and make a running leap from the 
           porch, sprinting for the car. Behind them, a shotgun 
           FIRES.

                                 ANGLEY
                        Stop you bastards!

           Another shotgun BLAST, as Tim and George run for their 
           lives.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (freaking out)
                        Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

           Tim, who has now been through a few adventures, remains 
           focussed, powering through his injuries...

                                 TIM
                        Keep running, George. Just keep 
                        running!

           A few more SHOTS, but the older man can’t keep up with 
           them and they reach the car and jump in...

           INT. TIM’S AUDI - CONTINUOUS

           As Tim starts the engine and throws the car into gear...

                                 GEORGE
                        Holy fuck, he shot at us! That 
                        pyscho shot at us! 

           Another BLAST, the back window of Tim’s Audi BLOWS OUT, 
           but Tim slams his foot down on the gas and they speed 
           off...

           Once they are clearly safe, George starts laughing, 
           totally buzzing on adrenaline. Tim joins the laughter... 
           only to wince at the pain in his ribs. George doesn’t 
           notice...

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        orgy!

           Clutching his ribs, Tim studies his brother for a beat, 
           the word “orgy” still hanging in the air... 

                                 TIM
                        You’re done with those, right?

           Pulling back from his high, George grows thoughtful, even 
           serious...

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, yeah... I’m done. I’m done.

           OFF Tim’s nod of understanding...

           EXT. GEORGE AND LAURIE’S HOUSE - DAWN

           The sun is just coming in Mill Valley, as Tim’s Audi 
           pulls up the driveway and comes to a stop.

           INT. TIM’S AUDI - SAME TIME

           The two brothers are quiet for a beat, reflecting on what 
           they’ve just experienced.

                                 GEORGE
                        You sure you don’t need help with 
                        the other birds?

                                 TIM
                        There’s only two left. I kind of 
                        need to do those myself.

                                 GEORGE
                                 (nodding)
                        Right. I get it...

           Then, as George reaches for the door handle... 

                                 TIM
                        George, wait...

           George stops, as Tim pauses, considering his words. 
           Finally...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        You know, at some point, it was 
                        too late for Stella and me.

                        I see that now. But, if it’s still 
                        there with you and Laurie, even 
                        just a little bit... that love is 
                        worth fighting for. Everyday. Kick 
                        the ashes, blow on the sparks and 
                        fan them until they flame again... 

           Tim pauses to make sure this sinks in...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        It’s the only way we stay alive.

           A shared moment between the two brothers, the words 
           penetrating deeply. As a tear comes to George’s eye, he 
           turns, staring at his house...

                                 GEORGE
                                 (raw)
                        I know I talk a lot, Timmy, but, 
                        truth is... I’ve always wanted 
                        Laurie. She’s all I’ve ever 
                        wanted.

                                 TIM
                                 (nodding, believing)
                        I know. (beat) Thanks for the help 
                        tonight, George.

           George looks at his younger brother with gratitude, then 
           does his best to give a non-chalant shrug...

                                 GEORGE
                                 (with a shrug)
                        Hey, that’s what big brothers do. 

           Again, George starts to exit the car, then pauses...

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I do have to ask one 
                        thing... why flamingos? Of all the 
                        birds to fixate on, I don’t 
                        know... why not something more 
                        robust? A bird of prey... like a 
                        hawk? Or an eagle?

           Tim considers this for a beat, then...

                                 TIM
                        We don’t always choose the bird, 
                        George. Sometimes the bird chooses 
                        us.

           George nods and smiles - good point. Then gets out and 
           heads for the garage. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Tim sees Laurie and Joy peeking through the front window 
           of the house. He thinks for a beat, then, calling out...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        Hey, George... why don’t you go in 
                        the front door?

           George pauses, then nods and changes course, heading for 
           the front door. Tim gives a quick WAVE to the faces in 
           the window, Joy smiles at him, then, as he reverses down 
           the driveway, we STAY ON...

           ...George, as he enters the house, returning to his 
           family. There is still a spark...

           EXT. DEREK TROTTERS’S HOUSE - DAY

           Tim stands behind his parked car, holding the black 
           duffel bag, while staring calmly at the house. After a 
           beat, he turns, places the bag on the trunk and unzips 
           it, revealing the two original flamingos - Uno and Dos.

           Tim pulls the birds from the bag and strolls across the 
           lawn until he reaches their old spot. He pushes the 
           spindly legs into the ground, then steps back to view 
           them one last time...

           As he does, the front door opens and Stella and Derek 
           step out of the house.

                                 STELLA
                        Tim?

                                 TIM
                        Hello, Stella. I brought your 
                        birds back. (beat) I’m sorry I 
                        took them. That was wrong.

           Stella and Derek look at the birds, Tim’s battered 
           appearance, then at each other - what the hell?

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        I hope you guys have a wonderful 
                        life together. I really want you 
                        to be happy.

           Tim sounds so pure and sincere, there’s no doubt he truly 
           means it. Derek instinctively puts his arm around Stella, 
           but neither has any idea what to say...

                                 TIM (CONT’D)
                        By the way, Derek, congratulations

                        amazing.

                        Take care of these birds.

           Tim turns and starts for his car.

                                 STELLA
                        Tim, wait...

           Tim stops and turns back. She takes a step towards him.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        The articles in the paper, the 
                        news reports... are you the--

                        Flamingo Thief? (beat) No. Not 
                        anymore.

           With that, Tim turns again and walks to his car. On his 
           face, the first true expression of peace and contentment 
           we’ve seen.

           INT. ART PETTIS’S OFFICE - DAY

           Art enters his office, studying a folder of legal briefs. 
           He circles his desk, about to sit down, when his 
           attention is caught by...

           The FLAMINGO COFFEE MUG - now back in it’s place on his 
           shelf.

           Pettis’s hand goes to his mouth. The folder and legal 
           briefs slide from his hand. His eyes well with tears.

           For a moment, he stares at the mug, considering a course 
           of action. Then, he sits down at his desk, picks up his 
           phone and dials...

           We hear a MUFFLED VOICE on the other end of the line, 
           then Pettis draws a deep, courage-summoning breath and...

                        Hello, Son. It’s your dad...

                        want to say...

           As tears flood down Pettis’s cheeks and conversation with 
           his once-estranged son begins, we DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. SALT WATER LAGOON - DAY

           SLOW MOTION as a flock of BRIGHT PINK FLAMINGOS, wings 
           spread wide, begin to take flight. Backlit by the bright 
           glow of morning sun, their wings almost appear to be on 
           fire.

                                 TIM (V.O.)
                        Historians believe that, in 
                        ancient times, the sight of 
                        flamingos rising from the ground, 
                        their burning pink wings spread 
                        wide, inspired the legend of the 
                        Phoenix, the mythical bird that 
                        rises from the ashes of death to
