           EXT. CALVERT FARMHOUSE - TENNESSEE 1973 - NIGHT

           A farmhouse built in the lee of the Appalachian Mountains. An 
           eruption of bloodcurdling screams is accompanied by the sound 
           of crashing furniture. All is quiet.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CLAUDELLE (17) is crying as she fights to pry the window open 
           with desperation. Its edges are painted shut. 

                                 CLAUDELLE
                            (sotto)
                        Open damn it. 

           She SLAMS her palms against the base of the window frame. The 
           ARROWHEAD necklace she is wearing swings on its leather thong  
           with each hopeless attempt. 

           An unknown ASSAILANT arrives at the locked door and begins to 
           twist on the knob. He starts HAMMERING his weight against the 
           oak panels - WHAM! And again - WHAM!  

                                 GRANVILLE (O.C.)
                        Let me in, Let me in, little pig or 
                        I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll 
                        blow your house in. 

           Claudelle looks back; the hinges are already SPLINTERING. She 
           uses her whole body as leverage. She pushes against the glass 
           and the window slowly creaks upward.   

           WHAM! Again - WHAM! The door shutters. Claudelle screams with 
           each POUNDING as she slides the window inch by inch. Suddenly 
           the door SHATTERS out of its frame.   

           GRANVILLE SUTTER (40) storms into the bathroom like a tornado 
           of terror. His eyes stare at the window curtain as it billows 
           in the breeze. 

           EXT. CALVERT FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Claudelle sprints for her life. She moves through shadows and 
           muddy bottomlands. She heaves with torment and falls and gets 
           back to her feet. Mud is splashed across her nightgown.    

           Behind her the farmhouse door swings open as if it were under 
           the onslaught of a mighty wind. Granville steps out to search 
           the darkness for his prey.   
           EXT. BARN LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Claudelle hides behind a crude shack. Her lips tremble. Tears 
           stream down her face. Terrified she reaches for the arrowhead 
           around her throat and begins to thumb it. After a long moment 
           she peers around the corner of the shack.  

           The farmhouse door is open and light spills over the yard but 
           Granville is nowhere to be seen. She eyes a black Ford Bronco 
           idling 40 yards ahead. 

           She sits back down and closes her eyes. She breathes deep and 
           thumbs the arrowhead once more before rising to her feet. She 
           turns to sprint for open territory. 

           WHAM! A set of scarred and bony knuckles connect solidly with 
           her nose. Claudelle flies onto her back with a muddy THUD. 

           She squints against the sting of her broken nose as Granville 
           steps over her and grabs the leather thong around her neck.

           He hoists her up and twists the thong in his hand so it coils 
           against the flesh of her throat.  

           Claudelle begins slapping Granville. He remains unwavering as 
           he chokes her desperate eyes into nothingness. 

           EXT. ROAD - THE NEXT MORNING

           A truck emerges out of the sun. Its worn body is fired orange 
           by the malefic rays of light flaring behind it. 

           The quilt-covered CARGO it hauls shifts with every crevice in 
           the gravel road as the DRIVER disdains the shoddy route.

           EXT. BLUEBIRD CAFE - MOMENTS LATER

           Still moving in a cacophony of rattles and shrieks and creaks 
           the truck approaches.

           A gregarious MAN is sweeping the sidewalk with his threadbare 
           broom. He halts the driver with an upraised hand. 

                                 MAN
                        What you got there, Sandy?

           The driver turns and spits chewing tobacco out the window. He 
           wipes his mouth and glances at the quilt-covered cargo.

                                 DRIVER
                        Dead folks. 
           EXT. COURTHOUSE - LATER

           The truck and its curious cargo have already accrued a motley 
           of EARLY RISERS; they journey like a parade to the courthouse 
           lawn. 

           The driver exits onto the ice-coated grass. He turns to study 
           the inquisitive people surrounding him.

                                 DRIVER
                        Get Sheriff Bellwether out here.

           A FAT MAN in overalls approaches like some beguiled patron of 
           the macabre.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Bellwether’s done been sent for. 
                        Who all is it, Sandy?

           The driver pulls off the quilt. The fat man shuffles his feet 
           clumsily as the other town-folk divert their eyes in shame.

                                 FAT MAN (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it, that girl’s half naked. 
                        Did you not have enough respect to 
                        cover her up?

                                 DRIVER
                        I ain’t Fenton Breece, Hooper. All 
                        I undertook to do was bring em in. 
                        That’s all the undertakin I aim to 
                        do. You want to handle em, then you 
                        cover em up.

           A little BOY goes unnoticed as he approaches the tailgate. He 
           sees a MURDERED FAMILY of FOUR exhibited in grim fashion. His 
           eyes zero in on Claudelle. The arrowhead thong is wound tight 
           into her bruised flesh. A welter of pungent blood covers all.

                                 FAT MAN
                        There are some sorry son of a 
                        bitches in this world. 

                                 DRIVER
                        I believe half of em are runnin 
                        wild in the Harrikin.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Who’s runnin wild? Who done this 
                        mess anyway?

                                 DRIVER
                        God knows or more likely the Devil.
                                 BOY
                        Look.

           The boy is pointing to a BLOODY LUMP of curly hair inside the 
           truckbed. A DOG is in there. His MOTHER quickly approaches to 
           shield his young eyes from the horrific tableau.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Well, I’ll be damned. 

           The fat man pulls out the Scottish Terrier. Its eyes are wide 
           open and its distended tongue is purple. But strangest of all 
           its ears have been pierced with a gaudy pair of gemstones. 

                                 DRIVER
                        I don’t believe I ever seen a dog 
                        wearin earrings.

                                 FAT MAN
                        Reckon why whoever it was killed 
                        the dog anyway?

                                 DRIVER
                        I’ve thought about that some. I 
                        believe it was just all there was 
                        left to kill. 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                     Beyond the Pale

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

           CORRIE (21) and her brother KENNETH TYLER (18) walk through a 
           stand of cypress that shrouds the graveyard. A heavy rain has 
           begun to fall. It runs from the tip of his shovel. 

                                     13 Days Earlier

           Corrie moves ahead amongst the milk-white gravestones shining 
           her flashlight with a sense of purpose. Its stark beam hits a 
           simple epitaph reading Mann “Moose” Tyler 1932 - 1973.

                                 CORRIE
                        Here. This one here.

                                 TYLER
                            (drawing near)
                        Yeah. This is crazy as shit.

           Soaked to the bone Tyler glances at his sister and drives his 
           shovel into the mud.
           He begins to dump the loose earth atop the next grave. Corrie 
           sits down underneath a cypress and pulls her legs close.

           Shielding herself from the bitter rain she lights a cigarette 
           and watches Tyler work this weird task. Even in this sinister 
           setting Corrie Tyler is rather beautiful. 

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           The final embers of her cigarette radiate orange and close to 
           the filter. Corrie removes it from her mouth and extinguishes 
           it on the ground beside two others. 

           Tyler is now six feet under when the sounds of metal scraping 
           against metal emanate from the fresh hole.

                                 TYLER (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Bring me the light.

                                 CORRIE
                        Come and get it.

                                 TYLER (O.C.)
                        Goddamn, can’t you do anything?

                                 CORRIE
                        I don’t want to see.

           Tyler mutters something indecipherable and clamors out of the 
           grave all gummed with mud. He wordlessly takes the flashlight 
           and descends back into the hole.

           The shovel strikes the casket. Corrie places her hands to her 
           ears hoping to avoid the squeak of the coffin lid.

           Silence. The uneasy moan of wind in the trees. Tyler comes up 
           to the gravestone and sits hunkered in the rain with a ragged 
           sound to his breath. He might be crying.

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        What we thought?

                                 TYLER
                        Worse.

           Corrie leans forward to look and gasps. MANN TYLER lies naked 
           in his casket. Lace panties cover his genitalia and mounds of 
           rotten garbage litter his bloated corpse.

           Corrie turns to Tyler; his frightened eyes are burning palely 
           in the dark.

                                 CORRIE
                        The son of a bitch--
           EXT. CENTRE - THE NEXT DAY

           FENTON BREECE (44) waddles through town wearing a fawncolored 
           topcoat over a tan gabardine suit. A matching vest covers his 
           well-fed belly.

           TOWN-FOLK nod to him formally. He welcomes their pleasantries 
           by effeminately tipping his felt Stetson. He passes a squalid 
           watering hole called The Bobcat Bar and crosses the street to 
           the much finer Centre Bank & Trust.  

           INT. THE BOBCAT BAR - CONTINUOUS

           SHERIFF ODEL (52) pitches the Centre Sentinel onto one of the 
           round tabletops; its headline reads COST OF WATERGATE SCANDAL 
           REACHES $6 MILLION. 

                                 ODEL
                        Jackasses.

           Odel sips his beer and glances at the bar. Corrie is carrying 
           a case of Miller from the storeroom to the icebox. 

           She is wearing high-waisted jeans. Odel canvasses the side to 
           side movement of her hips. 

                                 HARLAN (O.C.)
                        I wouldn’t kick that out of bed.

           DEPUTY HARLAN (25) saddles the stool beside him; his eyes are 
           also locked in lust. 

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Unless there was more room on the 
                        floor. 

           Odel turns to see fiery red hair and an aquiline nose and the 
           badge reading Deputy Sheriff of Centre.

                                 ODEL
                        Who is that, anyway?

                                 HARLAN
                        Old Moose Tyler’s daughter. 

           Corrie begins unloading bottles into the cooler. Harlan swigs 
           his tumbler of scotch.  

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t know who she got her looks 
                        from, but she damn sure never got 
                        em from that son of a bitch.  
           MRS. TARKINTON (42) enters from the outside world and quickly 
           sets her bitter gaze on the bar.

                                 MRS. TARKINTON
                        Ms. Tyler.

                                 CORRIE
                            (without looking up)
                        Gimme a sec. 

                                 MRS. TARKINTON
                        You’ve had twelve days. 

           Immediately Corrie feels a massive weight and she reaches for 
           the ARROWHEAD necklace around her throat.

                                 CORRIE
                        Mrs. Tarkinton--

                                 MRS. TARKINTON
                        No more buts. You and your brother 
                        have worn my patience thinner than 
                        water. 

           Mrs. Tarkinton presents a piece of paper with Eviction Notice 
           written at the top. Corrie reluctantly takes it. 

                                 CORRIE
                        It’s come to this?

                                 MRS. TARKINTON
                        You’ve got seventy-two hours.

           Corrie sighs and shoves the paper into her pocket. She begins 
           jamming more bottles into the cooler. Mrs. Tarkinton turns to 
           find Odel watching the unpleasant exchange.

                                 MRS. TARKINTON (CONT’D)
                        Sheriff Odel.

                                 ODEL
                        Annie.

                                 MRS. TARKINTON
                        May I have a word outside?

           Odel eyes Corrie and stands. He readjusts his pistol belt and 
           follows Mrs. Tarkinton out the door. 

                                 CORRIE
                            (sotto)
                        Shit.
           Harlan shifts his sight from Odel’s departure onto Corrie. He 
           downs his drink and rises. He swaggers toward the bar like an 
           ungainly bird.   

                                 HARLAN
                        Can I help?

                                 CORRIE
                        Not unless you got a couple hundred 
                        dollars to spare or can convince 
                        Odel to let us be. 

                                 HARLAN
                        Depends on what’s being offered in 
                        return.

           Harlan reaches to touch her chest and she snaps back; a piece 
           of blonde hair falls across her eyes. He tries to move it off 
           her face.  

                                 CORRIE
                        Fuck off, Harlan.

                                 HARLAN
                        What?

                                 CORRIE
                        You heard me. 

                                 HARLAN
                            (sly)
                        No, I didn’t. Say it again.

                                 CORRIE
                        Sick bastard. 

           Corrie angrily pulls off her apron. She turns and marches for 
           the rear door. 

                                 HARLAN
                        Don’t forget you’re a Tyler. A 
                        piece of poor white trash. It’s in 
                        your blood.  

           She halts and stares at Harlan with spite; he smiles a toothy 
           and unsettling grin.

           INT. BELLYSTRETCHER CAFE - DUSK

           Fenton Breece sits in one of the vinyl booths. He sets a bank 
           deposit pouch on the table, then nods to an OLD-TIMER sitting 
           nearby.  
                                 FENTON
                        Winter is coming.

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        ‘tis. 

           An amicable WAITRESS approaches with a coffee and hands it to 
           Breece. 

                                 FENTON
                        Thank you dear.

           Breece grabs the sugar shaker and begins heaping the granular 
           bits into his coffee.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Everybody’s real appreciative for 
                        last week, Mr. Breece. 

                                 FENTON
                        I was just sorry Mrs. Raymer came 
                        to pass. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        We were too. Only saving grace was 
                        an elegant service. 

           The waitress touches Breece with a tender hand and ambles off 
           to the kitchen. He leans back to drink his coffee and notices 
           the old-timer gazing outside.

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        Anybody’s dog who wants to go 
                        huntin. 

           Breece looks out the window. Corrie is leaning on the side of 
           a primer-spotted pickup with tears in her eyes; she furiously 
           smokes a cigarette.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Corrie feels Breece lock his eyes onto her soft breasts, then 
           drop them to her crotch, then back to her breasts. She flicks 
           her cigarette and raises her middle finger.  

           INT. BELLYSTRETCHER CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           The old-timer is eyeballing Breece with sardonic amusement as 
           Corrie climbs behind the wheel of the truck. 

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        You ain’t so good, is you?
           Breece avoids his eyes. The old-timer snorts phlegm and rises 
           for the exit. 

                                 OLD-TIMER (CONT’D)
                        Lookin at that girl like a puppy 
                        with two peckers.

           EXT. TYLER HOUSE - NIGHT

           The soft sound of music can be heard emanating from within. A 
           CROW sits on Tyler’s truck; it caws momentarily before taking 
           flight.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Corrie and Tyler are sitting at a beat-up table, listening to 
           an 8-track and finishing the remains of a meager meal.

                                 CORRIE
                        What do you think we ought to do?

                                 TYLER
                        Do? Put his sorry ass away. Tell 
                        the law and let them open the 
                        graves themselves.

                                 CORRIE
                        You think they would?

                                 TYLER
                        I know they would. What would you 
                        do with him? 

           She grows quiet and slips the arrowhead back and forth on her 
           necklace; the low light causes her eyes to appear opaque. 

                                 CORRIE
                        He’s rich and respected. We’re poor 
                        and hated.  

                                 TYLER
                        Rich is no good here. All these 
                        dead people’s folks. We just opened 
                        up a few of the graves. There’s 
                        still worse covered up. Somebody’s 
                        husband or son would kill the sorry 
                        son of a bitch.

                                 CORRIE
                        We’ve got to get more evidence. 
                            (duplicitous)
                        Get him ourselves. 
                                 TYLER
                        More? What more do we need? Anyway, 
                        what’s all this we mess? It’s not 
                        our job. Let the law or somebody 
                        dig up a few more graves. There’s 
                        your more. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Seems like we never had much luck 
                        with the law. Daddy never did.

                                 TYLER
                        Criminals hardly ever do.

                                 CORRIE
                        Well, you know so much about it. I 
                        doubt his son would either.

                                 TYLER
                        You’ve got a hell of a way of 
                        looking at things. 

           Corrie grows quiet again. Tyler eyes her as he takes the last 
           bite of his food.  

                                 CORRIE
                        I know where to make Fenton Breece 
                        pay where it’ll hurt him the worst.  

                                 TYLER
                        How long have you been thinking 
                        about this?

                                 CORRIE
                        I guess from the you minute you saw 
                        him hauling that vault back to the 
                        funeral home.
                            (softer)
                        Since the son of a bitch made a 
                        pass at me at my own Daddy’s 
                        funeral.

                                 TYLER
                        This is crazy and you know it, and 
                        whatever you got in mind, you can 
                        include me out.

                                 CORRIE
                        You can’t be included out of a 
                        family. Once you’re in one, you’re 
                        in it for life. You can’t turn away 
                        from blood. Will you help me? 
                                 TYLER
                        This mess is too crazy for me.

                                 CORRIE
                        He should pay for what he’s done. 

                                 TYLER
                        No. Not only no, but hell no.

           She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the Eviction Notice 
           from Mrs. Tarkinton; she lays it on the table. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, why didn’t you tell me?

                                 CORRIE
                        I’m telling you now.

           Corrie takes his hands. She squeezes until his regretful eyes 
           meet hers. 

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        Please. You’re all I’ve got. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - THE NEXT DAY

           Here is wealth beyond measure. The glass sign reads in Gothic 
           script Breece Funeral Home.

           Tyler sits hidden behind sassafras trees. He searches for any 
           signs of life on the property. There is none. Tyler pulls the 
           hood of his sweatshirt low and overhead.  

           Huffing down the grass slope toward the house, he first rings 
           the door bell and waits. There is no answer. He looks through 
           a bay window. The mortuary is deserted. 

           Tyler wanders around back. He passes curious Oriental-looking 
           hedges and marble fountains and stone statuaries.

           EXT. CARPORT - CONTINUOUS

           A gleaming Lincoln convertible is parked. Tyler passes it and 
           his lean frame is reflected in the specular surface. He steps 
           to the back door and drops his hand to the knob; it opens. 

           INT. MUD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler enters and is struck with the sheer opulence. The floor 
           is crafted from Jerusalem stone and flocked paper adorns each 
           wall.
           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           He steps onto the Oriental rug. Paintings of European hunters 
           from centuries prior hang behind the stately desk. Tyler goes 
           around it. 

           He opens the center drawer and rifles through a messy mixture 
           of papers. He opens each progressive drawer and finds nothing 
           until he pulls on the last one; it is locked. 

           Tyler hesitates, then snatches an ivory letter opener off the 
           sideboard. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Sunlight off the lustrous surface of a silver Cadillac hearse 
           winks as it winds the curved drive.

           Breece parks in the roundabout and steps out with mail in his 
           hand. He goes to the front door and fumbles with his keys.   

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler has the letter opener deeply imbedded in the drawer. He 
           leverages with all of his strength - SNAP. The drawer springs 
           open to reveal a SMALL BRIEFCASE sitting inside.

           SLAM - the sound of the front door shutting echoes throughout 
           the house. Tyler feels panic course his veins. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Breece ambles down the hallway while perusing the pages of an 
           Enchantingly Feminine catalogue. 

           He’s too distracted by the copious number of bras and panties 
           and young models to see his office door move seemingly on its 
           own.  

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Breece enters with his nose still buried in his catalogue. He 
           sits in a silk chair and drops his mail on the desk. 

           He immediately sees the open drawer and its vandalized top as 
           well the letter opener lying on the rug.

           Breece’s eyes dart about the room. There is no soul about. He 
           rises and awkwardly rushes into the hall. 
           After a long moment the door swings away from the wall. Tyler 
           is hiding behind it with the small briefcase in his hand. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler runs for the front door and sees Breece standing at the 
           far end of the hall; Breece whips around like a carousel.  

                                 FENTON
                        Wait a Goddamn minute!

           Tyler yanks on the door handle, but it doesn’t open. He tries 
           again. Breece narrows the gap. Tyler looks back in horror. He 
           fumbles with the dead-bolt. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler breaks out the door with Breece on his heels. As Breece 
           tries to grab him, Tyler jumps off the landing and clears the 
           stairs and bolts toward the grassy slope.  

           Breece runs down the steps like a penguin. As he steps on the 
           drive his ankle gives and he tumbles onto the roundabout.   

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler breaks through the cover of trees. He crashes through a 
           thicket with brush whipping past him. He continues to sprint. 

           He finally slides behind a stump to catch his breath. He sits 
           staring at the small briefcase. His heart THUMPS. Tyler pries 
           the fastened latch until it breaks. He reaches inside. 

           A pair of lavender PANTIES. They are discolored down one side 
           with a faded rust-brown stain on the hip. He lays them on the 
           ground with wonder. He reaches back into the briefcase. 

           A stack of glossy PHOTOGRAPHS. Tyler slips off the rubberband 
           and rifles hastily through them. Suddenly he drops them as if 
           they seared his hand. His face looks infected.   

           The photos have scattered, some face up. They are all of NUDE 
           WOMEN. Some young, some old. Some pretty, some ugly. They are 
           arranged in grotesque configurations and all are UNMISTAKABLY 
           DEAD. Legs spread flagrantly, some grouped in mimicry of acts 
           of lesbianism. Their faces painted in carmine smiles. Here is 
           BREECE himself. Nude and gross and grinning. Capering happily 
           among them in pure necrophilic infamy.   
           INT. FRONT ROOM - EVENING

           Corrie is on the end of their tattered sofa. She holds up the 
           panties delicately by the unstained hem. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Well, you certainly outdid 
                        yourself.

           She sets the panties aside, then reaches inside the ill-fated 
           briefcase and pulls the photographs out. 

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got the son of a bitch.

           Tyler is straddling a folding chair across from her. His arms 
           are folded over the top slat with one hand intertwined in his 
           messy brown hair. 

                                 TYLER
                        I tell you what, Corrie. You’ve got 
                        him. Not me. I want nothing 
                        whatever to do with him. I don’t 
                        want to talk to him. To see him. To 
                        even hear his voice.

                                 CORRIE
                        I do. I want to watch his face when 
                        I tell him. 

           She studies the pictures clinically one by one before setting 
           each down. Tyler watches his sister; he’s touched with pity.

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        Why are you looking at me like 
                        that?

                                 TYLER
                        I was thinking I’ve known you all 
                        my life, and yet I don’t know you 
                        at all. 

                                 CORRIE
                        There’s nothing to know. I get up, 
                        I work, I do the housework. I go to 
                        bed. Then tomorrow I get up and do 
                        the same thing over again. 

           Tyler simply shakes his head which seems to infuriate Corrie. 

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know you. I don’t know 
                        where you go when you’re wandering 
                        around. What you think. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        No one’s ever known what you think. 
                        It’s like you hardly ever talk. 

                                 TYLER
                        This is absolutely crazy as shit. 
                        There is just no way he’s going to 
                        smile and start counting money into 
                        your hand. 

                                 CORRIE
                        What can he do? Run to the law? 
                        There’s nothing he can do but pay 
                        up. Put yourself in his shoes. 

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t want in his shoes. And if I 
                        was I’d cut my throat.

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - THE NEXT DAY

           Thunder booms as obese rain drops ricochet off the glittering 
           bricks of the ostentatious mortuary. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Corrie is sitting in a contoured lounge with Better Homes and 
           Garden in her hand. MS. CECIL (60) watches her disapprovingly 
           from behind a bureaucratic desk. 

                                 MS. CECIL
                        What was it about?

                                 CORRIE
                        It was about me seeing Fenton 
                        Breece.

                                 MS. CECIL 
                        Perhaps I could help you.

                                 CORRIE
                        You couldn’t unless you’re Fenton 
                        Breece, and I don’t believe you 
                        are. 

           Ms. Cecil feels her punctually coiffed and blueish hair as if 
           it were ruffled by the precocious girl.

                                 MS. CECIL
                        I reckon you’ll have to wait then. 
                        Mr. Breece is a busy man. 
                                 CORRIE
                        You have no idea. 

           The outer door opens and Breece himself enters. He’s dripping 
           wet from the slantwise rain falling outside. 

                                 FENTON
                        Messy out. 

           He folds his umbrella and places it in the nearby wastebasket 
           to drain. His pale hand smooths a misplaced wing of hair. 

                                 MS. CECIL
                        A lady to see you.

           Breece turns to find Corrie; a moment of recognition flickers 
           in his eyes. He looks back to the woman behind the desk, then 
           down to his rose-gold Rolex.  

                                 FENTON
                        You can go any time, Ms. Cecil.
                            (to Corrie)
                        My office is back here. 

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Corrie sits in an antique armchair with her hands clutched in 
           her lap. Her eyes are unwavering and fierce.  

                                 CORRIE
                        You buried my father.

           Breece is fixed on the fullness of her lips and the sharpness 
           of her clavicle.  

                                 FENTON
                            (nodding)
                        Mann Tyler.

                                 CORRIE
                        He had an insurance. We paid for an 
                        eight hundred dollar vault to go 
                        over his casket, and it’s not there 
                        anymore. 

           Breece stands up and crosses the oak floor. He peers down the 
           hall and shuts the door. He returns to his chair.  

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        Just not there. And that’s not all. 
                        He’s buried without all the clothes 
                        we bought for him, and he’s been... 
                        mutilated. 
           A tic begins to pulsate at the corner of one bulging eye like 
           something monstrous is stirring beneath his flesh. 

                                 FENTON
                        Absurd. I’m a reputable 
                        businessman. My work is exemplary, 
                        a matter of pride to me, and you 
                        are treading on dangerous legal 
                        ground if you intend to accuse me 
                        of misconduct.

           Corrie leans forward with her elbows on her knees. She smiles 
           slightly as the word twists in her mouth. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Misconduct? 

                                 FENTON
                        Dangerous ground indeed. A matter 
                        to be taken up with my counsel. 

           Breece reaches for the rotary phone on the opposite corner of 
           his desk. Corrie leans back unaffected as he begins to dial.  

                                 CORRIE
                        We dug him up.

                                 FENTON
                            (stopping)
                        You what?

                                 CORRIE
                        We dug him up. We had reason to 
                        suspect something was wrong with 
                        his burial, and we were proved 
                        right. Then just to be sure we dug 
                        up several more. I forget how many. 
                        I don’t even want to think about 
                        the things we found. No one would 
                        expect to find the things we did. 

           Breece looks directly at Corrie, desperately trying to remain 
           stoic in the face of her accusation. 

                                 FENTON
                        Graverobbers. Vandals digging up 
                        graves and committing atrocities. 
                        I’ve heard of such things--
                                 CORRIE
                        I’ve heard of them myself. But none 
                        where these vandals took pictures 
                        of you and a bunch of naked dead 
                        women and hid them in your 
                        briefcase.

           His eyes dart away; they are hard glassy blue and as slick as 
           wet marbles. Lightning crashes outside.

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re finished. You don’t begin to 
                        expect how finished you are.

                                 FENTON
                        What do you want?

                                 CORRIE
                        I want the things done to my daddy 
                        made right. I want him buried with 
                        decency.

                                 FENTON
                        Of course. If you aren’t satisfied, 
                        I’ll do anything to satisfy you.

                                 CORRIE
                        I’m a hell of a way from satisfied.

                                 FENTON
                        I’ll refund your money. No question 
                        about that. I could even give you a 
                        liberal sum for what they call 
                        punitive damages.

                                 CORRIE
                        And what would you expect in return 
                        for that? 

           Breece shamefully notes her secondhand clothing and the cheap 
           arrowhead necklace around her throat. 

                                 FENTON
                        The pictures, of course. I’d have 
                        to have them back. They’re subject 
                        to misunderstanding, a delicate 
                        subject, part of an experiment. 

                                 CORRIE
                        I expect you’re right about that. I 
                        was wonderin about the panties. Are 
                        they part of the experiment too?
           One hand trembles violently. Breece tries to stay it with the 
           other. His cheeks turn crimson. 

                                 FENTON
                        I’d want your agreement to remain 
                        silent. I’d have to have it in 
                        writing. I have a position in the 
                        community, a reputation to 
                        maintain. 

                                 CORRIE
                        I want twenty thousand dollars. 
                        That’s nothing to you, but pocket 
                        change. 

                                 FENTON
                        Whatever you call it, it’s 
                        extortion. Blackmail. Both of them 
                        are against the law. 

                                 CORRIE
                        All right. We both go before a 
                        grand jury and tell our stories. 
                        We’ll see how it all comes out when 
                        they dig up a grave or two. 

                                 FENTON
                        I may have to convert some bonds 
                        into cash.

                                 CORRIE
                        Then you’d best be converting. 
                        We’ll be waiting on you. 

           Corrie rises. As she is halfway toward the door, Breece makes 
           some curious strangled noise. 

                                 FENTON
                        You must think I’m terrible.

           Corrie doesn’t have an answer for that. She walks through the 
           door and pulls it shut. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Corrie exits onto the curved driveway. She looks up and feels 
           the rain course down her cheeks as if grasping the soon to be 
           freedom from this town.  
           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Breece sits unmoving. He shuts his eyes hoping an alternative 
           will rescue him. Dusk gathers at the windows.

           Finally he opens his eyes and reaches underneath the stack of 
           papers on his desk. He slides out The Centre Sentinel. 

           Its headline reads LOCAL MAN ACQUITTED OF MURDER. Measures of 
           peace slowly return to his face. 

                                 FENTON
                        Granville Sutter. 

           EXT. DARLA’S BOUTIQUE - THE NEXT DAY

           Granville Sutter is leaning against the column supporting the 
           striped awning.

           His face is reflected in the window. High cheekbones with the 
           leathery skin pulled taut over them. A blade for a nose. Eyes 
           brown and flecked in their depths with gold. 

           An austere MOTHER and her two CHILDREN are approaching on the 
           sidewalk. Upon seeing Granville, they turn to walk on the far 
           side of the street. 

           INT. DARLA’S BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS

           LORENE CONKLE (55) fingers a dress and peeks covertly through 
           the glass. Granville there. He catches her looking and levels 
           his stare directly at her.

                                 CLERK (O.C.)
                        Was it something I could help you 
                        with?

           Startled, Lorene turns to find a prissy little CLERK standing 
           behind her.

                                 LORENE
                        I reckon not right now.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Lorene exits to discover Granville standing on the corner. He 
           is looking across the street and refuses to make eye-contact.

                                 LORENE
                        I seen you parked across the street 
                        from my house a few days ago. 
                                 GRANVILLE
                        I was just visitin a feller lives 
                        down there.

                                 LORENE
                        I want you to let me be. And my 
                        husband Clyde, too. If I ever 
                        mention to him--

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Why don’t you just mention it to 
                        Clyde?

                                 LORENE
                        He couldn’t help being on that 
                        jury, and he couldn’t help voting 
                        what he knew was right. What does 
                        it matter anyway? You got out of 
                        it.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        It took a year out of my life. Two 
                        trials. I’d of been acquitted the 
                        first time if your old man hadn’t 
                        been bound and determined to send 
                        me to Brushy Mountain. Eleven votin 
                        not guilty and he had to hang the 
                        jury.

                                 LORENE
                        Yeah. Eleven people afraid you’d 
                        burn them out like you did old Mrs. 
                        Todd.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You think I burnt that old woman’s 
                        house?

                                 LORENE
                        I know good and well you did. And 
                        so does everybody else. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You believe too much of what you 
                        hear.

           Granville leans closer to Lorene; his face twists hostile and 
           his eyes narrow. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        You think you’re better than me 
                        cause your old man owns a 
                        drugstore. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Wears a little white apron and 
                        mixes up pills all day behind a 
                        counter. Yes, ma’am. No, ma’am. I 
                        reckon you think your shit don’t 
                        stink.

                                 LORENE
                        You watch your nasty little mouth 
                        with me or I will go to the law. 
                        And yes, I do think I’m better than 
                        you. Not because of my husband but 
                        because I mind my own business.

           He leans back and grins like the Cheshire Cat; Lorene becomes 
           increasingly aghast with his sudden changes in expression.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Aww, you got me all wrong. You was 
                        to get to know me better you 
                        wouldn’t be so down on me. You 
                        right nice lookin. A little long in 
                        the tooth, but you’re holdin up 
                        alright. Me and you just might get 
                        together sometime.

           Lorene’s face goes white. She whirls around and walks blindly 
           in the other direction.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        So long, widow Conkle.

                                 LORENE
                            (without stopping)
                        I’m not a widow.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Not yet. 

           Lorene stops. She turns and raises her hand to shade her eyes 
           from the setting sun.

           INT. TYLER TRUCK - AFTERNOON

           Tyler is behind the wheel and Corrie sits shotgun; The Bobcat 
           Bar is a shabby visage outside her window. She opens the door 
           and starts to exit. 

                                 TYLER
                        Wait... 

                                 CORRIE
                        What?
                                 TYLER
                        Are you sure you want to do this?

           Corrie sits back to look at Tyler, but doesn’t shut her door. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I could figure something else out 
                        if you give me a few days. 

                                 CORRIE
                        I love you, Kenneth, but I’d rather 
                        die than spend another day in this 
                        godforsaken town.  

           INT. THE BOBCAT BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Corrie enters. JOE CREED (38) is behind the bar serving beers 
           and slinging stiff cocktails.

                                 JOE
                        Where the hell you been? You left 
                        me high and dry two days now. 

                                 CORRIE
                        I’m here to quit. 

                                 JOE
                        You’re fuckin jokin?

                                 CORRIE
                        Does it look like it? I got better 
                        places to be.  

                                 JOE
                        You can shove it up your ass, 
                        Corrie. 

           Corrie smiles with a certain sense of satisfaction. She turns 
           and exits without another word. 

           EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is dark and isolated. Drizzle falls. Breece waddles 
           up the cobblestone walk and looks at his dainty watch.  

           He knocks on the front door. Almost directly the tiny antique 
           peephole opens. A gold-flecked eye peers out. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Whoever sent for you lied. I’m 
                        still alive and kickin.
                                 FENTON
                        I need to talk to you on business.
                        Let me in. It’s cold out here. 

           The door opens. Granville is still wearing all black as if he 
           slept in his clothes. Or not slept at all.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Breece wanders around in the half-dark and seats himself in a 
           rocker by the fire. He spreads his hands to its warmth. 

                                 FENTON
                        Turning colder.

           Granville grabs a chair from the eating table and drops it on 
           the other side of Breece.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I could of stuck my head out the 
                        door and told you that. You didn’t 
                        drive all the way out here to give 
                        me a weather report.

                                 FENTON
                        Like I told you, it’s business. 
                        Someone has something that belongs 
                        to me, and I’m being blackmailed. 
                        I’ve got to have it back, and I 
                        think you’re the man to get it. 

           Granville begins to roll himself a cigarette. Breece covertly 
           steals glances at his bony face. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Who is it?

                                 FENTON
                        A brother and a sister named Tyler. 
                        The girl is the one who actually 
                        approached me about the money, but 
                        the young man is the one who stole 
                        the article out of my house. That’s 
                        what I want back, and I’m willing 
                        to pay for it.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        The article?

                                 FENTON
                        Yes.
                                 GRANVILLE
                        Say I try to do it for you. Do I 
                        get to know what the article is, or 
                        do I just wander around finding 
                        things that look like they might 
                        have belonged to you.

                                 FENTON
                        Of course, you’ll know what it is.

                                 GRANVILLE
                            (lighting his cigarette)
                        Then let me in on it. 

                                 FENTON
                        All right. Some photographs were 
                        taken of myself and a...young lady. 
                        They are potentially very damaging. 
                        The photographs are of a very 
                        incriminating...a very intimate 
                        nature. The young woman is 
                        connected politically, and they are 
                        threatening to go to her husband if 
                        I don’t pay them twenty thousand 
                        dollars. 

           Granville appears impressed with the obvious lie. He allows a 
           small smile as smoke escapes from his lips.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Of course, we both know that’s 
                        bullshit. But it’s your business 
                        what you done and what specie of 
                        animal you done it with. Pictures 
                        then. If they’re as bad as you say, 
                        why don’t you just give them the 
                        twenty thousand dollars? That’s 
                        chickenfeed to you.

                                 FENTON
                        If it were simply a matter of the 
                        money, I’d pay it and be done with 
                        it. However...there was something 
                        in the Tyler’s woman’s eyes. It was 
                        clear she means to ruin me. She’ll 
                        take the money and then want more. 
                            (for affect)
                        There was a vindictiveness in her 
                        face. Utter viciousness. 
                                 GRANVILLE
                        Wait a minute. Let me guess. You 
                        was doin things of an incriminating 
                        nature to this Tyler gal, and then 
                        your attention wandered to this gal 
                        who was politically connected, and 
                        the Tyler gal got pissed and aims 
                        to run you out of the undertakin 
                        business.

                                 FENTON
                        It’s not necessary to ridicule me.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Then quit actin like I’m a goddamn 
                        fool. Quit jerkin me around and get 
                        on with it.

                                 FENTON
                        Very well. I’ll give you the money. 
                        All twenty thousand dollars, half 
                        now and the rest when I have the 
                        pictures.

           Granville spits into the flames. He shoots Breece a harrowing 
           look. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        It’s not just the pictures. They’ve 
                        got some kind of deathlock on you 
                        and you want it off. You want me to 
                        kill them.

                                 FENTON
                        No, no, certainly not. I can’t 
                        condone murder, hire murder done.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Sure you can. You just don’t want 
                        to know about it. You don’t even 
                        want to say it. You want me to do 
                        it for you. 

           Breece is quiet for a moment. He studies the hypnotic flicker 
           of the fire.

                                 FENTON
                        How many...how many people have you 
                        killed?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You don’t owe me for them. 
                                 FENTON
                        Will you tell me that if I tell you 
                        something of my own past?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        What is this, you show me yours and 
                        I show you mine? I don’t care about 
                        your past.

                                 FENTON
                        I killed someone myself once, while 
                        I was still in college. I killed a 
                        whore in Memphis.

           Granville gives Breece a quick glance of dismissal as he lays 
           another stick of wood in the sparkling coals.

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        I killed her with a Pop-Cola 
                        bottle.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        What’d she do, run out on you and 
                        you busted her head with it? 

           Breece falls silent; his eyes glaze over as he looks off into 
           this curious memory. 

                                 FENTON
                        Oh, it wasn’t anything like that.
                        She took to bleeding. You never saw 
                        so much blood. The bedclothes were 
                        soaked, white sheets with great 
                        crimson centers, like flowers...the 
                        bottle broke something loose inside 
                        her, punctured her in there 
                        somewhere, and all the blood ran 
                        out of her. 

           Granville eyes him with confusion, then his face furrows when 
           comprehension overcomes him.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I don’t want to hear anymore of 
                        this perverted shit. You just keep 
                        anymore stories you got about Pop-
                        Cola bottles to yourself. 

           Breece casually laces his fingers across his corpulent belly. 

                                 FENTON
                        Did it ever occur to you that we’re 
                        a lot alike?
                                 GRANVILLE
                        Let me get this straight. You want 
                        the pictures and you want it hushed 
                        up.

                                 FENTON
                        Yes, that’s what I want.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Give me the money.

                                 FENTON
                        I’ll have to get it from the bank. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Alright. Tomorrow, then. 

           Breece rises. He stands awkwardly for a moment as if about to 
           proffer a hand to seal this bargain.

                                 FENTON
                        I’ve kept you up long enough. 

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Granville lies down on his bed still fully clothed. He clasps 
           his hands behind his head and stares at the ceiling. Darkness 
           surrounds his face.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        All these sons of bitches.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - THE NEXT DAY

           Gasoline washes paint brushes and red ochre hits the pavement 
           as if it were the throat-blood of a hapless pig. 

           Tyler flicks the brushes clean and turns to place them in the 
           bed of his truck. The trim on the rooftop behind him is fresh 
           and wet. 

                                 DE VRIES (O.C.)
                        You done me a good job. 

           He turns to find DE VRIES (56) standing behind him, carefully 
           thumbing through bills in his wallet. 

                                 TYLER
                        It’s painted, anyway. 

           De Vries counts cash into Tyler’s hand. He holds a ten poised 
           in midair with hesitation, then places it atop the others. 
                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        That’s ten more than we agreed.

                                 DE VRIES
                        You stayed with it, Tyler.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you, sir. You hear of anybody 
                        else wants anything done, try to 
                        get word to me. 

           Tyler turns for the driver’s door of his truck, but something 
           in De Vries’s manner causes him to hesitate. He looks back. 

                                 DE VRIES
                        Yeah. Hold on a minute. It’s a 
                        feller been hanging around out 
                        front waitin for you to get done. 

           EXT. DE VRIES HARDWARE - MOMENTS LATER

           The bench in front of the store sits empty. Granville hunkers 
           beside it, calmly smoking.

                                 TYLER
                        You looking for me? I’m Tyler. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I know who you are. You old Moose’s 
                        boy. You don’t look much like him. 
                        Old Moose was heavy and built right 
                        close to the ground. You kinda 
                        rangy. Must of took after your 
                        mama’s side of the family. 

           Tyler is momentarily caught off balance; he studies Granville 
           as if measuring his size against his own.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Or who knows? Maybe you do look 
                        like your daddy. Names and blood 
                        don’t always go arm in arm. 

                                 TYLER
                        You might ought to watch your 
                        mouth.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Follow me, Tyler. 

           Granville starts walking toward the railroad tracks and after 
           a moment, Tyler falls in behind him. 
           EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Granville sits on the staircase and rolls himself a cigarette 
           while watching TWO BLACK MEN unload boxes from a flatbed onto 
           a train car. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I asked around about you. When the 
                        feller told me what he told me.

                                 TYLER
                        What fellow told you what? I don’t 
                        know what you’re talking about. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        The feller whose property you 
                        stole. He wants it back. I been 
                        studyin about you, Tyler. I keep 
                        askin myself, what’s a boy who’s 
                        sharp in school doin tryin to 
                        blackmail Fenton Breece out of 
                        twenty thousand dollars.

           Granville licks the paper and removes a piece of tobacco from 
           his tongue. He lights his cigarette. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Course a man can get the bigeye 
                        thinkin about all that money. I can 
                        understand that. All he wants is 
                        the pictures back.

                                 TYLER
                        Pictures of what?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Course I took into consideration 
                        maybe it wasn’t all your doin. 
                        Maybe you just easy led, and I 
                        ought to went to your sister to 
                        begin with.

                                 TYLER
                        You leave Corrie out of this. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        What it is, you don’t quite see the 
                        whole picture. You’ve got some idea 
                        about Fenton Breece and you’re 
                        judgin me by him. Fat and soft and 
                        very likely some specie of queer. 
                        Let’s get it straight right now 
                        that me and him ain’t nothin alike. 
                                 TYLER
                        What’s he paying you?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I won’t lie to you. He’s payin me 
                        plenty. Because he’s got a lot to 
                        lose and because he thinks I can 
                        stop up the holes where it’s 
                        spillin out. And make no mistake 
                        about it, Tyler, I can. I’m the fix-
                        it man, and you’re the problem I 
                        been hired to fix. 

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t have them. 

           Granville stands. He flicks his cigarette onto the ground and 
           faces Tyler, trapping him against the steps’ iron railing. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        But you know where they live. 
                        Whatever you have to do, you better 
                        get your mind right to do it.

                                 TYLER
                        I got to get on. 

           Tyler turns toward the street, but Granville GRABS his biceps 
           and YANKS him back.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Not just yet.

           Tyler tries to break free, but Granville LOCKS onto his other 
           biceps and SLAMS him into the iron railing with a BANG. Tyler 
           momentarily loses his breath.  

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Think about this. I’ll do what I 
                        have to do. It’s a hell of a lot of 
                        money, and it would move me pretty 
                        far down the line, and it looks 
                        like I need to be there. All these 
                        sons of bitches. I’m goin to lay 
                        some folks out to cool if I have 
                        to, and I don’t particularly care 
                        who. But what I want you to think 
                        about is the worst thing that can 
                        happen. You know when somethin bad 
                        happens, how folks kind of console 
                        one another. They say, well, it 
                        could of been worse. Well, not this 
                        time. Believe it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        I am absolutely the worst thing 
                        that can happen to you.

                                 TYLER
                        I just don’t know. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You better know. If you don’t it’ll 
                        be on your head. 

                                 TYLER
                        What will?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Whatever happens. Whatever it 
                        takes. It’s enough that you know 
                        that Fenton Breece ain’t the only 
                        man can bury the dead, and the 
                        grave ain’t the only place to put 
                        em.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corrie and Tyler face off in her room. Dried flowers decorate 
           the walls and candles are half-burnt on the bureau.

                                 TYLER
                        We’re going to the law.

                                 CORRIE
                        No, we aren’t. That would be the 
                        end of it. The money and 
                        everything. This is our last chance 
                        to get away from this town.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m watching out for you. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Granville Sutter is bluffing. 
                        Trying to scare us.

                                 TYLER
                        You didn’t hear him. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Think what it would be like, 
                        Kenneth. Us somewhere else, some 
                        big city where no one knows our 
                        names. No more harassment. No more 
                        eviction notices. With all that 
                        money. Doing what we please. You 
                        could even go to college.

                            (pause)
                        Besides the law won’t help us. 

           Tyler studies his sister and discovers a palpable desperation 
           in her eyes; it seems rationality is impossible for her.  

                                 TYLER
                        Give me the pictures.

                                 CORRIE
                        What are you going to do with them? 

                                 TYLER
                            (reluctant)
                        Hide them. Just in case. 

           Corrie exits her room. When she comes back in, she places the 
           photographs on the bureau.  

                                 CORRIE
                        It will work out. 

           Tyler takes a TOBACCO TIN from his shirt pocket and slips the 
           photos delicately inside. He wordlessly leaves the room. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Deputy Harlan walks down a corridor led by his fiery red hair 
           and aquiline nose with a bundle of warrants under his arm. He 
           goes through a side door and descends a staircase. 

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Harlan enters the basement to see Tyler sitting on a bench in 
           the distance; he has a bottle of Coke in his hands. 

           Harlan stops at the door closest to Tyler; it’s marked in big 
           black letters Sheriff’s Office. He fumbles with his keys. 

                                 HARLAN
                        You want something?

                                 TYLER
                        I wanted to see Sheriff Odel.

                                 HARLAN
                        He ain’t in.

                                 TYLER
                        I figured.
                                 HARLAN
                        I’m a duly sworn Deputy Sheriff. If 
                        it’s got anything to do with the 
                        law, you can take it up with me. 

                                 TYLER
                        When do you reckon he’ll be back?

                                 HARLAN
                        Odel will come when he comes.

           Harlan unlocks the door and walks inside. Just as quickly, he 
           walks back out, locks the door and saunters away. 

           Tyler watches him go and takes a big sip of his Coke. He sets 
           the bottle down - 2/3 full. 

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           The bottle sits totally empty when Harlan returns through the 
           side door with Sheriff Odel in tow. 

           Again, they approach the door marked Sheriff’s Office. Harlan 
           unlocks it and glances toward Tyler.

                                 HARLAN (CONT’D)
                        Him.

                                 ODEL
                            (skeptical)
                        Uh-huh. 

           Sheriff Odel goes inside the office. Harlan nods for Tyler to 
           follow.

                                 HARLAN
                        You better not waste his time.  

           EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - DAY

           Granville is sitting underneath a great walnut tree. He trims 
           his fingernails with a switchblade knife.

           A county car pulls into the driveway. Deputy Harlan exits and 
           crosses the cobblestone drive with a SEARCH WARRANT under his 
           arm. He squats in front of Granville.

                                 GRANVILLE
                            (without looking up)
                        Harlan.
                                 HARLAN
                        I heard something you might be 
                        interested in. 

           Granville continues pairing his nails in silence; Harlan eyes 
           this curious task.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Well, are you going to tell me, or 
                        are we playin guessin games?

                                 HARLAN
                        You remember that state prosecutor 
                        you got into it with at your trial? 
                        Schieweiller? He’s trying to get 
                        you a new trial, and get it moved 
                        out of the county. He’s workin with 
                        Sheriff Bellwether, over at 
                        Ackerman’s Field. 

           Harlan hands the warrant to Granville. He clinches his jaw as 
           he reads Ackerman’s Field on top and the signature of Sheriff 
           Bellwether below.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Hellfire. They can’t try me again 
                        on that. They done tried me on it 
                        twice already and it done got 
                        throwed out. 

                                 HARLAN
                        Well. They claimin jury tamperin. 
                        Perjury too, what I hear. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Jury tamperin. I never tampered 
                        with one of them son of a bitches. 
                        Never had to. They was already 
                        scared shitless.

                                 HARLAN
                        I just told you what come down. 
                        Like I always do. Watch out for 
                        Bellwether. He’s a sanctimonious 
                        shit.  

           Granville shoves the switchblade knife into the soil and sets 
           the warrant down.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        All these sons of bitches. Push and 
                        push and keep on and I’ve had about 
                        all I want of it. 
                                 HARLAN
                        It’ll be my ass they ever catch me 
                        out here. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I appreciate you warnin me, Harlan.

           Still Harlan sits, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down every 
           time he swallows. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Was there somethin else?

                                 HARLAN
                        The Tyler boy came by.

           Granville gazes past Harlan, his gold-flecked eyes peering at 
           the setting sun.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        He did, did he? 

           EXT. HAGGIS HOUSE - DUSK

           Two weathered stone lions stand guard a gate which is bent on 
           one canted hinge. Tyler ambles up the concrete walk; he hears 
           soft jazz playing inside. 

           He raps on the peeling door. The porchlight comes alive above 
           his head and the door creaks open. HAGGIS (35) looks at Tyler 
           from behind thick glasses; he is holding a book of poetry. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        Kenneth?

                                 TYLER
                        Hello, Mr. Haggis.

           Haggis looks back into the house. He closes the door slightly 
           to prevent Tyler from seeing inside. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        I thought you were in Knoxville.

                                 TYLER
                        Well. No. Not yet. Maybe next 
                        semester. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        If you wanted to talk about it, 
                        this is not really a good time for 
                        me. Could you come back tomorrow? 
                        Perhaps in the afternoon?
                                 TYLER
                        I did want to talk to you, but not 
                        about that. Could I come in for a 
                        few minutes? I need to talk to you 
                        about Fenton Breece.

                                 HAGGIS
                        Fenton Breece?

           MR. BRANDT (40) appears behind Haggis. He’s an effeminate man 
           in a starkly pressed shirt and pants.  

                                 BRANDT
                        Hello Kenneth.

           There is a weird mixture of humility and defiance on Haggis’s 
           face as he looks back at his lover. Realization hits Tyler.

                                 HAGGIS
                        You remember Mr. Brandt from the 
                        junior high.

                                 TYLER
                        Yes. Hello. 

           Haggis smiles quick and neurotic and steps outside. He closes 
           the door, leaving Mr. Brandt inside. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        I had him over to discuss some 
                        poetry and we decided to have a 
                        bite to eat.
                            (beat)
                        You know how things are. 

                                 TYLER
                        I’d better get on. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        Well, if you must, then I suppose 
                        you must. I hope it wasn’t anything 
                        urgent?

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll let you get back to your 
                        guest.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A black Ford Bronco sits off the side of a homemade road. The 
           dark figure behind the wheel brings a flask to his lips. 
           INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS

           Granville doesn’t even show the faintest sign of a grimace as 
           the liquor hits his mouth. He tilts his head back and guzzles 
           the flask dry. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                            (opening the door)
                        Time to move myself down the line.

           EXT. TYLER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Corrie stands on the porch, backlit from the lights emanating 
           within.

           An angular shadow appears in the distance. He walks closer to 
           the house. Corrie sees the scoped rifle held aloft across his 
           chest. 

           Granville. As he approaches the fence, he makes no attempt at 
           the gate but simply steps over it.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Hidy. 

           Corrie attempts to appear strong as Granville takes the first 
           step onto the porch and stops.   

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        I been waitin up there in my 
                        Bronco. I been kinda holdin off 
                        thinkin he’d come, but I don’t 
                        think he’s goin to. 

           He lowers his rifle and sets its stock atop his haggard black 
           boot. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Then you ain’t seen him?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Not today, little sister. Ain’t you 
                        goin to ask me in for supper?

                                 CORRIE
                        No. I don’t know what you’re doin 
                        here in the first place. Kenneth’ll 
                        run you off when he gets in.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Kenneth couldn’t run water through 
                        a garden hose. 
           Granville treads onto the edge of the porch; his gold-flecked 
           eyes are as compassionless as a cat’s.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go in.

           He grabs her arm, but she JERKS away and spins around to slap 
           him, then thinks better of it. 

           She quickly moves through the front door and tries to slam it 
           shut, but Granville KICKS it violently.  

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Corrie FLIES down beneath the power of his foot thrusting the 
           door open. She HITS her head against an end table and TUMBLES 
           to the floor. 

           Granville enters and shuts the door. He casually sets his gun 
           against the wall, then looks at Corrie apathetically.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Let’s cut through the front part 
                        and go right to the end. The front 
                        part is where I ask for the 
                        pictures and you tell me you don’t 
                        know what I’m talkin about. None of 
                        that is in question. I know you got 
                        em. Now come up with em before you 
                        do somethin to put me in a bad 
                        mood. 

           Corrie rises to her hands and knees. A solitary drop of BLOOD 
           falls from her hairline and splatters into a crimson star. 

                                 CORRIE
                        You can kiss my ass.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Temptin as that offer is, I’m goin 
                        to have to let it slide. Maybe 
                        later. I hardly ever mix business 
                        with pleasure. 

           She glances at Granville; more BLOOD dribbles to the linoleum 
           floor.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s have em. Where are they?

                                 CORRIE
                        Where you’ll never find them.
           He GRABS Corrie by the hair, YANKS her to her feet and TWISTS 
           the blonde locks back. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Well, we’ll see.

           Corrie begins to cry. Granville SLAPS her and MUCUS and BLOOD 
           sling across her face. 

                                 CORRIE
                        Kenneth’ll kill you. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        It’s been tried before. By better 
                        man than he is. I figured you for a 
                        harder case than this. Folks into 
                        blackmailin and extortion need a 
                        harder shell than what you’ve 
                        shown. 

                                 CORRIE
                        You ought to know. 

           Granville releases Corrie and she falls to the floor. He goes 
           to the chest of drawers and dumps each one onto the linoleum.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Be puttin this shit up.

           He walks into the kitchen and begins rifling through cabinets 
           as Corrie rises listlessly.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                            (returning)
                        What’s them pictures show, anyway?

                                 CORRIE
                        Just dead folks.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Dead folks? Why’s he wantin 
                        pictures of dead people so bad?

           Corrie shakes her head mutely. She bends over to pick up some 
           fallen papers and stifles a sob. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Is he screwin dead women or what?

           Corrie looks at Granville. He walks across the room and stops 
           awfully close; she stammers back in fright. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you got em on you.
                                 CORRIE
                        I’m not that stupid.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        It might be fun to look.

                                 CORRIE
                        How much is he paying you?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Doesn’t matter.

                                 CORRIE
                        They’re worth a lot. Me and Kenneth 
                        will give you five thousand dollars 
                        and all you got to do is leave us 
                        alone. 

           He looks at her cunningly. Corrie grows more afraid; her eyes 
           flutter to the floor. 

                                 CORRIE (CONT’D)
                        Half, then.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        It’s a hard fact that half of 
                        nothin is nothin. That’s what you 
                        got and that’s what you’re going to 
                        wind up with. 

           Granville GRABS her blouse, one hand on each collar. He YANKS 
           and the buttons POP off.

                                 CORRIE
                        Please...

           He unpockets his switchblade and presses the pearl button. He 
           slips the blade in between her breasts.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Let’s see what’s under here.

           Granville PULLS the knife outward and the narrow edge of cold 
           steel SLICES her bra strap. He uncovers her breasts and feels 
           them clinically.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        No pictures here. Nothin here but 
                        titties.

                                 CORRIE
                        You’re going to pay for this, you 
                        son of a bitch. 
           Suddenly the clamor of a truck is heard laboring up the drive 
           and Granville turns; headlights sweep across his face.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        He got a gun in that truck?

                                 CORRIE
                        I don’t know what he’s got.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You holler and I swear I’ll kill 
                        you. I’ll cut your throat, then 
                        hide behind the door and cut his.

           EXT. TYLER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler exits his pickup and crosses the front porch. He has an 
           old thermos bottle in one hand and a toolbelt in the other. 

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler enters and stands framed darkly against the night, eyes 
           growing wide as he takes in everything at once.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I don’t believe you thought I was 
                        serious.

           Granville stands behind Corrie. He holds her left arm TWISTED 
           behind her shoulders with the blade of his knife PRESSED into 
           the flesh of her throat. Her right breast remains exposed. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        She can’t keep her clothes on. 
                        Somethin about me affects women 
                        that way. 

                                 TYLER
                        I told you to leave Corrie out of 
                        this. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        She’d had mine off, you hadn’t 
                        shown up when you did. 

           He releases Corrie and steps away. He pushes the pearl button 
           to close the blade. 

                                 TYLER
                        Sooner or later I am fixing to kill 
                        you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TYLER (CONT'D)
                        You had no business going after my 
                        sister any such chickenshit way as 
                        this. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Whatever works. 

           Tyler HURLS the thermos at Granville, but Granville sidesteps 
           it; the bottle CRASHES loudly against the wall. 

           Tyler rushes Granville and THUMPS his rib cage, but Granville 
           remains unaffected and SLAMS a LEFT HOOK into the boy’s jaw. 

           Rising up, Tyler SWINGS his toolbelt and Granville catches it 
           one-handed. He JERKS forward. Tyler stumbles and meets a huge 
           UPPERCUT to the abdomen - WHOOSH! 

           Tyler falls to the floor. He rolls over GASPING, desperate to 
           catch his breath. Granville eyes him half-amused as he ambles 
           over to his rifle and picks it up. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Now get out the memory box and 
                        let’s take a look at them old 
                        family pictures. 

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t have them.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You think I just fell off the 
                        haywagon? Shit, Tyler, you can do 
                        better than that. 

                                 TYLER
                        I went to the law with them. 
                        Sheriff Odel’s got them. I told him 
                        the whole thing and they’re going 
                        to be looking for you. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Fact is, I know you went to the 
                        law. But you went with some cock-
                        and-bull story about me and your 
                        floozy sister. Harlan done talked 
                        to me about it. We had a laugh. 

                                 TYLER
                        There is just no way you can get 
                        away with this. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        We’re in the process of getting 
                        away with it right now. 
           Tyler glances at Corrie; she is sitting against the wall with 
           her knees pulled close.  

                                 CORRIE
                        Don’t tell him. 

                                 TYLER
                        They’re in the truck. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        We’ll see if they are. You go 
                        first. Little sister stays with me. 
                        You try anything even approachin 
                        what you done a minute ago, she 
                        gets another slit cut in a place 
                        where she’s got no use for one. 

           EXT. TYLER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The truck is facing the house with the passenger door closest 
           to the porch.

                                 TYLER
                        They’re taped under the dash. If 
                        you want them, you’ll have to get 
                        them out. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Not in a million fuckin years. 

           Tyler reluctantly opens the door. He lays across the seat and 
           fumbles underneath the dashboard. The TOBACCO TIN is taped to 
           the backside of his radio.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s gone.

           Involuntarily Granville leans forward to look and Tyler KICKS 
           him the chest as hard as he can.

           Granville drops his rifle and FALLS backward. Tyler scrambles 
           behind the steering wheel. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                            (to Corrie)
                        Get the hell in here.

           INT. TYLER TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Corrie JUMPS in and tries to shut the door as Tyler turns the 
           ignition and pops the clutch. The truck SPINS in reverse. 
           Gravel flies. Tyler SLAMS the shifter into low and shoots out 
           of the driveway sideways. The rear tires fishtail against the 
           loose rock and the passenger door PITCHES open.

                                 TYLER
                        Shut the door!

           BOOM! The window ERUPTS in flying pellets of safety glass. As 
           Tyler looks back through the window, he sees Granville aiming 
           his rifle again. Tyler SMASHES his foot into the accelerator.  

                                 CORRIE
                        Kenneth!

                                 TYLER
                        Get down! Shut the door and lay 
                        down in the seat!

           Corrie hurriedly drops down, but leaves the passenger door to 
           FLOP open with each progressive BUMP of distance between them 
           and Granville. The truck speeds down the roadway.

           BOOM! The side-view mirror SHATTERS into pieces. Granville is 
           receding in the distance as the truck moves faster.

           Tyler reaches over Corrie and tries to shut the door, but the 
           truck is going too fast for an approaching curve in the road. 

           He tries to correct the SKID and the rear tires SCHOOL-HOP on 
           the packed earth violently. POP! A tire blows out. 

           The truck MOVES eerily sideways on an embankment; brush WHIPS 
           past at an alarming rate. 

           Corrie SLAMS into Tyler. The truck ROLLS upward and over in a 
           cacophony of RENDING metal and BREAKING glass. 

           The truck HITS an enormous rock and ROCKETS further upward as 
           Corrie SMASHES through the windshield and out of the cab.  

           CRUNCH! The truck PROPELS itself into a tree and stops in one 
           final OUTRAGE of SHRIEKING steel.

           Quickly Tyler scrambles off the floorboard and out the broken 
           window. 

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           He looks around wildly; BLOOD drips from his nose as he feels 
           himself for broken bones. His feral eyes stop and lock. 
           A WHITE BODY is strewn on the homemade road. Tyler jumps over 
           broken brush. He picks Corrie up by her armpits and drags her 
           toward the truck; she is totally slack. 

           Laying Corrie down, Tyler pulls his rifle out from behind the 
           passenger seat and grabs the TOBACCO TIN underneath the dash. 

           He slings the rifle over his shoulder and shoves the tin into 
           his back pocket. He hoists Corrie up and drags her toward the 
           woods as fast as he can. 

           BOOM! A bullet WALLOPS firmly into the earth. It sends chunks 
           of dirt skittering. They fall to the ground. 

           Tyler lies stock still like a shell shocked soldier. He looks 
           at Corrie. Her arms are out-flung helpless. Her eyes are open 
           with the exposed whites rolled upward. Both sticks and leaves 
           are tied up in her hair. Her cock-eyed neck is clearly broken 
           from the wreck and death sits in her colorless face. He feels 
           her pulse hopelessly.  

                                 TYLER
                            (sotto)
                        Corrie...

           Tears well in his eyes. With a heartbroken effort, Tyler rips 
           the ARROWHEAD off of her necklace. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. So sorry.  

           BOOM! Another shot ricochets off of a nearby tree. Bark flies 
           through the air. 

           Tyler gets his rifle off the ground and runs into the shelter 
           of the woods, disappearing amongst its density.   

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Tyler comes cautiously back through the tree-line to discover 
           the accident site alive with activity. 

           Varicolored lights flicker like spirit lamps. SHADOWED PEOPLE 
           move from vehicle to vehicle; disembodied voices drift out in 
           surreal fashion. 

           An ambulance moves onto the roadway and its tires slew on the 
           gravel. It meanders off toward town. 

           Another vehicle backs around and its headlights sweep through 
           the tree-line. It’s a wrecker with a revolving strobe. 
           A FIGURE at the wrecker pays out lengths of cable and carries 
           it to the totaled truck. He passes in front of the headlights 
           and Tyler recognizes him; it’s Deputy Harlan.  

           Harlan hooks the cable onto the truck’s hitch and shouts. The 
           cable grows tight and the creaking winch slowly pulls Tyler’s 
           truck off the tree it’s impaled on.

           Tyler starts walking toward Harlan, then abruptly stops as if 
           he were making the gravest discovery.   

           A second FIGURE emerges from behind the truck and motions his 
           arm in a circular fashion to pull faster. His angular body is 
           unmistakable; it’s Granville Sutter. 

           Granville approaches Harlan. He places his bony hand onto the 
           Deputy’s shoulder and whispers something into his ear; Harlan 
           nods in agreement. 

           Both men stand side by side and supervise the pickup as it is 
           pulled back onto the roadway. Tyler walks backward toward the 
           tree-line while watching this tableau of corruption unfold.

           EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - LATER

           The house is dark. A pale ribbon of smoke rises from the flue 
           and dissipates in the windless air. 

           Tyler lies in the knee-high grass beyond the perimeter of the 
           property, watching for activity. He pillows his cheek against 
           the polished walnut of his rifle and squeezes the trigger.

           BOOM! A window pane EXPLODES and glass falls into the home. A 
           moment of silence passes.

           Tyler shoots again - BOOM! It seems the place is deserted. He 
           stands and yokes the rifle across his back.  

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           CRACK! CRACK! The oak door shutters underneath the banging of 
           his rifle stock. It finally gives and swings open. 

           Tyler stands backlit with his rifle ready to shoot, but there 
           is no soul about.

           The front room is neat and austere. The dishes are washed and 
           put away in the drainboard. Tyler eyes the wood stove and can 
           see a vestigial of heat emanating within.   
           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The door is eased open by a trepidatious hand to reveal Tyler 
           standing in the frame. His eyes canvass the entire room. 

           Stabbed to the wall with a big Bowie knife is the copy of the 
           WARRANT from Harlan. 

           Tyler rips it off and eyes the county of Ackerman’s Field and 
           signature of Sheriff Bellwether. He pauses before folding the 
           warrant into his pocket. 

           He approaches the carefully-made bed and rips the quilt-cover 
           off.  

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler drops the quilt-cover onto the floor and approaches the 
           wood stove. He opens the door and looks inside.

           A bed of coals waned in their delicate cauls of ash. Suddenly 
           Tyler wrenches it over. 

           It topples onto its side in a hail of breaking stovepipes and 
           simmering coals. He scatters the coals with his foot.  

           The linoleum darkens and bubbles underneath heat. Tyler yanks 
           a window curtain from its rod and places it on top. 

           He kneels down to blow. A flame flickers and catches, a small 
           cutting edge of fire on the delicate fabric.

           He grabs the quilt and places its patched corner to the blaze 
           and steps back. It ignites. 

           EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler trudges up the slope with his rifle by his side. Behind 
           him, smoke cascades out of the windows like some heavy breath 
           of an awakened beast. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

           The ambulance lingers up the curved drive and comes to a rest 
           in front of the garish mortuary.

           Breece exits the house in a blue robe and velvet slippers. He 
           meets a MEDIC at the rear of the ambulance.   
           They open the back doors and pull the gurney out. Its legs go  
           straight and its wheels touch the pavement. Breece unzips the 
           body bag to find the lifeless face of Corrie staring at him. 

           His eyes flare as he stares back and counts the possibilities 
           of him and her together. 

           This moment is finally broken when a clipboard is pushed upon 
           him. 

                                 MEDIC
                        Sign here. 

           EXT. SUTTER HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Granville crouches before the quaking ash. He holds his hands 
           outstretched to the smoke and sits staring mutely at all that 
           is left of his burnt and leveled home. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Ready, set, go, you son of a bitch.

           He spits into the soot and rises to his feet. Granville turns 
           and marches toward his idling Bronco. 

                                                             FADE OUT.

                                      The Harrikin

           NOTE: The Harrikin is a section of the Appalachian Mountains. 
           It’s a deserted and eerie land much like the Sherwood Forest.

           EXT. HARRIKIN - ESTABLISHING - TIME LAPSE

           Tyler trudges a path long faded to a ghost-path. His rifle is 
           at his side. The timber is thick with honeysuckle and kudzu. 

           The ground is sunk with vertical mining shafts and horizontal 
           tunnels while climbing with hills and sheer limestone bluffs.

           Tyler passes abandoned farms and fallen houses with uncovered 
           ridgepoles and broken-out windows. 

           Everything is landscaped by the fallen leaves of decades past 
           and rusted mining machinery long forgot by fleeing settlers. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - DAY

           A spectral road cuts through the piney trees on the border of 
           the Harrikin. On the shoulder, a rusted fifty-gallon oil drum 
           sits.  
           From its recessed top, a great horned OWL watches Granville’s 
           Bronco approach wavering and ephemeral.  

           INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS

           Granville drives with steadfast eyes. He brings a hand-rolled 
           cigarette to his lips and exhales great plumes of smoke. 

           As he passes the fifty-gallon drum, the owl takes flight. Its 
           huge wings set off concussions above him as it disappears for 
           the world beyond.     

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           The owl circles over a ramshackle building with two gas-pumps 
           outside.  

           The field to its right is given over to an enormous graveyard 
           for wrecked automobiles. 

           Tyler crosses through the barbed-wire fence and trails a foot 
           path worn between the rows of cars; his rifle is at his side. 

           INT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler prowls the aisles and selects tinned sausages and thick 
           bars of Hershey chocolate. 

           Lastly he grabs a dripping Coke from an ice-chest and sets it 
           on the wooden counter. The tattooed old KEEP totes it up in a 
           paper sack. 

                                 TYLER
                        I need a box of .22 long rifles. 

           The keep fetches a box of shells from underneath the counter.

                                 KEEP
                        Huntin in the Harrikin?

                                 TYLER
                        Somethin like that.

                                 KEEP
                        Best be careful less you’re used to 
                        it. First time I got lost in there 
                        prowlin quail and like to never 
                        come out. Course it’s also a great 
                        place to hide. 
                            (pause)
                        Be fourteen eighty with the shells. 
           Tyler hands him a twenty and pockets the change. He grabs the 
           sack and turns for the door. 

                                 KEEP (CONT’D)
                        You hear about that girl getting 
                        herself killed over on Lick Creek? 

                                 TYLER
                        What girl?

                                 KEEP
                        Heard about it this mornin from 
                        Granville Sutter. Her and her 
                        brother both drunk and her killed 
                        when they turned the truck over. A 
                        young girl layin out dead in the 
                        woods with whiskey all over her and 
                        inside her. I’d hate to meet my 
                        maker with whiskey on my breath, 
                        wouldn’t you? 

           Tyler feels a cold point of ice on the nape of his neck as if 
           it had been stuck with an icepick. 

                                 TYLER
                        I get that close I don’t expect to 
                        have much of a breath left.

                                 KEEP
                        Make sport of me if you want to. It 
                        ain’t me found dead cut all over 
                        from a broke whiskey bottle. Nor me 
                        that’s run off and hid and bein 
                        hunted by Sheriff Odel for 
                        manslaughter neither. 

                                 TYLER
                            (softly)
                        Manslaughter? 

           The keep notices the pain in his voice which seems to cut him 
           with a sore memory of yesteryear; he shakes his head. 

                                 KEEP
                        Granville said you’d be in. Said to 
                        tell you he’d see you on the road 
                        somewheres. Although a hunted man 
                        has no place bein on the road. 

                                 TYLER
                        When was he in?

                                 KEEP
                        Not morn an half hour ago. 
           EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler hustles through the field of wrecked cars with the sack 
           under his arm. 

           From behind a totalled Lincoln, Granville watches him go down 
           the blued length of his rifle barrel. He lays a cheek against 
           the stock, stares into the scope and aligns the crosshairs. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                            (sotto)
                        Bang. 

           But he does not shoot. Tyler continues to hurry past the dead 
           vehicles, totally unaware. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                            (lowering the rifle)
                        Fuck it. I’ll get you where folks 
                        ain’t so thick. 

           INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

           In a hushed world of locked doors and drawn shades, Breece is 
           dragging his television across the hardwood floor. 

           Its feet make little skidmarks on the waxed oak. Breece walks 
           around to its back-side, and begins shoving it with his heavy 
           shoulder toward a double door. 

           INT. EMBALMING PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

           Breece props the doors wide and stands for a moment breathing 
           hard and perspiring almost audibly. 

           The parlor has become more of a Badgers Den with a collection 
           of his favorite things. A magazine rack and plushy chairs and 
           a hassock exist amongst the tools of his trade. 

           Breece tugs the television inside, closes the double door and 
           slides the dead-bolt into place. 

           He pushes the television across the tile floor, plugs it into  
           the wall and turns the knob. A soap opera comes to life.  

           Satisfied, he turns his attention to Corrie. She’s lying on a 
           steel table nude with her arms alongside her torso. 

                                 FENTON
                        What am I going to do with you?
           He takes up a spray bottle filled with glycerin and water and 
           mists her face.  

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        We’ll get you all fixed up. 

           KNOCK. KNOCK. Annoyed Breece shifts his attention from Corrie 
           to the double door.  

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        You can go anytime, Ms. Cecil. 

           KNOCK. KNOCK. 

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        I said you’re free to leave--

                                 GRANVILLE (O.C.)
                        Hey undertaker man.

           Breece freezes at the sound of Granville Sutter. He turns off 
           the television and clears his throat. 

                                 FENTON
                        Yes?

                                 GRANVILLE (O.C.)
                        Hey undertaker man. 

                                 FENTON
                        One moment.

           Breece drapes a sheet over Corrie and looks for anything else 
           that may be out of place.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Breece unlocks the double door and shoulders Granville out of 
           the way; he quickly shuts the doors behind him. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        What are you up to, undertaker man?

                                 FENTON
                        I thought you were my secretary. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        What are you up to? You’re red as a 
                        beet. You look like a kid his daddy 
                        caught jackin off behind the barn. 

                                 FENTON
                        I was working.
                                 GRANVILLE
                        Workin my ass. Workin some kind of 
                        devil’s business with that Tyler 
                        girl’d be my guess. 

                                 FENTON
                        Poor old Mrs. Hull died. I’m 
                        preparing her for burial.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        If there’s a Mrs. Hull back there 
                        or ever was it’d come as a big 
                        surprise to me. 

                                 FENTON
                        What are you doing here?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        We talked about money.

                                 FENTON
                        Oh. Yes, I’d forgotten. In my 
                        office. Just walk this way. 

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Breece steps behind his desk and opens a drawer. He takes out 
           a manila envelope and lays it before Granville. 

                                 FENTON
                        This is half. Everything is just 
                        the way we discussed it. 

           Granville sits in an armchair. He withdraws a bundle of bills 
           and licks his finger to count. 

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        The bank counted it and they were 
                        satisfied. I counted it and I was 
                        satisfied. It’s ten thousand 
                        dollars. 

           Granville stops. He looks up and narrows a gaze on the uneasy 
           man. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You know, Breece, one of the five 
                        or six thousand things I don’t like 
                        about you is that you think you’re 
                        smart. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT'D)
                        You think because you went to 
                        college and learned how to puncture 
                        folk’s insides with Pop-Cola 
                        bottles you can run a number on me. 
                        Forget that. Put that thought away 
                        and don’t look at it no more. 

           Breece looks away and makes a tiny gesture of dismissal as if 
           please continue. 

                                 FENTON
                        Count by all means. If you don’t 
                        trust me. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        There’s damn small question about 
                        that. I don’t trust you worth a 
                        shit and I pity the fool who does. 

           Granville goes back to counting the bills. Breece sighs as he 
           watches him work this task meticulously.  

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           At length, Granville seems satisfied. He folds the money once 
           and shoves it into his pocket and rises to leave.   

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        I got places to be. 

                                 FENTON
                        Have you made any progress?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You’ve seen the result of some of 
                        that progress and I expect I could 
                        smell her on your fingers if I was 
                        a mind to. That playpretty I sent 
                        you special delivered. That wasn’t 
                        supposed to be. It went south too 
                        quick for me to stop and it’s fixin 
                        to cost you more money. 

                                 FENTON
                        What do you mean? 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Maybe she had a little breath in 
                        her and I had to suck it out. Maybe 
                        her neck wasn’t twisted just right 
                        and I had to retwist it. Maybe I 
                        didn’t have as much time as I 
                        needed to set that wreck up in a 
                        way the law would buy.

                        Or go on buyin. Anyway it’ll all 
                        show up on the final bill. 

                                 FENTON
                        My money seems to buy an awful lot 
                        of maybes. I’d like a little more 
                        certainty. I explained to you it’s 
                        crucial I get those pictures back. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I’ll get your precious pictures. 
                        Maybe when I bring em I’ll bring 
                        that mouthy houseburnin boy so 
                        you’ll have a matched set of 
                        playpretties. Like salt and pepper 
                        shakers. How’d that suit you?

                                 FENTON
                        Just get the pictures. 

           Granville turns for the door. As he goes through it, he looks 
           back at Breece. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I’ll leave you and poor old Mrs. 
                        Hull to finish your business. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Granville exits the mortuary and lights a cigarette. He gazes 
           at the moon and begins strolling down the drive while singing 
           a ballad; smoke trails his silhouette.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Once upon a time there was a pretty 
                        fly / He had a pretty wife, this 
                        pretty fly / But one day she flew 
                        away, flew away. 

           He begins to WHISTLE the ballad until it morphs into an eerie 
           TUNE. This sound carries into the next scene.  

           EXT. HOLLOW - THE NEXT MORNING

           Tyler is trudging up a deep hollow that is a funnel for winds 
           and a maelstrom of debris. He follows an eerie WHISTLE of one 
           constant and mournful note. This one is created by the land. 
           EXT. WHISTLING WELL - CONTINUOUS

           He climbs up the mouth of the hollow to higher ground to find 
           an irregular OPENING six feet wide and cleft out of limestone 
           and shale. It is the source of this ceaseless whistling.

           A crude fence has been constructed around the hole of castoff 
           boards wound with barbed-wire. 

           Tyler climbs over the jury-rigged fence and warily approaches 
           the whistling well. Peering down, he can feel an updraft cold 
           from the earth. He grabs a stone and drops it; the hole seems 
           totally bottomless.  

           On the other side of the fence sits a narrow man-made ARCH of 
           stone. Tyler walks toward it and kneels underneath it. A FLAT 
           CIRCULAR STONE is buried in the earth.   

           Tyler pries it free and scratches a hole in the mud. He takes 
           the TOBACCO TIN out of his pocket and sets it in the hole. He 
           covers the keeper of pictures with the circular stone. 

           EXT. HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           The hill begins to descend. Through the cover of trees, Tyler 
           can see tended land and a wooden farmhouse leached gray. 

           An OLD MAN exits and hobbles toward the nearby barn where his 
           GOATS are grazing. Tyler eases through the shadowed trees. 

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           The old man dumps a bucket of water into a trough and sets it 
           on the ground. He wipes his hands on a bandana. 

           EXT. BOOKBINDER FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           As the old man returns to his house, he sees Tyler sitting on 
           the end of his porch with the rifle in his hands. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        How do. Coolin some, ain’t it. 

                                 TYLER
                        Aren’t you Mr. Bookbinder?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I’m Hollis Bookbinder. I ain’t 
                        never been Mistered too much. Who 
                        might you be?
                                 TYLER
                        My name’s Tyler. I heard your 
                        goatbells. You got a lot of them?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        They’s several. I don’t know 
                        exactly how many. Ain’t run a 
                        census on em lately.
                            (pause)
                        That’s a right nice rifle you got 
                        there. 

                                 TYLER
                        Thanks. My granddaddy gave it to 
                        me. 

           Tyler hands his rifle to Bookbinder. The old man canvasses it 
           with a nostalgic smile. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        Winchester lever action with that 
                        octagon barrel. Gave one to my son 
                        too. 

                                 TYLER
                        You seen a man named Granville 
                        Sutter come through here?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                            (handing his rifle back)
                        Was you lookin for him?

                                 TYLER
                        No. I’m pretty sure he’s hunting 
                        for me, though. Do you know him?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I know him well enough to stay wide 
                        of him. Granville strayed from the 
                        ways of men long time ago. 

           Bookbinder ascends the porch steps and opens the screen door. 

                                 BOOKBINDER (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t had the rest of my mornin 
                        coffee. How about you?

                                 TYLER
                        I didn’t have any.

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        Then I reckon you ready for some.
           He disappears into the house. Tyler glances off to the wooded 
           area beyond; it looks like a hostile land. He reaches for the 
           WARRANT in his pocket and studies it momentarily.  

                                 BOOKBINDER  (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Sutter got in for ye, has he?

           Bookbinder returns with two cups of opaque coffee. He extends 
           one to Tyler and sits beside him.

                                 TYLER
                        I reckon.

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        It ain’t none of my business, but 
                        what did yins have your fallin out 
                        about?

                                 TYLER
                        Well. It come up about my sister. 
                        We got into it over her. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        And you took to the Harrikin. I 
                        would of thought this was something 
                        for the law to handle. 

                                 TYLER
                        They never paid me any mind. I 
                        heard there’s a sheriff in 
                        Ackerman’s Field supposed to be an 
                        honest man. Bellwether? 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I know of him. He’s got the name of 
                        bein pretty straight law. There’s a 
                        lot of these laws around here their 
                        badge just guarantees they can do 
                        their meanness and get away with 
                        it, but he’s supposedly alright. 

           Bookbinder gazes off in the way elderly sometimes do; both he 
           and Tyler sit quiet. Tyler finishes his coffee. 

                                 TYLER
                        Could you tell me the best way to 
                        get to Ackerman’s Field?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        These old roads wind and twist and 
                        sometimes just peter out. Go due 
                        east till you hit the railroad 
                        tracks. They growed up, but they 
                        still there.

                                 BOOKBINDER (CONT'D)
                        It’s about twenty or so mile. The 
                        tracks run north and south. Go 
                        south another several and you’ll 
                        come out right in Ackerman’s Field.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s all there is to it?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        First you got to get to the 
                        railroad track, and that ain’t no 
                        Sunday drive, specially if you 
                        ain’t used to the Harrikin.

           Bookbinder takes the last sip of his coffee and sets it down.

                                 BOOKBINDER (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t worry too much about 
                        Sutter. Likely he’s forgot about 
                        you by now and he’s drinkin him a 
                        cool one somewheres. 

                                 TYLER
                        No. He’s not forgot. When he comes 
                        here, just tell him where I went. 
                        That won’t hurt me, by then I’ll be 
                        somewhere else. I didn’t mean to 
                        mix you up in anything. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I ain’t tellin him jackshit. And 
                        you ain’t mixed me up in nothing. I 
                        reckon I can set on my own front 
                        porch and drink a cup of coffee 
                        with whoever I want to. But if that 
                        stuff about Sutter is so, you need 
                        to be anywhere else besides the 
                        deep pineys.  

                                 TYLER
                        I believe the Harrikin is my best 
                        chance to get to Ackerman’s Field. 
                        Get to Sheriff Bellwether and tell 
                        him the whole story. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I reckon you know your business.

                                 TYLER
                            (rising)
                        Well. I’ll see you, Mr. Bookbinder. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        Hold on. 
           Bookbinder reaches into his pocket and withdraws an old WORLD 
           WAR II ZIPPO made of porous steel and a black crackle finish.

                                 BOOKBINDER (CONT’D)
                            (offering it up)
                        You’ll be needin to build a fire 
                        tonight. 

           Tyler takes the lighter and studies the U.S. Marines seal. He 
           wonders its course in history.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you, sir. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        You just remember what I said. Due 
                        east. 

           And with that, Tyler steps off the porch and heads toward the 
           dense wilderness beyond. 

           EXT. CENTRE PRESBYTERIAN - DAY

           It is a quiet Sunday afternoon with a chill in the air. A few 
           late WORSHIPERS climb the steps to the church.

           Haggis walks past and turns down Maple Street. Breece Funeral 
           Home looms in the distance. 

           He adjusts his glasses on his nose as if readying himself for 
           a scholarly confrontation. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Haggis pushes against the front door but it does not open and 
           for a moment, he just looks at it in perplexity.   

           He knocks and glances around the yard. A garbage can has been 
           overturned and the wind has kited trash into the hedges.

           The door opens no more than three inches and Haggis can see a 
           narrow section of Breece’s face and a necktie knotted beneath 
           his ponderous chins. 

                                 FENTON
                        Yes?

                                 HAGGIS
                        My name is Haggis. I want to make 
                        an inquiry about Corrie Tyler. 

           Breece doesn’t open the door. Perhaps he shuts it a fraction. 
                                 FENTON
                        What about her?

                                 HAGGIS
                        Well, I assumed there’d be a 
                        funeral. 

                                 FENTON
                        Of course there’ll be a funeral. 
                        Arrangements haven’t been 
                        finalized. 

           The door goes closer to the jamb; the slice of Breece narrows 
           to one eye. Haggis sets his hand against the handle.

                                 HAGGIS
                        Hold on here a minute. I want to 
                        talk about these arrangements. 

           The eye Haggis can see seems distracted as it wanders like an 
           errant pendulum.  

                                 HAGGIS (CONT’D)
                        I know both of the Tylers and know 
                        the young man rather well, a 
                        student of mine. Perhaps it’s none 
                        of my business, but I’m aware of 
                        their financial situation.

                                 FENTON
                        It’s been taken care of. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        Taken care of how? 

                                 FENTON
                        Just don’t worry about it, Mr. 
                        Haggis. As I said, it’s taken care 
                        of, nothing for anyone to pay. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        When are the services? I’d like to 
                        view the body. 

                                 FENTON
                        I don’t mean to be indelicate, but 
                        the body has been badly damaged in 
                        the accident. Face crushed and so 
                        on. Of course it will be a closed 
                        casket ceremony.  
                                 HAGGIS
                        Something’s not right here. I’ve 
                        spoken with people in the Sheriff’s 
                        Department and been informed that 
                        she was unmarked. In fact, I was 
                        told that the broken neck was her 
                        only injury. 

                                 FENTON
                        I’m a professional, Mr. Haggis. 
                        Don’t you think I’d know the 
                        condition of a body I’m preparing? 
                        At any rate it’s a moot point. The 
                        body has been claimed. It is being 
                        transported. By an aunt, I believe. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        I told you I know this family. 
                        Known both of them all their lives, 
                        I’ve taken an interest, had one of 
                        them as a student. There’s no aunt. 

                                 FENTON
                        Of course there is. From Michigan 
                        or somewhere, one of those upnorth 
                        states. Good day, Mr. Haggis. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        This can’t be. Kenneth came by my 
                        house the night of the accident. He 
                        seemed agitated and even mentioned 
                        your name. Why would he do that?

           Breece grows wide-eyed. He slams the door and clicks the lock 
           into place, leaving Haggis to stare at panels of fine oak. 

                                 HAGGIS (CONT’D)
                        Breece? Open this door.  

           He knocks hard and waits but there is only silence within. He 
           hesitantly turns and walks into the wind, hand sliding on the 
           railing. Face furrowed. 

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Breece is standing quietly on the other side of the door like 
           a victim of paralysis. He looks through the peephole and sees 
           Haggis descend the steps, look back at the door with an angry 
           thought and finally, proceed down the curved drive. 
           EXT. BOOKBINDER FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           The world has gone sepia with dusk and twilight’s lengthening 
           shadows run like dark liquid across the packed earth.  

           Bookbinder dozes in his rocking chair with an old plaid shawl 
           across his lap.

           Granville emerges from the woods and approaches the porch. He 
           uplifts one foot and the old man’s eyes blink open. Granville 
           stands for a moment in awkward indecision, then sets his foot 
           down in the yard. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Mr. Bookbinder. You recollect me? 

           Bookbinder nods, head clouded by the tatters of an old dream. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m looking for a young feller up 
                        this way, figured you might have 
                        seen him. 

           Granville reaches into his jeans and pulls out his wallet. He 
           flashes a glimpse of a badge and a card.

           As he repockets it, Bookbinder looks away. When he looks back 
           at Granville, his face holds a look of utter contempt. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Well you seen him?

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I don’t know if I have or I ain’t. 
                        You got ary picture of him?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        No. Course to hell I ain’t got no 
                        picture. You don’t need one to make 
                        you remember if you’ve seen a young 
                        feller wanderin around. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        Some days I get a run of em. I 
                        don’t know if I’ve seen this one 
                        you’re lookin for or not. 

           The air grows menacing; Granville spits in the yard. He spies 
           a baby GOAT meandering toward the porch from the barn.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I always been a respecter of age, 
                        Mr. Bookbinder, but I ain’t got no 
                        time for no jokin around here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT'D)
                        You seen that badge. I’m a duly 
                        sworn constable of the Sixth 
                        District, and you got to cooperate 
                        with me.  

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        You’re goin to have to get further 
                        into the Harrikin than this to work 
                        that kind of bullshit. 

           The goat approaches Granville; it nuzzles against the calf of 
           his leg. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You a mouthy old son of a bitch. To 
                        have one foot in the grave and the 
                        other in a pile of owl shit. You 
                        tired of livin or what? 

           Granville pulls his switchblade out of his pocket. He fingers 
           the button and the knife flicks out. He GRABS the goat by its 
           head and TWISTS upward; it bleats with pain.   

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        I reckon a man lives alone puts a 
                        lot of store in his animals. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        They a right smart company.

                                 GRANVILLE
                        This’n acts like a pet. I bet if I 
                        cut its throat it’d make you 
                        remember where that boy went. 

           The goat begins to jerk against Granville’s grasp. Its hooves 
           make tiny dancing motions as he lifts it in the air. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        Or it might make me blow a hole in 
                        the middle of you a log truck could 
                        drive through. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You might if you had a gun. 

           Bookbinder removes the shawl. It slides off his lap and lands 
           soundlessly on the porch. He’s pointing a WORLD WAR II pistol 
           at Granville and the hammer is thumbed back. 

           It so surprises Granville that he releases his grip; the goat 
           lands on its feet and flees toward the barn. 
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        It ain’t loaded.

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        I done a lot of foolish things in 
                        my life, but I ain’t never 
                        threatened to kill a man with a 
                        empty pistol. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Piece of shit would likely blow up 
                        in your face anyhow. 

           Bookbinder moves the barrel away from Granville. He points it 
           at a fence-post and fires - BOOM! The resulting concussion is 
           deafening as the post splits in chunks of rotten wood.    

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. 

           The old man doesn’t say anything as he easily aims the gun at 
           Granville. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        You know I’ll get you for this. 
                        You’re graveyard dead and don’t 
                        even know about it yet. I’ll come 
                        through your window like a cat some 
                        hot night and cut your throat. 

                                 BOOKBINDER
                        You come ahead. And they’ll be 
                        scraping bloody pieces of you off 
                        my wall with a goddamned putty 
                        knife.

           Granville turns to walk off. At the yard’s edge, he hesitates 
           and goes to say more, but Bookbinder lifts his gun. Granville 
           keeps moving until he vanishes in the darkening woods. 

           Bookbinder sets the gun down and squeezes his trembling hands 
           in between his thighs to still them. 

                                 BOOKBINDER (CONT’D)
                            (sotto)
                        Things in this world better let 
                        alone, Tyler. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - NIGHT

           Tyler sleeps restless in a stump-hole covered with dry leaves 
           and branches. A fire is dwindling beside him. 
           The land is eerie and strange as black shadows and slivers of 
           firelight dance into the early hours of dawn. 

           EXT. BLUFF - THE NEXT DAY

           Tyler climbs an immense bluff of limestone covered with clods 
           of wild ivy. A windy table of stone sits at the SUMMIT. 

           He looks up and sees the mouth of a CAVE within the bluff. He 
           begins climbing toward it. 

           INT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler crawls into the narrow cave. He looks around to see the 
           calcified bones of luckless animals fallen prey. He grabs one 
           of his Hershey bars and takes several satiating bites.   

           He reaches inside his pocket and pulls out Corrie’s arrowhead 
           and studies it between his fingers. 

           He sets it aside and takes off his belt. With his pocketknife 
           he slices a thin thong of cowhide and loops a slipknot around 
           the ears of the arrowhead. He ties the amulet about his neck. 

           As Tyler turns to exit the cave - BOOM! The rock splinters in 
           shards of bright metal like bits of hot molten slag. The shot 
           sends Tyler reeling down the bluff.  

           EXT. BLUFF - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler army-crawls through the wild ivy with the rifle cradled 
           underneath his chin.  

           BOOM! A closer shot clips shreds of limestone and careens off 
           into space. Tyler hunkers down behind an outcropping of rock. 

           He aims his rifle and waits. Can’t see anything in the timber 
           far below - BOOM! Another shot whizzes past Tyler. 

           Granville emerges from the woods with his rifle; he’s running 
           toward a thin ridge of timber closer to the bluff. 

                                 TYLER
                            (panicked)
                        The son of a bitch.

           Tyler fires - BOOM! But Granville simply ducks behind a cover 
           of trees. 

           Tyler scrambles further up the bluff. His feet sliding on the 
           loose shale.  
           He hits a stockpile of stone. It creates a makeshift stairway 
           and Tyler hurriedly climbs it to the SUMMIT.  

           EXT. SUMMIT - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler crests the enormous table of windy stone and looks down 
           the opposite side. He immediately loses his breath.

           It is 120 feet straight down to a brown field which rolls out 
           with a tangled blue-gray forest; a green river snakes quickly 
           out of the bluff and dissipates into the trees beyond. 

           Tyler studies his position critically. There is a small LEDGE 
           sticking out 40 or 50 feet below him with a handful of cedars 
           in between.  

           He turns around to look for Granville on the back side of the 
           bluff. Granville is significantly closer and hustling through 
           the cover of trees. 

           Without hesitation Tyler turns toward the abyss and begins to 
           slide dangerously toward the nearest cedar while gripping his 
           rifle one-handed.  

           EXT. BLUFF - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler reaches the cedar and clutches it close to his body and 
           tries not to look at the dizzying landscape below. A long way 
           down, he begins to realize the folly of his choice. 

           Tyler slides downward to the next sapling. He grabs the trunk 
           and its roots slowly RIP out of the earth. 

           He desperately CLAWS at the limestone and the rifle falls out 
           of his hand and clatters down the face of the bluff and BANGS 
           loudly on the rock below.  

           Tyler manages to grab a wrist-size pine and he holds it for a 
           moment in giddy relief before it also gives. He SCRATCHES his 
           face and arms against the limestone as he falls.

           EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler lands with a sickening THUD. He lies momentarily before 
           staggering to his feet. BLOOD drips off his face and arms. He 
           looks dazed. He sees his rifle nearby. 

           He picks it up and quickly inspects it. If it is broken Tyler 
           is unable to tell. 
           He goes to the edge of the ledge and stares down. The fall is 
           even further at 70 or 80 feet straight down to the top of the  
           trees with the clocking river below.

           Tyler looks acutely at the SUMMIT above, then at the ledge he 
           is on. He is trapped and a BOULDER offers the only cover.

           He has no choice and hurries behind it. He aims his rifle and 
           waits. 

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           The day wanes; light gathers in the west above the timber and 
           the sky turns red.

           Granville materializes at the rim. His head, then his arm and 
           Tyler throws up his rifle to squeeze the trigger, but it does 
           not fire. He twists the gun in his hands with disbelief. 

           Granville shoots - BOOM! The bullet hits the boulder and bits 
           of splintered rock shower Tyler and CUT his neck. He searches 
           the ledge in horror; there is nowhere to hide. 

           BOOM! The bullet RIPS through his shirt sleeve and grazes his 
           arm. 

           He quickly backs himself against the bluff - BOOM! The bullet 
           splits the ledge between his feet. 

           Tyler runs off the edge and keeps running and LEAPS as far as 
           he can, brandishing the impotent rifle aloft as gravity works 
           against his kicking legs. 

           He turns in midair and there is a gray-brown picture of stone 
           and cedars rushing dizzily upward, going shapeless with speed 
           as he PLUMMETS down to the RIVER. 

           EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler HITS the water and rockets all the way under. He twists 
           in the swift current and immediately begins wrestling for the 
           surface. His unmanned rifle sinks to the rocky riverbed.  

           He surfaces in an EXPLOSION of spray, fighting for air. He is 
           on his back bearing downstream - BOOM! The shot falls short. 

           Tyler wipes the water from his eyes and sees the BLUFF. It is 
           diminishing rapidly, but Granville is silhouetted against the 
           pale sky. He lowers his rifle and stands as dark and still as 
           a crude sculpture of obsidian. 
           EXT. HARRIKIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Shivering cold, Tyler wades out of the river and hustles into 
           the cover of the forest. He looks around desperately lost and 
           bloody with the walls of night drawing in on him. 

           INT. EMBALMING PARLOR - NIGHT

           Corrie lies on a steel table quite composed and nude with her 
           legs together. Her eyes are wide open and adorned in mascara. 

           Breece combs her hair in a becoming way. He places a gardenia 
           behind her left ear. 

           There is a small cut on her forehead he had worked on earlier 
           and he fingers it delicately. 

           Unsatisfied, Breece unpockets a tube of tinted cream from his 
           smock and meticulously daubs the wound. He studies its effect 
           and wipes away a minuscule amount.  

           He slides a pair of silk underwear up her legs, then pulls an 
           evening gown over her head. 

           Pleased, he takes off his smock and tosses it aside. He picks 
           Corrie up underneath her armpits. 

           INT. SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Breece struggles to carry Corrie into a great amphitheater of 
           a room with sloped ceilings and dark wooden beams.

           He eases her onto an antique settee with a grunt, then stands 
           for a moment breathing hard and admiring his recent work.

           Her head tilts forward and lolls loosely sideways. He takes a 
           pillow and slips it behind her head to stay it; Corrie’s face 
           wears a slightly quizzical look. 

           Breece goes to the Crosley. He drops its needle onto a record 
           and waits for his favorite orchestra to play.

           Returning to Corrie, he sits himself beside her and takes her 
           hand. For a moment, he simply listens to the music.  

                                 FENTON
                        That’s Mahler.
                            (abruptly)
                        Brandy?
           Breece rises and from the credenza, he grabs a crystal bottle 
           of brandy and two snifters. He pulls a table next to Corrie’s 
           legs and places one of the snifters atop it.  

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                            (pouring the brandy)
                        I don’t suppose you’re familiar 
                        with Mahler.

           He sits with his own snifter held in his tiny white hands. He 
           sips it while watching Corrie, then smiles softly.  

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        Gustav Mahler was an Austrian 
                        composer from around the turn of 
                        the century. This is a cycle of 
                        songs called the Kindertotenlieder. 
                        Translated, that means ‘Songs of 
                        Dead Children.’ Don’t you think 
                        that’s a nice touch of irony?

           Breece downs the rest of his brandy and sets his snifter atop 
           the table. He moves her hand onto his thigh. He wraps his arm 
           around her shoulders and cups her breast with his left hand.

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        That’s fine? 

           He draws her closer to him with a stricken urgency and buries 
           his face into the soft white curve of her neck.

                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Corrie. 

           Across his shoulder, Corrie with her unfocused eyes looks out 
           across the great empty room as if someone were watching. 

           EXT. SANDY HOUSE - NIGHT

           An old house sits in a clearing surrounded by dense trees. It 
           is unlit and silent. 

           A pale moon beckons Tyler on. He comes into the yard and sees 
           a GERMAN SHEPHERD lying chained to a clothesline; it does not 
           move. Tyler approaches and stares in bemused wonder. 

           The shepherd is lying in a pool of blood which looks black in 
           the moonlight. Its eyes are inanimate and its lips are pulled 
           over its teeth in a perpetual snarl at death. A HUNTING KNIFE 
           is still lodged in its disemboweled belly. 
           Tyler stands hesitantly and glances toward the dark house. He 
           steps over the dead dog and walks up a stoop of stacked rocks 
           and hammers on the door. 

                                 TYLER
                        I need help.

           There is silence within, a flare of dull light, then a covert 
           stirring.

                                 SANDY (O.C.)
                        You’ll by God need some shortly if 
                        you don’t get off my porch.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m lost. I just need to talk to 
                        you a minute.

                                 SANDY (O.C.)
                        I was just sittin here thinkin 
                        about blowin a hole in my front 
                        door with this shotgun. You standin 
                        on the steps, you liable to get 
                        hit.

           Tyler wisely steps to the side of the door. He looks over his 
           shoulder at the dense trees and shivers. 

                                 TYLER
                        Open up a minute.

           The door springs inward. An overalled FIGURE appears in front 
           of Tyler clutching a double-barrelled shotgun.

           His cheeks are florid and unshaven. He looks half-demented in 
           the dim light from within. 

           Unmistakably, he’s the DRIVER from the beginning of the story 
           also known as SANDY. 

                                 SANDY
                        How is it all you crazy son of a 
                        bitches always know how to find me? 
                        Out of all the people in this round 
                        world and half of it covered in 
                        trees, why is it you fools keep 
                        wanderin up out of the same goddamn 
                        woods into my front yard?

                                 TYLER
                        Put your gun up. I don’t aim to 
                        hurt anybody.
                                 SANDY
                        I shore can’t say the same about 
                        myself. How many of you’s is out 
                        here?

                                 TYLER
                        Just me.

                                 SANDY
                        It’s folks has to work for a livin. 
                        Has to sleep. All of us can’t get 
                        by running in the woods all night 
                        long. 

                                 TYLER
                        Who else was here? Somebody’s 
                        killed your watchdog.

                                 SANDY
                        No shit. 

                                 TYLER
                        Granville Sutter’s after me. He’s 
                        gone crazy and I need help. 

                                 SANDY
                        I can guarangoddamntee he’s crazy 
                        as a shithouse mouse and getting 
                        farther into the territories all 
                        the time.

                                 TYLER
                        He aims to kill me.

                                 SANDY
                        You need to get the hell on away 
                        from here. As long as you’re 
                        somewhere else I’m thinking he’ll 
                        be as well.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m trying to get to Sheriff 
                        Bellwether. Have you got a car?

                                 SANDY
                        Course I got one.

                                 TYLER
                        Take me to Ackerman’s Field.

                                 SANDY
                        Not likely. I’m a Godfearin man. I 
                        ain’t messed up with you two and 
                        don’t plan to be. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SANDY (CONT'D)
                        I know for a fact he stuck my dog 
                        with my own damned knife, and no 
                        tellin what you done. 

                                 TYLER
                        Let me in awhile. I’m cold and 
                        starving.

           Sandy breathes raspy and hard and does not speak, nor does he 
           move to unblock the door. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        At least show me the way the 
                        railroad tracks are.

           He points mutely into the dark night. Tyler looks the way his 
           finger indicates and there is nothing but dense trees.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        That’s the goddamn way I came.

                                 SANDY
                        I can’t help that. They’ve always 
                        been there, and unless they moved 
                        em they’re there still. Now head 
                        out. And the next man prowls into 
                        my yard tonight they goin to have 
                        to drag him out.  

           Sandy steps backward and slams the door shut in Tyler’s face. 

                                 TYLER
                        Wait...please?

           Silence. Tyler turns and trudges down the stone stairs toward 
           the line of trees. Halfway across the yard, he looks back.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        How far is it?

           The dim light from within is turned off. The windows go still 
           and secret and black. There is only the moonlight. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        How far?

           The house appears vacant. Tyler is suddenly taken by a fit of 
           rage and begins screaming. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn you! I never made these 
                        crazy sons of bitches! None of it’s 
                        my doing. They’re just put here for 
                        me to contend with. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        They’ve killed my sister and tried 
                        to kill me, and I don’t even know 
                        if she’s been buried or not. Fenton 
                        Breece is crazy, sick somehow, the 
                        things he’s doing to dead folks. 
                        Open a few graves and you’ll see 
                        what I mean.

           Tyler falls to his knees and grabs a goose-egg of a stone. He 
           hurls it at the dark house and it ricochets off the door.  

           Still there is nothing from within. After a long while, Tyler 
           rises and in an act of defiance, he approaches the bloody dog 
           and yanks the hunting knife out of its belly.

           EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

           Granville washes his bloody hands and leaves a trail of brown 
           liquid to run through the natural channel of water. 

           INT. SITTING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Breece is half-dressed and sleeping at the foot of the settee 
           with Corrie lying beside him; she’s nude and her evening gown 
           has been discarded. 

           The sound of a door is heard closing. His eyes spring open as 
           if snapped back by an invisible puppet string, then he stands 
           in a disheveled whirlwind.   

                                 MS. CECIL (O.S.)
                        Mr. Breece? 

           He looks at himself, then Corrie and panics. He quickly grabs 
           his trousers and thrusts one fleshy leg into the opening, but 
           he’s too late. 

           Ms. Cecil is standing in the threshold of the room, her mouth 
           covered with one spider-veined hand.   

                                 MS. CECIL (CONT’D)
                        Heavens.

                                 FENTON
                        It’s not--

           But Ms. Cecil spins on her heels and begins an old lady’s run 
           down the hallway. With one foot still in his trousers, Breece 
           awkwardly hops forward, then trips over Corrie. 

           He lands with a fatty WHAM on the floor. He quickly scrambles 
           to his feet, kicking off his pants.  
                                 FENTON (CONT’D)
                            (to Corrie)
                        Goddamn you!

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ms. Cecil barrels down the hall, her bluish hair bobbing left 
           and right with every step. 

           Breece appears behind her and begins narrowing the gap in his 
           penguin-like run. 

                                 FENTON
                        Ms. Cecil!

                                 MS. CECIL
                        You’re a sick man!

           Breece grabs a weighty rock statue of two birds off a console 
           table and increases his speed; he’s never moved so fast.  

           Ms. Cecil turns for the staircase and Breece reaches back and 
           SWINGS the statue with all of his might. 

           It CONNECTS with her pompadour. BLOOD squirts across Breece’s 
           face as Ms. Cecil begins to tumble. 

           She FALLS down the steps, bones CRUNCHING with every movement 
           until she lands on the bottom step in one stomach-turning and 
           disjointed mess. 

           Breece stands still as death with blood running down his face 
           and the statue of the two birds clutched in his small hand. 

                                 FENTON
                        Oh dear.

           EXT. HARRIKIN - DAY

           Tyler passes rusted and purposeless mining machinery. A light 
           yet piercing sleet has begun to fall and it chills him.  

           He comes off a long ridge of chestnut and descends a hill. An 
           old motorless Buick is sitting next to a tree. By some divine 
           miracle all of its windows are in tact.  

           Tyler opens the door and climbs inside. He wearily stares out  
           the blurred windshield pelted with frozen rain; his eyes grow 
           heavy as he shivers. 

           He reaches out with his forefinger to draw on the window. The 
           condensation splits and he pulls his finger back to reveal:
                                      Corrie Tyler
                                       1952 - 1973

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           Dusk has fallen and the sleet has subsided; reddish hues fill 
           the sky. Tyler exits the Buick and trudges on.  

           EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

           He follows a dirt road and the songs of disembodied voices. A 
           white tent sits in a muddy clearing and a PREACHER steps into 
           the chilly night. WORSHIPERS follow and pay their respects. 

                                 PREACHER
                        Good night, brother. God bless you.

                                 WORSHIPER
                        See you at the meetin tomorrow.

           Tyler moves off the road as religious folk pass by and extend 
           weary glances; he looks near death.  

           A FAMILY approaches, led by a MAN and his rawboned WIFE. They 
           are followed by a BOY and a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair. 

           Unmistakably, it’s the MASSACRED FAMILY from the beginning of 
           the story also known as CLAUDE, PEARL, DREW and CLAUDELLE.    

           Claude stops and studies Tyler with a curious eye; his family 
           huddles behind him.   

                                 CLAUDE
                        Boy, are you washed in the blood?

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t reckon.

                                 CLAUDE
                        This ridge is a place for 
                        worshippers tonight. No place here 
                        for sinners. 

                                 TYLER
                        I just heard the singing and 
                        followed it. I’m lost.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Lost?

           Claude leans closer. Tyler glances around skittishly until he 
           is suddenly offered an enthusiastic handshake. 
                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        I know all about lost. I wrote the 
                        book on lost. 

           The rawboned wife touches her husband with a grateful hand as 
           she steps forward.    

                                 PEARL
                        Claude was saved tonight. He was a 
                        drunk for twenty years, but tonight 
                        he gave it all up.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Amen.

           Claudelle is a beauty and staring at Tyler; he meets her gaze 
           momentarily and she offers a mischievous smile. 

                                 TYLER
                        I’m just trying to get to 
                        Ackerman’s Field. I come from 
                        Centre.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Lord, you’re a long way from home.

                                 TYLER
                        I can maybe catch a ride to town 
                        from here then?

           Claude clamps onto Tyler and seeks his eyes with a divine and 
           altruistic fixity.

                                 CLAUDE
                        You goin with us. You goin to get 
                        somethin to eat and a bed to sleep 
                        in and you goin into town with us 
                        in the mornin. 

           Tyler attempts to object, but he is abruptly pulled toward an 
           old pickup.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Claude waves them to table with an expansive arm. Tyler’s eye 
           takes in a platter of pork chops, white beans cooked with ham 
           and a bowl of snowy mashed potatoes. 

           Claude and Pearl sit down at the heads with Drew and Tyler on 
           one side and Claudelle on the other. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Just help yourself. 
           Tyler begins dishing the potatoes onto his plate as Claudelle 
           watches him. 

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you. I was about starved out. 

           Tyler passes the potatoes to Claudelle with a small smile; he 
           takes the platter of pork chops from Drew. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Who are you anyway, Lost Sheep? You 
                        say you from over around Centre?

                                 TYLER
                        I’m a Tyler. We always lived down 
                        on Lick Creek. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Lick Creek? You ain’t kin to old 
                        Moose Tyler, are you?

                                 TYLER
                        That’s what folks always called my 
                        father.

           Claude dumps his utensils and stares at Tyler with disbelief.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Well, I’ll be double-dipped in dog 
                        shit. Old Moose Tyler’s boy. 

                                 PEARL
                        Be baptized at a meetin and come 
                        straight home and talk that way at 
                        the supper table. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        ‘Shit’ ain’t takin the name of the 
                        Lord our God in vain. Or wadn’t the 
                        last time I looked. 

                                 PEARL
                        It’s vulgar talk, Bible or no 
                        Bible.

                                 CLAUDE
                            (ignoring Pearl)
                        If this ain’t the beatinest thing. 
                        Boy, I knowed your daddy thirty 
                        year or more. He used to drink 
                        whiskey better than a fish drink 
                        water, and I shore was sorry to 
                        hear when he died. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLAUDE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve passed out in your front room 
                        more times than once. 

           Pearl watches Tyler closely as if his social standing dropped 
           precipitously; he begins to eat incrementally faster.  

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t you have a sister a little 
                        older than you? Pretty little thing 
                        with big eyes?

                                 TYLER
                        Yes.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Where’s she at? She ain’t lost too, 
                        is she?

           Tyler’s jaw ceases working. He lowers his fork and sits quiet 
           for a moment. 

                                 TYLER
                        She died, too. 

           INT. FRONT ROOM - LATER

           Claude is sitting in a plush recliner with a Scottish Terrier 
           on his lap; its unmistakable gemstone earrings glimmer. Tyler 
           eyes it with curiosity as Drew fiddles with the TV.   

                                 TYLER
                        Is that dog wearing earrings?

                                 CLAUDE
                        Ain’t that somethin? Drew pierced 
                        her ears for me with a needle. 

           Garbled chunks of noise ring out of the TV as Drew cranks the 
           dial from one end to the other. Claude grows annoyed.   

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        Leave it in one place. Put it on 
                        eight. They might have Gunsmoke.

                                 DREW
                        I ain’t studying no Gunsmoke. I’m 
                        trying to find The Six Million 
                        Dollar Man. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Boy, The Six Million Dollar Man 
                        ain’t goin to get you in heaven.
                                 DREW
                        He’ll come about as close as 
                        Gunsmoke. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Let me see that thing. 

           Claude pushes the terrier onto the floor and rises. He nudges 
           Drew aside and spins the dial. 

                                 DREW
                        You gonna drift off anyhow.

           Tyler looks toward the kitchen and sees Claudelle standing in 
           the doorway. He glances at Claude and when he looks back, the 
           doorway is empty.   

                                 CLAUDE
                        What I’d say? Gunsmoke it is. 

           Satisfied with the TV station, Claude returns to his recliner 
           and grabs a bent apple pipe from the side table. He lights it 
           and closes his eyes for some sleep. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Claudelle is standing at the sink with her back turned to the 
           door, washing dishes. Tyler quietly enters.  

           At his step, her hand holding the sponge stops its motion and 
           she seems to be waiting for something. Tyler can see her face 
           reflected in the window. 

           He reaches for her shoulder and she pivots; they are close to 
           touching, but she refuses to meet his eyes.  

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Why don’t you just slip up on a 
                        body?

                                 TYLER
                        You heard me coming.

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        I did not.

                                 TYLER
                        You were waiting for me though.

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Waiting for you to do what?
           She looks at Tyler; her eyes are darkly fringed with gorgeous 
           lashes. He wants to speak but the words fail to come out.

           She kisses him. Tyler doesn’t pull away, but stiffens and his 
           lips clinch. 

           Her hand is wet with soapy water as it comes up to clutch the 
           back of his neck. Tyler tries to succumb, then turns his head 
           away and his gaze falls to the floor.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sorry. I can’t. 

           Claudelle searches his face. Her hand slides off his neck and 
           lifts his chin so his pained eyes meet hers. 

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Are you okay?

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t know.

           Hesitation fills his face. Claudelle takes his hand and pulls 
           him to the table. She sits and interlocks their fingers, then 
           looks up at him.    

           Tyler studies her sensitive eyes underneath him. So sweet. He  
           suddenly falls to his knees and buries his face in the warmth 
           of her lap and begins crying. Finally mourning with a painful  
           and quiet desperation.   

           Unsure of how to respond Claudelle places her hand on the top 
           of his messy brown hair. She leans down and kisses him on the 
           crown of his head. She puts her arms around him as Tyler sobs 
           heavily.  

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        It’s going to be okay. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - NIGHT

           A small bitter rain falls from the pewter sky. The wind blows 
           and drives a bevy of dark SPARROWS from an enormous cedar. 

           Granville comes off the long ridge of chestnut and approaches 
           the old motorless Buick. He opens the door and climbs inside.

           He observes Tyler’s oily fingerprints on the window and leans 
           forward to blow on the glass. The epitaph is revealed:

                                      Corrie Tyler
                                       1952 - 1973
           A look approaching regret crosses Granville’s face. He lights 
           a cigarette and watches a spherical vision of rainy trees and 
           thinks only of Tyler.     

           INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

           Tyler lies on the couch with a mothball smelling quilt pulled 
           to his chin; he listens to the sounds of the house. 

           His eyes fall in and out of dreams, then clarify on Claudelle 
           standing above him. She shucks her nightgown overhead and the 
           bloom of her pale body is unveiled. 

           She tugs the quilt aside and lays the warmth of her body onto 
           Tyler; her breasts pool against his chest. Tyler tries to say 
           something but Claudelle places her fingers over his lips.

                                 CLAUDELLE
                            (softly)
                        Shhh. 

           Tyler envelopes Claudelle, then rolls her over. Both of their 
           eyes are so near, seemingly dark and wise beyond their years. 

           He caresses her black hair behind her ears and kisses her. He 
           enters her gently and she arches back, eyes are unwavering as 
           they make love.   

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           Tyler is asleep on the couch. Claudelle is standing above him 
           as she pulls her nightgown overhead. She leans over and lands 
           a gentle kiss on his forehead, then turns and dissipates down 
           the hallway. 

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           Claude is standing over Tyler and shaking him secretly. Tyler 
           comes awake slowly as if he were rising out of muddy waters. 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Get up.

                                 TYLER
                        Crawl in next to me.

                                 CLAUDE
                        What? Wake the hell up, boy.

           Tyler awakens at once and shoots up; his eyes sweep the whole 
           room. He feels a rush of relief as he focuses on Claude.  
                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        Get up. It’s mornin.

           Tyler glances around. It’s so dark he can’t even see a window 
           yet alone a hint of light. 

                                 TYLER
                        If it’s morning why isn’t it light?

                                 CLAUDE
                        It’s getting light.

                                 TYLER
                        Where?

           Claude falls silent and Tyler can hear the steady rasp of his 
           breathing like an alcoholic in fix. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        What was it you wanted?

                                 CLAUDE
                        You didn’t have a little drink hid 
                        out, did ye?

                                 TYLER
                        No. No, I don’t even drink.

                                 CLAUDE
                        I just thought bein as you was 
                        Moose’s boy, you might.

                                 TYLER
                        I thought you quit?

                                 CLAUDE
                        I did, I did. I reckon I’ll go look 
                        for somethin to eat. 

           Tyler falls back to his pillow and Claude stumbles off. Windy 
           rain begins to pelt the farmhouse.  

           INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Breece is asleep in his four poster bed. The phone rings. His 
           groggy eyes fight to open. He clicks on the bedside light and 
           reaches for the receiver. 

                                 FENTON
                        Hello?
                                 ODEL (O.S.)
                        Mr. Breece. I apologize for the 
                        early morning intrusion, but this 
                        is Sheriff Odel. 

           Breece springs upward. He furiously wipes his eyes to awaken.

                                 FENTON
                        Yes?

                                 ODEL (O.S.)
                        I had an interesting conversation 
                        with Mr. Haggis from the high 
                        school.

                                 FENTON
                        You did?

                                 ODEL (O.S.)
                        I did. And something else, your 
                        secretary Ms. Cecil was reported 
                        missing this morning.

                                 FENTON
                        She was?

                                 ODEL (O.S.)
                        I need you to come by my office and 
                        answer some questions. Say noon. 
                        Can you do that for me?

                                 FENTON
                        Of course. Most certainly.

                                 ODEL (O.S.)
                        Goodbye Mr. Breece.

           Breece closes his eyes as if envisioning the inevitable grief 
           that will fall upon him.  

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Pearl is standing beside a pan of eggs and pointing a spatula 
           at Claude; he is red-faced and drunk. 

                                 PEARL
                        You take the cake. Baptized one 
                        night praisin Jesus and up before 
                        the daylight drinkin whiskey.
                                 CLAUDE
                        The Bible ain’t down on spirits. 
                        Why even them old prophets and 
                        disciples and suchlike of old was 
                        known to take a dram of wine.

                                 PEARL
                        They never blowed the grocery money 
                        on it, though.

                                 CLAUDE
                        They would if they had a 
                        sourtongued old bitch like you 
                        doggin their every move. 

           Pearl slams the spatula down. Claude avoids her stare and she 
           shakes her head in disbelief. 

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler is sitting on the couch and pulling on his boots. Pearl 
           enters and stops at the sight of him with bitter eyes.

                                 PEARL
                        You got him to thinkin about 
                        whiskey again.

                                 TYLER
                        If I did, I never meant to.

           Her face is as stoney as a banker’s; Tyler avoids her eyes as 
           she exits. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler enters to see Claude sitting at the table with his back 
           turned to the door.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Don’t pay her no mind. I don’t need 
                        it nohow, I’m shut of it.

                                 TYLER
                        We still going to town?

           Claude turns to look at Tyler; the heaviness of his addiction 
           is on his mind.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Boy, I don’t need any more 
                        temptation than I already got. 
                                 TYLER
                            (sinking)
                        I got to get on, then, Claude.

                                 CLAUDE
                        I’ll see you.

           Claude turns back. Tyler hesitates before stepping closer; he 
           clears his throat.

                                 TYLER
                        Listen. There’s a man looking for 
                        me named Granville Sutter, and he 
                        may come here. If he does, don’t 
                        fool with him. Don’t even let him 
                        in. 

                                 CLAUDE
                            (meeting his eyes)
                        You bring the son of a bitch on. 
                        After the mornin I’ve had and it 
                        not over yet, nobody’s goin to come 
                        here and jerk me around. 

           EXT. CALVERT FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Tyler trudges up the hill; chilly rain courses down his body.

           Claudelle runs out of the farmhouse. She is carrying a FOLDED 
           BLANKET and a paper bag with the top rolled down. 

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Tyler.

           Tyler turns back. Claudelle hustles after him, getting soaked 
           in the rain. She stops before him and offers up the effects.

                                 CLAUDELLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s Daddy’s army blanket and a 
                        little breakfast.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you. 

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Bring that blanket back. It’s 
                        Daddy’s, and he wouldn’t take 
                        nothing for it. You are coming 
                        back, aren’t you?

                                 TYLER
                        I need to take care of some 
                        business first. 
                                 CLAUDELLE
                        I’ve just got a bad feeling I’m 
                        never going to see you again.

                                 TYLER
                        Even your mother couldn’t keep me 
                        run off. Promise.

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Can I have something of yours to 
                        keep? To remember you by.

           Tyler sets the blanket and paper bag on the ground. He unties 
           the ARROWHEAD amulet from around his neck and wraps it around 
           Claudelle’s throat. He ties it shut and kisses her lips. 

                                 CLAUDELLE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t even know your first name.

                                 TYLER
                        It’s Kenneth.

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Thank you, Kenneth.

                                 TYLER
                        If a man shows up around here and 
                        asks about me, you head out. If you 
                        have to go out a window or 
                        whatever. Just stay out of his way.

           Tyler picks up the blanket and bag, then stares squarely into 
           her rain-soaked eyes. 

                                 CLAUDELLE
                        Daddy always says you gotta look a 
                        bully in the eye.

           INT. OFFICE - MORNING

           Odel is seated behind his desk; his palms are laid flat on it 
           and his eyes are suspicious. Harlan stands beside him.

                                 ODEL
                        So tell me again. When was the last 
                        time you seen Ms. Cecil? 

           Breece is sitting across the desk; he looks squeamish and his 
           face is flushed crimson. 

                                 FENTON
                        Yesterday. No, the day before 
                        Tuesday. Or maybe it was yesterday? 
                                 ODEL
                        Which one is it? 

                                 FENTON
                        The day before yesterday. 

                                 ODEL
                        Uh-huh. 

           Odel glances over his shoulder. Harlan meets his eyes with an 
           impish smirk. Breece notices and grows increasingly anxious.

                                 FENTON
                            (suddenly)
                        Somebody ought to check out 
                        Granville Sutter.

                                 ODEL
                            (looking back)
                        What’s Sutter got to do with this? 

                                 FENTON
                        Well, uh, Ms. Cecil spoke to me 
                        about some trouble she was having 
                        with the man. I simply thought it 
                        was nothing to worry about, and 
                        told her as much. But now, looking 
                        back and in light of her 
                        disappearance, maybe there is more 
                        to it. Apparently, he threatened 
                        her. Perhaps you should arrest him.

                                 HARLAN
                        The law’s a funny thing, Breece. It 
                        requires evidence.   

           Breece bobs his head metronomically; Odel’s stare grows heavy 
           as the undertaker nervously looks away.  

                                 ODEL
                        How bout you just let me know if 
                        you plan on leaving town anytime 
                        soon. 

                                 FENTON
                        Ah, yes. Okay.  

           Odel nods his goodbye. Breece rises and shuffles out. After a 
           moment, Odel turns to Harlan. 
           EXT. HARRIKIN - AFTERNOON

           The fog is thick and the light wanes beneath it. Tyler climbs 
           an embankment and looks out from its peak.

           The railroad tracks lay on crossties gleaming palely with wet 
           phosphorescence in the near distance.

           Giddy with relief, Tyler rushes down the embankment and heads 
           toward them. 

           EXT. CALVERT BARN - NIGHT

           Granville’s Bronco drives up the road. Its headlights refract 
           off the rain and illuminate the sleeping farmhouse. 

           He parks and cuts the engine. He exits and cases the house as 
           enormous BIRDS pass the remote face of the moon.  

           EXT. CALVERT FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Granville climbs the muddy grade and steps onto the porch. He 
           hammers on the door. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You better be in there.

           He can hear an abrupt scuttle of claws crossing the floor and 
           the grating bark of the Scottish Terrier.   

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Shut up, you little bitch.

           The barking becomes almost hysterical and a light flickers to 
           life inside the farmhouse.

                                 PEARL (O.C.)
                        What on earth? Claude?

           Footsteps cross the floor and move toward the door. Granville 
           hammers once more. 

                                 CLAUDE (O.C.)
                        You the Lost Sheep back?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        As lost a sheep as ever was. 

           The door opens onto the dimly lit front room. Claude focusses 
           his eyes on Granville; he is clearly still drunk.  
                                 CLAUDE
                        What the hell? It’s two o’clock in 
                        the mornin. 

           INT. FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Granville ambles into the center of the room. His clothes are 
           reeking and dripping water onto the rug. Claude stares at him 
           incredulously. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        How long’s he been gone? 

                                 CLAUDE
                        Who?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        That Tyler boy. You tell me what I 
                        want to know and I’ll be on my way 
                        without anybody gettin hurt.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Just who the goddamn hell do you 
                        think you are, mister? You seem to 
                        forget you’re on my property. 

           Pearl enters the room, followed by Drew and Claudelle; she is 
           clutching the Terrier to her chest. Granville keenly observes 
           the arrowhead tied around her neck.

                                 GRANVILLE
                            (to Claudelle)
                        I’m the fellow that’s huntin Tyler 
                        and if you don’t tell me damn quick 
                        where he’s at I’m going to unbreech 
                        you like a shotgun. 

           Granville furtively reaches into his pocket and pulls out his 
           switchblade; it winks dully in the light. 

                                 PEARL
                        Tell him, Claude.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Shut up. I ain’t tellin him 
                        jackshit. And you ain’t neither. 

                                 PEARL
                        He went to Ackerman’s Field. 

           Claude throws a savage blow and catches Granville hard enough 
           to stumble him; he spits BLOOD onto the floor.  
           Claude lists to the side like some drunken bear and begins to 
           windmill his arms wildly. Granville simply rises up and steps 
           inside his flailing fists.    

           He DRIVES his knife deep into Claude’s belly and JERKS upward 
           in an explosion of guts and putrid gasses; Claude momentarily 
           leaves the floor as BLOOD dribbles onto his chin. 

                                 PEARL (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God!

           Granville spins around to find the family aligned against the 
           wall like spectators of some twisted bloodsport. He YANKS the 
           blade out of Claude and charges toward Claudelle.

           She drops the Terrier and turns to run as Granville grabs for 
           her neck. Drew throws himself against Granville and Claudelle 
           sprints free.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Claudelle breaks into the bathroom. She quickly turns to lock 
           the door and steps back. Tears form in the corner of her eyes 
           as she hears Granville FIGHTING with her brother.     

           EXT. ROAD - THE NEXT MORNING

           The road is familiar from the beginning of the story; Tyler’s 
           following it with the army blanket wrapped around him. 

           He approaches a city limits sign which reads Ackerman’s Field 
           and a smile emerges from his lips; his pace quickens.  

           EXT. ACKERMAN’S FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Cresting a hill, Tyler sees a Plymouth Fury cocked inward and 
           gleaming in the pale sun. Ackerman’s Field Sheriff is painted 
           on its door; a tall uniformed MAN sits behind the wheel. 

           Tyler hustles down to the driver’s door and knocks as quickly 
           on the glass. 

           There is an instant look of revelation on Tyler’s face as the 
           driver cranes his neck. GRANVILLE SUTTER is dressed from head 
           to toe in fully deputy regalia.  

           The door flings outward and HITS Tyler - WHACK! He falls down 
           to the seat of his pants.  
           Granville jumps out the door and GRABS at Tyler like flies on 
           shit; an iron grip CLAMPS his throat and LIFTS him off of the 
           road.

           WHAM! Scarred and bony knuckles HIT Tyler in his temple solid 
           and the world tilts on its axis as he crumbles to the ground. 

           As the world rights itself, Granville’s face is very close to 
           Tyler’s and full of contempt. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I got you now, you little son of a 
                        bitch. 

           Tyler tries to TWIST away, but Granville SLAMS him in the jaw 
           and the back of his head RICOCHETS off the road like a paddle 
           ball; the world goes completely black.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. PLYMOUTH FURY - LATER

           He awakens to a dull throb in his temple and singing from the 
           driver’s seat; his wrists are bound with duct tape.  

                                 GRANVILLE
                        ...and I wound up her little ball 
                        of yarn / It was just two weeks 
                        from this I went out to take a 
                        piss... 

           Tyler looks out the window and sees clumps of trees streaking 
           past as the cruiser bounces over a dirt road.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        ..and I found myself a burden of   
                        great pain / For it had been to my 
                        mishaps I had caught a dose of the 
                        claps.  

           He creeps his bound hands over his thigh toward the door, one 
           inch, then no more, one inch, then no more. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Move em again and I’ll leave you a 
                        bloody stub to jack off with.

           Tyler knots his hands into fists and lays them on his lap. He 
           begins to work his tongue against his swollen jaw. 

                                 TYLER
                        Where are we going?
                                 GRANVILLE
                        Far enough so’s there ain’t no 
                        busybodies around. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - CONTINUOUS

           The road vanishes into a heavier timber. The Fury drives over 
           small saplings which cause it to labor harder; it snakes back 
           into the Harrikin.   

           INT. PLYMOUTH FURY - LATER

           Tyler is eyeing Granville as the cruiser hits a little gully; 
           it lurches sickeningly.  

                                 TYLER
                        Where’d you come by that getup?

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Do you honestly want to know?

                                 TYLER
                        No. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        I thought not. Now I looked you 
                        over pretty good while you was 
                        dozed off. You ain’t got no 
                        pictures. What I want to know is 
                        where they are and how we get to 
                        em.  

           Tyler prods his jaw with his tongue; a tooth breaks and blood 
           fills his mouth. He leans forward and spits it on the floor.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Damn, boy, ain’t you had no raisin? 
                        This car belongs to the Sheriff of 
                        Ackerman’s Field. 

           He sits staring at his tooth and a dull anger seizes him. The 
           cruiser reaches a veritable wall of timber with no give. 

           Granville kills the engine and something gives under the hood 
           with a soft whoosh and a rising curtain of steam. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        You see what meanness you’ve 
                        brought on everybody, and all 
                        that’s happened might never have 
                        been? It was your choice, and ever 
                        bit of it is on your head. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        There’s people been killed over 
                        your stubbornness, and more could 
                        come. I told you to imagine the 
                        worst thing that could happen and 
                        it would be so. 

           Tyler looks out the window; the timber ends with a sedgefield 
           rolling steeply downhill in stone tapestries.

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s just business to me and the 
                        only holdup is you. 

                                 TYLER
                        I promise the only man that’ll get 
                        them from me is Bellwether. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        You’ll give em to me. Oh, yes. When 
                        I’m through with you, you’ll be 
                        beggin me to take em. You’ll say, 
                        Please, Mr. Sutter, take these 
                        nasty things and be done with em. 
                            (opening his door)
                        Now get your ass out. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler exits into the cold; a wind with the taste of ice in it 
           is looping up from the sedgefield. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Fixin to snow.

           Granville studies the onecolor sky as if he were some curious 
           weatherman. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Me and you got to get to them 
                        pictures and get the hell out of 
                        Dodge before the snow flies. 

           He moves toward the trunk of the Fury and opens it. Inside an 
           ill-fated DEPUTY looks out with dead eyes. Granville leans in  
           and reaches for a tire iron beside his bludgeoned head. Tyler 
           sees his final opportunity. 

           He sprints around the Fury and leaps upon him. He flails both 
           fists and kicks before Granville can even hit the ground. 

           Granville rolls away from the kicks and is fighting to get up 
           as Tyler stumbles over a whiteoak branch; Tyler grabs it with  
           both bound hands. 
                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        You blindsidin son of a bitch. 

           CRACK! Tyler hits him alongside his temple with the length of 
           the branch; chunks of rotten wood fly. Granville falls to his 
           knees and Tyler hits him again - CRACK!

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        You’re graveyard dead.

           But Tyler doesn’t stop; he sobs with rage and frustration and 
           swings the makeshift club as hard as he can - CRACK!

           Granville attempts to crawl away on his hands and knees; he’s 
           half-dazed. Tyler does not cease - CRACK! CRACK! 

           Granville falls facedown and clamps his hands around the back 
           of his head. CRACK! CRACK! Tyler beats his knuckles and blood 
           soaks through his hair. CRACK - the branch breaks. 

           Tyler looks around for another stick and picks up the biggest 
           one he can find. Granville struggles sluggishly like some odd 
           half-crushed insect. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

           Tyler quits and eyes Granville with loathing as he rolls onto 
           his back. 

                                 TYLER
                        Goddamn you. 

           Granville’s face resembles something you’d unwrap from bloody 
           butcher paper and the skin has been beaten off of his hands.  

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Why won’t you just leave me the 
                        hell alone?

           Granville lies breathing heavily. The beating crushed his jaw  
           and bloody bubbles froth from the corners of his mouth. 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        By God you will lay here and die 
                        directly. 

           Tyler throws the stick and walks around the back of the Fury; 
           he shuts the trunk on the dead deputy, then climbs behind the 
           wheel. 

           INT. PLYMOUTH FURY - CONTINUOUS

           For a moment Tyler sits staring through the windshield at the 
           timber beyond and breathing heavily. 
           He twists the key. The engine turns over lethargically but it 
           doesn’t hit. He tries again and again until the starter turns 
           slower and slower and ultimately clicks dry. 

           Tyler looks over the backseat and finds his HUNTING KNIFE and 
           OLD ARMY BLANKET. He grabs them and exits the cruiser. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler uses the knife to cut the tape bounding his hands, then 
           slips the knife into his belt. He drapes the blanket over his 
           shoulders and turns to walk out the path they had come.  

           After a few paces, Tyler stops. He defiantly turns to go back 
           into the deeper timber. 

           EXT. HILL - LATER

           Tyler crests the summit of a hill and stops to rest. He looks 
           up and huge snowflakes begin to list out of the heavens, gray 
           against the pale steely gray of the sky. 

           He looks back the way he had come. Below the hillside, a flat 
           valley is spread out and merging with a row of trees. Another 
           slope ascends, already whitening.

           Tyler sees Granville trudging down that slope; he is tiny and 
           dark and furiously animated against the field.

           EXT. SLOPE - CONTINUOUS

           He’s crazed all over with dried blood and his body aches, but 
           Granville keeps pushing himself through the snow with a rifle 
           in his hands, limping closer and closer.  

           A dark shifting cloud of BIRDS comes flying out of the timber 
           and a CARDINAL arcs from tree to tree like a drop of blood. 

           EXT. SUMMIT - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler turns and hustles down the backside of the hill leaving 
           snowy footprints in his wake. 

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           TWELVE MEN are gathered loosely about the courthouse steps in 
           Ackerman’s Field; they are armed to the last man with rifles. 
           The door to the courthouse opens and SHERIFF BELLWETHER exits 
           into the falling snow. 

           The gang of men settles as Bellwether looks up with pale eyes 
           and wavy hair going prematurely gray. 

                                 BELLWETHER
                        Gentleman. Deputy Garrison and I 
                        will go in the county car, and the 
                        Holt brothers will bring you all 
                        behind us in their trucks. We’ve 
                        got a bunch of flashlights. 
                        Everybody make sure you have a 
                        light and make sure it works. 

                                 MAN 1
                        What about the state?

                                 BELLWETHER
                        For right now they’re manning 
                        roadblocks. 

                                 MAN 2
                        Roads ain’t nothin to Granville. He 
                        could be in Alabama by now. 

                                 MAN 3
                        Where we goin?

                                 BELLWETHER
                        Last place we know for sure he was 
                        at was Claude Calvert’s place. 
                        That’s where the truckload of 
                        bodies came from. From there we’ll 
                        just have to play it by ear. 

                                 MAN 3
                        It’s two or three hundred square 
                        miles in the Harrikin. What are we 
                        lookin for, clues? Fingerprints? 
                        He’s long gone from there. 

                                 BELLWETHER
                        He may well be. But all the same 
                        it’s got to be done. You understand 
                        this is purely a voluntary thing. 

                                 MAN 3
                        I never said nothin about not goin.
           INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

           Breece is packing his clothes in a leather suitcase; he wears 
           a silk lounging robe and velvet slippers. The phone rings. He 
           answers it. 

                                 FENTON
                        Good evening? 

           He hears heavy breaths on the other line, then the mechanical 
           click as the anonymous caller hangs up. 

           Breece returns the receiver to its base and stands for a long 
           moment. He opens the nightstand and pulls out a German Luger.   

           EXT. HARRIKIN - NIGHT

           The snow is falling harder and the woods are full of pastoral 
           drifts. 

           Granville leans against the trunk of a cedar; he is smoking a 
           cigarette. His bloody and demolished hand lifts the filter to 
           his equally demolished and bloody mouth.  

           Far off on the hillside, a long line of flashlights move in a 
           slow curve around the face of the hill. 

           Granville puts out his cigarette in the snow and picks up the 
           rifle; he pushes after Tyler.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Breece is still packing when somebody begins to POUND against 
           the front door. He looks up half-expecting the visitor. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           A motley crew of TEN MEN are standing outside the front door, 
           clutching rifles and baseball bats. Tyler’s teacher Haggis is 
           amongst them.

           The oak door opens a scant two inches with the security chain 
           held in place; Breece peeks out.

                                 FENTON
                        I’ll be right with you. I’m not 
                        dressed to receive company.
           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Breece SLAMS the door shut and locks the dead bolt. He rushes 
           down the foyer with his suitcase. Behind him, the door begins 
           to SHUTTER as the men pound against it - WHAM! Again - WHAM!

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Breece pushes a red button mounted to the wall and the garage 
           door rises; the snow is blowing slantwise outside. His silver 
           Cadillac hearse sits like a shuttle ready for launch.   

           He quickly rushes to the rear and sets the suitcase inside. A 
           pair of limpid eyes stare back at him; the horrific corpse of 
           Ms. Cecil is entombed here and her bluish hair has become one 
           nauseating beehive of dried blood. He slams the door closed.   

           He climbs behind the steering wheel and cranks the engine; he 
           rolls forward a few feet and abruptly slams on the brakes. 

                                 FENTON
                        Sweet Jesus.

           He climbs out of the hearse and hustles back through the door 
           to the funeral home. 

           INT. EMBALMING PARLOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Breece uncovers Corrie on the steel table; she is wearing his 
           evening gown. He lifts her. 

                                 FENTON
                        Hurry, hurry.

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Breece opens the passenger door and jostles Corrie inside. He 
           slams the door and it bounces off of her ankle. 

                                 FENTON
                            (to Corrie)
                        Goddamn it! What the hell’s the 
                        matter with you? Can’t you see 
                        we’re in a hurry here?

           He moves her foot and shuts the door. He goes around the back 
           of the hearse and climbs behind the wheel.
           INT. HEARSE - CONTINUOUS

           The hearse slews sickeningly sideways, but miraculously stops 
           in the direction Breece intended. He steps on the accelerator 
           and shoots down the snowy drive past the funeral home. 

           EXT. BREECE FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The gang of men have practically battered the front door down 
           and it hangs crazily on one hinge. Their heads turn as one as 
           the hearse streaks past. They immediately run, yelling toward 
           their parked cars. 

           INT. HEARSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coming off a hill, Breece is driving eighty miles an hour; he 
           steers left-handed while holding Corrie with his right.

           A wash of headlights trail him. He can barely see through the 
           windshield as he flies through an intersection.

           Breece fumbles with the wipers. He hits a dip in the road and 
           Corrie suddenly folds forward into the steering wheel; Breece 
           jerks her back and the wheel cocks dangerously.    

           EXT. MAPLE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The hearse slides on the road in a caterwauling of protesting 
           rubber, then rockets over an embankment toward a utility pole 
           in a sudden and eerie silence. 

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - CONTINUOUS

           CRUNCH! A simultaneous uproar of SPLINTERING wood and WARPING 
           steel and BREAKING glass as the hearse SLAMS into a telephone 
           pole; the wires are pulled tight and the pole swings overhead 
           until it separates.

           WHAM! It COLLIDES with the engine in one final outraged burst 
           of WRENCHING metal. 

           Breece crawls out and immediately falls onto the snowy ground 
           with a broken leg twisting beneath him.

           He slithers around the hearse to the passenger side and opens 
           the door. He grabs Corrie and starts tugging her out. 
           EXT. MAPLE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The gang of men jump out of their cars and begin running down 
           the embankment. 

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Above the hearse, two electrical wires snap together and send 
           arcs of bright blue fire into the night. Breece has his right 
           elbow locked around Corrie as he drags her into the field.  

           He makes it a few feet when the men reach him, shouting vague 
           obscenities. 

           Breece releases Corrie and pulls the Luger out of his crimson 
           robe. He sits holding it uncertainly. The men halt. 

           Holding the gun with both hands, Breece puts the acrid barrel 
           into his mouth. 

                                 FENTON
                        You stop right there. You come any 
                        closer and I’ll blow my head off. 

           The FOREMOST MAN leans forward with his hand on his knee; his 
           face is florid with a weary rage in his eyes. 

                                 FOREMOST MAN
                        You go ahead, you worthless son of 
                        a bitch and save me the quarter it 
                        would cost me to do it myself. 

                                 FENTON
                        I’ll do it in a second. I’ll count 
                        to five and then I’ll do it. Ten-- 

           The man straightens up and KICKS the Luger viciously away; it 
           TEARS out the left corner of Breece’s mouth and pieces of his 
           bloody teeth fling across the snow. 

           Breece whimpers softly as blood drips from his chin. The gang 
           stands before him and Corrie in a perverse awe. A SQUATTY MAN 
           stumbles closer.  

                                 SQUATTY MAN
                        Lord God. What are we goin to do 
                        with him?

                                 FOREMOST MAN
                        Do any fuckin thing you want to as 
                        long as I don’t have to touch him. 
           Haggis kneels before Corrie; he pulls the gown over her naked 
           hips. 

                                 HAGGIS
                        Jesus.

           Two other men haul Breece erect and carry him toward the road 
           like some loathsome weight. 

           EXT. HOLLOW - NIGHT

           Tyler trudges on. Two hills begin to rise. He hears a curious 
           and familiar sound; it is a mournful and high pitched KEENING 
           of one constant note. 

           He instantly knows where he is. A flood of relief courses his 
           body as he continues up the hollow through the snow. 

           EXT. WHISTLING WELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler passes the WHISTLING WELL and its barbed-wire fence; he 
           descends upon the narrow man-made ARCH of stone.  

           Tyler kicks the snow off of the FLAT CIRCULAR STONE buried in 
           the earth. He lifts it aside and pries the TOBACCO TIN out of 
           the ground; he puts it into his back pocket. 

           He turns and moves toward the hollow, then stops abruptly and 
           looks speculatively at the whistling well.  

           Some core of stubbornness hardens within him and he begins to 
           dismantle the barbed-wire fence. He kicks the boards free and 
           boots them into the bottomless hole.   

           Tyler removes the ARMY BLANKET from his shoulders and lays it 
           across the fissure; he fastens each corner with a stone. 

           EXT. HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           He rushes down the hillside and begins to collect armloads of 
           snowy leaves and brush.  

           EXT. WHISTLING WELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler spreads them across the blanket. A thin skim of snow is 
           beginning to form and it appears the hole does not exist; the 
           ceaseless note grows fainter and fainter.  
           EXT. TREE LINE - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler dashes to the line of trees. He pulls the HUNTING KNIFE 
           out of his belt and cuts dozens of branches from their limbs. 

           He saws husks off of whiteoak trunks and stuffs them into his 
           pockets. He returns the knife to his belt and gathers as many 
           branches as he can carry. 

           EXT. HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler pulls the husks out of his pockets and places them in a 
           natural depression of stone. He sites several of the smallest 
           branches on top and fumbles out the WORLD WAR II ZIPPO. 

           He snaps the wheel multiple times before it finally catches a 
           flame; he sets it to the tinder. 

           The husks burn in bright fluxing wires. Tyler feeds them with 
           more wood; the fire wavers in the wind, then begins to build.

           His face is sharp and intent in the orange glare. He piles on 
           the largest branches and flames rise. The fire roars and pops 
           as the wind pumps billowing smoke up the hollow.  

           Tyler continues to dump wood into the flames and within a few 
           minutes, an enormous bonfire is roaring full-throated; sparks 
           cascade upward into the falling snow. 

           EXT. WHISTLING WELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler returns to the narrow man-made arch of stone. He squats 
           behind it and waits with drowsed exhaustion. The well appears 
           to no longer exist, hidden by his trap. 

           EXT. HARRIKIN - LATER

           Granville moves through shadowed bottomlands; the trudging is 
           painfully slow. His body aches with every step, but an orange 
           glow on a distant bluff beckons him forward. 

           EXT. HOLLOW - LATER

           Granville climbs up the recess of stone and silently aims his 
           rifle. The wind blows and the fire flares. He spins like some 
           wild beast ready to catch whatever scent it might bring. 
           EXT. WHISTLING WELL - CONTINUOUS

           Tyler peers out from behind the arch; his eyes intensely call 
           Granville forward.

                                 TYLER
                            (sotto)
                        Come on, goddamn you. 

           Granville glances around. He crouches down and aims his rifle 
           as he steps toward the jury-rigged chasm, closer and closer.  

           His left foot hits the crude trap and the earth falls beneath 
           him like the gallows. He flings his rifle and claws wildly at 
           the stone. 

           Granville manages to grab a piece of wrought iron jutting out 
           from inside the well. He dangles precariously above the abyss 
           and his eyes are intent on the nearest lip of stone. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        Boy!

           Tyler walks to the edge of the hole and looks down. His fiery 
           eyes lock on Granville, who is opening his mouth in big gulps 
           of icy air as he desperately clings for his life. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        Listen. There’s money in my pocket. 
                        Better than seven thousand dollars. 
                        You can have it.  

           Tyler picks up the greatest stone he can find and clutches it 
           over his head. Granville watches him urgently. 

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        She ain’t dead. When them doctors 
                        come they brought her to. All she 
                        was was knocked out.

                                 TYLER
                        You’re a goddamned liar. She was 
                        dead before I left her and Fenton 
                        Breece has got her somewhere. 

                                 GRANVILLE
                        This money’s in my right front 
                        pocket. I can feel it burnin my 
                        leg. It’s yourn if you want it. We 
                        can get a lot more out of that 
                        crazy undertaker. 

           Granville extends his hand. Tyler stands in a brief moment of 
           indecision, then suddenly swings the stone.  
           It STRIKES the outstretched hand and Granville swings like an 
           errant pendulum. As he comes back around, he claws feverishly 
           at the stone. 

           Tyler is crying as he wields the stone once more and HITS him 
           solid; the stone flies out of his hands. Granville slips down 
           the length of wrought iron and bounces up and down.

           Tyler hunkers down and begins to STOMP the end of the wrought 
           iron dementedly. Granville reaches for Tyler in one Herculean 
           effort and SNAGS the instep of his boot; he YANKS. 

           Tyler slips half way into the chasm and catches the pole with 
           his armpits. Granville PULLS harder and Tyler slides down the 
           wrought iron; hero and villain are apparently locked together 
           forever as they wrestle to survive.   

                                 GRANVILLE (CONT’D)
                        The Gates of Hell are welcoming 
                        both of us--

           Tyler wrenches the HUNTING KNIFE out of his belt and tries to 
           STAB Granville, but he grabs the serrated blade with his hand 
           and it slices against his palm. They continue to fight.  

           But Granville can not withstand the pain. The blade JAMS into 
           the base of his throat. A spittle of blood dislodges from his 
           mouth and Granville releases his grip. 

           He plummets down the abyss as his far away eyes diminish into 
           nothingness. 

                                 TYLER
                        Not today.

           Tyler crawls up the lip of stone and onto steadier ground; he 
           falls onto his back and studies the stars.

           EXT. HOLLOW - LATER

           Tyler sits dully before the dwindling flame. He takes out the 
           tobacco tin and opens it. He eyes the pictures. 

           He feeds them to the fire; their edges curl and darken as the 
           perverse images bubble and burn with little blue flames. 

                                                         MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. CREMATORY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Corrie lies in a particleboard coffin; it sits on the sliding 
           steel rollers of a retort. 
           Its door cranks upward as the warm orange glow of its burners 
           hiss to life.

           The box slowly glides into the fire and is enveloped whole as 
           the flames cascade around Corrie’s face. 

           EXT. HOLLOW - MORNING

           The motley band of volunteers hunch red-eyed and weary before 
           the smoldering mound of ash.

                                 MAN 3
                        Son of a bitch.

                                 MAN 1 
                        Old man Bookbinder’s place is right 
                        down the ridge. He might of seen 
                        somethin. 

           Bellwether studies the hollow; it’s pristine with snow and he 
           tries to decipher what unfolded over the course of the night. 

                                 BELLWETHER
                        Maybe. 

                                 MAN 1
                        Want to go down there and see? Bet 
                        it’s warm. And it’s just possible 
                        Bookbinder might offer us coffee.

                                 BELLWETHER
                        It sounds better than bein poked in 
                        the eye with a stick. 

           The men stand; their breathing plumes palely as they climb up 
           the hollow. 

           EXT. WHISTLING WELL - CONTINUOUS

           As the men pass the whistling well, one stops and stares down 
           the hole warily. Bellwether approaches. 

                                 MAN 4
                        Hell of a thing to be just out here 
                        open in the woods. Without a fence 
                        around it or nothin. A man could 
                        damn sure get his ticket punched he 
                        didn’t watch where he was goin. 
                                 BELLWETHER
                            (knowingly)
                        Yes he could. 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. PRISON - DAYS LATER

           Breece sits in a cold cinder-blocked cell; both blue eyes are 
           as hollow and lifeless as a doll’s. Several days growth can’t 
           cover the wretched stitch-job administered to the gash on his 
           face. He is totally unmoving.    

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

           The weather has moderated and what snow remains lays in dirty 
           melting pools; the blacktop is muddy. Tyler skirts the deeper 
           areas of mud with a thought for the new shoes he wears. 

           He is carrying an old suitcase in one hand and a simple brass 
           URN in the other. 

           A Lincoln drives past, but doesn’t stop. Tyler steps onto the 
           shoulder to avoid the tire-slung sluice of muddy water. A big 
           sticker adorns the back of the car claiming Jesus Is God.

           Tyler sets the suitcase in a dry spot and seats himself on it 
           as he carefully places the urn aside. He takes off one of his 
           shoes and rubs his heel contemplatively.

           Far off down the highway, the sound of tires on macadam grabs 
           his attention, then the car itself wavering and ephemeral.

           Tyler slips his shoe back on; he stands and extends his thumb 
           as the car gains solidity in a rush.  

           A black Buick stops next to him and sits waiting. Tyler picks 
           up the urn and old suitcase. He looks through the glass and a 
           curious play of light behind him renders it mirrored. He eyes 
           his reflection.  

           In this altered light is a new Tyler, older and perhaps wiser 
           and more versed in the reckless ways of a reckless world. 

           He opens the door and gets in. 

                                                             FADE OUT.
