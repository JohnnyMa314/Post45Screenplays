           INT. MALLOY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           It’s a few minutes before homeroom, and kids are scurrying to 
           their classes. A BUNCH OF DUDES are standing by their 
           lockers. 

           One of them checks the time on his phone, and holds it up to 
           his buddies. 

                                 DUDE #1
                        OH, COME ON!

                                 DUDE #2
                        The waiting IS the hardest part.

           We see the clock the wall CLICK from 7:44am to 7:45am. 

                                 DUDE #3
                        Showtime.

           Everything goes into SLOW MOTION as we see the TWO 
           UNBELIEVABLY GORGEOUS 17 YEAR OLD GIRLS: JESS & CASEY. 

           They both look and dress like models. Jess is more 
           traditionally glam, Casey is a little artsier and edgy.

                                 DUDE #1
                        Jess and Casey.

                                 DUDE #2
                        Part of your well-balanced daily 
                        dose of HOTNESS. 

           We close up on Jess, the taller of the two. Her name appears 
           underneath her face, as three sort of “Pop up windows” pop up 
           around her. Each window shows a part of her life.

           WINDOW ONE: TITLE CARD: “VARSITY GIRLS’ BASKETBALL” We see 
           Jess hitting a 3 pointer.

           WINDOW TWO: “PRESIDENT: DRAMA CLUB,” She’s playing Hamlet.

           WINDOW THREE: “SELF-STYLED INTERNET FASHION ICON,” Jess snaps 
           a picture of herself as she puts the finishing stitches into 
           an AMAZING dress. While she’s wearing it.

           The windows disappear as we pan over to Casey. She rocks the 
           “Hot Indie Rock Librarian” look.  

                                 DUDE #3
                        Jess is obviously hotter.
                                 DUDE #4
                        You’re high. It’s Casey all the 
                        way. 

           Again, Casey’s name appears underneath her, as the pop up 
           windows pop up around her. 

           WINDOW ONE: “PRESIDENT: DEBATE CLUB” She slams her fist onto 
           her podium. Her opponent breaks down crying.

           WINDOW TWO: “YOUNGEST BIKRAM YOGA INSTRUCTOR IN SEATTLE” She 
           holds a difficult pose as students pass out around her. 

           WINDOW THREE: “WEB GURU” She uploads the picture Jess just 
           took of herself to Jess’ website. Soon, hundreds of pics pop 
           up in response, all of girls wearing a dress like Jess’.

           The windows disappear. Casey and Jess are fully around the 
           corner. Then, a few seconds behind them is their best friend, 
           BIANCA. 

           Bianca, like most ordinary teenagers, dresses like she 
           realized she had to get dressed two minutes before school 
           started. 

                                 DUDE #1
                           (sad trombone noise)
                        Wah-WAHHHHHHH. 

           Bianca’s name POPS UP over her head, along with these 
           windows”:

           WINDOW ONE: “THRIFT SHOPPER” She’s trying on various crazy 
           outfits at the local Thrift Store.

           WINDOW TWO: “HONOR ROLL STUDENT” She gets an 102 on a test.

           WINDOW THREE: “INSTAGRAM GURU” She posts a picture of her cat 
           to Instagram, and it immediately gets 500 likes.

                                 DUDE #4
                        Show’s over. It’s just their DUFF.

           Freeze on Bianca. All of her windows disappear, and are 
           replaced by this one, directly over her face.

           NEW WINDOW: “THE DUFF”

           That window EXPANDS until it fills the entire screen, 
           bringing us to our...

           MUSIC: SCHLONG’S cover of “I Feel Pretty” 
           (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aTjju2OQa8)

           We see various pictures of groups of famous attractive people 
           and their entourages. The pictures are in black and white, 
           but each one has the least attractive person highlighted in 
           color. 

           EXAMPLES:

           *KHLOE KARDASHIAN with her sisters

           *SNOOKI with J-WOWWW

           *PEREZ HILTON with anyone.

           *And finally, a photo of Jess, Casey and Bianca.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           We cross-fade from the picture of Bianca to a close-up of the 
           real McCoy. 

           Lingering on her face as we are, we see that she is a pretty 
           young woman. Not a stick-figure American standard of beauty, 
           but a funky, earthy, gal who’s smile radiates warmth.

           She is being interviewed by an OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER. Maybe 
           for a job, maybe for college, it’s not important right now. 

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER
                        Favorite color?

                                 BIANCA
                        What do people usually say?

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER
                        Gree-

                                 BIANCA
                        RED. 

           She smiles. The interviewer laughs. 

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER
                        Are you a naturally contrary 
                        person? 

                                 BIANCA
                        No. 
           They both laugh.

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER
                        So let me ask you one more 
                        question. What was the most pivotal 
                        moment in your life?

           Bianca gets contemplative. 

                                 BIANCA
                        You have a few minutes, right?

                                 OFFSCREEN INTERVIEWER
                        Take as much time as you want. 

           Bianca takes a deep breath, and a sip of Diet Coke.

                        High school. Junior year.

           INT. MALLOY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           We pick up right where we left off, with the dudes walking 
           off in a huff. The girls don’t notice at all.

                                 JESS
                        Wanna hit that new H&M after 
                        school?

                                 CASEY
                        Jesus, Jess, it’s 7:45 in the 
                        morning and you want to talk about 
                        shopping?

                                 JESS
                        I wanted to talk about shopping at 
                        4:45 this morning, but I showed 
                        restraint. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (checking her schedule on 
                           her phone.)
                        Damn. I wish I could. I’m booked. 
                           (she swipes the screen)
                        And so are you two! Jess, you have 
                        play practice, and Casey, you have 
                        your “Firefly” meet-up! 

                                 JESS
                        I’m not called until 7.
                                 CASEY
                        And my meetup got called off 
                        because the organizer got mono. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (pockets her phone)
                        You should really send me schedule 
                        updates. 

                                 JESS
                        And you should go shopping with us. 

           INT. GYM CLASS - AFTERNOON

           The three girls are warming up for class. Jess does push-ups. 
           Casey is doing yoga. Bianca drinks a Frappuccino. 

                                 JESS
                           (to herself)
                        “Or not TO be.” “OR not to be.” “Or 
                        not to BE.” 

                                 CASEY
                        You don’t have to buy anything, 
                        Bianca. 

                                 BIANCA
                        To buy or not to buy is not the 
                        question. 

                                 JESS
                           (looks up)
                        Say that again?
                           (to Casey)
                        Record that?

           Casey points the phone at Bianca.

                                 BIANCA
                           (sighs)
                        “To buy or NOT to buy.”

                                 JESS
                        Nailed it. Email that to me. 

                                 BIANCA
                        You’ll get my invoice at the end of 
                        the month.

                                 JESS
                        I will pay you in AWESOME SHIT FROM 
                        H&M. Besides! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        We need to get our homecoming looks 
                        in order, ladies! It’s only a month 
                        away!

           Bianca sighs.

                                 CASEY
                        You ARE going to homecoming, right? 

           Bianca leans back. She gets a sad look on her face. This is 
           obviously a discussion they’ve had before. 

                                 BIANCA
                        More than anything. But...

           Jess puts a hand on her shoulder. 

                                 JESS
                        You talk to your dad lately? 

                                 BIANCA
                        We’re scheduled to have a catch-up 
                        phone call early fourth quarter.

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Look, normally I’m up for 
                        everything, you know that. But I 
                        always had this vision of Dad being 
                        there to, like, take my picture and 
                        hassle my date for my first really 
                        important dance. And he can’t do 
                        that from 3000 miles away. 

           Jess hugs her. 

                                 JESS
                        You take all the time you need, 
                        buddy. You don’t have to do 
                        anything you don’t want to do.

           Casey’s eyes narrow. She obviously disagrees with Jess.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        I feel a wave of Casey tough love 
                        coming on.

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, jesus. Assume the crash 
                        position. 
                                 CASEY
                        Your parents got divorced a year 
                        ago. It’s time to stop moping, get 
                        out there, and make things HAPPEN. 

                                 BIANCA
                        You sound like my mom. 

                                 CASEY
                           (sheepish)
                        Well...I think she makes some good 
                        points. 

           Bianca rolls her eyes.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Casey wasn’t the only one. 

           INT. ADULT ED CENTER (HALLWAY) - EVENING

           On a classroom door, we see a sign that says, “TONIGHT! 
           DOTTIE PIPER: ‘STOP MOPING, GET OUT THERE, AND MAKE THINGS 
           HAPPEN!’” 

           There is a LINE OUT THE DOOR of people waiting to get in. 

           INT. ADULT ED CENTER (CLASSROOM) - A LITTLE LATER

           Dottie addresses a packed room of rapt listeners. Bianca sits 
           in the very back row. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Mom didn’t handle the divorce 
                        particularly well, originally.

                                                     FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. PIPER HOUSEHOLD LIVING ROOM - 4:00AM

           Dottie is sitting on her couch crying and drinking Pinot 
           Grigio out of a beer stein. 

           She’s watching a rerun of the ancient “Simpsons” episode, 
           “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Bluefish.” 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Then, one night, inspiration 
                        struck, in the form of Homer J. 
                        Simpson. 

           We watch the episode along with Dottie.
                                 DR. HIBBERT
                        Now, a little death anxiety is 
                        normal.  You can expect to go 
                        through five stages.  The first is 
                        denial.

                                 HOMER
                        No way!  Because I'm not dying! 

                                 DR. HIBBERT
                        The second is anger.

                                 HOMER
                        WHY YOU LITTLE...!

           Dottie’s eyes go wide. She puts down her stein, grabs her 
           laptop, and types in “Five Stages of Grief.” 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Mom realized three things. 1. The 
                        stages of grief weren’t just for 
                        blowfish poisoning victims. 2. 
                        Pinot tastes better out of a wine 
                        glass. And 3....

           INT. ADULT ED CENTER (CLASSROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           Dottie is pointing to a piece of foam-core with the five 
           stages of grief on them. (DENIAL, ANGER, BARGAINING, 
           DEPRESSION, ACCEPTANCE) The title on the board reads, “THE 
           FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF.” 

                                 DOTTIE
                        I was in the “Depression” stage. 
                        But not for long!

           BEGIN “OVERCOMING ANYTHING” MONTAGE:

           We zip through all of the various self-help classes she 
           teaches. The stages on the chalkboard remain the same, but 
           the title and the students change.

           *TITLE: “THE FIVE STAGES OF UNEMPLOYMENT” Students are all 
           dressed in sweatpants and crummy shirts.

           *TITLE: “THE FIVE STAGES OF PET LOSS” Students are sad old 
           women wearing cat sweaters.

           *TITLE: “THE FIVE STAGES OF MALE PATTERN BALDNESS” Students 
           are all bald guys.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

           Dottie is shopping, surrounded by a CROWD OF PEOPLE vying for 
           her attention.

                                 PERSON #1
                        Dottie! I just want to stick pins 
                        in my husband’s eyes!

                                 DOTTIE
                        Anger!

                                 PERSON #2
                        I think if I keep eating 
                        cheesecake, I won’t care about 
                        being fat!

                                 DOTTIE
                        Denial!

                                 PERSON #3
                        If I clean the fish tank, my 
                        girlfriend will stop sleeping with 
                        her softball coach!

                                 DOTTIE
                        Here’s my card. You might need a 
                        private consultation.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Don’t get me wrong. I’m proud of my 
                        mom for finding happiness.

           Bringing up the rear is Bianca. She watches her mom and her 
           admirers from afar, and smiles a melancholy smile. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I just keep waiting for it to 
                        trickle down to me.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The girls are walking to class.

                                 BIANCA
                        After MINUTES of thinking it over, 
                        I’ve decided I can go shopping with 
                        you guys.
                                 JESS
                        And there was much rejoicing!

           They laugh. Just then, a bunch of POPULAR GIRLS approach Jess 
           and Casey. 

           A POP-UP WINDOW appears over all of them that reads, “POPULAR 
           GIRLS. PRETTY. VACANT.”

                                 POPULAR GIRL #1
                        Hey, Casey and Jess! You guys going 
                        to the party at Tony’s Friday 
                        night?

                                 POPULAR GIRL #2
                        His dad works for Red Bull, so it’s 
                        going to be a serious all-nighter.

                                 BIANCA
                           (excited)
                        Sounds great!

           The two popular girls look at each other, and then at Jess 
           and Casey. It’s obvious to everyone but Bianca that she was 
           not part of this invite. 

           Casey’s not having it. She gestures to herself, Jess and 
           Bianca. 

                                 CASEY
                        WE’LL ALL be there.

           The popular girls shrug and smile. Ultimately, they don’t 
           care.

                                 POPULAR GIRLS #1&2
                        AWESOME!

           The popular girls walk off. Just then, Bianca’s phone BUZZES.  
           She looks. It’s a reminder that reads, “TOBY GUITAR 
           PRACTICE.”

           Bianca SMILES. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Would you guys excuse me? I have 
                        serious business to attend to.

           EXT. BEHIND THE SCHOOL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Leaning up against a brick wall, playing guitar, is TOBY. a 
           floppily haired, semi-awkward, black-wearing, guitar playing 
           kid who straddles the divide between “dreamy” and “dweeby.”
                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        That’s Toby.

           THREE POP-UP WINDOWS appear around him. 

           WINDOW 1: “DREAMY” - We see Toby flipping his floppy hair in 
           slow motion.

           WINDOW 2: “DREAMY” - We see him trying on a new leather 
           jacket.

           WINDOW 3: “DREAMY” - We see him reading feminist magazine 
           “BUST,” and nodding his head in agreement.

           The windows DISAPPEAR.

           He strums out chords, and hums over them. While he’s doing 
           this, the camera circles around the wall, and we see Bianca 
           sitting on the other side of it, out of his view. 

           Her eyes are closed, and she’s listening to Toby’s music. 
           She’s enjoying it very much.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        In addition to all of that, he’s 
                        strumming my pain with his 
                        fingers...

           We see an ARROW pointing at Toby’s fingers, with the words 
           “MY PAIN” next to it.

                                 BIANCA
                        ...Singing my life with his words.

           An ARROW points at Toby’s mouth, with the words, “MY LIFE” 
           next to it. 

           She SIGHS loudly. The music stops. Toby pokes his head around 
           the wall, and sees Bianca.

                                 TOBY
                        Hope I wasn’t oppressing you with 
                        my music. Just like an entitled 
                        white guy to think his actions 
                        don’t have ramifications, right?  

           She scurries away. Toby shrugs, and goes back to playing.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER

           Bianca is tromping to her next class, angry from so 
           thoroughly boning her encounter with Toby. A VOICE calls to 
           her.
                                 DUDE’S VOICE
                        HEY! B-GIRL!

           Bianca rolls her eyes. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (”oy vey.”)
                        Wesley. 

           We see WESLEY, the prototypical high school dreamboat who is 
           VERY aware of his status.  Bianca is 100% immune to his 
           charm, however. 

                                 BIANCA  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Wesley Rush was known amongst his 
                        friends, of which I was not one, as 
                        “The Bone Machine.” 

           He gets the pop-up windows.

           WINDOW 1: “JUNIOR VARSITY QUARTERBACK.” We see him playing 
           football.

           WINDOW 2: “LOVER OF ALL THE LOVELY LADIES.” We see him 
           dancing at a party, utterly SURROUNDED by ladies.

           WINDOW 3: “BIANCA’S NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR.” We see him through 
           his bedroom window, hitting it with a CHEERLEADER. Bianca, 
           who’s trying to study slams her window SHUT.  

           The windows disappear. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I thought he was kind of gross, he 
                        thought the same thing about me. 
                        But he needed me, occasionally.

                                 WESLEY
                        Where are Jess and Casey?

           Bianca pulls out her phone to consult. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Jess, Home Ec, Casey, Spanish 
                        class. 

                                 WESLEY
                        They going to the party tonight? 

                                 BIANCA
                        Haven’t discussed it. 
                                 WESLEY
                        Can you tell Jess and Casey I’m 
                        going?

                                 BIANCA
                        They won’t care.  

                                 WESLEY
                        Awesome. Gotta jet.

           He takes off. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        It’s not like I got anything out of 
                        talking to him...

           She checks out his butt as he walks away, and smiles. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        For the most part. 

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON 

           The three girls are trying on clothes. Jess is looking at 
           herself in the mirror, in a cute new tank top and skirt.

                                 JESS
                        I think I’ll wear this. What are 
                        you wearing tonight, Bianca? 

                                 CASEY
                        Did you even buy anything at H&M?

           Bianca holds up a new hair-thingy. 

                                 CASEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s all you’re wearing?

                                 JESS
                        Certainly a bold statement. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I didn’t see anything else I really 
                        liked...Or that fit. 

                                 JESS
                        What have I told you over and over 
                        and over again? Clothes don’t just 
                        magically fit. I can tailor them 
                        for you.
                                 BIANCA
                        Yes. I’m sure I’m just a few deftly 
                        placed stitches away from being 
                        Megan Fox.

                                 CASEY
                        Can you sew her mouth shut?

                                 BIANCA
                        Nice. I’ll probably just wear what 
                        I’m wearing. 

                                 JESS
                        What if Toby’s there?

           Bianca smiles.

                                 BIANCA
                        Toby doesn’t go to parties. He’s 
                        too cool.  And if he was there, he 
                        wouldn’t judge me by what I was 
                        wearing. 

           Just then, Dottie walks into the room. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Bianca, are you wearing that 
                        schmata to the party tonight? 

                                 BIANCA
                        ...Unlike some people.

                                 DOTTIE
                        You can do better than that. 
                        Bianca, come with me. Jess and 
                        Casey? No meth labs or anything 
                        while we’re out of the room.

           The three friends share a look.

           INT. DOTTIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dottie has her closet open to Bianca. It looks like a 
           “Chico’s” outlet. Lots of beige. Lots of earth tones. Lots of 
           shoulder pads. 

           Bianca is wearing a beige blazer with shoulder pads. She’s 
           not happy about it.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Now THAT’S a look.
                                 BIANCA
                        Can’t disagree with you there, mom.

                                 DOTTIE
                        You don’t like it.

                                 BIANCA
                        Well, it would be great if I were 
                        doing stand-up about how men always 
                        leave the toilet seat up...

           Dottie arches an eyebrow at her daughter.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Point taken, rotten, ungrateful 
                        child.  

           Dottie looks at her daughter in the mirror, and squeezes her 
           cheeks. Bianca looks less than thrilled.

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        Did I ever tell you-

                                 BIANCA
                           (rote)
                        -That I’m the prettiest girl in the 
                        whole wide world, and as soon as I 
                        manifest my inside potential on the 
                        outside, I-

                                 DOTTIE
                        -Will shine like a thousand suns. 
                        Okay. We’ve been through that, I 
                        guess. 

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        I mean it, though. Do you?  

           Pause. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m gonna get back to Jess and 
                        Casey. 

           Bianca exits. Pause. Dottie puts on the jacket, grabs a 
           hairbrush, and turns to the mirror.

                                 DOTTIE
                           (using brush as mic)
                        “Men! They always leave the seat 
                        up, am I right, Ladies?”

           She nods. That’s good stuff. 
           INT. SUBURBAN TEEN HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           What seems like a very nice suburban house is getting torn 
           apart by what appears to be about a million high school kids. 

           We see Wesley arguing with a very attractive girl we’ll come 
           to know as ROBERTA. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        ARE YOU GONNA HIT ON EVERY GIRL AT 
                        THIS PARTY?

                                 WESLEY
                        YOU BROKE UP WITH ME MONTHS AGO!

                                 ROBERTA
                        I’M BREAKING UP WITH YOU AGAIN!

           Wesley walks to the basement, shaking his head. Roberta turns 
           to SALLY ANN, a gawky freshman girl who’s at her beck and 
           call.

                                 ROBERTA (CONT’D)
                        SALLY ANN! DIET COKE ME!

                                 SALLY ANN
                        Sure thing, Roberta.

           INT. SUBURBAN TEEN HOUSE PARTY (BASEMENT) - CONTINUOUS

           There’s a BUMPING dance party in the basement. Jess and Casey 
           are in the thick of it. 

           Bianca hangs out in a corner and nurses a Diet Coke. Jess and 
           Casey wave to her, and motion for her to join them. Bianca 
           thinks about it, but then she sees TOBY across the room. 
           Panic.

           She smiles and shakes her head, “No,” to Jess & Casey. They 
           go back to dancing. 

           Bianca takes a few tentative steps towards Toby, but is 
           immediately stopped in her tracks by Wesley. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Hello. Your girls look good out 
                        there. LOOK at them. It’s like they 
                        choreographed all of their moves! 

                                 BIANCA
                        Well, they knew you were going to 
                        be here, Wesley. 
                                 WESLEY
                        Really?

                                 BIANCA
                        Yes, I told them just like you 
                        asked, and their eyes sparkled with 
                        childlike wonder, and then they 
                        just started dancing. It was 
                        beautiful.

           Wesley isn’t listening.

                                 WESLEY
                        They sure are. Let me ask you, do 
                        they always dance like that 
                        together? 

                                 BIANCA
                        What?

                                 WESLEY
                        Do they do...You know...Other 
                        things together? Other things I 
                        might be able to join in on? 

           Bianca turns to walk away. Wesley follows her.

                                 BIANCA
                        WESLEY! It’s not my job to stand 
                        here and parse out pervy intel 
                        about my besties! 

           Wesley’s genuinely confused. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Well, yeah it is. I mean, everyone 
                        always asks you about them, right?
                        Right. Because that’s your job, as 
                        their DUFF.

                                 BIANCA
                        Their WHAT?

                                 WESLEY
                        DUFF. “Designated Ugly Fat Friend.” 

           Bianca freezes in her tracks. She’s stunned. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        SPOILER ALERT: This was NOT the 
                        most pivotal moment in my life.
           Wesley keeps talking. It is SUPER IMPORTANT to note that even 
           though he’s saying pretty awful stuff, he is obviously not 
           aware how much he’s hurting Bianca. 

                                 WESLEY
                        I mean...Look around the room. 
                        Every group of friends has one. And 
                        if you don’t know who it is, then 
                        chances are, it’s you.

           Wesley points to a GROUP OF GIRLS. All of them are 
           attractive, except one, who is acne-riddled and pudgy. An 
           arrow with the word “DUFF” appears over her.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        But it’s not just for girls. Like, 
                        over there...

           We see a GROUP OF GUYS, four of which look like Zac Efron, 
           and one who looks like Zack Galifinakis. He gets the DUFF 
           arrow as well.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s just how things work. DUFFS 
                        are an important part of any group.

           Arrows that say DUFF pop up all around the party, with a 
           final, gigantic one appearing over Bianca’s head.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        See, DUFFS have two jobs. To look 
                        not as good as their friends, which 
                        makes their friends look better...

           Bianca’s eyes go wide. We see her fists clench. She may 
           actually punch this jerk. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        And then the other job is to be 
                        their friend’s...Assistant. 

           We PAN over to the group of hot guys and their one weird 
           looking friend. A HOT GIRL walks up to the weird looking guy.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Hey! Your buddy Tom. Is he single?

                                 MALE DUFF
                           (taking a very long time 
                           to check her out)
                        He sure is. 

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Thanks! You’re sweet.
           The Male DUFF smiles. Back to Wesley and Bianca. 

                                 WESLEY
                        See! She got her info, he got to 
                        talk to a hot girl, and his friends 
                        didn’t have to do anything. 
                        Everyone wins. Kind of like us 
                        right now. 

                                 BIANCA
                        That’s nothing like us.

                                 WESLEY
                        What period does Jess have AP 
                        English tomorrow?

           Bianca starts to reach for her phone.

                                 BIANCA
                        Third, but let me-
                           (She realizes what she’s 
                           doing)
                        OH GOD.

                                 WESLEY
                        See? Being a DUFF, it’s a BIG JOB. 
                        And one that you do really well, 
                        which is why you’ve been friends 
                        with them, for, like, EVER.

           Bianca THROWS HER DRINK RIGHT IN HIS FACE. He’s genuinely 
           shocked by this turn of events. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        What...What was THAT for?

           She high-tails it out of the party before anyone realizes 
           what happened.

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Bianca is putting on her pajamas, while still talking to 
           herself. 

                                 BIANCA
                        “Designated Ugly Fat Friend?” I 
                        mean, I’m not even-

           She turns, and looks at her half-undressed self in the 
           mirror. 

           She’s wearing granny panties and a very utilitarian bra. 
           Neither do her any favors. 
           She turns sideways, and sees her “not bad, but could be 
           better” midsection. She swats the bottom of her untoned arms. 
           She runs her fingers through her mop of hair. 

           She looks like she might cry, but then squeezes her eyes 
           tight, and shakes her head while putting her pajamas on.

           She climbs into bed, and stares at the ceiling. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not The DUFF. 

           As she lies there convincing herself, the camera pulls out of 
           the room, and down the hallway. It stops on a framed copy of 
           the five stages of grief.  

           We PULL IN on the words, “THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF,” and 
           before our eyes, it turns into “THE FIVE STAGES OF DUFF.” 

           Then it pans down to stage one: “DENIAL.”

           TITLE CARD: “DENIAL”

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Bianca is sleepily getting ready for school. She, charitably, 
           looks like a total mess. 

           She walks by her window, and sees Wesley in his bedroom. He 
           is still wearing his Diet Coke-stained shirt from last night. 

           They catch each other’s eye. He points to the stain on his 
           shirt, as if to say, “What the hell was THAT about?”

           She slams the shades shut. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

           Bianca is walking to her locker. She sees Jess and Casey 
           standing there.  

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I hadn’t talked to Casey and Jess 
                        since the party. But I couldn’t 
                        bring myself to talk to them. 
                        Because...What if Wesley was...

           She turns the other way.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        ...Right?
           INT. 3RD PERIOD SCIENCE - LATER

           Bianca sits in the back of the class, staring out the window. 
           But really, she’s looking at her own faint reflection. 

                                 TEACHER’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bianca?

                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                        I’m not The DUFF!

           The teacher, MR. HENDERSON, is confused. The class snickers.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        I was just handing back last week’s 
                        tests. You got an “A.” 

           She takes her test, smiling.

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Wesley Rush...Not as good news. 
                        Another “F.” 

           Wesley walks up to the desk and takes his test. He plays the 
           whole thing off as a joke. 

                                 MR. HENDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Laugh it up. It’ll be 
                        hysterical when you can’t play 
                        football next season.

           Wesley slinks back to his seat. Bianca smiles. Good.

           INT. 1ST PERIOD SCIENCE - LATER

           Bianca is dissecting a frog, alone. Wesley wanders over.

                                 WESLEY
                        Hey, Duffy! Shouldn’t you be 
                        working with a partner?

                                 BIANCA
                        Shouldn’t you be working? 

                                 WESLEY
                        My lab partner’s on top of it.

           We see his lab parter, A HOT CHICK. She is staring into 
           space, applying lip balm.
                                 BIANCA
                        A real Madam Curie. (Pause) I 
                        prefer to work alone. Take the 
                        hint.

           He doesn’t. Instead, he leans on the table.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m the one who should be mad, you 
                        know. You ruined my favorite shirt. 

           Bianca slams down her scalpel. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Of COURSE I should be mad, 
                        dickhead! You called me fat! You 
                        called me ugly! 

                                 WESLEY
                        No I didn’t! I called you THE DUFF!

                                 BIANCA
                        “Designated Ugly Fat Friend.” 

                                 WESLEY
                        That’s just what it’s called! I 
                        mean, Troy Aikman was a Dallas 
                        Cowboy, but it’s not like he ever 
                        rode a horse! 

                                 BIANCA
                        Just go back to your lip balm 
                        receptacle, asshole.

                                 WESLEY
                        Look, I’m sorry I said it. If it 
                        makes you feel any better, you’re 
                        not as heinous as a lot of DUFF’s 
                        I’ve seen.

                                 BIANCA
                        Urge to kill RISING...

                                 WESLEY
                        Man, you are TOUCHY. Forget it.

           He wanders away, she goes back to work. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        While I was imagining I had Wesley 
                        under the scalpel, I was devising 
                        an experiment of my own. I had to 
                        prove to myself and Wesley that I 
                        wasn’t The DUFF. 
           INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Bianca strides down the hallway. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I would keep avoiding my two best 
                        friends for the next few days. 

           She walks right past Jess and Casey. They start to walk after 
           her, but she walks into a classroom and closes the door. Jess 
           and Casey look at each other. What the hell? 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Bianca’s phone rings. It’s CASEY. She turns her phone off. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I had to prove that I didn’t just 
                        live to serve them, and all that 
                        other DUFF bullshit. 

           She turns off the light in her room. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Was I ever in for a surprise.

           INT. LOCKERS - MORNING 

           Bianca is opening her locker. A KID standing next to her is 
           having trouble with his.

                                 BIANCA
                           (helpful)
                        Hey, sometimes you have to push in 
                        a little and-

           The KID just walks away from his locker, taking no notice of 
           Bianca. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           Bianca walks down the hall. One of her TEACHERS passes her. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Morning, Ms. Adams.

                                 MS. ADAMS
                        Can you tell Jess and Casey-?

                                 BIANCA
                        I haven’t seen them. 
           Ms. Adams walks off. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

           Kids walk by with their trays, and the LUNCH LADY scoops food 
           onto them, almost like an assembly line.  Bianca gets to the 
           end of the line, and looks at her tray. Empty. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (peeved)
                        GOD DAMN IT!

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Bianca is going through a shoebox of old photos.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        My worst fears were realized. 

           In every picture, they look amazing, and Bianca sort of fades 
           into the background. 

           We flash through the photos...

           PICTURE: Jess as Juliet in “Romeo & Juliet” Bianca is the 
           dowdy nurse.

           PICTURE: Casey and Jess dressed for some kind of formal 
           dance, and Bianca serving punch. 

           PICTURE: Halloween. Jess and Casey are dressed as Charlie’s 
           Angels. Bianca is dressed as Bosley. 

           Bianca THROWS the box on the floor. 

           She looks at the pictures scattered everywhere. She picks up 
           the Halloween picture.

                                 BIANCA
                        And WHY did I dress as Bosley? 
                        THERE WERE THREE ANGELS!

           EXT. BIANCA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bianca holds the box of photos over the garbage can, and 
           drops them in with a THUD. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        For those of you playing along at 
                        home, this was not my most pivotal 
                        moment. But it was a big one. 
           We slowly close up on her scowling face.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        You know in “Batman,” when the guy 
                        falls into the vat of acid and 
                        becomes The Joker? This was my vat 
                        of acid moment. I would never be 
                        the same. Because at that moment, I 
                        knew Wesley was right. That I was 
                        The Duff. And that. Made. Me...

           Close up on her lips. They speak.

                                 BIANCA
                        Angry.

           TITLE CARD: “STAGE 2: ANGER”

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           We see a picture of Bianca as a six year-old on her dresser. 
           She wears her hair in messy pigtails, a ringer T, and 
           overalls. 

           She OOZES attitude, and a “don’t-give-a-crap” vibe.

           Bianca is staring at it. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I thought to myself, “Who was I 
                        before Jess and Casey?” Before I 
                        was their DUFF?  

           Bianca grabs her hair in a way that approximates ponytails. 

           INT. BIANCA’S HOUSE (FRONT HALLWAY) - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Dottie is fixing herself up in the mirror before she goes out 
           for the day.

                                 DOTTIE
                        BIANCA! Time to seize the day! 

           We hear Joan Jett’s “Bad Reputation,” fire up on the sound-
           track.

           Bianca walks down the stairs dressed in her overalls, a 
           wrinkled ringer-t, and mismatched socks and sneakers. Her 
           hair is in ratty ponytails.
           She does NOT look like a person dressed up like a six year 
           old, just to be clear. She looks like a pissy, rebellious 
           teenager. 

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        You look crazy!

                                 BIANCA
                           (not missing a beat)
                        Crazy AWESOME. 

           And with that, Bianca’s out the door.

           INT. BIANCA’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Bianca drives to school, BLASTING music out of her stereo. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        The world had given me a gift. The 
                        gift of invisibility. A licence to 
                        do whatever the hell I wanted, look 
                        however the hell I wanted and 
                        generally not give a shit. 

           She looks at herself in the rear-view mirror, and scowls.

           INT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bianca parks her car on a diagonal, taking up two spaces. She 
           gets out of the car, and admires her work. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Sweet. 

           She passes a COUPLE OF BURNOUT KIDS smoking cigarettes before 
           class.  She takes a cigarette out of one of the dudes’ hands.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Not my brand, but thanks. 

           The burnouts look at each other. Bianca leaves them in the 
           distance as she strides towards school.

           Triumphantly, she takes a deep inhale of her cig. 

           Pause. She looks over her shoulder to make sure the burnouts 
           aren’t paying attention, and then coughs up a lung.
           EXT. SCHOOL FRONT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

           As kids rush past her, Bianca sits on the steps, taking a 
           picture of a caterpillar on her foot with her iPhone. 

           The homeroom bell RINGS. The kids are all now inside. Bianca 
           stands up, stretches, and checks her watch.

                                 BIANCA
                        Goodness. I’m going to be late for 
                        homeroom. 

           She shrugs, and goes back to her caterpillar.

           INT. HOMEROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The HOMEROOM TEACHER drones on about school stuff.

                                 HOMEROOM TEACHER
                        ...And Homecoming is right around 
                        the corner, so get your tickets 
                        now...

           Bianca walks into the classroom, and flops down in a chair. 

                                 HOMEROOM TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Bianca? Little late today?

                                 BIANCA
                        Yep.

                                 HOMEROOM TEACHER
                        Well, don’t let it happen again.

                                 BIANCA
                        I make no promises.

           She goes back to fiddling with her phone. 

                                 HOMEROOM TEACHER
                        Okay! Varsity Chess Club is meeting 
                        in the basement today...

           INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

           Bianca is eating some pudding while reading “US MAGAZINE.”

                                 BIANCA
                        Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay. Cocaine 
                        IS a hell of drug.
           The magazine is then PULLED out of her hands. Standing by her 
           table are Jess and Casey. Both have their arms folded. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                           (snatches magazine back)
                        I’m sorry? Do you people have an 
                        appointment? 

           Casey sits at the table. She’s a little emotional. 

                                 CASEY
                        You ditched us at the party. You’ve 
                        been avoiding us for days.

                                 JESS
                        You’re acting crazy.

                                 BIANCA
                        What the hell do you care? I mean, 
                        the crazier I act, the better you 
                        look in comparison!

           Bianca stops. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Ladies, I thought we could do this 
                        over the social networking site of 
                        our choosing, but...This isn’t 
                        working out. I quit. 

                                 CASEY
                        You quit...What?

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m tired of “Casey Jess Bianca.” I 
                        just want to be “Bianca.” So get 
                        over it, leave me alone, and find 
                        yourself a new DUFF.

           She walks off. Jess and Casey are stunned and sad. 

                                 CASEY
                        What the hell’s a DUFF?

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Bianca storms down the hallway. She is at once sad and 
           victorious, which reads as “Steely Resolve.” 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I did it. Ties with my blonde 
                        overlords had been severed forever. 
           We hear a TOBY’S VOICE from off screen.

                                 TOBY (O.S.)
                        Cool socks.

           We pull back to see that Toby is standing there, holding his 
           guitar case. All of Bianca’s bravado disappears. 

           Toby smiles, and points to her mismatched socks. 

                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        That’s kind of awesome. You don’t 
                        care about the American paradigm of 
                        beauty. I respect that. 

           Bianca looks like a deer in the headlights. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Here it was. Minutes into my 
                        emancipation, and the guy of my 
                        dreams actually talked to me. My 
                        retort?

           Bianca opens her mouth. Nothing. Then this comes out: 

                                 BIANCA
                        Socks are cool. 

           Toby looks at her. She turns bright red and walks away.

           INT. 1ST PERIOD SCIENCE - MORNING

           Bianca is busily mixing chemicals together. Wesley chats with 
           his hot chick lab partner.

                                 WESLEY
                        ...I wouldn’t call myself an 
                        expert, but I go to a restaurant, I 
                        know what kind of wine to order. 

           She GIGGLES. Bianca looks at them, and rolls her eyes. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        It was all so easy for Wesley. He 
                        was never tongue-tied. He could 
                        talk to anyone. ANYONE.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        WESLEY! Get back to work! 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Except his science teacher. 
                                 WESLEY
                        Aw, MAN! Why are you always on my 
                        case?

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        Because I don’t want you in my 
                        class next year, bitter and angry 
                        that you got kicked off the 
                        football team because you failed 
                        THIS YEAR.

           Wesley slumps back to his seat. Bianca raises an eyebrow.

           INT. CLASSROOM - END OF PERIOD

           Bianca is hanging by the door of the classroom, while Wesley 
           and Mr. Henderson finish up a heated discussion.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        ...Look, son. Do you think I WANT 
                        you to fail? Not play? Lose your 
                        scholarship? Do you think I want 
                        the Coach to wait by my car with a 
                        lead pipe?  

                                 WESLEY
                        Depends if that last part actually 
                        happens.

                                 MR. HENDERSON
                        I’ll ignore that. Just...Please. 
                        Apply yourself. Pass this class. I 
                        don’t want to have this 
                        conversation with you again. You 
                        understand?

           Wesley walks out without responding, past Bianca.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Bianca catches up to Wesley.

                                 BIANCA
                        Hey, can I talk to you? 

                                 WESLEY
                        You want to yell at me, too?

                                 BIANCA
                        Always. Every day. Every second of 
                        every hour. It’s what I love best. 
                        EXCEPT right at this moment.
                                 WESLEY
                        What do you want?

                                 BIANCA
                        I want to make a deal with you.

           Wesley looks curious.

           TITLE CARD: “STAGE 3: BARGAINING.” 

           EXT. BEHIND THE SCHOOL - AFTER SCHOOL

           Wesley and Bianca are talking by the brick wall. Wesley looks 
           incredulous.

                                 WESLEY
                        You want...What?

                                 BIANCA
                        There’s a guy. I can’t talk to him 
                        without making an ass out of 
                        myself. You never seem to have this 
                        problem.

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re asking me for...Dating 
                        advice?

                                 BIANCA
                        I know. It sounds completely 
                        insane. But I’ve been the DUFF for 
                        so long...So wrapped up in Jess and 
                        Casey’s lives...I lack...Skills.

                                 WESLEY
                        And I don’t. 

                                 BIANCA
                        There are many things you lack. 
                        Skills are not one of them. 

           Wesley leans against the wall.

                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t you hate me?

                                 BIANCA
                        Great question. Yes, because you’re 
                        a dipshit and a man-whore. And you 
                        called me the DUFF. 

           Wesley frowns.
                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah. I did. 

                                 BIANCA
                        But. You’re the only one in this 
                        whole school who actually TOLD me 
                        exactly where I stand. Jess and 
                        Casey didn’t. You’re a dipshit, but 
                        you’re an honest dipshit.

                                 WESLEY
                        Thank you?

                                 BIANCA
                        So here’s my offer: A trade. You 
                        teach me...Skills. Enough skills to 
                        ask Toby out on a date. Enough to 
                        ask him out to Homecoming.

                                 WESLEY
                        And...What do I get?

                                 BIANCA
                        I’ll take you on as my science 
                        partner, and make sure you pass the 
                        class with flying colors. 

           For the first time in his young life, Wesley is actually 
           giving something serious thought.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Well?

                                 WESLEY
                        Well...You have the easy part of 
                        the deal. I mean, you could pass 
                        that class in your sleep.  But I 
                        have to make you date-able?

           Bianca cradles her head in her hands. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, God. Bolt of lightning. Him or 
                        me. It doesn’t matter.

                                 WESLEY
                        Not to mention that we’d have to 
                        hang out, right? In public? I mean, 
                        I’m a pretty sensitive guy-

           Bianca GUFFAWS.
                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        -But my friends are dicks. 
                        Especially if they see me with you.

           Bianca, grossed out, turns to leave.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Wait! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it 
                        like that.

           Bianca stops.

                                 BIANCA
                        How could you have POSSIBLY meant 
                        that? I get it! I’m gross! I’m 
                        disgusting! I...Can’t believe I 
                        thought this was a good idea.

           She turns to leave.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy playing intramural “Wii Golf” 
                        next year, you TOOL. 

           Pause. Wesley takes a deep breath.

                                 WESLEY
                        Nobody’s ever asked my advice on 
                        anything before. 

                                 BIANCA
                        What?

                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t know if you’ve heard, but 
                        I’m...Uh...Dumb. Dumb guys don’t 
                        give great advice. 

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        What if I mess it up? What if I 
                        can’t help you? Not because you’re 
                        gross and disgusting. Because 
                        you’re not. But because I’m...An 
                        idiot?

           Bianca softens. 

                                 BIANCA
                        It’s not like you can make me any 
                        more awkward. 
                                 WESLEY
                        That’s tr-

           Bianca shoots him a look. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        See? Dumb. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah. So you’ll do it?

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s a deal.

                                 BIANCA
                        Awesome.

           She puts out her hand to shake on it. He puts his hand up for 
           a high-five. She awkwardly high-fives him.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        And awesome it was. In theory. Not 
                        everyone agreed, however.

           As this is happening, we see a TWO GIRLS observing this from 
           afar. We pull in on them. One of them is Roberta, from the 
           party. Wesley’s ex. The other is Sally Ann, her minion.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What the hell is this about? 

                                 SALLY ANN
                        Want me to do some recon?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Stat.

                                 SALLY ANN
                        Copy that. 

           INT. CASEY’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Casey and Jess are staring at something off-screen.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        This was a question a lot of people 
                        were asking about a variety of 
                        topics.

           We see what Casey and Jess are looking at. A whiteboard, with 
           the words I DON’T WANT TO BE YOUR DUFF written on it, and 
           question marks around it. 
                                 CASEY
                        What the hell is this about? 

                                 JESS
                           (reading off her laptop)
                        “Duff: A stiff flour pudding boiled 
                        in a cloth bag.” 

                                 CASEY
                        I bet that’s not what she meant.

                                 JESS
                           (reading more)
                        “Bad or useless, as by not working 
                        out or operating correctly.”

           Casey shrugs, and writes it down.

                                 CASEY
                        She HAS been pretty down in the 
                        dumps lately...

                                 JESS
                        Yeah, but we never told her she was 
                        bad or useless! We love her! 

                                 CASEY
                        Hold it together, girl. We’ll 
                        figure this out. We’re insanely 
                        smart. Keep reading.

           Jess takes a deep breath, and goes back to her laptop. 

                                 JESS
                           (reading further)
                        “Also slang for buttocks.” 

                                 CASEY
                        “I don’t want to be your butt?”

                                 JESS
                           (thinking)
                        Maybe it’s a “Human Centipede” 
                        thing? Like if we were all sewn 
                        together, she wouldn’t want to be 
                        the butt?

           Casey looks at her. 

                                 CASEY
                        I’m going to tell your parents to 
                        revoke your pay-per-view 
                        privileges.
           INT. COFFEE SHOP/BAKERY - AFTERNOON

           We pan over from a glass case of cakes to Wesley and Bianca 
           sitting and drinking coffee.  

           Well, Bianca drinks coffee, Wesley drinks Red Bull.

                                 BIANCA
                        You SURE you wouldn’t rather have a 
                        coffee?

                                 WESLEY
                        Nah, that stuff’s gross.

           He takes a big gulp of Red Bull. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        AHHH. Okay. My mind is Bull’d UP! 
                        Now tell me about...Tobor?

                                 BIANCA
                        Toby.

                                 WESLEY
                        Tuba. And you want to blow his 
                        horn. 

           Bianca quietly laughs.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Was that a laugh?

                                 BIANCA
                        No, I’d chalk it up to a small 
                        stroke. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Like a midget jerkin’ it.

           Bianca GUFFAWS.

                                 BIANCA
                        STOP! 

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m sorry, “Little Person.” 

                                 BIANCA
                        Okay, okay. That. Let’s start 
                        there.

                                 WESLEY
                        With little people j-
                                 BIANCA
                        Stop. No. It’s the fact that you 
                        will say anything. Anything that 
                        pops into your head. 

                                 WESLEY
                        What about it?

                                 BIANCA
                        Do people ever call you on it? 

           Wesley thinks. 

                                 WESLEY
                        No. They just laugh, high-five me, 
                        and occasionally make out with me. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Why is that?

                                 WESLEY
                        I assume it’s because I’m so 
                        handsome.

                                 BIANCA
                           (sarcastic)
                        So Step 1: “BE HANDSOME.” 

                                 WESLEY
                        You gonna write that down?

           Bianca rolls her eyes at him, but then kind of smiles.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        You should do that more.

                                 BIANCA
                        I don’t know, I roll my eyes at you 
                        a lot.

                                 WESLEY
                        Smile. You should smile more. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I...What?

                                 WESLEY
                        Do you have one of those lady 
                        mirrors?

                                 BIANCA
                        A...Compact? No. 
                                 WESLEY
                           (thinks)
                        Let’s move.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

           They’re standing in front of a store window.  We don’t see 
           what kind of store it is.

                                 WESLEY
                        This is my favorite shop in town.

           We pull back to see that it’s a store that sells MIRRORS. 
           Wesley checks himself out from every angle.

                                 BIANCA
                        Man, you LOVE you. You should 
                        totally ask you out to Homecoming. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah, I’m pretty amazing. Now call 
                        me a jackass. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (flat)
                        Gladly. Jackass.

                                 WESLEY
                        No, like you mean it. Like I said 
                        something totally stupid. Like, “I 
                        want to take all you ladies for a 
                        ride on my disco stick.”

                                 BIANCA
                           (grossed out)
                        UGH, you jackass!

                                 WESLEY
                        Now say it again, but smile.

                                 BIANCA
                        Also, you’re into Gaga?

                                 WESLEY
                        From the neck down. From the neck 
                        up she looks like the lunch lady 
                        who only knows the English word for 
                        “CORN.”

           She laughs, in spite of herself.
                                 BIANCA
                           (while laughing)
                        Jackass.

           She looks in the mirror, smiles again, and says it again.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                           (smiling)
                        “Jackass.” 

                                 WESLEY
                        So let’s say you’re talking to 
                        Timmy. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Toby.

                                 WESLEY
                        Whatever. Let’s say you get tongue-
                        tied. Or maybe you say something 
                        completely inappropriate. Just 
                        smile. He’ll know you’re happy to 
                        be talking to him. 

           Pause. Bianca gets a pen and paper, and scribbles some notes.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m writing that down. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Wait, that was good advice?

                                 BIANCA
                        It was.

           Pause. Wesley throws both fists in the air.

                                 WESLEY
                        WOOOH! I SAID A SMART THING!

                                 BIANCA
                        Don’t get cocky. Now run along. I 
                        have to go do our homework.

                                 WESLEY
                        More tomorrow? 

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah. 
                                 WESLEY
                        You have my number? 

                                 BIANCA
                        I live next door to you, dork. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Take this anyway.

           He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a card. Bianca 
           reads it: “WESLEY RUSH: AWESOME DUDE - 424-3193”

                                 BIANCA
                        Why do you...?

                                 WESLEY
                        My mom made them for me. She thinks 
                        I’m awesome. HIGH FIVE!

           They high five. Wesley takes off. Bianca watches him walk 
           away. 

                                 BIANCA 
                        Jesus, what a dork.

           She gets a funny look on her face.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        As I said the words, I realized 
                        something about Wesley that never 
                        occurred to me before. 

           Wesley stops to pet a dog, being walked by an ATTRACTIVE 
           CHICK.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Sure, he was a player, a popular 
                        kid, and attractive enough under 
                        certain circumstances...

                                 WESLEY
                        Who’s a good boy? WHO’S A GOOD BOY? 
                        Ah-WOOF! Ah-WOOF!

                                 BIANCA
                        But was he also, secretly, a dork 
                        in wolf’s clothing? 

           Wesley’s now talking to the dog’s owner.

                                 WESLEY
                        ...And who’s a good girl?

           The Attractive girl GIGGLES.
                                 BIANCA
                           (rolling eyes)
                        Oy. 

           Just then, Bianca’s PHONE BUZZES. She checks it. “BOOK 
           SIGNING.”

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Double oy. 

           INT. THE GLOWING CHAKRA - DAY

           We’re in THE GLOWING CHAKRA, a local spiritual health and 
           well-being bookstore. The sort of place that sells crystals 
           and dream-catchers and whatnot. 

           There is a line out the door. Not because Dottie is so 
           popular, but because she is gossiping with Bianca. They share 
           an orange and chat as people filter through with their books. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Oh, I just don’t know, Bianca. 
                        Wesley? The kid who ate mud pies in 
                        my garden when he was five? And 
                        six? And that one time when he was 
                        15? 

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m tutoring him in Science, mom. 
                        Believe me. It’s not going to turn 
                        into anything else. 

           An INTENSE CUSTOMER comes up to the table.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Who am I making this out to?

                                 INTENSE CUSTOMER
                        “To Phil: The World Is Against You, 
                        But I am Your Rock and Salvation. 
                        Love Forever, Dot-”

                                 DOTTIE
                        Yeah, let’s just go with “To Phil, 
                        Cheers! Dottie.” 

                                 INTENSE CUSTOMER
                        May angels bless you.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Charming. Move it along. 

           He walks away.
                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        What about that nice Toby boy?

                                 BIANCA
                        Wesley’s tutoring me in how to talk 
                        to Toby. So I can ask him out on a 
                        date, and hopefully to Homecoming. 

           Dottie is impressed. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Who’s idea was this?

                                 BIANCA
                           (smiling)
                        Mine.

                                 DOTTIE
                        That’s taking control! That’s 
                        maxifying your potential! 

                                 BIANCA
                        That’s...Not a word?

                                 DOTTIE
                        It is now! 

           Dottie stands up.

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        Attention, Chakra Shoppers! My

                        Well...

           Dottie shoots her a look.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                           (changes her tune)
                        I only wish I had two pairs of eyes 
                        so I could read two books at the 
                        same time!

           An IMPATIENT WOMAN IN LINE is tired of not having her book 
           signed. 

                                 IMPATIENT WOMAN IN LINE
                        Excuse me, is this going to take 
                        much longer? I’m on my lunch-break. 
                                 DOTTIE
                        I suggest you use this as an 
                        opportunity for a teachable moment. 

                                 IMPATIENT WOMAN IN LINE
                        How?

                        Oh, right on. Good point. 

           The impatient person closes their eyes.

           Dottie and Bianca smile. 

                                 DOTTIE

           INT. MALL - THE NEXT AFTERNOON

           Bianca and Wesley are standing outside of a “Victoria’s 
           Secret.” Bianca shoots him a look.

                                 BIANCA
                        Are you kidding me and my ass? 

                                 WESLEY
                        What? Look at me! My look is TIGHT! 
                        That’s half the battle, right 
                        there.

                                 BIANCA
                        I am not going to let you Tim Gunn 
                        me.

                                 WESLEY
                        Is that legal in this state?

                                 BIANCA
                        Forget it. Next lesson. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Look. You play World of Warcraft, 
                        right? 

           Bianca is surprised. 
                                 BIANCA
                        Uh...Yeah? How did you-

                                 WESLEY
                        I’ve seen you questing around 
                        Outland. Anyway, would you go into 
                        battle without the right armor? 
                        And, uh, under-armor? 

           Bianca thinks about this. 

                                 BIANCA
                        But my bras are fine-

                                 WESLEY
                           (pretending to cough)
                        COUGH - uniboob - COUGH...

                                 BIANCA
                        OH, SHUT UP. 

           Pause. She looks down at her chest, and sighs.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Fine. But you’re not coming in with-

                                 WESLEY
                        Wouldn’t dream of it. Let me just 
                        set you up.

           He takes a step in the store.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Ladies?

           All of the women working at Victoria’s Secret turn their 
           heads. They all know him. 

                                 VICTORIA’S SECRET WOMEN
                        Wesley!/What’s up, foxy?/He’s 
                        back!/Guten Tag, Herr Wesley!/etc.

                                 WESLEY
                        This is Bianca. Take good care of 
                        her. I’ve got a date with Panda 
                        Express!

           He takes off. The women watch him walk away, and then turn to  
           Bianca.

                                 VICTORIA’S SECRET WOMAN #2
                           (German, Heidi Klum type.)
                        Ach! Das Unibooben. 
           Bianca sighs. 

           EXT. VICTORIA’S SECRET - 30 MINUTES LATER

           Bianca walks out. She is wearing a new bra, not that we can 
           see it. But certainly, we see the results. It’s not a HUGE 
           difference. But it is a difference nonetheless. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Hey! They- I mean YOU, look great!

                                 BIANCA
                        Watch it. And thank you.

                                 WESLEY
                        I know my boobs. Now let’s keep it 
                        moving. We’ve got one more place to 
                        hit. 

           Wesley starts walking. Bianca checks herself out in the store 
           window one last time. She straightens her posture, and 
           smiles. They do look great.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I have to say, I was getting a 
                        little tired of Wesley making 
                        sense.

           EXT. FOREVER LEGAL - MOMENTS LATER

           “Forever Legal” is a young women’s store. It could charitably 
           be described as “Modern Tart Wear.” 

           INT. FOREVER LEGAL - CONTINUOUS

           Bianca has a horrified look on her face. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Luckily, it was short-lived.

           We see what she’s looking at. Wesley is holding up a pair of 
           stripper shoes, and a dress that seems to not exist more than 
           it does. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, HELL to the no.

                                 WESLEY
                        What? These shoes are the shit! 
                        Katy Perry has 50 pairs of these!
                                 BIANCA
                           (turning to leave)
                        I’ll be in the food court, asking 
                        random homeless people for clothing 
                        advice. 

           Wesley follows her. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay. Okay. Maybe those aren’t your 
                        jam-

                                 BIANCA
                        No, bunions and crippling back 
                        problems are TOTALLY my jam. 

                                 WESLEY
                        -But right now, I don’t know who 
                        you are from your clothes. I mean, 
                        I know who you are, because I do, 
                        but if I didn’t, I wouldn’t. You 
                        need to dress more like you, and 
                        less like nobody.

           Bianca stops in her tracks.

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, god help me. That aphasia-
                        flavored word salad made sense. 

                                 WESLEY
                        I don’t know what any of that 
                        means. But does it mean you’ll try 
                        this stuff on? 

                                 BIANCA
                        No. Frakking. Way.

                                 WESLEY
                        You know, we DO have a deal going 
                        here. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah, nowhere does it stipulate you 
                        humiliate me publicly.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m not going to march you through 
                        the mall. Look. If you’re going to 
                        get Toby, you gotta get out of your 
                        comfort zone a little.

           Bianca sighs. 
                                 BIANCA
                        Let’s do this.

           BEGIN TRYING ON CRAZY CLOTHES MONTAGE

           As AQUA’s “Barbie Girl” plays, we see Bianca emerge from the 
           Dressing room, wearing a variety of absolutely batshit crazy 
           outfits.  

           From gold lame tops, to leggings and legwarmers, from 
           miniskirts to mini-mini skirts, she gives it all a shot.

           The good news is, at no point does she look like “Dumpy Girl 
           in Tight Clothes.” Everything fits, her dignity remains 
           compromised. Mostly. 

           She even begins to ham it up for Wesley, striking dramatic 
           poses as he mimes taking pictures.  They’re both giggling 
           like school kids playing dress-up, which of course, they are.

           We pull back to see, peeking over a rack of clothes, Sally 
           Ann, Roberta’s minion.

           She has a cameraphone. 

           Click. 

           END MONTAGE

           INT. FOOD COURT - CONTINUOUS

           Roberta is eating a cup of lettuce. Her phone buzzes. She 
           looks at it. We don’t see what she sees. But it makes her 
           MAD. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Oh, it’s ON. 

           She takes an angry bite of lettuce. 

           INT. FOREVER LEGAL - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley and Bianca are walking out of the store.

                                 WESLEY
                        I can’t believe we were here for 
                        two hours, and all you bought was a 
                        hair thingy.

                                 BIANCA
                        You’re lucky I agreed to this at 
                        all. 
                                 WESLEY
                           (smiling)
                        I can’t disagree.

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA
                        Does that mean I looked...Good?

           Wesley collects his thoughts.

                                 WESLEY
                        Uh...

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, HERE we go. Just say it. I 
                        looked like an idiot.

                                 WESLEY
                        You looked...Good. The clothes 
                        looked good.  Just...Not...

                                 BIANCA
                        Together?

                                 WESLEY
                        That.

                                 BIANCA
                        So what you’re saying is, clothing 
                        like this isn’t my jam.

                                 WESLEY
                        Not your jam. But you are...Your 
                        own jam. And you should know that. 

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA
                        Well. I do now. 

           There’s a tiny, tiny little moment between them. Broken by 
           something catching Bianca’s eye. It’s a TOTALLY cute little 
           black dress. 

           Bianca is kind of enamored with it, in spite of herself. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, WOW. 

                                 BIANCA
                        That is AWESOME. But I require a 
                        smoothie. 
                                 WESLEY
                        You tried on the Ke$ha wear, but 
                        you won’t try this? You could 
                        totally rock this at Homecoming!

           Bianca takes the dress off the rack, and stares at it.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        There was no way I could tell him 
                        that I KNEW the other clothes were 
                        going to look goofy on me. But this 
                        dress...I wanted to look good in 
                        it. And I knew I wouldn’t. 

                                 BIANCA
                        What can I say? Chicks, man, we’re 
                        weird and mercurial. 

                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        WesLEY? 

                                 WESLEY
                        Oh, god. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Who’s that?

                                 WESLEY
                        Roberta. My ex. 

           Roberta approaches them, looking like a mannequin from the 
           store come to life. Leading the way is Sally Ann. 

           She then turns her attention to Bianca. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        And what’s this? If this is what 
                        you’re hooking up with, you’ve hit 
                        rock bottom. 

           Bianca winces. 

                                 ROBERTA (CONT’D)
                           (to Bianca)
                        So THIS is what rock bottom looks 
                        like.

                                 SALLY ANN
                        Oh, snap. 
                                 BIANCA
                        Do people still say, “snap?” 
                        Anyway, we were just screwing 
                        around. Not in that way. I’m...I’m 
                        gonna go.

           Bianca places the dress on the rack, and high-tails it out of 
           the store.

                                 WESLEY
                        Nice, Roberta. Real nice. 

           Roberta smiles smugly. 

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bianca’s room looks like her entire wardrobe exploded. She’s 
           trying on various outfits, and looking at herself in the 
           mirror. 

           She frowns, and flops on her bed.

                                 BIANCA
                        Ugh. 

           She sits up, and looks at herself in the mirror. Roberta 
           appears in the mirror for a split second.

                                 ROBERTA (V.O.)
                        ...Rock bottom... 

           Bianca grabs a flannel shirt, and lobs it at the mirror, 
           covering it up. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (looking around)
                        What a mess. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Bianca walks down the hall, lost in thought. She nearly bumps 
           right into Sally Ann, who is standing stock still in the 
           middle of the hallway. Waiting.  

                                 BIANCA
                        ...Hello?

           Sally Ann hands her a piece of paper. 

                                 SALLY ANN
                        From Roberta. 
                                 BIANCA
                        Don’t people text anymore? 

           Sally Ann walks off. Bianca looks at the paper. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Oh, no. 

           We see the paper. It’s Bianca, trying on an outfit at 
           “Forever Legal.” It’s taken at just the right angle for her 
           to look absolutely horrific and three times her normal size.  

           Written underneath it in big letters, “FOREVER DUFF.” 

           Off Bianca’s horrified reaction, we FREEZE FRAME...

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Back it up. 

           BEGIN REVERSE SEQUENCE

           We quickly RUN THE FILM backwards from Bianca getting the 
           picture to Bianca trying on clothes at “Forever Legal.” 

           END REVERSE SEQUENCE

           INT. FOREVER LEGAL - YESTERDAY

           We see Sally Ann snap the picture, and send it to Roberta.

           INT. FOOD COURT - YESTERDAY

           We see Roberta receive the picture, take an angry bite of her 
           lettuce, AND THEN, send it to two of her friends. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        You’re playing with the big girls, 
                        now, big girl. 

           We zoom in on her phone, and then into...

           INT. THE INTERNET - CONTINUOUS

           Following the various beams of light, TRON-like pulses of 
           energy, and cute cat pictures that make up The Internet, we 
           see BIANCA’S PICTURE split into 2 versions of itself. 

           They streak through cyberspace like tiny, poorly cropped 
           comets. 
           INT. FANCY COFFEE JOINT - CONTINUOUS

           The TWO POPULAR GIRLS both pick up their phones, and laugh at 
           the same time.

                                 POPULAR GIRL #1
                        Is that Jess and Casey’s friend?

                                 POPULAR GIRL #2
                        Viral?

                                 POPULAR GIRL #1
                        Viral. 

           They both hit “Send” on their phones.

           BEGIN “PICTURE” MONTAGE

           INT. THE INTERNET - CONTINUOUS

           The pictures split into 10 versions of themselves, all of 
           which streak into ten different directions around cyberspace.

           Some float to a giant “T” for Twitter. Others to a giant “F” 
           for Facebook. None float to the rickety, tiny “M” for 
           MySpace, however. 

           The screen splits 10 ways. We see various kids from all 
           corners of high school life receive the picture on their 
           various social networks, laugh, and send it off.

           The screen splits 20 ways, same deal.

           Pretty soon, the screen is just hundreds of little squares, 
           each with a mocking kid receiving and then re-sending the 
           picture.  

           We pull back, and all of the little boxes become a pixel 
           in...

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY = CONTINUOUS

           ...The picture of herself that Bianca is holding. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, no. 

           She looks up. Everyone in the hallway is looking at their 
           phones, pointing, and laughing at Bianca.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        So much for invisibility.
           INT. CAFETERIA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Bianca sees Wesley chatting with HIS BUDDIES.  They’re 
           laughing and carrying on, as dumb boys do. 

           Bianca approaches them. She’s still pretty emotional. People 
           are still pointing and snickering. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Hey, Wesley, I gotta talk to you 
                        about-

           The guys all look at her, and then at Wesley.

           Wesley’s eyes go wide with fear, but before he can say 
           anything-

                                 BUDDY #1
                        Oh, shit! It’s the chick from the 
                        picture!

           All of the guys BUST OUT LAUGHING.

                                 BUDDY #2
                        You sure? Hey, babygirl, bend over 
                        a little and hike up those pants so 
                        I can be sure.

           Bianca looks to Wesley for some kind of lifeline. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Wesley? 

           All he says is...

                                 WESLEY
                        Her boobs look okay. New bra? 

           Bianca goes from emotional to PISSED.

                                 BIANCA
                        My hero.

           She dumps a plate of food in his lap, and storms off. 

           Wesley’s pals laugh it up. Wesley stares at his lap. He knows 
           he screwed up.

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Bianca is crying in her bed. Suddenly, she hears a THUNK on 
           her window. 
           She looks up. It’s WESLEY, from his bedroom, throwing pencils 
           at her window to get her attention.

           She’s about to shut her blinds, when she sees that he is 
           holding a sign that says, “I’M SORRY.” 

           She grabs a piece of paper. She writes something on it, and 
           holds it up. It says, “COME OVER.” He nods, and dashes out of 
           his room.

           INT. BIANCA’S HOUSE (FRONT HALLWAY) - MOMENTS LATER

           We hear a doorbell and knocking. 

           Bianca opens the front door. It’s Wesley.

                                 WESLEY
                        I’m glad you wanted to-

           Without a second thought, Bianca lays him out with a right 
           cross to the chin. 

           She slams the door.

           Pause.

           The doorbell rings. She opens the door. Wesley is still on 
           the ground.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        May I come in?

                                 BIANCA
                           (sighs)
                        Sure.

           INT. BIANCA’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Wesley and Bianca sit at her kitchen table. Wesley has a bag 
           of frozen okra on his face. Bianca has a bag of broccoli on 
           her hand. 

           This is the first time we see a more contemplative side of 
           Wesley. He seems tired. Upset with himself, and his friends. 

                                 WESLEY
                        You had every right to do that. 

                                 BIANCA
                        You’re goddamn right I did. 

           Pause.
                                 WESLEY
                        Roberta was way out of line. But 
                        she understands what she did...Was 
                        wrong.

                                 BIANCA
                        OF COURSE IT WAS WRONG, YOU SHIT-
                        TARD! THAT’S WHY SHE DID IT!

                                 WESLEY
                        I know. There’s nothing I can 
                        really do about her. 

           Pause. They both slump back in their chairs. Bianca looks at 
           Wesley’s hand. It’s red and swollen like hers. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Why is your hand messed up?

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re not the only one exercising 
                        their right hook today. Like I 
                        said. I can’t do anything about 
                        Roberta sending the pictures, 
                        but...

                                 BIANCA
                        But?

                                 WESLEY
                        The receivers are a different 
                        story.

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - EARLIER THAT DAY

           Wesley has a scrawnier JOCK DUDE up against a locker.

                                 WESLEY
                        NOBODY ELSE SEES THAT PICTURE. TELL 
                        EVERYONE.

                                 JOCK DUDE
                        I don’t know that many people!

                                 WESLEY
                        MAKE MORE FRIENDS AND TELL THEM.

           INT. BIANCA’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley rubs his hand.
                                 WESLEY
                        You do that four or five times in a 
                        day, suddenly everyone finds 
                        something else to talk about.

                                 BIANCA
                        I’ve never had anyone go on a 
                        punching spree for me before.

                                 WESLEY
                        Don’t get used to it. There’s 
                        rumors going around that I’m on the 
                        ‘roids. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m sure you’re not telling them 
                        any different. 

                                 WESLEY
                        How?

                                 BIANCA
                        That you were sticking up for me. 
                        Because you’re a good guy. And 
                        we’re, you know, friends.

           Pause. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Are we friends?

           Bianca doesn’t know what to say.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I know we have this deal, 
                        but...I mean, I didn’t think you 
                        thought of me as a friend.

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        I just figured you were kind of too 
                        smart and funny to be friends with 
                        a dipshit like me. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m pretty sure I am. 

           Wesley stands up. We see that he has a tiny bag with him. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Irregardless-
                                 BIANCA
                        -Not a word.

                                 WESLEY
                        Well, irregardless of that, what 
                        happened today will never, ever 
                        happen again. 

           He hands her the bag. 

                                 BIANCA
                        What’s this?

                                 WESLEY
                        A peace offering. If you want to 
                        keep doing...Whatever this thing we 
                        do is, I’m around. 

           He turns to leave.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Can I keep this Oprah?

                                 BIANCA
                        Okra. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Right. I’ll, uh...See you around.

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I’m sorry I ever called you 
                        the DUFF. I was an idiot. You’re 
                        awesome. I’m still an idiot.

           He exits.  Pause. She waits to hear the door close, and looks 
           in the bag. 

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Bianca has her eyes closed. She tentatively opens them, and 
           looks at herself in the mirror.

           She is wearing Wesley’s peace offering. The little black 
           dress. 

           It neither looks great or terrible on her. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        In my head, I was expecting some 
                        big reality show reveal. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BIANCA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But it was just me. Me in a dress 
                        that wasn’t me. 

           Bianca goes to take it off. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Still. It was nice of Wesley. It 
                        didn’t make him less of an idiot, 
                        but it made him less of an 
                        egregious idiot. 

           EXT. BEHIND THE SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Bianca is sitting with her back to the brick wall, listening 
           to Toby on the other side. 

           Wesley, in his football uniform, takes a break from practice 
           to run over. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Hey, B! We on for this weekend? 

                                 BIANCA
                           (panicky, whispered)
                        SHH! He doesn’t know I’m here!

                                 WESLEY
                           (whispering)
                        Who doesn’t know you’re where?

           She points to the other side of the wall. 

           Wesley pokes his head around. He sees Toby. Toby stops 
           playing, and looks at him.

                                 TOBY
                        Hey.

                                 WESLEY
                        Hey. There’s nobody on the other 
                        side of this wall.

                                 TOBY
                        Huh?

                                 WESLEY
                        Just so you know. 

           Wesley walks back around to Bianca.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re clear. He doesn’t suspect a 
                        thing. 
           Bianca puts her head in her hands. 

           One of Wesley’s buddies yells to him.

                                 BUDDY #1
                        WESLEY! GET BACK HERE! WHAT THE 
                        HELL ARE YOU DOING?

                                 WESLEY
                        I’M TALKING TO MY FRIEND BIANCA! 
                        WHO IS TOTALLY MY FRIEND, NO MATTER 
                        WHAT YOU DICK-HEADS HAVE TO SAY 
                        ABOUT IT!

           Now it’s Toby’s turn to poke his head around the wall. Toby, 
           Bianca, and Wesley all stare at each other. 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                           (to Toby)
                        Oh, hey. Turns out there IS 
                        somebody here. 

           Toby smiles at Bianca. 

                                 TOBY
                        Oh. With the cool socks.

                                 BIANCA
                        That’s me. 

                                 TOBY
                        Bianca.

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah.

                                 TOBY
                        Cool.

           He goes back to the other side of the wall. Pause.

                                 WESLEY
                        Hey! You didn’t freeze up!

                                 BIANCA
                        I didn’t? (beat) I didn’t!

                                 WESLEY
                        You didn’t ask him out, either.

                                 BIANCA
                        SHHHHHHH!!!!
                                 WESLEY
                        Right. Sorry. I’m gonna go throw a 
                        ball and tackle people.

           Wesley runs off. Bianca looks bewildered.

                                 BIANCA
                        What just happened?

           She watches Wesley back on the field. 

                                 TEAMMATE
                        Hey! Wesley! You still talking to 
                        that big ugly DUF-

           Wesley tsckles him.

                                 WESLEY
                        ‘ROID RAGE!

           BEGIN “BIANCA’S SLOW TRANSFORMATION” MONTAGE

           We watch Wesley and Bianca working together on both school-
           work and Bianca work.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        What happened was, for all of his 
                        millions of shortcomings, Wesley 
                        was having an effect on me.

           We see:

           *Bianca and Wesley studying in the library and laughing.

           *Bianca getting ready for school. Instead of putting on her 
           usual no makeup, she puts on a vaguely tinted lip balm.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        And the truth is, he didn’t really 
                        have millions of shortcomings.

           *Bianca and Wesley in science class. They are dissecting a 
           fetal pig. Bianca makes the first cut. Wesley looks like he 
           might pass out. 

           *Bianca getting ready for school. A thought occurs to her, 
           and she reaches for her hairbrush. She blows the dust off of 
           it, and brushes her hair. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Certainly, he was no Toby.
           *Bianca sees Toby in the hall. She straightens her posture, 
           and smiles as she passes by him. He smiles at her. They pass 
           each other. She exhales and slouches.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        But he was Wesley. And as far as 
                        Wesleys go, he wasn’t bad. 

           *Bianca and Wesley in science class. Tests are handed back. 
           She gets an “A,” he gets a “C-.” They’re equally psyched.

           *Bianca getting dressed in the morning. Her jeans have a 
           giant rip in them.  She trades them out for jeans with a 
           slightly smaller rip. 

           A pencil THUNKS on her window. She looks. Wesley is in his 
           room, holding up a sign that says, “KILLER JEANS, B.” She 
           smiles.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Bianca, walking to class, is stopped by the two POPULAR GIRLS 
           from the beginning of the movie.

                                 BIANCA
                        Ladies?

                                 POPULAR GIRL #1
                        Hi, Bianca!

                                 POPULAR GIRL #2
                        Hi, Bianca!

                                 BIANCA
                        Hi, Bianca! 

           They look at her a little funny. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for you?

           They hand her a FLIER.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        What, is this a picture of me 
                        flossing? 

                                 POPULAR GIRL #1
                        It’s an invite to the Homecoming 
                        Afterparty.
                                 POPULAR GIRL #2
                        We wanted to make sure you got one.

                                 BIANCA
                           (confused)
                        Why? 

                                 POPULAR GIRL #1
                        You’ve got Wesley punching out 
                        dudes in your name.

                                 POPULAR GIRL #2
                        You’ve ARRIVED. 

           They walk away. Bianca smiles. 

           EXT. WESLEY’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Bianca walks next door to Wesley’s house, and knocks on the 
           door. She hears shouting, and looks concerned. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        WESLEY, GET THE DOOR!

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        STOP BOSSING HIM AROUND!

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        MAYBE IF YOU DIDN’T CODDLE HIM, HE 
                        WOULDN’T BE FAILING EVERY GODDAMN 
                        CLASS!

                                 WESLEY (O.S.)
                        I’LL GET IT!

           Wesley opens the door. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Ready to go?

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah.

           INT. BIANCA’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Bianca drives, and Wesley stares at his shoes.

                                 BIANCA
                        So...Library? Mall? 

           Wesley doesn’t say anything.
                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Surface of the Earth’s sun? 

                                 WESLEY
                        That sounds good.

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA
                        Want to talk?

                                 WESLEY
                        I want to not talk.

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA
                        I know just the place. 

           EXT. LOCAL PUBLIC PARK (WOODED AREA) - A LITTLE LATER

           In the foreground, we see a large, flat rock in a clearing. 
           Bianca clears some branches out of the way, and she and 
           Wesley walk towards it. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I give you, “Think Rock.” 

                                 WESLEY
                        Did you discover it?

                                 BIANCA
                        Yep. 1492. Claimed it for Spain. 

           Wesley laughs.

                                 WESLEY
                        So, what happens here?

                                 BIANCA
                        You sit on the rock and think. Or, 
                        I do anyway.

           They sit. 

                                 WESLEY
                        How long have you...

                                 BIANCA
                        Since my parents’ divorce last 
                        year. I needed a quiet place, that 
                        wasn’t filled with angry, screaming 
                        people. 
                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah. That.

                                 BIANCA
                        Are your parents getting...?

                                 WESLEY
                        God, I hope so. 

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        If I’m not at school, I’m at 
                        football practice. Or at games. Or 
                        with my friends. Or out on dates. 
                        Or just sort of walking around.

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t love being at home.

                                 BIANCA
                        I don’t blame you. 

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY
                        Is it gonna get better?

                                 BIANCA
                        It has for my mom. Took her a 
                        while. 

                                 WESLEY
                        And you?

                                 BIANCA
                        Let’s just say I’ve logged a lot of 
                        time on this rock. 

           Wesley hangs his head down. He’s a little weepy.

                                 WESLEY
                        I hate them. I hate that I have to 
                        smile, and be cool and pretend that 
                        everything’s fine. And none of my 
                        friends care, anyway. They don’t 
                        want to hear that “poor me” shit 
                        from me. And girls just want to get 
                        to it. And that’s great. Because 
                        then I don’t need to think 
                        about...Anything else. 
           Bianca tentatively puts an arm around him. 

                                 BIANCA
                        It’s okay. 

                                 WESLEY
                        It’s not okay.

                                 BIANCA
                        It’s okay that it’s not okay.

           Pause. Wesley looks at her.

                                 WESLEY
                        I like you, Bianca. You’re not 
                        okay.

                                 BIANCA
                        I like you too, Wesley.

           Pause. They lean in, and kiss.

           They enjoy it for a few seconds, and then they both nervously 
           pull away.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I swear to god, there’s a pivotal 
                        point in my life in here somewhere. 
                        This ain’t it, though. I had no 
                        idea what the hell it was. And 
                        neither did Wesley.

                                 WESLEY
                        Woah.

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah.

                                 WESLEY
                        That happened.

                                 BIANCA
                        It totally happened.

           Pause. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Practice. 

                                 BIANCA
                        What?
                                 WESLEY
                        It’s part of the plan. Our plan. 
                        Um, you know, in case you’ve never 
                        kissed anyone before-

                                 BIANCA
                        I have. I mean, what is summer camp 
                        if not Club Med for kids?

           Wesley laughs.

                                 WESLEY
                        I...Figured. But maybe you needed a 
                        refresher course?

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah. Let’s go with that.

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay. Well. Good practice!

           They both laugh.

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah! Good game.

                                 WESLEY
                        Good game! 

           They bump fists. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Library?

                                 WESLEY
                        Library.

           They get up to leave. The camera slowly pans away from them, 
           to a bunch of bushes. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Know how they say, “The hills have 
                        eyes?” 

           We see Sally Ann has been hiding in them. And taking notes.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Well, so do the shrubs. 
           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Bianca confidently walks down the hall towards her locker. A 
           few kids smile and wave. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Finally, I had a basic 
                        understanding of what it was like 
                        to not be a total freak. And I 
                        LOVED IT.

           She smiles and waves back, whistling contentedly as she opens 
           her locker. Suddenly, it SLAMS SHUT.

                                 BIANCA
                        What the-

           We see ROBERTA standing there.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Stay the hell away from Wesley, 
                        freak.

                                 BIANCA
                        JESUS, you scared me. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        I can be a whole lot scarier. 

                                 BIANCA
                        How? Fangs and a cape? Zombie 
                        makeup?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Did you like that photo of you I 
                        sent around? I have TONS more like 
                        it. From “Forever Legal,” from 
                        “Victoria’s Secret...”

           Bianca’s eyes go wide. 

                                 BIANCA
                        The Victoria’s Secret pictures are 
                        in 3D. Better for the cellulite. 

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        What do you want? 

                                 ROBERTA
                        I want you out of Wesley’s life. 
                                 BIANCA
                        I thought you dumped-

                                 ROBERTA
                        Well now, I want him back. He’s 
                        obviously deranged with sadness 
                        over losing me, which has sent him 
                        to YOU. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Speaking of “Obviously deranged-” 

                                 ROBERTA
                        I’m not going to stand by and watch 
                        Wesley ruin his status in this 
                        school by chasing the likes of you. 
                        Thank god people just assume he’s 
                        on steroids.  

                                 BIANCA
                        He doesn’t care about any of that!

                                 ROBERTA
                        Oh, wake up! He’s a MESS. He mopes 
                        around all day. Obviously, it’s 
                        because of YOU. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I think his parents might have 
                        something to-

                                 ROBERTA
                        He doesn’t give a crap about his 
                        parents. They’re losers. He’s a 
                        WINNER. He needs to be around 
                        WINNERS like ME. Not losers like 
                        you.

           Roberta lets this sink in, and then she moves in for the 
           kill.

                                 ROBERTA (CONT’D)
                        Wesley will be back in my arms by 
                        Homecoming, bitch. You got that?
                        I’m going to be Homecoming Queen, 
                        and he will be my King. YOU? He’ll 
                        forget about you in two weeks. 

           Roberta storms off. Bianca sighs.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        In the past, this would have been 
                        enough to get me to hide under my 
                        bed.
           Her phone buzzes. “TOBY GUITAR PRACTICE.”

           She gets a determined look on her face. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        But I had a job to do. 

           INT. GIRLS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bianca fixes her hair, applies her vaguely tinted lip gloss, 
           and smiles determinedly. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        The fact was, in her own crazy-
                        bitch scented way, Roberta had 
                        reminded me of a two very important 
                        facts. One: I didn’t set out to bag 
                        Wesley Rush. And two: I didn’t want 
                        the entire school knowing the 
                        topography of my ass. 

                                 BIANCA
                           (Practicing into mirror)
                        Hi, there. Hi there! Yo. Hey.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I was in it to be able to talk to 
                        Toby. And to have him talk to me. 
                        And to have things go from there. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Let’s do this. 

           EXT. BEHIND THE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Toby is playing. Bianca takes a deep breath, and then sits 
           next to him.

                                 BIANCA
                        Hey. Mind if I have a seat?

                                 TOBY
                        Looks like you have.

                                 BIANCA
                        Aren’t you observant.

           She smiles. He smiles. 

                                 TOBY
                        Bianca, right?
                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah. And you’re Toby.

                                 TOBY
                        Indeed I am. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Let me ask you a question.

                                 TOBY
                        Shoot.

                                 BIANCA
                        Would you like to grab dinner or 
                        something this weekend?

           Toby straightens up.

                                 TOBY
                        Are you asking me out on a date?

                                 BIANCA
                           (unwaveringly confident)
                        I am.

                                 TOBY
                        But...Aren’t you with that jock 
                        kid? The one on the ‘roids?

                                 BIANCA
                        NO! No. No way. He’s a buddy.

                                 TOBY
                        A buddy.

                                 BIANCA
                        That’s right. 

                                 TOBY
                        It seems strange that an advanced 
                        woman of the new millennium would 
                        be hanging around with a caveman 
                        like that.

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m tutoring him in science. And 
                        teaching him how to walk erect. 
                        (pause) NOT LIKE THAT.

           They both laugh.
                                 TOBY
                        Well, I’m glad to hear that. I 
                        figured I couldn’t compete with a 
                        guy like that. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Compete? Over me? Hilarious.

                                 TOBY
                        Why is that hilarious? 

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m not the competing over type.

                                 TOBY
                        You could have fooled me. 

           Bianca smiles. 

                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        So. Yes. I would like to grab some 
                        dinner. With you. My place? 
                        Saturday? 8?

                                 BIANCA
                        Yes to all of the above. 

                                 TOBY
                        Sweet.

                                 BIANCA
                        Sweet.

           Pause.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Mind if I...

           She gestures to his guitar.

                                 TOBY
                        I was hoping you would. 

           She listens to him while he plays.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        After three years, I had finally 
                        made it to the other side of the 
                        wall. 

           She closes her eyes and smiles.
                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        And right then, I thought that was 
                        the most pivotal moment in my life. 

           INT. SCIENCE CLASS - AFTERNOON

           Wesley is working on an experiment before class starts. 
           Bianca rushes in.

                                 BIANCA
                        I DID IT! 

                                 WESLEY
                        What?

                                 BIANCA
                        I asked out Toby! And he said YES!

           She puts up her hand for a high-five. Wesley high-fives her, 
           but we get the sense his heart isn’t in it. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Way to go.

                                 BIANCA
                        Saturday! 8pm! IT’S ON! And I never 
                        could have done it without you!

           Wesley smiles. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        But don’t worry about this class. 
                        We’re acing it. Mr. Henderson will 
                        never trouble you again.

                                 WESLEY
                        I appreciate that.

           The bell RINGS. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Hey, you okay?

                                 WESLEY
                        Yeah. Happy for you. Glad I could 
                        help make it happen.

                                 BIANCA
                        Me too! And-

                                 WESLEY
                        Class is starting.
                                 BIANCA
                        Oh. Okay.

           The teacher begins to drone on. Wesley stares straight ahead. 
           Bianca looks at him sideways. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        The hell was his problem? Isn’t 
                        this what we’ve been working 
                        towards? Wasn’t this the plan all 
                        along? You’d think he’d be psyched!

           Bianca shrugs, and turns her attention to the teacher. Wesley 
           looks at her, and then back to the teacher. 

           INT. BIANCA’S LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Close-up on Bianca as she trots down the stairs.

                                 BIANCA 
                           (shouting)
                        MOM! I’M OFF TO HAVE THE MOST 
                        IMPORTANT EVENING OF MY-

                                 DOTTIE (O.S.)
                        SHHH!

           We PULL BACK to reveal that Dottie is standing on the couch, 
           as a ROOMFUL of WEIRD PEOPLE crawl around the room on their 
           hands and knees.

                                 BIANCA
                        What-

                                 DOTTIE
                           (to the crawling people)
                        ...In order to evolve to the 
                        acceptance stage in your mind, you 
                        have to evolve with your BODY. 
                        Right now, you’re primates. 
                        Skittering around the...Uh..Veldt. 

           The people begin to make primate/monkey type sounds.

                                 WEIRD PEOPLE
                        OOO OOO OOO!/AAA-AAA-AAA!/Ca-CA! Ca-
                        CA!

           One guy begins to mime throwing his poop. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Mr. Dobraux! There will be no poop 
                        flinging in my encounter session!
                                 MR. DOUBRAUX
                           (As if saying “Sorry.”)
                        CHEE-chee.

                                 DOTTIE
                        That’s okay. Now, in your own 
                        time...EVOLVE! Stand up! Explore 
                        the space!

           Everyone begins to stand up, and climb over the furniture.  A 
           bookcase gets knocked over in the process.

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay! It’s a safe space!

           Bianca has had enough.

                                 BIANCA
                        I’ll see you later, Mom. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Be back by 11.  

           Bianca rolls her eyes as she walks out the door.

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Let’s take a few minutes to 
                        discuss. Linda? How did you feel?

           LINDA, a large, sweaty woman, speaks in a deep voice.

                                 LINDA
                        Like I wanted to present myself and 
                        be mounted. Mounted in the veldt of 
                        my personal evolution.

           Dottie is grossed out.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Okay. Discussion time is over. 
                        Silent reflection time.

           EXT. TOBY’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Bianca rings the bell. She holds a bouquet of gladiolas. Toby 
           opens the door. He holds a bouquet of gladiolas.

                                 TOBY
                        Well this is the nicest kind of 
                        awkward.

                                 BIANCA
                        Trade ya.
           They trade bouquets.  

                                 TOBY
                        Come on in. Dinner’s getting warm.

                                 BIANCA
                        “Warm?”

           INT. TOBY’S HOUSE (DINING ROOM) - CONTINUOUS

           The lights have been dimmed, and the table is set with an 
           Asian theme. There’s an awesome looking sushi dinner spread 
           out on the table.

                                 TOBY
                        I hope you like sushi.

                                 BIANCA
                        It’s my favorite. How did you know?

                                 TOBY
                        It’s exotic, raw, natural...Like 
                        you. My dad is teaching me how to 
                        make it...I hope it came out okay.

           Bianca seems like she might melt. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Well, I’m speechless.

                                 TOBY
                        Then I’ve done my job. Mind if we 
                        listen to Joni Mitchell over 
                        dinner?

                                 BIANCA
                        That...That would be perfect. 

           Toby pulls out her chair for her. She sits.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you! 

                                 TOBY
                        No prob.

           He sits, and using a remote, turns on the stereo. Joni 
           Mitchell’s ”Coyote” plays.

                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been trying to teach myself 
                        this on guitar for FOREVER. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        Joni Mitchell is such an artist, 
                        it’s hard to even come close, 
                        y’know? 

           Pause. Without even knowing it, we’re into a QUICK FANTASY 
           SEQUENCE.

                                 BIANCA
                        Take me. Take me on this table 
                        right now.

           Toby brushes all of the food off the table, and they begin to 
           make out. He pulls away for a minute, and when he pulls back, 
           we see that he’s somehow morphed into Wesley.

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        What the-

                                 IMAGINARY WESLEY
                        S’up! I’m AWESOME!

           And just like that, we’re BACK TO REALITY.

           CLOSE-UP ON BIANCA’S FACE

           Her eyes are closed. When she opens them, the table is 
           exactly how it was a few seconds ago, and Toby is staring at 
           her.

                                 TOBY
                        You okay?

                                 BIANCA
                           (shakes it off)
                        Yeah...I just really like this 
                        song. 

                                 TOBY
                        Me too.

           Bianca pops a California roll in her mouth. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        When I got home, I was going to 
                        give my brain a stern talking-to. 
                        Here I was on a perfect date, with 
                        my perfect guy...

           We pan over to Toby, who’s talking dreamily about whatever.
                                 TOBY
                        ...Yeah, it’s just, the poetry of 
                        the chord progressions intertwines 
                        with the poetry of Mitchell’s 
                        lyrics...Like lovers, almost...

           Just then, Imaginary Wesley pops up behind him.

                                 IMAGINARY WESLEY
                        Like a midget jerkin’ off!

           Bianca LAUGHS OUT LOUD. Then she blinks, and it’s just Toby, 
           looking at her oddly.

                                 TOBY
                        I mean, I guess it’s kind of funny.

                                 BIANCA
                        No! I wasn’t laughing at you...It’s 
                        just so surprising to hear a guy 
                        talk that intelligently about 
                        music. It makes me happy.  

                                 TOBY
                        Well, I like that. It reminds me of 
                        a poem I wrote a few weeks ago. 
                        Maybe I can read it to you later. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, yeah. You TOTALLY can. 

                                 TOBY
                        It’s a deal. I like poetry. I’m not 
                        very good at it, but I almost feel 
                        like if you get TOO good at it, 
                        it’s not real. Not from the heart. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, yeah, absolutely.

           Imaginary Wesley pops up right next to her, and whispers in 
           her ear.

                                 IMAGINARY WESLEY
                        Like this one: “Hickory Dickory 
                        Dock/The mouse ran up my c-” 

           Bianca stands up.

                                 BIANCA
                        Would you excuse me a second?
           INT. TOBY’S HOUSE (BATHROOM) - MOMENTS LATER

           Bianca is splashing water on her face.

                                 BIANCA 
                           (to reflection)
                        What the hell, brain?

           Her reflection shrugs. 

                                 BIANCA’S REFLECTION
                        Dude. You’re into Wesley. Deal with 
                        it. 

           Imaginary Wesley also pops up in the mirror.

                                 IMAGINARY WESLEY
                        NUMBER ONE IN YOUR BRAIN!

           Bianca sits on the edge of the tub, and massages her temples.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        The perfect date. The perfect guy. 
                        And only my Wesley-infected brain 
                        standing in the way of true 
                        happiness. 

           She takes a deep breath. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Okay. I got this. 

           INT. TOBY’S HOUSE (DINING ROOM) - MOMENTS LATER

           Bianca enters, re-energized. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I think I’d like to hear that poem 
                        now. 

                                 TOBY
                        I wasn’t that hungry anyway.

                                 BIANCA
                        Me neither.

           EXT. TOBY’S HOUSE (BACK PORCH) - MOMENTS LATER

           Toby and Bianca sit on his back porch. He’s tuning his 
           guitar. She shivers.
                                 TOBY
                        You cold?

                                 BIANCA
                        A little chilly.

           Toby takes off his jacket, and puts it over her shoulders.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Like, seriously. Wesley WHO?

                                 TOBY
                        Better?

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, yeah.

                                 TOBY
                        Check this out.

           Toby sort of speak-sings over his playing. It’s freaking 
           awful, but to Bianca, it’s THE GREATEST.

                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        Woman...
                        Strong and powerful...
                        You will rise up...
                        Against your white male 
                        oppressors...
                        Like a mighty warrioress...
                        Like Harriet Tubman 
                        And Diane Sawyer...
                        And also Hillary Clinton...
                        Hillaaaaary Cliiinton!
                        Hillaaaaary Cliiinton!
                        Hillaaaaary Cliiinton!

           He finishes with a flourish.

                                 TOBY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not quite done yet.

                                 BIANCA
                        It’s great. Really. 

                                 TOBY
                        Thank you. 

           They stare up at the sky.

                        But enough about me. How are you?
                                 BIANCA
                        It’s been a weird month. But it’s 
                        getting better.

                                 TOBY
                        Weird how?

                                 BIANCA
                        Well, I kind of found out that my 
                        two best friends...Weren’t. 

                                 TOBY
                        Jess and Casey? 

                                 BIANCA
                           (off-guard)
                        Wha- Yeah. Jess and Casey. Anyway, 
                        I haven’t talked to them in 
                        forever, and I’m not sure if I made 
                        the right call. 

                                 TOBY
                        You should talk to them. They seem 
                        like really caring, understanding 
                        people. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Do you...Know them? 

                                 TOBY
                        Jess is in my drama class, and I 
                        have Trig with Casey. They’re both 
                        very cool.

                                 BIANCA
                        Well...I don’t know. But anyway-

                                 TOBY
                        Jess is a terrific actress. 

                                 BIANCA
                        She’s very good. Why don’t you play 
                        another-

                                 TOBY
                        And Casey. So...Firey. 

                                 BIANCA
                        She’s the whole book of matches and 
                        a couple extra. But I’m not really 
                        talking to them.

                                 TOBY
                        Sure. Is it intimidating?
                                 BIANCA
                        What?

                                 TOBY
                        Being friends with such...And it’s 
                        so rare that I point this out, 
                        because I don’t subscribe to the 
                        American ideal of feminine 
                        beauty...Such, POWERFUL women. 

           We pull in on Bianca. She’s been down this road before.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Oh, NO. NO, NO, NO, A MILLION GOD 
                        FORSAKEN TIMES NO. 

                                 TOBY
                        A friend of mine was wondering...Do 
                        they have homecoming dates?

           Bianca is horrified.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        This is what I wanted to do. 
                        Scream, cry, set him on fire, 
                        bulldoze his house, throw up, and 
                        explode. 

                                 TOBY
                        I mean, it’s DEFINITELY not for me, 
                        because, you know, I’m not hung up 
                        on physical beauty...But...

                                 BIANCA
                        Are you DUFFING me?

                                 TOBY
                        Excuse me?

                                 BIANCA
                        You are. Jesus. I feel diseased. 

                                 TOBY
                        I don’t know...

                                 BIANCA
                        You’re using me to get a date with 
                        Jess or Casey!

                                 TOBY
                           (caught)
                        No...No...For a friend...
                                 BIANCA
                        You PHONY! You POSEUR! You...Excuse 
                        me. 

           She gets up to leave. Walking by the trash cans, she sees 
           bags and takeout containers from “Mr. Sushi.” 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        TAKEOUT? 

                                 TOBY
                           (sheepish)
                        The poem was mine.

                                 BIANCA
                        Obviously! It was AWFUL! Good 
                        night, and DROP DEAD.

           INT. BIANCA’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Bianca is driving, crying, and dialing. 

                                 WESLEY’S VOICE MAIL (V.O.)
                        This. Is. WESLEY!

                                 BIANCA
                        Wesley. I get it. I get why you 
                        were bummed out in science. 
                        Toby...He’s a fake. He was using me 
                        as the DUFF the whole time. I...I 
                        need to talk to you. I need to talk 
                        to somebody. I...Call me.

           EXT. WESLEY’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Bianca walks from her house to Wesley’s Pause. We hear a 
           GLASS BREAK. Bianca winces. 

           She knocks on his door. The door opens a crack. 

                                 WESLEY’S DAD
                        You looking for Wesley?

                                 BIANCA
                        I-

                                 WESLEY’S DAD
                        He’s not here.

           Wesley’s dad closes the door. 
           EXT. LOCAL PUBLIC PARK (WOODED AREA) - A LITTLE LATER

           It’s a bright, moonlit night. Bianca makes her way to Think 
           Rock.  

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I needed to clear my head. Get my 
                        thoughts in order. I mean, maybe it 
                        was crazy, the idea that Wesley and 
                        I could be a thing, but-

           She sees TWO SHADOWY FIGURES on Think Rock. They’re in a hot 
           and heavy embrace. 

           She takes a step closer. It’s Wesley and Roberta. Bianca’s 
           lip begins to quiver. 

           INT. BIANCA’S LIVING ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Bianca is sitting on the couch, staring at QVC. She 
           looks...Blank. 

           There’s a knock at the door. 

           INT. BIANCA’S HOUSE (FRONT HALLWAY) - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s Wesley.

                                 WESLEY
                        I got your call, and my dad said 
                        you...

                                 BIANCA
                        Forget it. Go home. 

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY
                        Sorry about Tob-

                                 BIANCA
                        I saw you and Roberta.

           Pause.

                                 WESLEY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 BIANCA
                           (laughs, darkly)
                        I was going to MY Think Rock to 
                        think.
                                 WESLEY
                        You said I could use it.

                                 BIANCA
                        Not as a Motel 6.

           Now it’s Wesley’s turn to laugh, a little. 

                                 WESLEY
                        ...I think there’s still a way we 
                        can be-

                                 BIANCA
                        No. You belong with Roberta. I 
                        belong with nobody. I’m releasing 
                        you from your duties. There’s no 
                        reason for you to go around 
                        pretending you’re on steroids and 
                        threatening freshmen so we can 
                        be...Friends.  

                                 WESLEY
                        But I like threatening freshman. 
                        It’s kind of what football players 
                        do.

                                 BIANCA
                        It is. Football players also date 
                        hot chicks like Roberta. And they 
                        don’t hang out with DUFFs. It’s the 
                        natural order of things. 

                                 WESLEY
                        But...I...Care about you. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I have it on authority that you’ll 
                        forget about me in two weeks.

                                 WESLEY
                        But-

           Bianca closes the door on Wesley, sighs, and walks up the 
           stairs. 

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Without taking off any of her clothes or her shoes, she 
           climbs into bed.

           BLACKOUT.

           TITLE CARD: “STAGE 4: DEPRESSION”
           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Bianca is sitting in bed, wearing an old bathrobe. She looks 
           like she has not showered in a while.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        So this was it. 17, alone, 
                        friendless, single, destined for a 
                        life of TV dinners and bumper 
                        stickers that said, “My Other Car 
                        Is A Cat.” 

           There’s a knock on the door. 

                                 BIANCA
                        GO AWAY!

                                 CASEY
                        We’ve done that already.

                                 JESS
                        We’d like to come back now!

                                 BIANCA
                           (weak)
                        Okay.

           The door opens, and it’s Jess and Casey with snacks, 
           magazines, makeup, etc.

                                 CASEY
                        Okay. First thing, open a window. 
                        It smells like Sylvia Plath’s 
                        kitchen in here.

                                 JESS
                        On it!

           Casey begins to attempt to tidy up a little.

                                 CASEY
                        I do believe there’s a floor under 
                        all this.  

                                 BIANCA
                        Why...Why are you guys here?

                                 CASEY
                        For the record, I don’t want to be 
                        here, as I’m, like, RIP-SHIT mad at 
                        you. 
                                 JESS
                        Your mom called us. And I bribed 
                        Casey with a lifetime “WIRED” 
                        subscription.

                                 CASEY
                           (scoffing)
                        Lifetime. Like there’s gonna be 
                        such a thing as magazines in 5 
                        years. 

           Jess dumps a variety of magazines on her bed.

           Bianca smiles, and then immediately starts crying. Jess gives 
           her a big hug.

                                 CASEY (CONT’D)
                        Still pissed.

           Jess shoots her a look. Casey harumphs, and joins in the hug. 

                                 JESS
                        Bianca? Sweetie? What the hell is a 
                        DUFF?

           Bianca sighs. 

                                 BIANCA
                        So we were at that house party. And 
                        Wesley came up to me...And...

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        And...Let’s skip ahead. You guys 
                        know this stuff already.

                                                    CROSS FADE TO:

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER

           The room is now cleaned and livable, thanks to Jess and 
           Casey. 

                                 BIANCA
                        ...And then I got into bed.

                                 CASEY
                        So...You stopped being friends with 
                        us because Wesley said you were 
                        ugly? But then you fell in love 
                        with him? You are SO going to lose 
                        your gold commenter star on 
                        “Jezebel.” 
                                 JESS
                        Stockholm Syndrome. Happens all the 
                        time. 

                                 BIANCA
                        He’s a shithead. But he’s a sweet, 
                        thoughtful, funny...

                                 JESS
                        Shithead?

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah. 

                                 CASEY
                        Okay, that aside, why didn’t you 
                        ever come to us? 

                                 BIANCA
                        Because, I’m the ugly one out of 
                        all of us. That’s just fact. 

           Pause.

                                 JESS
                           (quietly)
                        Well...No. If anything, it’s me. 

           Bianca lets out a hearty laugh.

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, NO WAY am I going to believe 
                        that, you supermodel-shaped vision 
                        of wonderment. 

                                 CASEY
                        She’s right.  It’s me. 

                                 BIANCA
                        OUT. BOTH OF YOU. I don’t buy this 
                        at all.

                                 CASEY
                        Do you know why I never wear above 
                        the knee skirts?

           Casey pulls up her skirt just high enough to reveal WEIRDLY 
           KNOBBY KNEES. 

                                 CASEY (CONT’D)
                        Knobby old lady knees. I haz them. 
                                 JESS
                        I can top that. You know why I 
                        never wear anything backless? Three 
                        words: Mad. Ass. Backne. I’ll show 
                        you-

           She begins to pull up her shirt.

                                 CASEY/BIANCA
                        NO!/OH, GOD STOP!/Etc. 

                                 CASEY
                        I have a lumpy butt. 

                                 JESS
                        One of my boobs is smaller than the 
                        other.

                                 CASEY
                        I go through a bottle of foundation 
                        a week. 

                                 JESS
                        I bathe in Proactiv. 

           Bianca flops back on her bed. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Ladies, ladies. Stop fighting. 
                        You’re both hideous, apparently. 

                                 CASEY
                        We clean up well. But we didn’t 
                        always. 

                                 JESS
                        Do you still have that picture on 
                        your phone?

                                 CASEY
                        You know it.

           Casey busts out her phone, and pulls up a picture of the 
           THREE OF THEM AS 10 YEAR OLDS. Jess is giraffe-gawky. Casey 
           is deathly pale with coke-bottle glasses. Bianca, on the 
           other hand, looks relatively normal. 

                                 JESS
                        Look at those two dweebs.

                                 BIANCA
                        Why do you have this?
                                 CASEY
                        Because I never want to forget who 
                        my friends are. Who stood up for me-

                                 JESS
                        And me-

                                 CASEY
                        When we were kids.  You did, 
                        Bianca. 

                                 JESS
                        You were always there for us. Never 
                        as our DUFF. As our friend. Our 
                        best friend.  

           Bianca is deeply moved.

                                 BIANCA
                        I...Love you guys. Thank you. 

           Hugs all around. 

                                 JESS
                        You know how we should celebrate 
                        this emotional reunion?

                                 BIANCA
                        Shakey’s?

                                 JESS
                        That. And...
                           (perks up)
                        HOMECOMING! LET’S ALL GO! 

           Jess is jumping up and down on the bed with excitement. 
           Bianca looks like she needs 20 Advil.

                                 BIANCA
                        PLEASE don’t remind me. 

                                 JESS
                        TONIGHT! WE’LL BE EACH OTHER’S 
                        DATES AND IT’LL BE FUN FUN FUN!

                                 BIANCA
                        Look. I hate to take the T-Bird 
                        away. But NO.

           Jess sits down.

                                 JESS
                        I’ll make my poutiest face. 
                                 BIANCA
                        I love you guys. And I’m sorry. But 
                        I can’t see Wesley. I can’t see 
                        Toby. 

                                 CASEY
                        Well, then, we’ll stay here with 
                        you.

                                 BIANCA
                        No. Go. Have fun. Let me wallow for 
                        the rest of the weekend. And then 
                        Monday, we’ll be back to normal. 

                                 JESS
                        Promise? 

                                 BIANCA
                        Promise. 

                                 JESS
                        Hug?

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m so hugged out. 

                                 CASEY
                        Me too. 

           EXT. BIANCA’S HOUSE (FRONT PORCH) - CONTINUOUS

           Jess and Casey pull away, as Bianca waves to them. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Well, I had my friends back. So I 
                        wasn’t 100% alone. But I had a 
                        nagging question on my mind. 

                                 BIANCA
                        What now?

           INT. BIANCA’S HOUSE - FRONT HALLWAY

           Bianca wanders back in.

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        I mean, if only there was some kind 
                        of road map to get you through 
                        crazy, painful experiences-

           She walks by one of Dottie’s many visual aids with the 5 
           stages on it. Pause, she stops, and stares at it.
                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        Oh. Right. That. 

           Bianca runs her finger down the list.

                                 BIANCA
                        Denial, did it. Anger, did it. 
                        Bargaining...Close enough... 
                        Depression...Right. 

           She lands on ACCEPTANCE. 

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        I guess...

           TITLE CARD: ACCEPTANCE 

           INT. BIANCA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bianca is draped over the couch, watching a “TEEN MOM 2” 
           marathon on TV. 

           Dottie enters, after a long day of making life better for 
           people.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Hey, sweetie! 

                                 BIANCA
                        Hey, mom.

                                 DOTTIE
                        You seem like you’re doing better. 
                        You’ve moved from the bed to the 
                        couch. 

                                 BIANCA
                        The girls came by today. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Everything better?

                                 BIANCA
                        Yeah. Thanks for calling them.

                                 DOTTIE
                        I can’t help but see you didn’t go 
                        to Homecoming with them.

                                 BIANCA
                        Couldn’t do it. But Rome wasn’t 
                        built in a day. 
           Dottie sits next to her. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        I’m sorry I haven’t been around...

                                 BIANCA
                        No, as it turns out, you really 
                        helped me.  

                                 DOTTIE
                        I did? Wow, I’m GOOD. 

                                 BIANCA
                        I realized that this whole 
                        time...I’ve been following the five 
                        stages. And now I’m at Acceptance.

           Pause.

                                 DOTTIE
                        And what do you accept, exactly?

                                 BIANCA
                        I accept that I’m not the DUFF...

                                 DOTTIE
                        What the hell is a-

                                 BIANCA
                        Long story. Trust me. It’s not a 
                        good thing to be.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Fine.

                                 BIANCA
                        I accept that I have a lot more 
                        strength and self confidence than I 
                        was aware of, and I should use it 
                        more. And I accept I have two 
                        amazing friends. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Wow! You’re accepting the hell out 
                        of Acceptance!

                                 BIANCA
                        And finally, I accept that I’m kind 
                        of a weirdo, and I’m going to be 
                        dateless for the rest of my life. 
                        And that’s...Okay.

           Pause.
                                 DOTTIE
                        Okay. That last one doesn’t work 
                        for me. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Me neither. But that’s Acceptance, 
                        right? The good and the bad. Right?

           Dottie takes a deep breath. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Okay, first of all. You must be the 
                        first teenager in the world to take 
                        anything her mother says seriously.  

                                 BIANCA
                        Believe me, I didn’t want to. 

                                 DOTTIE
                        Second of all, what I say is not 
                        gospel. I say it so scared, worried 
                        people will give me money, so I can 
                        provide us with the life’s little 
                        luxuries, like food.

                                 BIANCA
                        But...It happened! Every stage! 
                        Just like you’ve always said!

           Dottie pulls out a sharpie, and walks over to yet another 
           copy of the stages.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Fine. Then I’m creating another 
                        stage. Just for you. 

           She writes underneath ACCEPTANCE, “STAGE 6: ACCEPTANCE PLUS.” 

                                 DOTTIE (CONT’D)
                        Acceptance Plus. That’s when you 
                        know who you are, you accept it, 
                        and then you...Turn it up to 11. 
                        You’re a weirdo? Then be the best 
                        weirdo ever.

                                 BIANCA
                        ...How do I start?

                                 DOTTIE
                        You clean yourself up. You go to 
                        that dance. And you rock that 
                        jock’s world. 

           Bianca takes a deep breath, and whips out her phone.
                                 BIANCA
                        Jess? Get over here. Bring your 
                        sewing machine. 

           TITLE CARD: “STAGE 6: ACCEPTANCE PLUS”

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           The three girls work together, ripping apart pieces of 
           Bianca’s wardrobe, as Jess reassembles them on her sewing 
           machine. 

           Casey, meanwhile, is designing patterns on the fly on her 
           laptop. Bianca gives them the once-over, as Dottie helps her 
           try things on. 

           It’s a whirlwind of activity, but everyone is PUMPED.

           INT. BIANCA’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           Everyone stands around the mirror in such a way that they can 
           see Bianca’s outfit, but we can’t. By the look on everyone’s 
           faces, the operation was a success.

                                 BIANCA
                        We’re clear on the plan?

                                 JESS
                        Oh, HELL yeah. 

                                 CASEY
                        Double hell yeah. 

           Bianca smiles.

                                 BIANCA
                        Let’s DO this.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - AN HOUR LATER

           The dance is in full swing. Kids are dancing up a storm. 

           Roberta and Wesley are dancing, but she stops, suddenly. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        WesLEY. I need a drink. I need a 
                        Diet Coke.

                                 WESLEY
                        I think they only have punch.
                                 ROBERTA
                        There’s a machine in the hall, 
                        sweetie! 

           Wesley sighs, and then puts on his best smile. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Okay, babe. Be right back.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Please. After tonight, you can call 
                        me “Queen.” 

           Wesley shlumps off. We pull back to see Jess and Casey giving 
           her the evil eye.

                                 ROBERTA (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you looking at?

                                 JESS
                        Nothing.

                                 CASEY
                        Absolutely nothing. 

           Roberta walks away nervously. Jess and Casey both check their 
           phones. 

                                 JESS
                        The eagle.

                                 CASEY
                        She has landed. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley is going through his pocket, trying to find change.

                                 WESLEY
                        What the hell kind of machine 
                        doesn’t take dollars? 

           Just then, 4 quarters drop at his feet. He bends over to pick 
           them up. As he does, he sees who dropped them.

           It’s Bianca. The camera follows her from the feet up. 

           She looks amazing. It’s not a “movie” makeover. She literally 
           looks like Bianca, only the best version. 
           She and her friends have stitched, taped, and stapled bits of 
           her favorite wardrobe pieces (The overalls, her ringer-t, 
           etc), and sort of done a fashion “mash-up” with the dress 
           that Wesley gave her.

           And down the side of one sleeve, in Bedazzled letters, it 
           reads, “D.U.F.F.” 

                                 WESLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

                                 BIANCA
                        I’m into you. I’m pretty sure 
                        you’re into me. 

                                 WESLEY
                           (without thinking)
                        Yeah. But...Why? 

                                 BIANCA
                        Because you’re better looking on 
                        the inside than you are on the 
                        outside.

                                 WESLEY
                        But...I’m so handsome!

                                 BIANCA
                        My point exactly. You’re a 
                        genuinely good person. You’re 
                        honest, you’re funny, and you’re 
                        also a total weirdo. And so am I. 
                        So I propose that we be weird 
                        together. 

           Wesley considers, as he looks at her outfit. He points to her 
           sleeve. 

                                 WESLEY
                        You’re definitely not that.

                                 BIANCA
                        The “D.U.F.F.?” Sure I am. It’s a 
                        made up phrase. It can stand for 
                        whatever I want it to stand for. 

                                 WESLEY
                        Like what? 

                                 BIANCA
                        “Don’t Underestimate Flighty 
                        Females.” Or maybe, “Do U Fancy a 
                        Fling?” 
                                 WESLEY
                           (torn.)
                        I do...What about Roberta?

                                 BIANCA
                        Are you into her?

                                 WESLEY
                        Not at all. I just thought...That’s 
                        what I deserved.

                                 BIANCA
                        You don’t. You know why? Because 
                        you’re not just a dumb jock, who 
                        deserves a dumb girl who treats you 
                        like shit. 

                                 WESLEY
                        She’s awful. She’s the worst. So...

                                 BIANCA
                        So. I think we should dance. And 
                        kiss. And not in that order.

                                 WESLEY
                        Practice kiss?

                                 BIANCA
                        Oh, no. Practice is over. This is 
                        the real deal. C’mere.

           They kiss. It’s a long one.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Roberta is checking her watch. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Where is he?

           Jess and Casey flank her on either side. 

                                 JESS
                        Right there, sweetie.

           Wesley and Bianca enter the gym, hit the floor, and start 
           dancing like there’s no tomorrow. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        What? Her? EWWWW!

           She marches over to them. Jess and Casey smile. 
                                 CASEY
                        Give her a minute. 

                                 JESS
                        Naturally.

           Roberta taps Wesley on the shoulder.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What the HELL IS THIS?

                                 WESLEY
                        They were out of Diet Coke?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Wesley, take your hands off this 
                        disgusting piece of trash THIS 
                        INSTANT. 

           Bianca gets in Roberta’s face. 

                                 BIANCA
                        Or what?

           Roberta pulls out her phone. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        You know, “Or What.” I unleash on 
                        this school, this TOWN, so many 
                        photos of your chunky ass that 
                        you’ll want to LIVE in a paper bag.

                                 BIANCA
                        Go ahead.

           Roberta goes to hit SEND, but doesn’t like what she sees. 

           CLOSE UP on Roberta’s phone. It just reads: “ALL FILES 
           DELETED.” Then the :( emoticon, followed by, “YOU BEEN 
           HACKED, BITCH! ;)”

                                 ROBERTA
                        What the...

           The camera whip-pans over to Jess and Casey. Casey is typing 
           away furiously at her 11 inch MacBook Air. She slams it shut.

                                 CASEY
                        Thank YOU Rupert Murdoch, for 
                        making cell-phone hacking the new 
                        black. 

                                 JESS
                        Let’s finish this. 
           Jess and Casey TEAR A VELCRO STRIP off their sleeves, also 
           revealing the letters “D.U.F.F.” Just like Bianca. They flank 
           Bianca on either side.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Whatever. I have the photos on my 
                        home comp-

           Casey just shakes her head, “No.” 

                                 CASEY
                        You don’t. And unless you want US 
                        to show the world YOU singing 
                        Rebecca Black’s “Friday” into your, 
                        ahem, marital aid, you’ll shut your 
                        trap.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You’re blackmailing me?

                                 JESS
                        Rebecca Blackmailing you.

           Roberta takes a step back. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Okay. Fine. You know what? It’s 
                        immaterial. Because any minute now, 
                        they’re going to call MY NAME, and 
                        WESLEY’S name, and we are going to 
                        be the goddamn king and queen of 
                        this school! 

           Now it’s Wesley’s turn to shake his head, “No.” 

                                 WESLEY
                        I forgot to tell you something.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What...?

           The lights DIM. A spotlight hits the stage. THE PRINCIPAL 
           takes the mic.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Okay, kids, I hope everyone’s 
                        having a good time. Not TOO good of 
                        a time, I hope. Not like last year. 
                        With the “special ingredient” 
                        brownies on the refreshments table. 

           Everyone laughs. The principal doesn’t.
                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        IT’S NOT FUNNY, KIDS. Mrs. Leopold 
                        spent 5 hours crawling around the 
                        ventilation ducts. 

           Everyone laughs louder. The principal smiles.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Okay, that was kind of funny. 
                        Anyhoo! Let’s get to it! The Queen 
                        of Homecoming is...

           Roberta takes a deep breath. In spite of being surrounded by 
           people who loathe her, this is still her moment.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Ms. ROBERTA SMALLWOOD! 

           Roberta squeaks, jumps up and down, squeaks again, and turns 
           to Wesley. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Let’s go, Wesley. They’re just 
                        about to say your name!

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        And our King, in a landslide 
                        victory, thanks to the tireless 
                        campaigning of Jess and Casey...

           The girls smile.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Oh, shit.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        BARRY HOROWITZ! 

           The MALE DUFF from the party at the beginning of the movie, 
           confidently takes Roberta’s hand, and walks/drags her to the 
           stage.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Stop! Don’t touch me! 

                                 BARRY
                        Please, baby, let’s just enjoy the 
                        moment. 

           The two of them stand up on stage. Barry is beaming, and 
           Roberta looks utterly, totally humiliated. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        SALLY ANN! DO SOMETHING! 
           But over at the bleachers, Sally Ann is locking eyes with 
           Toby. 

                                 SALLY ANN
                        Wanna blow this shit-show and go 
                        make out in the bathroom?

           Toby shrugs.

                                 TOBY
                        Sure?

           They exit. Roberta growls. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM (DANCE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS

           Wesley and Bianca dance, blissfully happy. 

                                 BIANCA (V.O.)
                        And THAT was the most pivotal 
                        moment in my life. Not because I 
                        got the guy. Not because I had my 
                        two best friends back. But because 
                        that night, I came into my own. I 
                        left my old DUFF self behind, and 
                        became a whole new DUFF...And so 
                        did a lot of other people.

           We hear the hubub of VARIOUS KIDS looking at Bianca, Jess and 
           Casey. Chatter spreads around Homecoming like wildfire.

                                 KID #1
                        Why do they all have DUFF on their 
                        sleeves?

                                 KID #2
                        Wait, they can’t all be “DUFFS!”

                                 KID #3
                        Maybe DUFF stands for something 
                        else!

                                 KID #4
                        “Designated Ultimate Foxy Friend?”

                                 KID #5
                        “Divine Unbridled Far-out Famous?”

                                 KID #6
                        Damn, I wanna be The Duff.

                                 KID #7
                        Me too!
           But Bianca and Wesley take no notice of this. They just lock 
           eyes, and kiss like they were born to do it. 

                                                          FADE TO:

           INT. OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

           ...And we’re back in the office, at Bianca’s interview. 

                                 BIANCA
                        ...And that’s that. You know the 
                        rest of the story.

           We pull back to reveal that Bianca is, in fact, sitting 
           behind HER desk. 

           A WINDOW POPS UP over her head. It reads “DUFF.” She stares 
           at it for a second, and arches an eyebrow. 

           The WINDOW shimmers, and then reads, “BIANCA PIPER, CEO: DUFF 
           FASHION INDUSTRIES”

                                 BIANCA (CONT’D)
                        That’s better. 

           This is, in fact, HER office. It’s a cramped loft space with 
           desks, computers, and a LOT of sewing forms and equipment. 

           The person she’s talking to? A REPORTER. 

           We see that Bianca is wearing a very funky, professional 
           outfit, with DUFF on the sleeve.  The reporter also wears a 
           shirt with a DUFF sleeve. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Who doesn’t know the rest of the 
                        story? “DUFF-WEAR” goes viral, 
                        Chloë Sevigny wears a DUFF shirt to 
                        the Independent Spirit Awards, the 
                        three of you go into business...

           We see Casey working away on a new website design, while Jess 
           is fitting an outfit on a form.

                                 CASEY
                        Bianca, can you proof the copy for 
                        the new DUFF-Wear website?

                                 JESS
                        I need her to okay this design 
                        first, bossy-boots. 
                                 BIANCA
                        Settle, ladies. All in due time. 
                        It never ends. 

                                 REPORTER
                        And you’re not even out of high 
                        school. But what happened to...

           We hear a HONK! HONK! Bianca turns to the window. We see 
           Wesley in a baby-blue convertible with DUFF-WEAR on the side. 

                                 BIANCA
                        He passed science. He’s going to 
                        Notre Dame in the fall. Full ride 
                        scholarship. 

           She waves to Wesley. He gives the “Thumbs up.” 

                                 REPORTER
                        Any last thoughts?

           Bianca thinks. 

                                 BIANCA
                        It’s not about the success. It’s 
                        not about getting the guy. It’s 
                        about believing in yourself. And 
                        having the people you care about 
                        believe in you. 
                           (she leans in)
                        That said, all that other stuff is 
                        pretty frakking cool, too.

           And with that, she marches out of the office. 

                                 THE END

           OVER THE CLOSING CREDITS:

           We see all of the celebrity DUFFS from the opening credit 
           sequence...Each one of them starts with a DUFF bubble over 
           their heads, which is then crossed out and replaced with the 
           following text...

           series. Landed an NBA player.
