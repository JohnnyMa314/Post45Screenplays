                              A MANY SPLINTERED THING

                                        by
                            Chris Shafer & Paul Vicknair
          The following is a true interpretation of imaginary events that 
          took place in my head, inspired by real events that happened to me 
          and people I know. 

          All of whom are liars. 

          Names have been changed or omitted to protect me from myself.

          Let's get started, shall we?
           FADE ON IN, MOTHERFUCKERS

           A MODERATELY GOOD LOOKING MAN stands in a black void. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hey, there. This is me.

           As I stand still, my clothes magically change styles: I’m a 
           monk, then an astronaut, then a Korean villager, etc.

                                 NARRATOR  (V.O.)
                        Yeah, I know you’re judging me.  
                        And no, I’m not in some 
                        experimental Broadway musical. I 
                        just don’t know where to begin. 

           Lights swirl around me, backgrounds appear, WHOOSHING by. 
           It’s really fucking dizzying. 

                                 NARRATOR  (V.O.)
                        Fuck it. I’m gonna close my eyes 
                        and put my finger down somewhere.

           I close my eyes. Deep BREATH. Everything SCREECHES to a halt--

           INT. MY CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           I’m ten years old, alone, and sitting in a lounge chair. The 
           lights are dim, lit candles decorate the room.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ready?

           Suddenly “If I Could Turn Back Time” by Cher comes on and an 
           EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL steps out of the bathroom. She starts 
           a striptease.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That was my baby-sitter. This is 
                        actually too far back, but man could 
                        she dance... let me try this again.

           I close my ten year-old eyes, and as I open them--

           EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           I am thirty years old and about to get my face punched--

                                 ME
                        Oh, shit.

           TWHACK! 

           My ATTACKER doesn’t stop. I try to fend him off, but he SLUGS 
           me hard in the gut.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ok... one more time.
           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - POOL - NIGHT (LAST WEEK)

           I scan the PARTYGOERS, my eyes rest on a CUTE GIRL drinking 
           alone. She smiles at me.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Here we go.

           I approach, Patron still wet on my lips.

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        You know, I always thought you were 
                        cute.

                                 ME
                        Still have that boyfriend?

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        Yes.

           A blush (from her, not me).

                                 ME
                        Are you in love?

           She hesitates.

           BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CUTE GIRL sucks on my tongue. My fingers slide inside her.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This is really my fault. The whole 
                        “Are you in love?” thing is a trick 
                        question. No one can “know” if they 
                        are in love. They can think they 
                        know, but that still leaves room for 
                        doubt. See, love isn’t a knowing 
                        thing... it’s a feeling thing.

           CUTE GIRL MOANS, ferociously grabbing me by the neck. Fingers 
           tense. Nails digging in. Jackpot.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s semantics, but it works. 
                        Although, to be honest, what 
                        happened next still baffles me.

           CUTE GIRL suddenly switches gears. She pulls back and pushes 
           my fingers out of her.

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        Wait. I don’t want to feel guilty.

           FREEZE ON: Me... baffled.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        As if foreplay isn’t cheating? I 
                        always thought it was just guys who 
                        didn’t feel guilty until they came.

           MONTAGE - GUYS FEELING GUILTY 

           A MAN’s face goes from ecstasy to “uh-ho” in a split second. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We feel guilty about everything we 
                        said...

           ANOTHER MAN’s face.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Promised...

           ANOTHER MAN’s face.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And spent... to get to the moment 
                        right before this moment...

           A GUY rolls off a GIRL and looks straight at god.

                                 GUY
                        Fuck. You gotta go.

           END MONTAGE - BACK TO ME IN THE BATHROOM

           CUTE GIRL pulls her dress back down, straightens her panties.

                                 CUTE GIRL
                        You can’t say anything, ok?

                                 ME
                        Sure.

           CUTE GIRL leaves. I start to wash my fingers, but look at the 
           “glistening two” and decide not to.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - POOL - MOMENTS LATER

           I tour the party, navigating the HOLLYWOOD SOCIALITES. CUTE 
           GIRL is already back drinking with her FRIENDS.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I should feel bad, but I don’t, 
                        because the girl I think I love is 
                        probably fucking some other guy 
                        right now. 

           I should cut to a montage of that, but seriously, we’re 
           talking about the woman I think I love... I mean...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O)
                        They’re probably in a fancy hotel. 
                        Probably this one. Probably 
                        drinking red wine off of each 
                        other’s bodies. Staining the sheets 
                        with pleasure. Coining new words 
                        with orgasm after orgasm.

           I mount up to the bar. The BARTENDER eyes me.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        God knows that’s what I’d be doing.

                                 ME
                        Patron. Make it a double.
           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Me, taking the morning piss.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Here is where I should show you the 
                        main character’s daily routine. 

           I pause and examine the dark yellow of my urine.

                                 ME
                        I need to drink more water.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But I’ll just cut to the chase.

           INT. TALENT AGENCY - DAY (A FEW MONTHS AGO)

           BRYAN, a young maverick who traded his flight suit in for a 
           $3K D&G suit, slams a script down on his desk in front of me. 
           I guzzle a bottle of Fiji water.

                                 BRYAN
                        I’ll cut to the chase.

           I know what’s coming.

                                 ME
                        No.

                                 BRYAN
                        It’s a rom-com.

                                 ME
                        Fuck romance. Fuck comedy. 

                                 BRYAN
                        Boo hoo. The producer needs a favor 
                        polish because the studio hates the 
                        third act. 

                                 ME
                        I hate the third act.

                                 BRYAN
                        You haven’t read it.

                                 ME
                        I don’t see your point.

                                 BRYAN
                        You work your magic on this one and 
                        he’ll put you on his next thing. 
                        Some Malaysian action flick called 
                        RAINBOW 2: THE REVENGE.

           Action? That’s what I’m talking about. Blowing shit up.

                                 ME
                        Really?

                                 BRYAN
                        Yeah, man. Six weeks in Malaysia. 
                        Fucking Malaysian women. You ever 
                        fucked a Malaysian before?
           Wait... have I?

                                 ME
                        No.

           BRYAN grabs a pencil off his desk.

                                 BRYAN
                        This pencil’s a Hippo Cock to them.

           INT. BOOKSTORE - CAFE - DAY - LATER

           SCOTT, your basic writer type, purchases a suspicious number 
           of Teen Magazines. The YOUNG FEMALE CLERK looks him over, her 
           eyes say “ewwww gross.” His eyes can translate.

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t judge me. I’m a writer. It’s 
                        research.

                                 YOUNG FEMALE CLERK
                        Ok. Sure. Whatever.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not a pervert.

           He grabs his stuff and moves across the cafe to sit with ME.

                                 ME
                        Goddammit.

           I close the script my agent gave me.

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s it about?

                                 ME
                        It’s about a guy with multiple 
                        personalities... Who meets a girl 
                        with multiple personalities. And 
                        one of his personalities falls in 
                        love with one of her personalities. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hmmm. Sounds good.

                                 ME
                        It is. I mean it needs work. It’s 
                        got all the cliches. He has a gay 
                        friend personality, she has a bitch 
                        friend one. There’s the feisty 
                        Hispanic, and the black female 
                        detective personality. There’s even 
                        an Act Three “running through the 
                        airport” scene.

                                 SCOTT
                        So what’s the problem?

           SCOTT notices a WOMAN eyeing all his Teen Beats. He yells.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a pervert! It’s research!

           He’s back to me.
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Continue.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This is my friend Scott. We’ve been 
                        friends since the day we met.

           EXT. CITY BENCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           I’m sitting on a bench next to SCOTT. SCOTT looks around 
           suspiciously, then gets up and hurries away.

           SUPER: The day we met.

           I look down and notice that SCOTT left a brown-wrapped 
           parcel. I pick it up and go after him.

                                 ME
                        Hey! Buddy!

           SCOTT looks back at me, panics, then takes off running. I 
           pick up my pace.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Your package!

           SCOTT sprints. I’m not sure why, but now I’m in chase. He 
           runs me around town. Until I tackle him in--

           AN ALLEY

           Both of us are out of breath.

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t hurt me. I’m a writer.

                                 ME
                        A writer? I thought you were a 
                        terrorist. Why were you running?

                                 SCOTT
                        You were chasing me.

                                 ME
                        You left your package. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I did that on purpose. Fuck. My 
                        heart’s gonna come out of my chest. 

                                 ME
                        People don’t leave packages on 
                        purpose... You can’t do that shit 
                        post 9/11.

                        It’s my favorite book. So I leave 
                        copies of it in random places for 
                        other people. It’s my art.

                                 ME
                        That’s really cool.
           BACK TO THE BOOKSTORE - PRESENT

           SCOTT smiles his goofy smile.

                                 ME
                        I just don’t want to do a romantic 
                        comedy. I want to write something 
                        that shows love how it really is: 
                        neither romantic nor funny. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hmmm. Sounds like a downer.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Here’s my beef.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           A BLISSFUL COUPLE strolls hand in hand. Without warning, the 
           GUY makes an embarrassed face and retracts his hand.

                                 BLISSFUL GUY
                        Sorry. My palms get sweaty.

           The GIRL grabs his hand back.

                                 BLISSFUL GIRL
                        I don’t care. I love you.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A different, SERIOUS COUPLE makes confessions by candlelight.

                                 SERIOUS GIRL
                        ... And then he... threw up. He 
                        tried to say it was food poisoning, 
                        but I’ve never been able to make 
                        love with the lights on since.

                                 SERIOUS GUY
                        You’re so beautiful. We can take it 
                        slow. I’m lucky to have you.

           He blows out the candles.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        “Love is patient, love is kind.” 
                        Sure. It’s in the Bible.

           INT. LITTLE BOY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A MOTHER leans in and kisses her SLEEPING FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON.

                                 MOTHER
                        I love you.

           She turns to leave just as the SON’s eyes pop open. The 
           MOTHER registers the SON is awake.

           FREEZE ON: A tear escaping the corner of her eye.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But what they don’t tell you is 
                        love is potent. Love is painful. 
                        And love is kind, as in “kind” of 
                        like a Nigerian email scam.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - EVENING

           The BLISSFUL COUPLE doesn’t look so blissful anymore.

                                 BLISSFUL GUY
                        I work with her! What do you want 
                        me to do? Quit my job?

                                 BLISSFUL GIRL
                        No, I want you to keep eye-fucking 
                        her all night!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You give away your most personal 
                        information...

                                 BLISSFUL GUY
                        Baby...

           He puts his arm around her. She recoils.

                                 BLISSFUL GIRL
                        And don’t touch me with your sticky 
                        disgusting reptile hands!

           BLISSFUL GUY’s face turns BRIGHT RED.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Only to have your secrets come back 
                        to destroy you.

           INT. BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           A light comes on. The SERIOUS GIRL quickly covers herself.

                                 SERIOUS GUY
                        Stop being melodramatic. Maybe if 
                        you’d hit the gym once in awhile 
                        you wouldn’t need that sob story.

           SERIOUS GUY grabs his things as SERIOUS GIRL erupts in tears.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Love gives you the courage to load 
                        the ammo and hand them the gun. And 
                        love gives them the passion to 
                        shove the barrel in your mouth and 
                        pull the trigger.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           The SON from earlier goes for a brand new box of Captain 
           Crunch. He rips it open, looking for the prize inside. 
                                 SON
                        Mom! Where’s the prize?!

           Instead of a prize, he finds a note. His GRANDDAD enters.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Your mom’s not here.

           The SON opens the note.

                                 NOTE
                        I love you so much. But Mommy has 
                        to go to China for a little while 
                        with Phillip. Granddad will take 
                        good care of you. Love, Mommy.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That’s what love does. It leaves 
                        you with Granddad to go to China 
                        with fucking Phillip. 
                            (beat)
                        And that’s the last I saw of her. 
                        Which is why when someone says--

           MONTAGE OF THE NEXT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE:

           BEDROOM - A GIRL leans over and says--

                                 GIRL
                        I love you.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I look at them and say--

                                 ME
                        I’m not even sure if that’s 
                        possible.

           PARK - ANOTHER GIRL.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        What is it you think you mean, when 
                        you say... that word you just said?

                                 ANOTHER GIRL
                        What word?

                                 ME
                        When you said ‘I blank you.’

           CAFE - A DIFFERENT GIRL has a piece of paper with a hangman 
           game. The hangman is completely filled out, and even has 
           arrows stuck in him. The phrase reads: “I _ O _ _ YO_.” 

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        C?

                                 DIFFERENT GIRL
                            (aggravated)
                        No. No “C.” Try again.

           She draws a flame on one of the hangman’s legs.

                        We can make this next part quick.

           A SERIES OF WOMEN, ALL DIFFERENT AGES - Slapping Me. Punching 
           Me. Pinching Me. Putting a cigarette out on Me. Ending with 
           Me in kindergarten approaching a PRETTY GIRL in the 
           cafeteria. I flip over her bowl of Captain Crunch and she 
           stomps on my toe.

           In the background, a DIRTY GUY IN A HEART SUIT watches on, 
           smoking a cigarette. This is what MY HEART looks like.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY - LATER

           SCOTT and I walk the streets.

                                 ME
                        I don’t want my writing to put 
                        people together anymore. I want to 
                        blow shit up to gangsta rap.

           The SOUND OF A SHOTGUN chambering a shell kicks off a GANGSTA 
           BEAT. SCOTT and I put on sunglasses. The cars behind us start 
           EXPLODING, one by one -- in slow motion, bitch.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But then I met this girl. 
                            (beat)
                        After that speech, I know you’ll 
                        want an explanation... And I know 
                        you won’t believe me. Hell, I don’t 
                        believe me, but a girl like this 
                        requires no embellishment, no 
                        writer’s liberties, no exaggeration. 
                        Here’s how it starts.

           EXT. VICEROY HOTEL - FUNDRAISER - NIGHT

           In a suit and an awkward tie, I kick the men’s bathroom door.

                                 ME
                        Come on, Scott! 

                                 SCOTT
                        Coming!

                                 ME
                        You lied to me. Again. This is a 
                        cock convention. I know you don’t 
                        care, but I was promised attractive 
                        girls. Nines and Tens. I haven’t 
                        seen more than a Four all night!

           A GIRL appears behind me. That’s HER. In the hot sundress. 
           Only I can’t see HER because she snuck up on me. 
                                 HER
                        Fuck you, then.

           I turn around.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was blank at first sight.

           She was an 11. The same size as the shoe I stuck in my mouth.

                                 ME
                        Sorry. Not you. I didn’t mean that.

                                 HER
                        Then what did you mean?

                                 ME
                        I don’t even know. English is my 
                        second language so I’m sort of just 
                        spitting out phrases I found on 
                        this website.

                                 HER
                        Hard to believe a classy gentleman 
                        like you would x out of the Dutch 
                        porn sites long enough to learn 
                        basic English phrases.

           I immediately liked her style.

                                 ME
                        Porn objectifies women.

                                 HER
                        Is that a bad thing?

           She definitely winked. 

                                 ME
                        I don’t have a problem with women 
                        being objectified per se, but I’m 
                        sick of men not being objectified. 

                                 HER
                        And I’m sick of women not being 
                        judged by how much money they make.

                                 ME
                        I mean, if I spend an hour and some 
                        change getting ready for a date, I 
                        wanna be ogled. I’m begging for it.

                                 HER
                        Exactly! And I’m sick of being 
                        wanted for my body, but not my 
                        pocketbook. We’re drinking two 
                        hundred dollar wine and what, my 
                        money’s no good here?

           We share a smile. I think she’s feeling the blank, too. She 
           grabs my hand. 
                                 NARRATOR
                        Don’t worry if you missed it, we’re 
                        going to see this three times in 
                        slow motion:

           ONE: Our hands touch.

           TWO: Our fingers interlock.

           THREE: On the molecular level, our atoms exchange electrons.

           EXT. VICEROY HOTEL - POOL AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           She leads me into the main room of the Fundraiser. I watch as 
           she approaches a GUY.

                                 HER
                            (to Guy) 
                        Nice ass. You work out?

           The GUY is dumbfounded. She pinches it as she walks off.

           I approach a GIRL within earshot of HER.

                                 ME
                            (to Girl)
                        So, what kind of car do you drive?

           FLASHES of Conversations.

                                 HER
                            (to an OLD MAN)
                        That suit looks good on you, but I 
                        bet it would look even better balled 
                        up in the corner of a hotel room.

                                 ME
                            (to a DEBUTANTE)
                        What kind of diversity do you have 
                        in your portfolio?

                                 HER
                            (to an AWKWARD YOUNG MAN)
                        Hello, sweet cheeks. Grrrr!

                                 ME
                            (to a CLASSY LADY)
                        Is that dress a Valentino?

           LATER

           We LAUGH in the corner. She brushes her hair behind her ear. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I’d show you again, but I keep that 
                        one for myself.

           I spot a STUFFY LOOKING GUY walking in our direction.

                                 ME
                        Check out this douche. Catcall him.

           She stiffens. The laugh drains from her face.
                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Or do the blow job motion where you 
                        poke your tongue in your cheek.

                                 HER
                        No... um. That’s my boyfriend.

           STUFFY comes up to HER and wraps his arm around her waist.

                         STUFFY
           Wah wah wah wah. Wah wah.
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
                                             I have no idea what the fuck 
                                             he said because at that 
                                             moment I went momentarily 
                                             deaf.

           They walk off, leaving me devastated. Slowly, SOUND RESUMES 
           and SCOTT appears.

                                 SCOTT
                        Where were you? I looked a couple 
                        places.

           I’m still stunned.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Now what?

           I look him in the eye and say with out words:

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Time to randomly text some chicks.

           EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE GALAXY - MOMENTS LATER

           I’m standing in blackness.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You don’t need scenery for this. 
                        I’m in my texting zone. Hope you 
                        can read at an eighth grade level.

           My texts appear onscreen as I type. 

                                 MY TEXT
                        O-M-Goodness, just saw this chick 
                        in drag & had to txt.

           A GIRL appears on the other side of the screen, at dinner 
           with a FRIEND. She checks her phone, hits me back. Her name 
           and message appear onscreen over her face.

                                 LACEY (RED ROCK, 6/6.5)
                        LOL, wut? y? how r u?

                                 MY TEXT

                        girl made me think of you. What are 
                        you up to right this instant?

           LACEY (RED ROCK, 6/6.5) disappears and in her place appears a 
           CUTE GIRL in sweatpants watching TV alone.
                                 VIVIAN (WINSTONS, 7-ISH IN DARK)
                        WHATTTT?!! You are so crazy! Out 
                        dancing w some frends... why am i a

                        drag make me think of gwyneth in

                        he unwraps her. Tell me you love 
                        that scene!

           VIVIAN (WINSTONS, 7-ISH IN THE DARK) is replaced by ANOTHER 
           GIRL, this one in a cab.

                                 SADIE (BARNES Y NOBLE, 6-7)

                        that’s conceited!

           SADIE (BARNES Y NOBLE, 6-7) is gone and a NEW GIRL putting on  
           makeup appears.

                                 HIPSTER CHICK (TARGET, 8)
                        :( ur meeeeeean!

                        meant. my life’s goal is to TOP

                        30... ;)

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           I pull up to the curb and a HOT GIRL hops in my car.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        I’m so glad you called.

                                 ME
                        I didn’t.

           I hit the gas and she immediately leans over for road head.

           EXT. CITY - VARIOUS - MOVING

           I zig in and out of traffic, trying to concentrate more on 
           the blow job than the driving.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Love is like a leak in a boat. It 
                        pushes in through some weakness in 
                        the hull... Ehhh... I’m sorry... I 
                        blanked there for a second... and if 
                        you don’t stop the leak right away, 
                        it just gets worse, until you 
                        drown... ohhhh this chick is good... 
                        Having a hard time concentrating... 
                        She gets her own ellipses--
           SUPER: (dot-dot-dot)

           I pull up next to a fire truck and a FIREMAN, from his 
           elevated angle, can see what the HOT GIRL is doing to me. He 
           nods and gives me a thumbs up.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I wanna tell him: ‘No, Mr. Fireman, 
                        this is not a thumbs up moment.’

           I think about it...

                                 NARRATOR  (V.O.)
                        But, yeah, it is.

           I return the thumbs up.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We all have different patches for 
                        the leak, and mine is sex, which is 
                        about to erase all traces of that 
                        girl from the charity event right 
                        out of my brain. Orgasms are 
                        perfect mind erasers. I wonder if 
                        hot Russian spies used this shit in 
                        the Cold War.

           I look down at top of HOT GIRL’s head, then close my eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Goodbye to love in three... two...

           In the darkness of my closed eyes, I see MY HEART, inhaling a 
           cigarette and shaking his head at me.

           My eyes pop open.

                                 ME
                            (quietly)
                        Wait.

           HOT GIRL doesn’t hear me. I summon all my strength and pull 
           her off me.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Stop. I’m sorry.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        What the fuck?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Good question, Hot Girl. 

           We stare at each other. Neither knowing what else to say.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Never, in my own personal history 
                        of recorded time, have I passed up 
                        on an orgasm. 

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. VICEROY HOTEL - EVENT CHECK-IN - MOMENTS LATER

           I rush past the cleanup crew to the HOSTESS.
                                 ME
                        Hey, there was a girl here. Her 
                        hair was like... a perfect blonde, 
                        y’know? And she was about this 
                        tall... just a great, great girl 
                        height. And her smile was...

           The HOSTESS looks at me but sees an idiot.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Um...

           She stops an EVENT VOLUNTEER.

                                 HOSTESS (CONT’D)
                        Did you see some girl with a 
                        perfect smile?

           The EVENT VOLUNTEER rolls his eyes and keeps walking.

                                 HOSTESS (CONT’D)
                            (back to me)
                        Nope. Sorry.

           I spot the guest list in the trash by the Check-in table.

           EXT. VICEROY HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           I hop back in my car, list in hand. HOT GIRL is not happy.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        What the hell were you doing?

                                 ME
                        Hey Erin, you were amazing. Really 
                        know your stuff. But uh... Is there 
                        somewhere I can drop you?

           HOT GIRL wrinkles her face and punches mine.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Her name was Reagan, she would go 
                        on to explain. At least I think it 
                        was. I’ve forgotten again.

           INT. MY APARTMENT - LATER

           I pace the room reading the list of names in the lamp light.

                                 ME
                        Teresa C? Hmm. She could be a 
                        Teresa. With no “h.” That’s... No. 
                        Jenn? With two “n’s?” No. Never. 
                        Mary? Too plain. Carly? Too 
                        Nickelodeon. Chastity? I hope not.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        So, I’m realizing I’m not good with 
                        names. But if I had to pick a name 
                        for her, it would be... Anastasia.

           I look through the names for...
                                 ME
                        Ana... belle. That’s pretty 
                        close... What the fuck am I doing?

           I turn off the lights and get into bed.

           Beat.

           My cell phone LIGHTS UP, aimed at the list.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Sofia? That’s kinda good.

           INT. GUN RANGE - DAY

           POP! POP! Gunshots BLAST in the background. I’m against the 
           wall with earmuffs and protective eyewear. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This is my writing club in action. 
                        I guess you’ll want introductions.

           Lined up next to me are SCOTT and three others, wearing the 
           same protective getup. As they step up to fire, little 
           descriptions pop up next to them.

           SCOTT raises a shotgun and blasts away: “Scott. You’ve met 
           him already. Your attention span sucks.”

           LYLE raises a prostitute’s derringer, he doesn’t even look 
           down range: “Lyle. Single, low self-esteem and proud writer 
           of the first twenty pages of sixteen screenplays and twelve 
           novels.”

           SAMSON wields a high-powered sniper rifle. His eye magnified 
           through the scope looks like the eye of god him/herself: 
           “Samson. The married guy. Writes graphic novels, poems and 
           short stories.”

           MALLORY double fists two 9mm’s: “Mallory. She writes and 
           performs intensely personal one woman shows that she drags 
           the rest of us to. Beat. Sometimes we fuck. Beat. For 
           research.”

           INT. GUN RANGE - SNACK ROOM - LATER

           We all sit around eating candy bars and yelling over the 
           muffled background din of caps being popped.

                                 SCOTT
                        Why do you care what her name is?

                                 ME
                        I don’t know.

           I know they know it’s--

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                            (confessing)
                        So I can say it over and over again 
                        when no one is around.

           They all GROAN. MALLORY looks a little jealous.
                                 MALLORY
                        I wish someone would say my name 
                        over and over again.

                                 LYLE
                        While rubbing one out, or no?

                                 ME
                        This is just a passing infatuation. 
                        It’s not like I “whatever” her. 

                                 SCOTT
                        As if you would know. Love hater.

                                 ME
                        I just think the whole idea of true 
                        love is too old fashioned. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I sure hope that makes it into your 
                        romantic comedy. 

                                 ME
                        Art should reflect truth. Maybe 
                        love existed a hundred years ago, 
                        before we had real options... but 
                        we’ve definitely evolved. 

                                 LYLE
                        Can I use that in a story I’m

           I am a lonely figure gazing out a lonely window. I am all 
           Koreaned out: straight black hair, fashionable clothes. 
           Someone enters the room behind me, I turn to see--

                        What’s-her-name has somehow 
                        penetrated my subconscious.

           She has been traveling and drops her bags. We embrace an 
           embrace that tries to make up for a long separation.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                            (in Korean, English subtitles)
                        I thought they shot you and left 
                        you to die in that dirty ditch with 
                        the oxen.

                                 HER AS A KOREAN
                            (also in Korean)
                        They did. But my love for you gave 
                        me strength. I laid there for three 
                        days, until the soldiers were all 
                        gone. I tied myself to one of the 
                        oxen, who dragged me to the next 
                        village. It was a ten day journey. 
                        I let flies lay larvae in my wound, 
                        so that the maggots could keep it 
                        clean... The whole time, all I 
                        could see was your face.

           She suddenly turns her back to me.

                                 HER AS A KOREAN (CONT’D)
                        But that is not what I came here to 
                        tell you.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                        My jewel and rising sun, what is it?

           She hesitates.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN (CONT’D)
                        You can tell me anything, my bringer 
                        of moonbeams and poppy seeds.

                                 HER AS A KOREAN
                        I... I was not always... a woman.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                        What?

                                 HER AS A KOREAN
                        I was born a man, but I was always 
                        a woman inside. I had an operation 
                        so that I could be what my heart 
                        knew I was: a woman... your woman.

           She turns to me, but now I turn away.

                                 HER AS A KOREAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you ever forgive me, my prince 
                        of the warmth which brings life to 
                        my world?

           I hesitate. My words piling up in my throat like a 405-rush-
           hour-nightmare. 

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                        I, too, must tell you something.
                                 HER AS A KOREAN
                        Yes, anything.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                        I was not always a man. 

                                 HER AS A KOREAN
                        What?

           I turn to her, but now she turns away.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                        I was born with two breasts and a 
                        vagina, but I always felt they were 
                        not mine. They felt... foreign. So, 
                        after experimenting with some 
                        threesomes in college and saving a 
                        bit of money, I got an operation 
                        that liberated me and gave me what 
                        I always knew I had...
                            (dramatic beat)
                        One penis and two balls. 

           She is quiet.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you ever forgive me?

           She suddenly turns to me and says--

                                 HER AS A KOREAN
                        Don’t you see? If I was never the 
                        man I was before, and you were never 
                        the woman that you were, then we 
                        could never have loved each other as 
                        the woman and man that we are now.

                                 ME AS A KOREAN
                        I never looked at it like that...

           We embrace again.

           END OF SCOTT’S STORY -- BACK TO GUN RANGE

           INT. OLD PEOPLE PLACE - DAY

           I’m visiting my GRANDDAD at the Old People Place (you met him 
           earlier, when I showed how my mom ditched me).

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Something’s on your mind.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Granddad’s still a sharp bastard. 
                        Probably had another few years of 
                        living solo still in him, but he 
                        prefers the attention of nurses.
                                 ME
                        It’s nothing.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        So then it’s a girl. Are you going 
                        to marry her?

                                 ME
                        Ha. No. Marriage would require a 
                        paternity test and a shotgun as my 
                        best man. I just think she’s cool.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Cool? Sounds like a winner.

                                 ME
                        I don’t know. I only met her 
                        briefly and I don’t even know how 
                        to find her. But she’s invaded my 
                        brain and won’t leave.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        When did you become such a quitter? 
                        You know what Columbo would do?

                                 ME
                        Prove she’s a murderer?

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Yes, but first: he’d find her. Use 
                        your brain.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Somehow, he was always right. I 
                        needed to do some old fashioned 
                        detective work to find her, fuck her 
                        and forget her once and for all.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        And you may want to sleep with one 
                        eye open, in case she does turn out 
                        to be a murderer.

           GRANDDAD winks at me.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And just like that, my mind’s 
                        racing. I met her at a charity 
                        event. She’s a philanthropist. I 
                        need to blitzkrieg the LA charity 
                        scene to find her. How many events 
                        can there really be?

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           I google: “Upcoming charity events. Los Angeles.”

                                 ME
                        Holy shit.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I’m going to need backup. 

           I make a call.
                                 ME
                        Scott? You like doing good things. 
                        Wanna help me with some research?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Don’t worry. I know that even 
                        though you’re a good person, 
                        charity bores the shit out of you, 
                        too. We’ll montage this part.

           BEGIN HOPEFUL CHARITY MONTAGE

           - SCOTT and I sit in the National History museum, picking at 
           the shitty vegan food during the endangered Abdulali Wrinkled 
           Frog Luncheon. I scan the room, looking for HER.

           - I sit in my tub and read the romantic comedy script. I lose 
           focus and have to flip back to page one.

           - SCOTT and I participate in a 5K run/walk event for boobs. 
           As we jog, I scan the crowd for HER.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Charities are funny. They like to 
                        fatten you up with their luncheons 
                        and their hors d’oeuvres, their 
                        dinners and their drinks... Then 
                        they like to sweat it all back out 
                        of you with their 5K’s. 

           - In the ol’ tub again, reading the ol’ rom-com. The words 
           blur, outlining the shape of her face... I snap out of it.

           - Some ACTRESS auctions her “art” (the quotations are mine). 
           I scan the room for HER, but accidentally make eye contact 
           with an overweight HEDGE FUNDER who’s “giving back.”

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        Hey there! I see you at a lot of 
                        these. You’re a very caring person.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I didn’t wanna burst his bubble so I 
                        did what I do best: make up stories.

           - HEDGE FUNDER introduces SCOTT and I to some COLLEAGUES. We 
           help a RAGGED GUY replace his worn out shoes with new ones.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Wild, inventive stories about my 
                        travels and causes. Just to see the 
                        limits of the bullshit they’ll buy.

           Their faces light up. I look past them, but no sign of HER...

           - I dodge Santa Monican BUMS while finishing the 5K for guy 
           cancer. I search the faces. SCOTT approaches, PUFFING.

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s my best time yet!

                                 ME
                        It doesn’t matter. She’s not here.
                                 SCOTT
                        Is that what this is about? You 
                        told me we were doing research!

           - In my tub, I slowly rip pages from the script and lay them 
           on the surface of the bath to watch them absorb water and 
           sink. My answering machine BEEPS.

                                 BRYAN (V.O.)
                        Hey, buddy... just saw this amazing 
                        Malaysian chick in a porno. Thought 
                        I’d check to see how the rewrite is 
                        going... Forwarding you the link!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I must have misjudged her. She 
                        doesn’t care about charity at all. 
                        It’s actually kind of selfish of 
                        her to put me through all this. 

           My phone BEEPS from receiving Bryan’s e-mail.

           - SCOTT and I are at a round table with HEDGE FUNDER and a 
           bunch of his FRIENDS. I spin tales of my latest undertakings.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Between getting nowhere on this 
                        script and chasing the ghost of a 
                        girl I only met once, my sole 
                        creative outlet had become lying 
                        about my charitable adventures.

           END CHARITY BULLSHIT MONTAGE

           EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - EVENING

           A makeshift Dinner and Auction on the beach, with a stage and 
           all. I try my best to look enthusiastic but I’m failing. 
           SCOTT glances at the menu and whispers to me--

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s five hundred dollars a plate!

           A WAITER approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Meat or vegetarian?

                                 SCOTT
                        Actually, can we share a plate?

                                 WAITER
                        Shared plate fee is five hundred.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ll have the filet.

           HEDGE FUNDER is on the stage speaking.

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        And now I want to take this moment 
                        to have a truly extraordinary man 
                        come up here and share with you 
                        just what he’s been up to...
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        There are certain points in your 
                        life when all the little, harmless 
                        lies you’ve told...

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        This guy has farmed coconuts in 
                        Cambodia, helped with the lepers in 
                        South America...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Suddenly aren’t so little.

           I realize everyone is looking at me and waiting for me to 
           come up onstage. I rise. They APPLAUD. I walk to the stage.

           ONSTAGE 

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        Most recently he single-handedly 
                        got the Abdulali Wrinkled Frog off 
                        the endangered list.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That part’s somewhat true. I’ll 
                        explain later.

                                 ME
                            (into the mic)
                        It wasn’t really single-handed, 
                        there was a lot of hands in there, 
                        it was more like a hand orgy.

           Then suddenly I see HER: In all her slo-mo glory. She waves 
           and it erases the ability to speak from whatever part of my 
           brain controls speech.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, so... speaking of orgies, I’m 
                        just, uh, glad to get those 
                        wrinkled fuckers fertilizing eggs 
                        again... Thanks. Enjoy your dinner.

           She gives me a wry smile as I walk off the stage.

           LATER - BY THE SEA SIDE

           I chug a glass of wine to drink the awful taste of lies out 
           of my mouth and hope nobody finds me.

                                 HER (O.C.)
                        Wow. Wrinkled frogs. I had no idea 
                        you were such a philanthropist.

                                 ME
                        Yeah, I just came for the food. 
                        It’s better at frog events than 
                        those Rhesus monkey tapas things.

                                 HER
                        Not Rhesus tapas! They’re 
                        overpopulated. That’s a slush fund 
                        charity. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HER (CONT'D)
                        They sprinkle pictures of cute 
                        little monkeys around like ruffies 
                        and then date rape your checkbook. 
                        Bastards.

                                 ME
                        You seem pretty passionate about 
                        monkey rape.

                                 HER
                        Like you and frog orgies. 

           She LAUGHS one of those laughs that makes my heart ache.

                                 ME
                        You wanna go for a walk?

           LATER

           We walk along the water’s edge.

                                 HER
                        Do you see right there? Where those 
                        two waves collide and become one?

           I do.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        It’s crazy. It’s like who knows how 
                        far they’ve traveled... Miles? 
                        Thousands of miles? Years? 
                        Lifetimes? To finally meet right 
                        here, right now, for one moment. To 
                        crash... then go back out to sea, 
                        to search for each other again.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This is a moment. I should seize 
                        it. I’ve always excelled when women 
                        mention water: showers, baths, hot 
                        tubs. I once fucked a girl in a 
                        puddle. She obviously means we can 
                        hook up tonight and experience 
                        something almost impossible, and 
                        then go back to our normal lives 
                        out in the ocean.

           We silently watch as the waves collide over and over again.

           INT. CENTURY CITY MALL - DAY

           SCOTT and I wander through the crowd.

                                 SCOTT
                        And then what?

                                 ME
                        Nothing. I didn’t seize the moment. 
                        It wasn’t enough.

                                 SCOTT
                        Weren’t feeling it?
                                 ME
                        No, I was definitely feeling it. We 
                        both were. I just didn’t... act.

                                 SCOTT
                        You froze up? Ouch. 

           We take the escalator up to the food court.

                                 ME
                        I know. What’s wrong with me? I’ve 
                        spent years building up my armor, 
                        stocking ammunition, creating a 
                        perfect war machine to smash through 
                        the gates... And suddenly, it didn’t 
                        matter. I didn’t want to pull the 
                        trigger. I wanted... I don’t know. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You gonna see her again?

                                 ME
                        She has a boyfriend. I gotta get out 
                        before I embarrass myself even more. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I would say that’s two months of 
                        stalking well spent.

                                 ME
                        At least I never have to see her 
                        again. I’m done with charity, I’m 
                        done with stalking. Time to--

                                 HER (O.C.)
                        Hey, you!

                           ME
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Shit.
                                             Shit.

           Here she comes down the down escalator.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        This is weird, right?

           SCOTT shoots me a look, which I ignore.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        No matter how much your brain 
                        thinks it controls your mouth, 
                        there’s always gonna be that 
                        override switch... 

           I turn and walk downwards, fighting the escalator pulling me 
           up. She turns and marches upward, against her own stream. 
           Leaving us marching in place.

                                 ME
                        Weird that you’re following me?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        A terrifying, self-sabotaging, 
                        emotionally reckless autopilot.

           I push my way through ANNOYED PEOPLE riding up the escalator.
                                 ME
                        Yeah, it is a little weird. It’s 
                        like fate wants us to hang out.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And just like that... the self-
                        sabotage kicks in.

           She wrinkles her face.

                                 HER
                        Then why do I feel like something 
                        is pulling us apart?

           She stops walking and glides away.

                                 ME
                        Dork.

           She starts walking again to meet me in the middle.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        But seriously, right? I think we’re 
                        supposed to hang out.

           A curious look crosses her face.

                                 HER
                        You’re asking me out?

                                 ME
                        Yeah. I know you have a boyfriend.

                                 HER
                        Yup, I do. And he doesn’t like me 
                        going on dates.

                                 ME
                        He sounds controlling.

                                 HER
                        He gets jealous. Especially of 
                        intriguing philanthropists.

                                 ME
                        What if we just hung out as friends? 
                        I’d make a lousy boyfriend anyway. 
                        I’d probably forget your birthday.

                                 HER
                        That’s a terrible pitch! Friends 
                        don’t forget each other’s 
                        birthdays! You’re a lousy friend!

                                 ME
                        I just mean he’s probably better at 
                        relationship stuff. 

                                 HER
                        I bet you’re not so bad.

                                 ME
                        So it’s a date? Friend date?

                                 HER
                        That’s ok with you? The friend zone?
                                 ME
                        Wow, you have a healthy opinion of 
                        yourself. Thinking no guy can be 
                        your friend without wanting more...

                                 HER
                        I think straight guys aren’t 
                        friends with straight girls.

                                 ME
                        Ok, there’s obviously an attraction 
                        here, but once I find your flaw, 
                        I’ll be over you in no time.

                                 HER
                        My flaw?

                                 ME
                        Sure. Everyone has one. I just have 
                        to find it and focus in on it like 
                        a laser to kill the attraction.

                                 HER
                        I don’t know if I like this game. 
                        What’s your flaw?

                                 ME
                        You gotta find it.

                                 HER
                        I’m going with arrogance.

                                 ME
                        Or is that a turn on? 

           She narrows her eyes at me.

           EXT. PINEAPPLE HILL SALOON - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A PT Cruiser, covered in headshots advertising a Headshot 
           Studio, sits by the entrance.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That’s Mallory’s car. The headshot 
                        studio she works for pays extra if 
                        they can plaster her car with the 
                        faces of out-of-work actors.

           INT. PINEAPPLE HILL SALOON - NIGHT

           MALLORY and I drink pints as she practices a German accent. 

                                 MALLORY
                        You’re playing with fire.

                                 ME
                        There is nothing wrong with two 
                        adults hanging out in friendship.

                                 MALLORY
                        Men and women can’t be friends. 
                        We’re squids and squirrels.
                                 ME
                        Are you saying we aren’t friends?

                                 MALLORY
                        I’m saying we’ve slept together.

                                 ME
                        So? Friends can fuck. Fuck buddies.

                                 MALLORY
                        Have you fucked Scott?

                                 ME
                        Not physically. What’s with the 
                        German accent? 

                                 MALLORY
                        It’s for my new show: “It’s Not 
                        You, It’s Me... But If I Had To 
                        Break It Down, It’s Like 20/80.”

                                 ME
                        What happened to “Over You, Ovary?”

                                 MALLORY
                        Don’t change the subject. I think 
                        you’re starting to like this girl 
                        and you’re just setting boundaries 
                        so you can push them. 

                                 ME
                        Wrong. I’m going out with her to 
                        prove there’s nothing special about 
                        her. She’s just as ordinary as 
                        every other girl I’ve ever fucked. 

                                 MALLORY
                        Fuck you.

                                 ME
                        Present company excluded.

                                 MALLORY
                        Why? 

                                 ME
                        You know. Because we’re...

           I hesitate. Feels like a trap.

                                 MALLORY
                        Say it.

                           ME
                                                       MALLORY
           Friends.
                                             Fuck you.

           MALLORY drops the accent.

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I went on a “friend date” recently.

           INT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - MALLORY’S STORY - NIGHT

           I’m MALLORY in this one. Sexy dress, long hair. I don’t look 
           that bad with boobs... HER is the GUY, also in drag. 
           I grab a wine bottle to top off her glass. She kisses me and 
           then leans back. 

                                 ME AS MALLORY
                        What was that?

           She looks to her crotch and then back up to me.

                                 HER IN DRAG
                        My penis hurts.

                                 ME AS MALLORY
                        What?

                                 HER IN DRAG
                        My penis hurts.

                                 ME AS MALLORY
                        Then maybe you should go home and 
                        take care of it.

                                 HER IN DRAG
                        No. My roommates are home.

           My puzzled face is missing pieces.

                                 HER IN DRAG (CONT’D)
                        I want you to take care of it.

                                 ME AS MALLORY
                        Well, that’s not gonna happen.

           I look down to my own crotch, suddenly realizing something.

                                 ME AS MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        My boobs are sore, and apparently 
                        I’m on my period.

           She thinks it over.

                                 HER IN DRAG
                        I don’t even have to take off my 
                        pants.

           EXT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - MORNING AFTER THE FRIEND DATE

           I’m still MALLORY, and I get into the headshot-covered car, 
           only to see one of the headshots is HER IN DRAG, right above 
           the driver side window. 

                                 MALLORY (V.O.)
                        And now I have to see that fucking 
                        face every day.

           END OF STORY AS: HER headshot blends into--

           INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

           HER real face looking at my day dreaming face.  We’re on our 
           friend date.
           A giant sculpture invades the room. It looks like a kid made 
           it out of anything he could get his hands on, and it has a 
           bunch of ear pieces attached that allow you to listen to 
           different simulated heartbeats. It’s called a:

           STETHOSCOPE FOR ALL LIVING THINGS

           I put on one of the earpieces and hear a SLOW DEEP THUD.

                                 ME
                        What’s number thirty-seven?

           She rifles through a pamphlet.

                                 HER
                        It’s a great blue whale heart.

           LATER - She puts an earpiece on. This time the heartbeat is 
           pure machine gun fire.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Number eight?

           It’s my turn to rifle.

                                 ME
                        An Amethyst Woodstar Hummingbird, 
                        the fastest heartbeat in the world. 
                        Its heart beats so fast that the 
                        little fucker’s always near death. 

           LATER - The artist left out stethoscopes for the people to 
           use on each other. She listens for my heart as I read a 
           plaque on the wall.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        It says the ancient Chinese believed 
                        you were only allotted a limited 
                        number of heartbeats when you were 
                        born. You could spend them anyway 
                        you liked, but your heart used them 
                        up when it beat faster, like when 
                        you got angry or excited.

                                 HER
                        Shhh.

           She moves the stethoscope around.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t find it.

                                 ME
                        Hmm. I wonder if it’s the same with 
                        your allotment of boners...

                                 HER
                        Shhh!

           She puts the stethoscope down. 

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. You don’t have a heart.

                                 ME
                        I’m a miracle of science. That’s 
                        what the scientists call me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ME (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes just Miracle Man or Mr. 
                        Miracle for short.
                            (beat)
                        It’s not uncommon for people to 
                        applaud and sprinkle rose petals 
                        when I enter a room.

                                 HER
                        I’ll make a note of it.

           EXT. ART GALLERY - LATER

           We exit into the parking lot.

                                 HER
                        I had a great time, Miracle Man.

                                 ME
                        Well, deep down, us miracles of 
                        science are just regular, fun guys.

                                 HER
                        Thanks for coming. Been trying to 
                        drag my boyfriend here for weeks.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I’d already known tonight was going 
                        to be a complete emotional and 
                        sexual failure. But I just now 
                        figured out why.

           I pretend to be unfazed.

                                 ME
                        Common folk. They don’t appreciate 
                        the little things.

           She smiles.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Friend dates involve the emotionally 
                        and intellectually satisfying 
                        activities that boyfriends avoid. 

                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
                           HER
           Alright. Gotta get up early 
           to help the man pick out new 
           curtains. Guys cannot be left 
           to their own interior 
           decorating devices. 
                                             But when it’s time to reap 
                                             the benefits of devotion, 
                                             affection and rabid ravenous 
                                             feats of sexual exploration 
                                             too graphic for the nature 
                                             channel -- the very same 
                                             unprotected acts of divine 
                                             revelation that have been 
                                             echoing through my 
                                             imagination for the past four 
                                             hours and seventeen minutes--

           I shrug.

                                 ME
                        Yeah. I gotta go, too. I have a 
                        late night poker thing.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        When it comes to those things, 
                        you’re left out in the lying, 
                        lonely, masturbatory cold.  

                                 HER
                        We should definitely do this again.

                           ME
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Definitely.
                                             No chance in hell.

           We hug. I’m barely holding my shit together. If you’re 
           watching this performance right now, Sir Ben Kingsley, you 
           should be taking notes. 

           INT. MY CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           I stare at the dashboard. It’s a stupid fucking dashboard.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I’ve just made her boyfriend’s job 
                        easier by taking the bullets while 
                        he takes home the purple heart.

           I pound my hands on my stupid fucking steering wheel.

                           ME
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Fuck me. Fuuuuuck. 
                 (beat)
           AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
           HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
           HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH--
                                             At least I avoided setting 
                                             specific plans to see her 
                                             again. I’ll just disappear 
                                             now, she’ll forget me and I 
                                             never have to see her again--

           TAP. TAP. TAP.

           I look over to the stupid fucking window, mid-scream. 

           It’s HER.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Sufferin’ succotash.

           I roll the window down.

                                 HER
                        Are you ok?

                                 ME
                        Vocal warm-ups. I like to sing on 
                        my way home... I thought you left.

                                 HER
                        My car won’t start.

           EXT. HER APARTMENT - LATER

           We pull up to the curb in my car.

           INT. MY CAR - CONTINUOUS

           I put the car in park, but leave it running.
                                 HER
                        Thanks for the ride. Sorry the tow-
                        truck took so long.

                                 ME
                        That’s what friends are for.

                                 HER
                        I’m sorry I made you miss poker.

           I shrug.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, so... are you busy Thursday?

                           ME
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Oh, um...
                                             Yes. Yes! Very busy!

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Because there’s this charity event 
                        I don’t have a date to... 

                           ME
           Sure. Cool. Why not?
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
                                             You dumb motherfucker.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Yay! Second friend date!

                                 ME
                        Yay!

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        So, this is me. So awkward and 
                        stupid I barely recognize myself.

           We both look at each other. It’s awkward and stupid.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And here’s the proof of how utterly 
                        awkward and stupid this lower-life-
                        form-in-my-body has become. 

           She puts up her hand to wave bye.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That’s a goodbye wave. 

                                 HER
                        See you Thursday.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But I mistake it for--

           Super   ...slow   ...motion   ...SLAP! I high-five her hand.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        A fucking high-five.

                                 ME
                        See you Thursday!

           She takes a second to process the high-five. She smiles 
           awkwardly, then hops out of the car.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And now I’m left to hear the 
                        fucking echo of the high-five--

           SLAP-AP-AP...AP...AP...ap...ap...ap...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        For the rest of eternity.

           I notice a light appear in the top left window of her complex 
           and pop the car in gear before I do anything else stupid.

           EXT. GOLF DRIVING RANGE - DAY

           My writing group, at it again. We shoot tequila and see who 
           can hit a golf ball farther.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This is called drunk driving.

                                 MALLORY
                        At least you’ll never see her again.

           I’m silent. But the truth is written all over my face, clear 
           as a little girl’s sidewalk chalk drawing of a sunflower.  

                                 ALL
                        Jesus.

                                 ME
                        What? It’s for charity!

                                 SAMSON
                        Your dick get non-profit status?

                                 ME
                        I can’t blow it off, she thinks I’m 
                        a charity worker.

                                 LYLE
                        Starting to sound like love...

                                 ME
                        Fuck your love. This is research.

                                 LYLE
                        You look like shit. You’re stalking 
                        her. You talk about her nonstop. 
                        And you seem sexually frustrated. 
                        Are you even masturbating properly? 

                                 ME
                        I don’t have to masturbate! I can 
                        get laid anytime. I’m just hanging 
                        out with her to prove she’s no 
                        different from any other girl.

                                 MALLORY
                        That’s what you said last time.

                                 ME
                        Goddammit. I don’t have to explain 
                        myself. Love is a fairy tale lonely 
                        people use to justify sticking it 
                        out with each other. End of story.
                                 LYLE
                        Bullshit. Love is what connects 
                        people. And the whole becomes 
                        better than the parts.

                                 ME
                        Look at the divorce rate. People are 
                        petty, emotional whores. We don’t 
                        pair off to connect, we do it so we 
                        can spread our misery like STD’s. 

           That shuts them up.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Love is an ideal that can’t survive 
                        in our imperfect world. You can’t 
                        dump gasoline and spoiled meat on a 
                        rose and expect it to bloom.

                                 LYLE
                        But love is what makes you want to 
                        feed the rose water and fresh meat. 

                                 SAMSON
                            (to Lyle)
                        You’re never house-sitting for me.

                                 LYLE
                        It’s like anything else. If you 
                        don’t understand it, you ruin it... 
                        Which is, of course, the lesson of 
                        “Frankenstein.”

           SAMSON GROANS.

           INT. DR. FRANKENSTEIN’S LAB - LYLE’S STORY - NIGHT

           It’s a ridiculous, stormy night. I’m DR. FRANKENSTEIN. 
           LIGHTNING CRASHES outside as I pull a sheet off something in 
           the middle of my lab: It’s HER AS THE MONSTER.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        Everyone thought Dr. Frankenstein 
                        was evil, but it was actually love 
                        between man and beast.

           I pull a switch and HER AS THE MONSTER comes to life.

                                 ME AS DR. FRANKENSTEIN
                        Live!

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        That’s why the villagers killed 
                        them. Not because they were evil, 
                        but because the villagers couldn’t 
                        understand that kind of love.

           VILLAGERS rush in and stab us both to death with pitchforks.

           END OF LYLE’S STORY -- BACK TO GOLF RANGE

           That shuts us all up. Until--
                                 SAMSON
                        What the fuck was that?

                                 LYLE
                        “Frankenstein.” It’s a metaphor.

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s not even how the story goes.

                                 LYLE
                        Another way to look at it is that 
                        Frankenstein went against nature 
                        and so he had to die.

                                 SCOTT
                        The exact opposite of your first 
                        point.

                                 LYLE
                        Yeah... but this point is better. 
                            (to Me)
                        You’re lying to yourself by trying 
                        to prove she’s not special. It’s 
                        deceptive. To you, to her, to your 
                        connection. You’ll never get to the 
                        truth through deception.

           SCOTT sort of pauses at that.

                                 SCOTT
                        That actually had a thought behind 
                        it, Lyle. I’m a little surprised.
                            (to Me)
                        He’s right. You’re going to ruin 
                        this, because you’re a love hater.

                                 ME
                        None of you know what you’re talking 
                        about. Don’t romanticize everything 
                        because you read Love and Yellow 
                        Fever. It’s idealized bullshit.

                                 SCOTT
                        It was cholera, you dick, and if 
                        you really believe that, then why 
                        can’t you stop seeing her? She has 
                        a boyfriend. Doesn’t that mean 
                        anything to you?

                                 ME
                        She’s participating as much as I am.

                                 MALLORY
                        So, what, you’re going to wreck her 
                        relationship until you get bored and 
                        stop calling? Business as usual?

                                 ME
                        Fuck you. Don’t take your stupid 
                        “man issues” out on me. I’m already 
                        pissed I’ve gotta go to whatever 
                        dumb charity event this is tonight.

           MALLORY sees red. She throws her golf club at me.
                                 MALLORY
                        Fuck me? Fuck you!

                                 ME
                        Hey! What the fuck, Mallory?

           She kicks over a bucket of golf balls, picking some up and 
           pelting them at me.

                                 MALLORY
                        This is all your fault! You’re the 
                        one who keeps going out with her! 
                        Quit whining about it! 

                                 ME
                        Me whining? I didn’t even want to 
                        talk about this shit! And now you 
                        got me all worked up right before 
                        I’ve gotta go home and put on a 
                        fucking suit!

                                 MALLORY
                        So just go already!

           SCOTT, SAMSON and LYLE watch quietly, not sure what just 
           happened, as I grab my clubs and storm off.

           EXT. YOGA STUDIO - EVENING

           I show up in a suit. I see HER in spandex, carrying two mats.

                                 ME
                        What kind of charity is this?

                                 HER
                        It’s actually yoga class.

                                 ME
                        I think I missed something.

                                 HER
                        I didn’t think you’d come if I told 
                        you we were doing yoga.

                        She had the biggest balls I’d ever 
                        seen on a chick.

                                 ME
                        Um... I’m not dressed for this.

           She opens the door to the studio and looks back at me. Her 
           eyes have a pleading, Bambi-like quality.

                                 HER
                        Are you scared?

                        Since I was five, I’ve never been 
                        able to back down from a challenge. 
                        Which I’m sure will be my downfall.

           I drop my suit pants. Good thing I’m wearing boxers. She 
           smiles and I follow HER in.

           EXT. PAPER OR PLASTIK CAFE - LATER

           We sit drinking bottles of water. I’m in suit pants and a 
           wife beater, and we’re both drenched in sweat. She still 
           looks hot. 

                                 ME
                        Yeah, I’m pretty limber, right?

           She LAUGHS.

                                 HER
                        I’m sorry. You looked so ridiculous. 
                        You spent half the time in child’s 
                        pose. Where’s your stamina?

           I look around.

                                 ME
                        Shhhh! You’ll ruin my reputation! 

                                 HER
                        I think that noise you made during 
                        downward dog beat me to it...

                                 ME
                        Not a normal position for a man.

           She LAUGHS again. I smile, but can’t take my gaze from her. 
           She smiles back, looking at me slyly.

                                 HER
                        What?

                                 ME
                        What’s the deal with you and Stuffy? 

                                 HER
                        That’s not his name.

                        I’m reviving the art of nicknames.

                                 HER
                        We’ll get married, probably.

                                 ME
                        Sounds romantic. You gonna get him 
                        Uggs for his cold feet?

                                 HER
                        He already proposed.

                                 ME
                        So... you’re engaged?

                                 HER
                        Not exactly.

                        You said “no?”

                        I haven’t answered him yet.

                                 ME
                        Not sure he’s the one?

                                 HER
                        It’s not him, it’s me. I’m just...

                                 ME
                        Not the one for him?

                                 HER
                        You’re impossible. No. I’m just... 
                        afraid. You wouldn’t understand.

           She SIGHS.

                                 HER
                        Why get married? Is it the goal of 
                        love? Shouldn’t love be the goal? 

                                 ME
                        You’re afraid you don’t love him.

                                 HER
                        No. I’m afraid of my life being 
                        over. I don’t want to give up my 
                        independence.

                                 ME
                        You can’t look at things that way.

                        It’s different for guys. You get to 
                        graduate, get a job, get married, 
                        get promoted, conquer the world.

                        It’s never that easy. Besides, 
                        women have that same potential.

                        San Francisco. An outside wedding, 
                        but in the winter, so it’s crisp 
                        enough to crave each other’s body 
                        heat. They have these wonderful

                        Ask any girl. It doesn’t matter if 
                        she’s eloping or renting an island, 
                        she has it down to the last detail. 

                                 ME
                        “Woman” equals “obsessive.” Got it.

                        What scares me is: I don’t know what 
                        I want to do with my life yet. So 
                        when I get married, is that the end 
                        of me? I become a wife and then a 
                        mother. But where is my life? What 
                        if my dreams fade into the 
                        background or I never figure it out? 
                        Getting married is like being a rose 
                        waiting to bloom. There’s that one 
                        perfect, beautiful day, and then you 
                        start to wither away to nothing.

                        It’s the worst of things.

                        Don’t you see? One day all these 
                        little things that you find 
                        interesting about me, and I you, 
                        would make us lie in bed at night 
                        thinking of new ways to kill each 
                        other without being caught. But 
                        with the rate that technology is 
                        advancing, and forensics, that just 
                        won’t be possible. So, the only 
                        escape would be for one of us to 
                        have the balls to kill both of us.

           I wait for it.

                                 ME
                        So you’re saying you like me, too?

                        Yes. Unfortunately. Which is why 
                        this isn’t working. The rule was: 
                        we’re supposed to just be friends. 
                        But now it’s getting complicated.

                                 ME
                        It’s not that complicated.

                                 HER
                        I have a boyfriend. We’ve been 
                        together for four years. 

                                 ME
                        We have a connection, though. 

                                 HER
                        So? I can’t just break things off 
                        with him because you decided you 
                        like me. I owe him more. Us liking 
                        each other doesn’t change that.

           A CHALKBOARD DRAWING OF A BRAIN.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The brain is funny. It finds a 
                        thing it likes and gets fired up.

           Animated CHALK FLAMES engulf the brain.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The heart beats three times faster.

           Three CHALK HAMMERS pulverize a CHALK HEART.

                        Blood gets diverted to other areas.

           The red chalk flames travel from the brain down to the GROIN.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Which causes the feeling of 
                        butterflies in the stomach.

           Small CHALK BUTTERFLIES zip around inside a CHALK STOMACH.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s like a hit of cocaine. 

           Chalk dust falls off the butterflies into a line, which a 
           CHALK NOSE snorts, filling the entire chalk person with more 
           red flames. 

           The chalk butterflies become real butterflies and stream off 
           the chalkboard filling THE ENTIRE WORLD WITH COLOR.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But when you can’t have it...

           All the butterflies suddenly DRAIN OF COLOR and drop dead, 
           raining down in black and white wings.

           I see some FRAT GUYS barbecuing and drinking. I walk over and 
           throw my script onto their barbecue, cover it in lighter

                                 GRANDDAD
                        I never needed to before. Do you 
                        know how many years I’ve waited for 
                        you to actually fall for a girl? 
                        And now you’re puttering around! If 
                        I’d been half the pussy you are, 
                        you think you would’ve been born?

                                 ME
                        This isn’t me! She’s the one 
                        staying in an unhappy relationship. 
                        She rejected a marriage proposal 
                        from the guy, but won’t cut him 
                        loose. That’s not on me.

           I miss a shot. I’m already way more winded than GRANDDAD.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Your grandmother was engaged to a 
                        wop when I met her.  You think that 
                        douchebag would have known what to 
                        do with her? I had to steal her. I 
                        saved her. And when I die, I want 
                        to be buried right on top her.
                                 SCOTT
                        That’s so romantic. Face to face?

                                 GRANDDAD
                        No, you cum rascal. In a 69. 

           SCOTT and I exchange looks, trying to process that...

                                 GRANDDAD (CONT’D)
                        You kids have such wonderful words 
                        these days. Tool. Douchebag. 
                        Fuckstick. I love it.

                                 ME
                        That’s it, I’m having them block 
                        HBO in your room.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        No, you won’t. You won’t even fight 
                        for the girl you love. Pussy.

                                 ME
                        Who keeps saying I love this girl? 
                        It’s not love.

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s definitely “something.”

           I miss another shot. I hunch over to catch my breath.

                                 ME
                        I’m ok with that definition. Can we 
                        take a quick break? Granddad’s 
                        getting old. I don’t want to wear 
                        him out.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        A real man knows what he wants and 
                        goes after it. Because he knows 
                        he’s the best thing for it.

                                 SCOTT
                        I thought you were going to leave 
                        her alone.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        He can’t leave her alone. Look at 
                        him. He looks terrible! 

                                 ME
                        Thanks. 

                                 GRANDDAD
                        Don’t let the ghost of your mom 
                        haunt you for the rest of your 
                        life. Get on with things.

                                 SCOTT
                        He’s right.

                                 ME
                        Why are you ganging up on me? This 
                        has nothing to do with that!
                                 GRANDDAD
                        Love is like your 401K. It matches 
                        your investment. You love little, 
                        you’re loved little. But if you 
                        love with your balls in the lion’s 
                        mouth, then there’s nothing that 
                        can stand in your way.

                                 SCOTT
                        Tell him the story.

                                 ME
                        What story? Wait... do you guys 
                        hang out without me?

                                 SCOTT
                        I never knew my granddad. Don’t be 
                        selfish.
                            (to Granddad)
                        Tell him the story.

           INT. BAR - GRANDDAD’S STORY (1943)

           GRANDDAD likes to exaggerate, so I’ve got a feeling this is 
           going to be overdramatic. And like most things from his time, 
           it’s gonna be in technicolor. 

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        It was 1943. I was on R and R in 
                        San Diego.

           I’m GRANDDAD, wearing a pair of Dress Navy Blues.

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        And then I saw her. Every man in the 
                        bar was lined up to talk to her.

           I see HER AS MY GRANDMOTHER, in a long skirt and a Letterman 
           Sweater. All the GUYS are lined up to talk her, literally.

           I push my way to her. She shows me her engagement ring. I 
           take her wrist, ignore the ring, and kiss her hand. 

           She BLUSHES as I lead her to the dance floor. All the lights 
           dim, except for the jukebox, which plays on my cue: “Paper 
           Doll” by the Mills Brothers. It’s pure magic. As we dance, 
           the walls fade away and give birth to a million stars--

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        I shipped out the next day.

           EXT. PIER - GRANDDAD’S STORY - NEXT DAY

           I’m on a Naval ship. She waves from the pier, wipes her tears 
           with a white handkerchief, and then lets it go. A gust of 
           wind catches it and carries it to my hand.

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        After that, things got ugly.
           EXT. NAVAL SHIP - GRANDDAD’S STORY - NIGHT

           The sea is wild and stormy. The ship rocks. I pull out the 
           handkerchief and smell it to calm my nerves.

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        I never thought I’d see her again.

           A helicopter drops a bag of mail from the sky. I’m handed a 
           letter with just “MY NAME” written on it. I read the letter. 

                                 HER AS MY GRANDMOTHER (V.O.)
                            (hamming it up)
                        My Dearest. I do not know when or 
                        if I will ever see you again. I 
                        wake up at night and say your name 
                        to the same stars that I imagine 
                        govern your sky. But I am already 
                        betrothed to a man whom my parents 
                        call certifiable. I am sorry, my 
                        love. If we could be together I 
                        would turn the world on its side, 
                        but the wedding date has been set 
                        for this thirteenth of January. 

           I look at a calendar and see that the wedding is three days 
           away. That moment my ship takes German fire. It is rocked 
           sideways and sinks. 

           A German Vessel pulls our survivors from the water. 

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        But not even Germans can stop love.

           EXT. GERMAN VESSEL - GRANDDAD’S STORY

           On the German Ship, I overtake a machine gun and fire like a 
           mad man, freeing the OTHERS. 

           Staring out at the empty ocean, I caress the handkerchief 
           once more, and then dive in and swim away.

           TRAVEL MONTAGE - GRANDDAD’S STORY

           LATER IN THE OCEAN - Sharks circle ME AS GRANDDAD.

           ON A WOODEN RAFT - I paddle, wearing a shark’s skin like a 
           rain coat and his teeth on a necklace.

           IN AN AFRICAN DESERT - I strain water from a rock. 

           IN THE HIMALAYAS - I barter for a llama. A SHERPA touches her 
           handkerchief and I stab a knife through his hand.

           IN ALASKA - I mush a dogsled team across the Iditarod Trail.

           IN NORCAL - I fight a bear with my shark tooth necklace.

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        That was the longest three days of 
                        my life.
           INT. CHURCH - GRANDDAD’S STORY - DAY

           HER AS MY GRANDMOTHER and STUFFY AS AN ITALIAN are ready to 
           be pronounced man and wife.

                                 PRIEST
                        If anyone has reason for this 
                        marriage not to take place, speak 
                        now or forever hold your peace.

           Silence. The PRIEST opens his mouth to finish, but there is a 
           LOW RUMBLE. A YOUNG BOY looks out the church window to see a 
           herd of horses cresting a hill. They storm past the church. I 
           ride up on the last horse and pop a wheelie.  

           BACK INSIDE 

           The back doors fall down as I enter. I hold up the worn 
           handkerchief. She cannot believe it. I walk towards HER AS MY 
           GRANDMOTHER, slowly. She runs into my arms. We kiss. 

           STUFFY AS AN ITALIAN rushes to intervene and I punch him out, 
           without having to unlock lips. Confetti falls. APPLAUSE.

                                 GRANDDAD (V.O.)
                        That kiss changed everything. The 
                        solar eclipse came three days 
                        early, a rainstorm swept the 
                        drought-ridden town of Umhadawa, 
                        and the Allies turned the tide of 
                        the war.

           END OF GRANDDAD’S STORY - BACK TO HANDBALL COURT

           SCOTT sighs.

                                 SCOTT 
                        Great story. It’s right up there 
                        with Love in the Time of Cholera.

           I roll my eyes.

                                 ME
                        Most of that is not even possible.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        You’re missing the point. Women 
                        want to be fought for, to feel 
                        desired.

                                 ME
                        It just seems like if she felt half 
                        of what I feel, she would explode.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        But you feel all of what you feel 
                        and you’re not doing a fucking 
                        thing about it.
                            (beat)
                        Which makes him what, Scotty?

                                 SCOTT
                        A pussy.

                                 GRANDDAD
                        A pussy.
           INT. MY APARTMENT - MY BEDROOM - NIGHT

           I’m lying there, just a pussy staring up at the ceiling.

           EXT. HER APARTMENT - NIGHT

           I grab a rock and toss it at her window. The top left one. 
           Yeah, it’s old fashioned, so sue me. 

           CRACK. The rock goes through the window. 

                                 ME
                        Shit.

           A light pops on. A NEW GUY comes to the window, he’s Gerry-
           Butler-“300” buff. 

                                 NEW GUY
                        What the f?

           Who the fuck is that?

                                 ME
                        Who the fuck are you? Is she 
                        sleeping with you? 

           ANOTHER GUY comes to the window behind NEW GUY. Just as buff 
           and hairless. 

                                 ANOTHER GUY
                        Where did that rock come from?

                                 NEW GUY
                        This douchebag threw it up here.

                                 ME
                        Two of you? I’m gonna be sick.  
                        What the hell? Is it some no-body-
                        hair-invitation-only orgy up there?

                                 HER (O.C.)
                        What’s going on?

           I look over to the right side window. She lights it up. She’s 
           all by herself.

                                 NEW GUY
                        This guy threw a rock through our 
                        window.

                                 HER
                        You have something against gays? 

                                 ME
                        What? No. I thought you lived in 
                        that one... I love gay people.

           A NEIGHBOR has come outside to see all the commotion.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        What’s going on?

                                 NEW GUY
                        We can’t tell if this guy’s a bigot 
                        or coming out.
                                 NEIGHBOR
                        That’s how it goes. You hate because 
                        you’re afraid of your own feelings.

                                 ME
                        No! I was just looking for her.

                                 ANOTHER GUY
                        Why?

                                 HER
                        Yeah, why?

                                 ME
                        I just want to do... something... 
                        with you.

                                 HER
                        Like what?

                                 ME
                        Anything.

                                 HER
                        What time is it?

           A DOG WALKER, who has stopped to watch, chimes in--

                                 DOG WALKER
                        It’s 12:01.

                                 HER
                        It’s kind of late.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Yeah, it is kind of late.

                                 ME
                        Yeah. But is it too late?

           INT. SUPERMARKET - LATER

           She leads me through the fluorescent flickering maze. As we 
           pass the cereal, she stops to grab a box of Frosted Flakes.

                                 HER
                        Life’s too short, y’know?

           I see a box of Captain Crunch. That motherfucking Captain is 
           looking at me all wrong. I turn it backwards so I don’t have 
           to see him.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        You have a beef with the captain?

                                 ME
                        Ehhh... bad memories.

                                 HER
                        Do tell.

                                 ME
                        No... I’m just kidding.

           Sir Ben, if you’re still watching: acting school is over.
                                 HER
                        No, you weren’t. There’s totally a 
                        story there.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Don’t tell her. Don’t you do it.

                                 ME
                        I was eating Captain Crunch when I 
                        found out my mom left me.

                                 HER
                        Oh... And you’re holding a grudge.

                                 ME
                        I don’t know what else you’re 
                        supposed to do with grudges.

                                 HER
                        Unacceptable. Come on.

           She leads me to the greeting card aisle. 

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Help me find a birthday card.

           She picks one up.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                            (reading)
                        “To my dearest daughter - May you 
                        live all the days of your life. 
                        Happy birthday.”

           I grab one. 

                                 ME
                            (reading)
                        “If Christmas isn’t in your heart, 
                        you’ll never find it under a tree.”
                            (beat)
                        Happy birthday.

                                 HER
                        This is not a joke.

                                 ME
                        Whose birthday is it?

                                 HER
                        Mine.

           I hand over the card.

                                 ME
                        Surprise! Happy birthday!

           She opens it up and feigns surprise--

                                 HER
                        What, no cash? You cheap asshole.

                                 ME
                        Buying a card for yourself is kind 
                        of depressing. Maybe you should get 
                        one of the “cheer up” ones.
           She pauses the pause that comes before something heavy.

                                 HER
                        There’s something I haven’t told 
                        you.

                                 ME
                        That you live on the right side of 
                        your complex? Because I could have 
                        used that information earlier.

           She looks away.

                                 HER
                        When I was little... like real 
                        little... my father killed himself 
                        a couple days before my birthday.

                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                                                          ME
           Jesus.
                                             Jesus.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        But then, on my birthday, I got a 
                        card from him. He’d sent it before 
                        he died. The card said he was 
                        sorry, and that he loved me.

           She is crying a little, but hiding it well.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Love sure is fucked up sometimes.

           She composes herself.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        So now, every year on my birthday, 
                        I pick out a card that I think he 
                        would get me and I sign it for him.

           She looks at ME. I am speechless.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I want to scream at the top of my 
                        lungs that as long as I have breath 
                        I would never let anything hurt her.

           I walk towards HER.

                                 NARRATOR  (V.O.)
                        But I don’t. Because those are only 
                        words. 

           I reach HER and take the card from her hand.

                                 NARRATOR  (V.O.)
                        And words are bullshit. Trust me, 
                        I’m a writer. 

           I look into her glassy eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The only thing that really speaks 
                        in this world is action.

           I kiss HER. It’s awkward and passionate.
           INT. CULVER ICE ARENA - DAY

           LYLE ice skates backwards, facing ME and SCOTT. 

                                 LYLE
                        What did her tongue feel like?

           He has no idea that SAMSON is about to--

           SLAM! Bodycheck him into the wall.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit, Samson! Quit it! I’m 
                        trying to hear this.

           LYLE recovers.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                            (to Me)
                        So, that was it? You just kissed 
                        her and took her home?

           SLAM! MALLORY bodychecks Lyle, knocking him on his ass.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        You guys are assholes!

                                 MALLORY
                        I’m a girl, that couldn’t hurt!

           LYLE gets back to his feet.

                                 SAMSON
                            (to Me)
                        So, no boobs, no bones?

                                 ME
                        It wasn’t that kind of kiss. It was 
                        emotional, but it wasn’t about sex. 

                                 LYLE
                        I don’t know what that means.

                                 ME
                        What’s wrong with me? I’ve never not 
                        been able to get a girl out of my 
                        head before. 

                                 SAMSON
                        Are you ready to have a real 
                        conversation about this, without 
                        you freaking out again?

           I nod.

                                 SAMSON (CONT’D)
                        You two are way off course. If you 
                        don’t fuck soon, you’re going to 
                        fuck it up for both of you.

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t listen to him. You do not 
                        want to be the other man.

                                 SAMSON
                        Sexual tension clouds a man’s 
                        thinking. The dick takes over and 
                        the brain shuts off. 
                                 SCOTT
                        That’s terrible advice. You’re gonna 
                        end up hurting one or both of you.

                                 SAMSON
                        This is Writing 101: Women need 
                        romance, men need climax. That’s 
                        why chicks like chick flicks and 
                        dudes like action. One good orgasm 
                        will answer all your questions.

                                 SCOTT
                        Questions? There’re no questions!

                                 SAMSON
                        You meet a girl, you like her, you 
                        have questions: Am I in love? Could 
                        I live without her? Is she the one? 

                                 MALLORY
                        Do men really think sex is the 
                        answer to everything?

                                 SAMSON
                        It’s a time-tested shortcut that 
                        dates back to the dawn of man. If 
                        you can forget a girl after fucking 
                        her, she’s forgettable. And if you 
                        can’t, then you have your answer.

                                 SCOTT
                        And where does that leave her? 

                                 SAMSON
                        She’s already kissed him. She’s got 
                        questions, too.
                            (to Me)
                        There’s this story about a serf...

           EXT. HILLSIDE - SAMSON’S STORY - DAY

           Since this is a SAMSON story, I have to expect it will be 
           weird and so I’m just going to start it in Black & White. I’m 
           dressed as some sort of SERF back in the 13?/16?/1500’s. Time 
           probably doesn’t matter. Think of it as a Fellini film.

           I look up to see, perched on a hill: HER dressed as a MAIDEN. 
           She’s with STUFFY. He’s down on one knee.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        The serf was in love with a maiden, 
                        but he never told her. And so she 
                        married another.

           The hill sprouts PEOPLE. STUFFY stands up and they’re at an 
           altar. Getting married.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        The serf vowed to never be a slave 
                        to love again.

           WOMAN after WOMAN approach ME AS A SERF.

                                 ME AS A SERF
                        No. No. No.
           I turn them away and each withers like a vampire in sunlight.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        He became a cold bastard.

           Ice crystals form on my face. I brush them off.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        He was unfulfilled. Empty.

           I open my serf coat, revealing a latch on my serf chest. 
           Inside is an empty compartment where my heart should be with 
           nothing but an ashtray full of smoldering cigarette butts.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        There had to be more. So he became 
                        a monk, looking for the divine.

           I shave a circular bald spot into the back of my head and put 
           on a brown monk cloak.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        He ran to the ends of the Earth 
                        searching for the spiritual 
                        fulfillment of the boundless, 
                        immutable everlasting.

           I run, but COLLIDE with a transparent wall. Through the wall, 
           nothing but emptiness stretching forever. Everything ZOOMS 
           OUT, the transparent wall becomes the atmosphere of the Earth.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        Then the monk serf looked inward. 
                        He sought tranquility through 
                        meditation and communion with his 
                        surroundings.

           On a mountain top, I sit Indian style in my serf monk outfit 
           next to a mountain goat, also sitting Indian style.

                                 ME AS A SERF MONK
                        Ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        And after many years had passed...

           The hair around my bald spot turns salt and pepper, and then 
           stark white.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        ... And he had finally cleared his 
                        mind of all earthly thoughts, he 
                        stood up.

           I stand up. The mountain goat stands up.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        And opened his mouth for the first 
                        word that popped into his mind. 

           The mountain goat looks at ME AS A SERF MONK, expectantly.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        And it was...
                    ME AS A SERF MONK
                                                    SAMSON (V.O.)
           Her name.
                                             Her name.

           I blink. Unsure what to do. The mountain goat YAWNS.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        Ooh... It’s kind of like that 
                        astronaut.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        Lyle, I’m telling a fucking story.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        But it’s the same story, because 
                        there was that astronaut.

           Gravity disappears and I start floating. I put on a space 
           helmet to breathe. I float up next to a spaceship and climb 
           into the side door.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        He was Russian, I believe.

           A bottle of vodka floats by my astronaut head.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        He was in love with a mistress of 
                        the tsar or president or someone. 
                        So, he joined a mission to the space 
                        station so he could forget her.

           I look at a picture of HER AS A RUSSIAN, next to STUFFY AS A 
           RUSSIAN TSAR. I tear up the picture.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        Only, he never could. He was stuck 
                        alone in space by himself, going 
                        crazy thinking about her.

           I try to tape the picture back together. I tear it up again.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        Just floating out in space, no 
                        spaceship, no space station, 
                        nothing.

           I step out the side door of the spaceship, floating off.

                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        That’s it? Do any of your stories 
                        have a proper ending?

           The torn pieces of HER picture float around me. The mountain 
           goat swims by, eating the pieces.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        Well... he’ll probably run out of 
                        oxygen at some point. And die. 
                        So... that’s kind of an ending.

           I open a latch in my astronaut chest, only to find more 
           infinite space inside.
                                 SAMSON (V.O.)
                        The point of my story, is that you 
                        can’t just forget someone. You have 
                        to answer the question.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        Mine, too. Answer the question or 
                        you suffocate in space.

           INT. MY APARTMENT - NIGHT

           I flip channels. Bored out of my mind.

           ON TV - A Korean soap opera.

           FLIP - A nature doc on how the Abdulali Wrinkled Frog mates.

           FLIP - A MAN looks at me compassionately from the TV.

                                 TV MAN
                        Are you lonely? Are you cold? Do 
                        you just wish you could disappear?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Yes.

                                 TV MAN
                        Then try: The Burkuddler. 

           An image of SOMEONE on a couch wearing a Burka-blanket combo.

                                 TV MAN (CONT’D)
                        Just call this number.

           The number haunts me from the screen. I look at the phone. 
           Considering: TV. Phone. TV. Phone.

                                 ME
                        No.

           I turn the TV off and in the black screen I see my ASTRONAUT 
           SELF, suffocating. I realize I’m not breathing. Suddenly--

           My phone VIBRATES. I GASP for breath, and answer.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Hi...

                                 HER (O.S.)
                        I need to talk. Are you busy?

           In the TV screen my ASTRONAUT SELF pleads with his eyes.

           INT. NORM’S DINER - NIGHT

           We stare at each other over a cup of coffee.

                                 HER
                        This friend thing has kind of 
                        gotten off track.

                                 ME
                        It was the kiss, wasn’t it?
                                 HER
                        It’s sort of everything. I think my 
                        boyfriend knows something’s up. 
                        We’ve been fighting nonstop.

                                 ME
                        So... it was a good kiss?

                                 HER
                        We can’t keep doing this.

                                 ME
                        You think we should just have sex 
                        and get it out of our system?

           She almost chokes on her coffee on that one.

                                 HER
                        We’re not having sex!

                                 ME
                        Well, you’re not offering any 
                        solutions! I’m just being helpful!

                                 HER
                        To yourself! How does you getting 
                        laid help me?

                                 ME
                        I’ve explored every other option: I 
                        can’t just be friends. I won’t get 
                        a sex change. And I refuse to join 
                        a monastery or die out in space. 

                                 HER
                        How are those the only options?

                                 ME
                        Well... I’m open to suggestions.

                                 HER
                        I got nothing. But that does not 
                        mean sex.

                                 ME
                        I’m just saying that if this thing 
                        between us is nothing... if it’s 
                        some sort of infatuation, then 
                        maybe sex will cure it. 

                                 HER
                        And if it’s not? 

                                 ME
                        Wouldn’t we want to know?

                                 HER
                        No! It’s not that simple. Sex 
                        doesn’t “cure” anything for women.  

                                 ME
                        But what if it’s good sex?

           Our WAITER stops by.

                                 HER
                        Stop it. 
                                 WAITER
                        So what will it be?

                                 HER
                            (more to Me than him)
                        I think we need some cold turkey.

                                 ME
                        I don’t want cold turkey. I want a 
                        hot open-faced sandwich. 

                                 HER
                        No. Nothing hot.

                                 ME
                        I want something steamy, like soup.

                                 HER
                        No, you can have gazpacho. 

                                 WAITER
                        We don’t do gazpacho... the menus 
                        are right there...

                                 ME
                        Fine. Something cold it is... But 
                        it’s gonna be sweet and a little 
                        bad for you.

           She narrows her eyes.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                            (to the Waiter)
                        Ice cream.

                                 WAITER
                        We’re all out of ice cream.

                                 ME
                        Of course you are. 

                                 WAITER
                            (not sorry)
                        Sorry, dude.

           She thinks for a second. 

                                 HER
                        Can we get two bowls of ice, two 
                        empty glasses, a bunch of creamer 
                        cups, jelly and some whipped cream?

                                 WAITER
                        Whatever.

           He wanders off.

                                 ME
                        If you’re broke, I can buy you real 
                        food. You don’t have to eat 
                        condiments.

                                 HER
                        Shh. Don’t talk. Just do what I do.

           The WAITER brings HER the stuff.
           She mixes ice and salt in one of the empty cups, dropping in 
           some little unopened creamer cups. I follow suit with my 
           empty cup. We cover our cups and shake them to mix it all 
           together. We pull out the creamer cups, open them up.

                                 ME
                        Mine are frozen.

                                 HER
                        That’s the point.

           We scoop out the frozen creamer into the bowls and mix in 
           packets of strawberry jelly. She tops it with whipped cream.

                                 HER (CONT’D)
                        Voila. Ice cream.

           I take a bite.

                                 ME
                        Not bad.

           She smiles and it almost melts my ice cream.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        This was fun.

                                 HER
                        Yeah.

                                 ME
                        So... cold fucking turkey...

           She scoops out a bit of ice cream and accidentally gets 
           whipped cream on the tip of her nose. It’s too fucking cute. 
           We stare at each other... The whipped cream calling to me.

                        And just like that... It’s on.

           INT. HER APARTMENT - LATER

           GANGSTA RAP MUSIC kicks in. She looks into me. My heart beats 
           so fast. It feels like--

           INSIDE MY CHEST: MY HEART, cigarette dangling from his lips, 
           is a MERCENARY shooting a machine gun that fires out hundreds 
           of those Amethyst Woodstar Hummingbirds. 

           BACK TO HER ROOM: We’re all over each other, hard kisses that 
           break things. We fall on her bed.

                                 ME
                        Wait.

           The Gansta Rap stops. 

                                 HER
                        What?

                                 ME
                        I just want to do this right.

           I lean in again as the Gangsta Rap is replaced with one of 
           those indie songs that makes everything feel like the movie 
           “Days of Heaven.” 
           This is two people using their fucking like a wrench to 
           unbolt their souls from their bodies. It’s tasteful.

                        One thing I learned is that when 
                        you orgasm from making love to 
                        someone you actually care about, 
                        you don’t feel guilty. You feel...

           We lock eyes. Her pupils widen enough to swallow the world, 
           then pulse.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Absolute forgiveness. 

           Our bodies collapse as we catch our breath.

                                 ME
                        So.

                                 HER
                        So.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And sometimes it’s necessary to 
                        forgive each other more than once. 

           She looks me over, then climbs on top of me as the Gangsta 
           Rap KICKS BACK IN.

           INT. HER APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           My eyes pop open and I roll over: Yup, she’s still there. It 
           wasn’t a dream. 

           I stretch my shit out and YAWN, looking and feeling 
           refreshed. Her eyes pop open.

                                 ME
                        Good morning.

                                 HER
                        Ugggh. Don’t tell me you’re a 
                        fucking morning person.

                                 ME
                        Not traditionally. But today I feel 
                        good. You wanna get some breakfast?

                                 HER
                        Breakfast? 

                                 ME
                        Yeah. Come on. I know a great spot.

                                 HER
                        Oh, fuck you, morning person.

           She rolls over.

                                 ME
                        Or, I could make you something. Do 
                        you have eggs and stuff?

           She MOANS something incoherent.
           INT. HER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           I claw through the cupboards. Nothing but sugar cereals.

           I pause. Staring back at me from the cupboard is the face of 
           my old nemesis: Captain Crunch. Only he doesn’t look so 
           menacing anymore. I open the box, grab a handful and pop it 
           in my mouth.

           INT. HER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           I enter with the Captain Crunch.

                                 ME
                        I couldn’t even look at this stuff 
                        before last night. Now look at me.

           She opens her eyes to look and then rolls back over.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you see what this means? 

           She sits up. Looks at me solemnly. Weighing her thoughts.

                                 HER
                        I hope you don’t think it means... 
                        “something.”

                                 ME
                        Of course it means “something.” You 
                        feel it, too. I can see it.

                                 HER
                        Yes, I feel... something. But...

                                 ME
                        But what?

                                 HER
                        I told you last night, we can’t 
                        keep doing this.

                                 ME
                        But... then we had sex. That 
                        changes everything. You can’t tell 
                        me you don’t feel different.

                                 HER
                        Yeah, but it always feels this way 
                        at first. Like with my boyfriend. 
                        And all the guys before him. 

                                 ME
                        Wait... when you say “all the guys,” 
                        does a number pop in your head?

                                 HER
                        Jesus, that’s not the point.

                                 ME
                        The point is you don’t feel that 
                        with them anymore. You feel that 
                        way with me. Here. Today. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Seriously, though, what does she 
                        mean by “all the guys before him?”

                                 HER
                        But if you start to think this 
                        feeling that you have with every new 
                        person who comes along is “love,” 
                        then it no longer means anything. 
                        It’s not some sort of special, true, 
                        real love. It’s just... ordinary.

                                 ME
                        Ordinary? You thought last night 
                        was ordinary?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Does she mean like allll three guys?

                                 HER
                        No, no, no. Last night was amazing. 
                        Please don’t take it like that. I 
                        just don’t want to confuse anything. 
                        What I meant was: How many new 
                        “you’s” are there out there? 

                                 ME
                        There’s only one me, I hope. I try 
                        to always wear a condom. 

                                 HER
                        But what about the next guy after 
                        you? Is that gonna be “love,” too?

                                 ME
                        Next guy? There’s a fucking next 
                        guy already?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Or does she mean like “all” as in 
                        “I can’t remember all of them 
                        because they were wearing costumes 
                        and coming at me two at a time?”

           Her ALARM SOUNDS. She punches the button to turn it off.

                                 HER
                        There’s no next guy. The 
                        metaphorical next love. I just 
                        don’t know what to believe in. And 
                        now I have to go meet my boyfriend 
                        for lunch.

           She gets up and pulls some pants on.

                                 ME
                        Are you going to tell him about us?

                                 HER
                        No!

                                 ME
                        What, I have to tell him?
                                 HER
                        Tell him what? That I fucked some 
                        philanthropist because my life is a 
                        mess? That I have doubts about who 
                        I am and what I want? That I’m 
                        confused by the whole idea of love?

                                 ME
                        Hey, you’re the only one throwing 
                        the love word around. I thought we 
                        were just enjoying each other. 

           I pull on the rest of my own clothes.

                                 HER
                        If that’s all it is to you, why are 
                        we having this conversation?

                                 ME
                        I don’t know! I thought we had fun, 
                        but you’re telling me it was 
                        ordinary. I thought you were 
                        special, but I guess I was wrong. I 
                        guess you’re forgettable. 

           I slam the box of Captain Crunch into her trash can and storm 
           out, letting this gem echo as I go--

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy “all” your next guys.

           EXT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD PLAYHOUSE - NIGHT

           A small door plastered with a PLAYBILL reading: One night 
           only: Mallory Thomas in “I Used To Think Love Was Blind, But 
           Now I Think It’s Just Ignoring Me.”

                                 MALLORY (O.S.)
                        I want him to crawl inside my vagina 
                        like an underground missile silo, 
                        where we’ll make love until we’re 
                        famished and eat all the rations.

           INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD PLAYHOUSE - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           MALLORY performs to an almost empty house: It’s ME, SAMSON, 
           LYLE, SCOTT, and one OTHER DUDE a couple rows back. The OTHER 
           DUDE gets up to leave. SAMSON notices.

                                 SAMSON
                        Hey! Sit down! Don’t you know it’s 
                        rude to leave in the middle of a 
                        performance?

                                 OTHER DUDE
                        It’s not like that... I just have 
                        really bad gas.

                                 SAMSON
                        I don’t care. Sit the fuck down 
                        before I rip your jaw off and wear 
                        it like a tiara.

           OTHER DUDE heads back towards his seat.
                                 SAMSON (CONT’D)
                        Not there. Sit up here with us.

           OTHER DUDE sits next to ME.

                                 SAMSON (CONT’D)
                        There.

           LATER

                                 MALLORY
                        My ovaries became like abandoned 
                        potatoes in a basement and started 
                        growing legs and arms and forming 
                        political parties. 

           OTHER DUDE wasn’t lying. Because he, LYLE, SCOTT and I all 
           have our noses tucked down into our shirts. Not SAMSON. He 
           watches the show with a big smile on his face.

           INT. RESIDUALS BAR - LATER

           ALL OF US from the play, including OTHER DUDE have a beer.

                                 OTHER DUDE
                        Sounds like you gotta give her some 
                        space. You’re crowding her.

                                 MALLORY
                        Shut up. You don’t get to talk.

                                 SAMSON
                        I think dude’s got a point.

                                 ME
                        You’re the one who told me sleeping 
                        with her was the only way!

                                 SAMSON
                        No, I said sleeping with her would 
                        answer the question. I didn’t tell 
                        you to freak out and get “needy.”

                                 ME
                        I’m not needy. We had a connection.

                                 SAMSON
                        Dude, if you slept with a chick for 
                        the first time and the next morning 
                        she wanted you to rearrange your 
                        life, what would you do?

                                 ME
                            (realizing)
                        Fuck me. I am needy.

                                 OTHER DUDE
                        You better fix that shit stat. 

           A FLASH IN MY MIND: Mallory’s car. The headshot above her 
           driver’s side door. It’s OTHER DUDE’s face. 

           I raise my eyebrow at MALLORY. She averts her eyes.
           EXT. RESIDUALS BAR - LATER

           I pull out my phone as I walk to my car and dial HER up.

                                 HER (O.S.)
                        This better be good.

                                 ME
                        Truce lunch?

                                 HER (O.S.)
                        Are we at war?

           EXT. THE GROVE - SOME RESTAURANT PATIO - AFTERNOON

           I’m sitting at lunch with HER.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ok. Just be cool. Calm. Flip, even.

                                 ME
                            (none of the above)
                        I’m sorry about... you know. I was 
                        out of line. But - if I can explain 
                        myself - it seemed like you freaked 
                        out a little, and that freaked me 
                        out a little, which freaked you out 
                        even more. And then it was all a 
                        little freaky.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Or you can not listen to me at all.

                                 HER
                            (calm, cool... flip even)
                        I feel like you have this image of 
                        me in your head, like I'm this 
                        person that I'm not. This 
                        expectation of me that has nothing 
                        to do with the real me and that 
                        I’ll never be able to live up to.

                                 ME
                        If the expectations you have of me 
                        can't live up to the expectations I 
                        have of you, then you need to do 
                        some better expecting. And while 
                        you’re at it, add three inches.

                                 HER
                        I’m confused. Are we having a 
                        serious conversation?

                                 ME
                        It just seems like the universe is 
                        pushing me in a direction. For 
                        example, y’know how when people are 
                        telling you stories about a breakup 
                        or their cat dying or whatever? 
                        Well, I do this thing where I 
                        imagine myself acting out the 
                        stories, to keep from getting bored. 
                        But now, I can’t do it without you 
                        being in the stories, too. Is this 
                        making sense?
                                 HER
                        So... basically whenever someone’s 
                        telling you their own deeply 
                        personal or painful stories, you 
                        cut them out and insert yourself? 

                                 ME
                        Ok, with that spin it sounds...

                                 HER
                        That’s the most narcissistic thing 
                        I’ve ever heard.

                                 ME
                        But you’re in there, too! So, it’s 
                        sort of all about you if you think 
                        about it. 

           Over her shoulder, I see a face I don’t want to see: HEDGE 
           FUNDER approaching.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Shit.

           I try to hide behind HER, but he’s spotted me. 

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        Hey! I thought that was you. Where 
                        have you been? I haven’t seen you 
                        at any of the monkey dinners.

                                 ME
                        Yeah... my schedule’s been crazy.

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        Yeah, so then I went to Assist-a-
                        Sister’s craft sale and thought for 
                        sure you’d be there. But when I 
                        asked the event coordinator, she 
                        said she’d never even heard of you.

                                 ME
                        Yeah, uh...

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        And I was like, ‘screw that, sister. 
                        He’s on the board of directors.’ But 
                        her business card said she was on 
                        the board of directors. 

           I look from HER to him and back.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I would have ran, but this guy’s 
                        Fun Run times are off the chart.

                                 ME
                        Ok. See... uh...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Liar’s block. It’s like writer’s 
                        block, but for shitheads. And it 
                        feels roughly equivalent to being 
                        slapped in the face by a large, 
                        misshapen prison dick.
                                 ME
                        I’m not technically as involved... 
                        in the charity world... as I may 
                        have led you to believe.

           She frowns.

                                 HER
                        What does that mean? Aren’t you 
                        like a full-time charity worker?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Questions. They will only lead to 
                        more questions.

                                 ME
                        Charity events don’t pay the bills. 
                        I mean, I go when I can, but not as 
                        often as I’d like to go. Or... 
                        claim to.

                                 HER
                        So... what do you do, then?

                                 ME
                        I’m a writer.

                                 HER
                        You make up stories for a living.

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        You’ve been lying this whole time? 

                                 ME
                        Don’t think about it like that.
                            (beat)
                        Although, it’s technically accurate.

                                 HEDGE FUNDER
                        Africa? The rain forest? The frogs? 

           HEDGE FUNDER snatches my drink off the table.

                                 HEDGE FUNDER (CONT’D)
                        I wanna throw your drink in your 
                        face so bad...

           HEDGE FUNDER shakes his head. Disgusted. He pours my drink 
           slowly and deliberately into a nearby plant and huffs off.

                                 ME
                        I did help with the frogs!

           I turn to HER. She looks like she just survived a bomb blast.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        I did. I met a frog scientist at an 
                        event and he was this total nerd. 
                        But we got to talking about some of 
                        my theories on group sex... mating 
                        theories. Simple stuff really...

                                 HER
                        I don’t care about the frogs!
                                 ME
                        Is it the lying?

           She stands up, which I assume is a “yes.”

                                 HER
                        I don’t even know who you are! How 
                        could you expect me to feel 
                        anything real for you, if it’s all 
                        based on make believe?

                                 ME
                        You know me! As a person. Just not 
                        all the little white facts.

           She picks up her purse.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Please give me a chance to explain.

                                 HER
                        Didn’t you just explain?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She had me there.

                                 ME
                        We can’t just leave here mad.

                                 HER
                        I’m not mad. I’m... depleted.

           I can only watch her go.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They say, “the truth will set you 
                        free.” But I didn’t want to be 
                        free. I wanted us to be tied 
                        together and thrown into the ocean.

           EXT. CITY - SIDEWALKS AND SHIT - LATER

           I’m walking through the universe.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They also like to say, “there’s 
                        someone for everyone.” And as much 
                        as you may think that’s right--

           I see the most awkward looking LOSER LONER DUDE.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        -- You can always find that one 
                        person out there who’s so offensive 
                        to the natural order of things that 
                        you realize it can’t be true. But 
                        then suddenly--

           An even more awkward looking LOSER LONER GIRL meets up with 
           the LOSER LONER DUDE. He kisses her hand and they walk off.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        -- You’re wrong again.

           I watch them with a look of horror mixed with disbelief.
                                 NARRATOR
                        And then everywhere you look is 
                        like googling “Awkward Engagement 
                        Photos.”

           All around me, it’s nothing but strange couples: A SIX FOOT 
           GIRL holds hands with a MEXICAN HIPSTER... A COWBOY wearing a 
           suit that looks like the American flag caresses a SMALL ASIAN 
           WOMAN... TWO TINY BEETLES on a flower mount each other like 
           prison inmates.  

           I look up and see my reflection in a store front window.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And you realize you’re wrong a 
                        third time. You’re that one person. 
                        The exception. There’s someone for 
                        everyone. Everyone except you.

           INT. MY APARTMENT - EVENING

           I stare at my phone.

                                 ME
                        No.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        You’re lying to yourself.

                                 ME
                        Fine.

           I call HER. VOICEMAIL.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        It’s me. Please call me back.

           The other line BLINKS. It’s BRYAN. I answer.

                                 BRYAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, so... I read the pages you 
                        sent me. There’s, uh... some weird 
                        stuff in there. Let’s do drinks. 

                                 ME
                        Not now. I’m going through some 
                        stuff.

                                 BRYAN (O.S.)
                        You sound down? Is everything ok?

                                 ME
                        I don’t know.

                                 BRYAN (O.S.)
                        Sounds like you could... use a 
                        drink?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Damn. I just got agented.
           INT. HEMINGWAY’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           It’s a swanky spot filled with books and drinks named after 
           Hemingway’s works. BRYAN plops down across from ME. I have a 
           sampling of cocktails. 

                                 ME
                        I mixed The Old Man and the Sea, 
                        with a Garden of Eden and A Death 
                        in the Afternoon. Do you know what 
                        that makes? 

                                 BRYAN
                        A headache?

                                 ME
                        A shotgun suicide.

                                 BRYAN
                        Haha.
                            (beat)
                        I don’t get it.

           I can only EXHALE loudly and obnoxiously. 

                                 BRYAN (CONT’D)
                        You look like hell. Are you like 
                        one of those method writers?

                                 ME
                        I’m a fraud. 

                                 BRYAN
                        Don’t go to the dark place. Rom-
                        coms are supposed to be fun. 

           BRYAN grabs a bar napkin and sketches out some stick figures.

                                 BRYAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not that hard: Boy meets girl, 
                        shit happens, boy fucks girl. 
                        Happily ever after.

           He draws three panels for his stick figures: a meeting, an 
           explosion, a stick figure 69.

                                 ME
                        That’s not how the world works. 
                        It’s a fucking mess. And you didn’t 
                        even put hair on the girl, I can’t 
                        tell which one is the dude.

           BRYAN moves the napkins awkwardly.

                                 BRYAN
                        I don’t fucking know. Just keep it 
                        simple. You’ll crack it.

                                 ME
                        It always seems simple, doesn’t it? 
                        In our minds. But we try to put it 
                        out there in the world and it gets 
                        fucked up. You can’t even draw love 
                        on a piece of paper without it 
                        ending up two dudes sixty-nining.

           BRYAN is suddenly a little uncomfortable, I don’t see it 
           because I’m in a big abyss, but you notice it.
                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you sick of hiding behind 
                        all the lies?

                                 BRYAN
                        Lies?

                                 ME
                        The lies we sell each other about 
                        who we are and how we’re supposed 
                        to live. Trying to live up to them 
                        is eating our souls... like your 
                        two dudes eating each other out.

           BRYAN is nervous, but I still don’t see it.

                                 BRYAN
                        Who told you?

                                 ME
                        No one. I had to find out on my 
                        own. Isn’t that something?

           BRYAN takes a breath, leans in, and whispers--

                                 BRYAN
                        But I act straight, right?

                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
                                                          ME
           I’m sorry?
                                             What?

           BRYAN pulls back. He shrugs it off.

                                 BRYAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                           ME
                                                        BRYAN
           Are you--
                                             No.

                           ME
                                                        BRYAN
           But you just--
                                             No, I didn’t.

                                 ME
                        Bryan...

           We both look down to the table--

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        You’re holding my hand.

           BRYAN pulls his hand away.

                                 BRYAN
                        Of course I was holding your hand, 
                        because I’m your agent. I have to 
                        hold all of my clients’ hands.

                                 ME
                        Dude! Why are you lying to me?

                                 BRYAN
                        I don’t fucking know! I’m relating 
                        to you. My job is to motivate you. 
                                 ME
                        My best friend is gay, you don’t 
                        think I can handle it?

                                 BRYAN
                        Since I’ve known you, all you 
                        wanted to talk about was pussy, so 
                        I talk with you about pussy. I 
                        don’t have to be straight to talk 
                        about pussy, do I?

                                 ME
                        It helps.

                                 BRYAN
                        No offense, but you’re a talker. 
                        That’s how we relate. Other clients 
                        are listeners. It’s just not you.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That last part sounded gay, but I 
                        don’t think I should mention it.

                                 BRYAN
                        We cool?

                                 ME
                        Of course. I’m just dealing with my 
                        own relationship shit. 

                                 BRYAN
                        Say no more. There’s a Hollywood 
                        thing at the Roosevelt tonight. 
                        Poolside. As a gay man to a 
                        straight man, I think you should 
                        come with me and we’ll both hose 
                        down some tonsils. 

                                 ME
                        I don’t know if my heart’s in it.

                                 BRYAN
                        Fuck your heart, I’m talking about 
                        your dick. And that’s one thing I 
                        know way better than you do. I’ll 
                        email you notes on the script. Let’s 
                        just keep you out of the dark place.

           EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - POOL - LATER

           I pass by CUTE GIRL I fingered at the beginning, talking with 
           her FRIENDS. This is the end of a scene we’ve already seen. I 
           mount up to the bar. The BARTENDER eyes me.

                                 ME
                        Patron. Make it a double.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        So, here we are. Back at the start.

           I look at my fingers glistening, from fingering CUTE GIRL.

                                 ME
                        And a water.
           The BARTENDER serves up the drinks. I shoot the patron and 
           rinse my fingers in the water.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The truth is: I lied to you. I did 
                        feel bad about fingering that girl. 

           I wave the BARTENDER back over.

                                 ME
                        Again.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Not because she was cheating, but 
                        because I felt like I was cheating.

           The BARTENDER refills my patron. I slam it back.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But maybe that’s not even right. I 
                        honestly don’t know what I felt. 

           BRYAN comes up.

                                 ME
                        Hey. I think I’m gonna take off.

           BRYAN hugs me. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I was an emotional zombie, stumbling 
                        through the city with no purpose. A 
                        tin man with an empty chest.

           Over BRYAN’s shoulder, I spy: MY HEART, lying face down in 
           the pool, a la the opening scene of “Sunset Blvd.”

                                 BRYAN
                        Keep fighting the good fight.

           INT. LYLE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           LYLE takes off his shirt to audition a different one. Both 
           shirts have a shiny quality. 

                                 ME
                        Maybe she’s not the one. Maybe my 
                        instincts and my body and the whole 
                        universe are lying to me. I don’t 
                        even know what makes sense anymore.

                                 LYLE
                        A really good sign for me is when 
                        I’m surfing porn. If I keep trying 
                        to find girls that look like 
                        whoever I’m with, then, well that’s 
                        a good sign, right? 

           I shake off the thought.

                                 ME
                        What’s with all the shiny shirts?

                                 LYLE
                        I set up a “date” with one of those 
                        “Meet A Horny Neighbor” websites.
                                 ME
                        I thought we were hanging out!

                                 LYLE
                        We are. Don’t worry, this chick’s 
                        into DP. It said so on her profile.

                                 ME
                        Wait. I’m not--

           The doorbell RINGS. 

           LATER

           LYLE sits with his arms crossed, mad as hell. His HORNY 
           NEIGHBOR is crying.

                                 HORNY NEIGHBOR
                        And she chose him?

                                 ME
                        She didn’t choose me.

                                 HORNY NEIGHBOR
                        You have to go to her. Tell her how 
                        you feel.

                                 ME
                        She knows how I feel. 

                                 HORNY NEIGHBOR
                        But did you tell her you love her?

                                 ME
                        I don’t know if she believes in 
                        love. I don’t even know if I do.

                                 HORNY NEIGHBOR
                        That doesn’t matter. As long as you 
                        feel it.

           I think about that as LYLE taps my shoulder.

                                 LYLE
                        Can I talk with you at the door?

           AT THE DOOR

           LYLE opens the door and ushers me outside.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, but you’ve gotta go.

                                 ME
                        You’re kicking me out?

                                 LYLE
                        I’ve got needs and you’re need-
                        blocking me. At this point, I don’t 
                        even think I want you here as a 
                        cameraman. You should talk to 
                        Mallory. She loves talking about 
                        your issues.

           LYLE closes the door in my face.
           INT. MALLORY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           MALLORY lines up four tequila shots.

                                 MALLORY
                        Here’s to relationships.

                                 ME
                        No, thanks, Mal. Alcohol will just 
                        make me more depressed. 

                                 MALLORY
                        Suit yourself.

           She takes two of the shots, then bites a lime.

                                 ME
                        She won’t return my calls. She 
                        ignores my texts. Why are all girls 
                        so crazy? 

           MALLORY downs the other two shots. Winces.

                                 MALLORY
                        Men. Men make us crazy.

                                 ME
                        You know what I mean, right? You’re 
                        with this crazy person and they’re 
                        making you crazy, too, and you just 
                        want to shake them and make them 
                        see what you see.

                                 MALLORY
                        Yeah, I’ve been there.

           MALLORY pours herself some more shots.

                                 ME
                        How did you handle it?

                                 MALLORY
                        Me? Ha. I didn’t do anything.

                                 ME
                        Nothing? You must’ve done something. 
                        How strong were your feelings?

                                 MALLORY
                        Pretty strong. 

                                 ME
                        Not the dude from the play...

                                 MALLORY
                        No. He’s too needy. Some other guy.

                                 ME
                        If you had it to do all over again, 
                        would you tell him how you felt?

                                 MALLORY
                        I don’t know. It might hurt.
                                 ME
                        Yeah, but doesn’t it hurt now? And 
                        what if he felt the same way?

           MALLORY downs another shot. She looks at me.

                                 MALLORY
                        I love you.

                           ME
                                                   NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Sorry? 
                                             Oh, fuck.

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        I love you. I should have told you. 
                        I thought you knew.

                                 ME
                        Fuck, Mallory! I can’t deal with 
                        this right now.

                                 MALLORY
                        And that’s why I never told you.

           I guiltily grab a bottle of gin and rush out the door.

           EXT. LA RIVER - LATER

           I stumble along the concrete river bank, downing gin. 

           From out of the shadows, MY HEART appears with a shovel, and 
           CLOBBERS me in the back of the head.

           INT. MY APARTMENT - EARLY AFTERNOON

           My phone VIBRATES. More VIBRATING. A pile of clothes stirs in 
           a corner, then rises like a mountain emerging from the plains.

                                 ME (O.S.)
                        AhhhhhhhHHHHHHHH.

           My head pokes from under the mountain of clothes. Eyes half 
           shut, my hand stabs at the phone. Clicks “answer.”

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what time it is?

                                 HER (O.S.)
                        One-thirty. I need to tell you 
                        something.

           I finally open my eyes.

                                 ME
                        One-thirty post meridian?

           EXT. SANTA MONICA - BEACH - DAY

           We stroll along the Santa Monica Pier, hands in pockets. SOME 
           KIDS run by, LAUGHING in the sand and sun.
                                 ME
                        Don’t you miss how simple things 
                        used to be?

                                 HER
                        Were they? Or do we only remember 
                        the good things?

                                 ME
                        I remember bad things. But I prefer 
                        my highlight reel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        God, it’s a fucking sweet highlight 
                        reel, too. Now that I’m thinking 
                        about it, I really wish I had time 
                        to show you, but we’d miss too much 
                        important shit on the beach.

                                 HER
                        I need to tell you something.

           I cut HER off and square her up.

                                 ME
                        I love you.

           She SIGHS.

                                 HER
                        No, you don’t.

                                 ME
                        I’m not asking for your opinion. 
                        I’m telling you: I love you.

           A group of seagulls starts SQUAWKING nearby. Total mood 
           spoiling bastards.

                                 HER
                        Ok. Great for you. But I don’t. I 
                        don’t love anyone. 
                            (beat)
                        I’m not sure I ever will.

                                 ME
                        You don’t believe that. I know I 
                        screwed up.

                                 HER
                        It’s not just you. I doubted it 
                        before you. But everything that’s 
                        happened, it makes me realize that 
                        love is just a feeling. And 
                        feelings are too fleeting and 
                        insubstantial to mean anything.

                                 ME
                        But you do feel it. I know you do.

           The seagulls SQUAWK louder.

                                 HER
                        I’m engaged.

                                 ME
                        What?
           She looks me in the eye as she pulls her hand from her 
           pocket: a fucking diamond ring.

                                 HER
                        I finally gave him an answer.

                                 ME
                        Let me see...

           I take her hand as if to get a closer look, but pull the ring 
           from her finger. I fling it at the nearest seagull.

                                 HER
                        WHAT THE FUCK?!

                                 ME
                        Why would you do this? You don’t 
                        love him! You just said so!

           She punches me in the chest.

                                 HER
                        What is wrong with you?

                                 ME
                        I love you!

                                 HER
                        Stop saying that! You better find 
                        my fucking ring!

           She punches me again.

                                 ME
                        I’ll buy you a new one.

                                 HER
                        I swear to god if you make one more 
                        goddamn joke!

           My face FLUSHES.

                                 ME
                        I’ll find it! Jesus.

           I go sift through the sand.

                                 HER
                        I’m not fucking kidding.

                                 ME
                        Maybe if it was bigger it would be 
                        easier to find.

                                 HER
                        Really? You hear that a lot?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Burn.

           I see a GLINT of ring sparkling in the sunlight. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Fuck. My heart really hadn’t been 
                        in finding this thing.

           I pick it up.
                                 ME
                        Here. Here’s his stupid ring.

           She snatches it back. We look at each other, tempers boiling.

                                 HER
                        Why do you complicate everything?

                                 ME
                        I don’t want you to marry this guy!

                                 HER
                        It’s the best thing for everyone. 
                        Feelings fade. Love fades. You’ll 
                        see I’m right. We can’t control it, 
                        we can only try to make good choices 
                        and stick to them. I’m finally ready 
                        to do that. I need to do it. 

                                 ME
                        That’s all bullshit. Why now? Why 
                        this guy? Give me one good reason.

                                 HER
                        He’s handsome. He’s smart. He’s 
                        good in bed. He has a good job. 
                        What? What do you want to hear? 
                        What will make you understand?

                                 ME
                        That you love him.

           She puts his ring back on.

                                 HER
                        That’s not what you want to hear. 
                        You want to hear that I love you. 
                        But I can’t give you that.

           INT. VILLAIN’S TAVERN - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           SCOTT and I nurse beers in the corner. Some “band” drones on.

                                 ME
                        She won’t even listen to me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. That sucks, man.

                                 ME
                        I wanna put my face in a waffle 
                        iron, y’know? Or step in front of 
                        one of those maglev trains.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, you don’t.

                                 ME
                        You’re right. That’d be way too 
                        quick. What I really want is to go 
                        to a homeless shelter and gather 
                        all the STD’s I can find and make 
                        soup. Like an AIDS, crabs and 
                        hepatitis soup.

                        And then microwave it, to add in 
                        some cancer, and then just pour it 
                        straight into my lungs so I breathe 
                        it in, choking and gagging on AIDS 
                        and cancer.

                        Seriously? When you say shit like 
                        that, I want to kick your face in.

                                 ME
                        I wish you would.

                        Have you ever thought that you’re 
                        pitying yourself a little too much?

                                 ME
                        It’s not pity. I. Am. Hurt.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, but what about her? You put 
                        her in a tough place, too. Maybe if 
                        you really love her, you should let 
                        her go.

                                 ME
                        She’s going to marry a guy she 
                        doesn’t love. She put herself in a 
                        tough place.

                                 SCOTT
                        And you went after a girl who has a 
                        boyfriend. You did that to yourself.

                                 ME
                        Whose side are you on?

           SCOTT shakes his head.

                                 SCOTT
                        Do you ever get that crazy feeling 
                        when you’re up on a roof or in the 
                        front row of a theatre balcony, 
                        looking over the audience below, 
                        and you get the urge to just jump?

                                 ME
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m talking about this scary, 
                        exhilarating, paralyzing urge. 

                                 ME
                        Don’t try to “out suicidal” me.

                                 SCOTT
                        See, I know you’ve never gotten 
                        that urge. Cause if you did, you’d 
                        jump. That’s how you live your 
                        life: when you get crazy impulses, 
                        you see them through. It’s what 
                        I’ve always admired about you.

                        Just because you think she has that 
                        urge, doesn’t mean she’s ready or

                        an option, she sees as a danger. 

                                 ME
                        I really don’t need any of your 
                        romanticized metaphors. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m trying to help you see her side.

                                 ME
                        Oh, really? And you gained this 
                        insight from what relationship 
                        experience? You have none. Running 
                        around leaving some romance book 
                        for strangers to read doesn’t make 
                        you an expert on love.

                                 SCOTT
                        That book’s my art, man!

                                 ME
                        Nobody cares! I bet not even one 
                        person who found it ever read it!

                                 SCOTT
                        You never read it? You told me you 
                        read it!

           SCOTT makes a face where he purses his lips.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He was making the Scott face, which 
                        meant he was unreasonably upset.

                                 SCOTT
                        I can’t believe I’m just now 
                        realizing this.

                                 ME
                        Realizing what? Don’t make your 
                        Scott face. I’ll read it if it’s 
                        that important to you. I just never 
                        had the time.

                                 SCOTT
                        If it’s important to me? I got 
                        pinkeye from a charity dunk tank 
                        for you! You’re so fucking self-
                        absorbed. That book is my art!

                                 ME
                        You didn’t write it.

                                 SCOTT
                        It changed my life! It inspired me 
                        to write! It helped me accept 
                        myself! I’ve told you all of this!

                                 ME
                        I get that. But I’m going through 
                        some shit right now. My heart just 
                        got crushed. I think that’s a bit 
                        more important than some book you 
                        wanna blow.
                                 SCOTT
                        How long have I listened to you 
                        whine about this girl? And before 
                        that, it was all your vain and 
                        selfish stories about using girls 
                        and not giving a shit about anyone. 
                        And the whole time I thought we 
                        were coming from a place of 
                        understanding, of friendship. 

                                 ME
                        Come on, don’t do this.

                                 SCOTT
                        I see you run through Mallory and 
                        dismiss Lyle. You barely visit 
                        Granddad. I thought I was exempt. I 
                        thought I was the exception.

                                 ME
                        Seriously? You want to take it 
                        there over a book?

                                 SCOTT
                        Am I wrong? Have you ever really 
                        listened to me? 

                                 ME
                        I listen to you all the time!

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s the name of the book?

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)

                        Just kidding. Love and Cholera. No, 
                        wait, Love and the time of Cholera.

                                 SCOTT
                        Love in the time of Cholera.

                        Ninety-percent.

                                 SCOTT
                        The only thing I’ve ever asked you 
                        to do... in all the time I’ve known 
                        you... was read one fucking book. If 
                        you’re this much of a dick, how did 
                        you ever expect her to pick you?

           SCOTT gets up and leaves.

                                 ME
                        You didn’t write that book! And 
                        he’s my fucking granddad!
           EXT. PARK - DAY

           I’m at a birthday party for one of SAMSON’S KIDS. I spike my 
           punch, and talk to his KIDS.

                                 ME
                        You guys ever been in love?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        How do we know?

           I help the RUNTS onto a merry-go-round and spin it gently.

                                 ME
                        Love... it starts out like this.

           I spin a little faster.

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Weeee!

                                 ME
                        Yeah, weeee! Fun, right? But then...

           I spin it faster. They don’t look so happy anymore. 

                        LITTLE BOY
                                                     LITTLE GIRL
           Hey, stop.
                                             I want off.

           I spin it faster and faster.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        I know you do. But that’s the rub. 
                        You can’t. It’s out of your hands.

                        They need to know what’s coming.

           EXT. HER APARTMENT - NIGHT

           I stumble up the street, put my hand on the callbox and BUZZ 
           her place. I’m pretty fucking drunk at this point.

                                 ME
                        It’s me.
                                 HER (O.S.)
                        Jesus. Please go away.

           I step back and stare at her window.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        If I had a lowlight reel, this 
                        would be on there. More than once.

                                 ME
                        HEY! HEY! I wanna talk to you!

           I pick up a rock and lob it at the window, just as: Her head 
           pokes out.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Shit! Heads up!

           Luckily the rock misses HER.

                                 HER
                        Did you just throw a rock at me?

                                 ME
                        Not on purpose! You can’t marry 
                        him... I brought you reasons! 
                        First, you don’t love him. He’s so 
                        boooooring.

                                 HER
                        I don’t want you here!

                                 ME
                        Second, the sex is better with me. 
                        I have firsthand experience.

                            (calling back inside)
                        It’s no one.

                                 ME
                        It’s not no one! She’s lying! 
                            (to HER)
                        Third, he doesn’t like hearts. He 
                        hates museum hearts and he’ll hate 
                        San Francisco’s hearts and my 
                        heart... because my heart smokes.

           STUFFY appears.

                                 STUFFY
                        What’s going on out here?

                                 HER
                        Just go back inside.

                                 ME
                        Secondly, look at him! Your kids 
                        will look like that! I want your 
                        kids to look like us. But I would 
                        raise them either way...
                                 STUFFY
                        Hey man, I don’t know who you are, 
                        but can you leave us alone, please?

                                 ME
                        You leave us alone. What do you 
                        think you’re doing here?

                                 STUFFY
                        I’m packing, jackass. What are you 
                        doing?

                                 ME
                        Packing? 

                                 STUFFY
                        Do you want me to call the cops?

                                 ME
                        Only pussies call the cops. 

                                 HER
                        He’s drunk. Let’s just go inside.

                                 ME
                        Go inside. Go home. Go to hell.

                                 STUFFY
                        I swear to god, I’m gonna--

                                 ME
                        --Gonna what? Stand up there and 
                        talk me to death or come down here 
                        and stuff my balls in your mouth? 

                                 STUFFY
                        That’s fucking it.

                                 HER
                        Stop!

           She tries to grab him, but he disappears from the window. I 
           see some lattice and climb up to the window.

           As she pops her head back out, I am waiting for her.

                                 ME
                        Thirdly, I love you. There’s no one 
                        else. I’ve looked round and round.

           STUFFY comes storming out the front door. Looks for me, sees 
           me, starts jumping and swatting at my feet.

                                 STUFFY
                        You got a problem, punk? You want 
                        to harass me and my fiancee?

                                 ME
                        She doesn’t love you. She loves me.

           STUFFY runs back inside, and I drop back down.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        I can do this all night.

           But STUFFY tricked me and comes right back out.
                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Damn. That was smart. Let me show 
                        you what happens when you’re drunk.

           SPLIT SCREEN

           On the left side is what I think I am doing, and on the right 
           side is what I am actually doing.

           LEFT SIDE - I assume a perfect boxing stance. 

           RIGHT SIDE - I clumsily raise two limp fists.

           LEFT SIDE - STUFFY comes at me. I slip, bob and weave. I 
           punch: head, body, head. He gets in a shot or two, but he’s 
           taking quite the beating from me. 

           RIGHT SIDE - He CLOCKS ME across the face. I stumble and 
           spin, but I don’t go down. 

           LEFT SIDE - She rushes out. CHEERS me on!

           RIGHT SIDE - She rushes out. YELLS at us--

                                 HER
                        Stop it! Both of you!

           END SPLIT SCREEN and the right side takes over.

           I claw at STUFFY, miserably. He brushes off my hands, and 
           SLUGS ME in the gut. The force of the hit does not react well 
           with the whiskey--

           I VOMIT all over STUFFY.

                                 STUFFY
                        What the fuck? 

           He steps back, disgusted and a little afraid.

                                 STUFFY (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit! This shirt is Hugo Boss, 
                        fucker!

           He STOMPS back inside, grabbing HER as he passes.

                                 STUFFY (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           She lingers, staring at ME: pathetic, drunk, vomit-covered.

                                 HER
                        He asked me to move in with him. 
                        We’re going to elope in February.

           I grab her hand.

                                 ME
                        You hate me.

                                 HER
                        I don’t hate you. You no longer 
                        exist to me. I nothing you.
           She lets go of my hand. For symmetry we need to see that 
           three times.

           ONE: Our hands separate.

           TWO: Our fingers un-interlock.

           THREE: On the molecular level, my electrons return to my 
           atoms, as hers return to her atoms. Leaving me in total--

           BLACKNESS

           It’s like I don’t exist to anyone. Until--

                                 SCOTT (V.O.)
                        Wake up.

           INT. MY APARTMENT - LATE MORNING

           My eyes slowly take in light.

           SUPER: Suck Date Log: The Worst Day of My Life. Location: 
           Unknown. Forecast: Whatever.

           SCOTT’s there. He sees a mass of porn magazines laid out. All 
           have pictures with certain parts of the girls circled in red. 

           LITTLE LABELS pop up pointing out resemblances I found: “Her 
           eyes.” “Her mouth.” “Her right ankle.”

           SCOTT has a strange look on his face.

                                 ME
                        Scotty?

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey.

           I stretch out gingerly. My face and body hurt.

                                 ME
                        I hurt in some weird places. Did 
                        anything happen... between us?

                                 SCOTT
                        Fuck you, man. You have to get up.

                                 ME
                        Where are we going?

           SCOTT pauses.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        If there’s one universal law, 
                        beyond relativity and string theory 
                        and M theory, it’s this: Things can 
                        always get worse.

                                 SCOTT
                        Granddad died.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        From an etymological standpoint, I 
                        hate funerals. 
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           It’s a bright, shiny day.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s not just that there’s no “fun” 
                        in “funeral.” Although, they really 
                        are pretty joyless in my experience.

           They lower GRANDDAD’s coffin onto another coffin.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It’s terms like “funeral party.” As 
                        if there’s a vodka luge and a 
                        condom bowl? I wanna throw a 
                        funeral rager for the dumb fuck who 
                        thought that term up.

           There’s a joint headstone for both GRANDDAD and GRANDMOTHER. 
           They’re burying him on top of her.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And there’s a “wake.” Seriously? Wake? 
                        No, he fucking won’t. He’s fucking 
                        dead.

           SCOTT directs the CREW.

                                 SCOTT
                        Her head is over here? Then his 
                        head goes at that end, face down.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           My car moves mechanically through traffic.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        People. We’re a sad sack ADHD bunch. 

           INT. MY CAR - CONTINUOUS

           I stare ahead into traffic. Expressionless. Still in my 
           funeral “party” suit.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Yes, I’m fucking including you. Go 
                        on, check your iPhone. We’ll wait. 

           INT. MY APARTMENT - DAY

           I walk in, set my keys down. Stare around the apartment.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Here’s my beef: it’s impossible to 
                        always focus on the big picture. So 
                        death comes as a reminder. It grabs 
                        us, shakes us, opens our eyes. But 
                        death, like life, is fleeting.

           MY POV: The closet.

           I walk over to it.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The big picture only lasts a second and 
                        then it’s gone again. Our vision narrows 
                        and we focus back in on some small thing 
                        or another. As we are prone to do.

           I rummage through it. Settling on a brown parcel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But every now and again, our focus 
                        is changed. Shifted. Revised. And 
                        the small thing we now settle on is 
                        actually an important one.

           I tear open the brown parcel to reveal--

           MY POV: Love in the Time of Cholera.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        If you’re like me, and you are, 
                        then your life is about yourself. 
                        Is that selfish? Maybe. 

           I sit in my armchair with the book. I run my hands over the 
           cover, feeling the texture of an old, worn out story.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But our lives need connection with 
                        other people. And the emotional 
                        fulfillment that comes with it. 

           I crack the book and notice a handwritten inscription. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And that’s what Scott’s book was 
                        about, as it turns out.

                                 BOOK INSCRIPTION
                        To the Finder of This Book -- This 
                        book changed my life, so I wanted to 
                        share it with you. Reading it won’t 
                        change yours. But I bet there is 
                        something - a book... a song... a 
                        memory... a feeling - that has 
                        changed your life. And if you shared 
                        that with even one person, maybe 
                        they would share their beautiful 
                        thing, too. And then, wouldn’t we 
                        all have done something beautiful 
                        together? Finders keepers. --Scott

           I start reading.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I’m going to show you this in POV, 
                        because if you’re like me, and you 
                        are, then you’re selfishly gonna 
                        insert yourself in here anyway.

           EXT. BOAT - MY MIND - DAY

           OUR POV: The wide ocean, stretching out before me. 

           This whole story is seen from OUR SHARED POV.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The basic story is a guy loves a 
                        girl from the second he meets her, 
                        but they can’t get their shit 
                        together until the very end of 
                        their lives. 

           Looking around, we see: we’re on a boat.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They’re stuck on a boat with one 
                        other couple and realize the only 
                        way they can stay together is to 
                        never go to shore. So they raise the 
                        yellow cholera flag so no port will 
                        take them. And they stay together, 
                        adrift at sea until the end.

           We see: A yellow flag on a mast.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And it makes you realize, there are 
                        people in your life so important 
                        they dwarf everything else. It’s up 
                        to you to figure out who they are.

           We see: SCOTT. Dressed as a KOREAN. Smiling at us.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        If you had to give everything else 
                        up and spend the rest of your days 
                        on a boat, who are the must-haves?

           Past SCOTT we see: MALLORY IN DRAG... SAMSON AS A MONK... 
           LYLE AS DR. FRANKENSTEIN... BRYAN IN HIS SUIT...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Who could you not live without?

           We also see: GRANDDAD, happy and healthy in his DRESS NAVY 
           BLUES, at the wheel.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Figure out your own list. And then 
                        do everything you can to let them 
                        know how much they mean to you.

           Beyond everything we see: HER. Simple and radiant in the sun.

           INT. MY APARTMENT - DAY

           I pace. Back and forth. Is there another way? 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was time to get my life back on 
                        track. First up, I had to finish 
                        writing this script.

           I’m reading the script that I’ve been working on out loud. 
           Acting out the different personalities of the characters. To 
           make it easier, let’s do this in MONTAGE. Little captions pop 
           on the screen to let you know which character I am...
                                 ME AS BLACK FEMALE DETECTIVE 
                                 PERSONALITY
                        Just because I wear a badge doesn’t 
                        mean I can’t feel. A kiss can do 
                        more damage than a bullet... 

           I cover my wall in sticky notes, each with a story beat. 

                                 ME AS BITCH FRIEND PERSONALITY
                        ... It’s too late. He’s Heisman-ed 
                        you into the friend-zone, baby... 

           I move sticky notes around wildly. Like I’m trying to make a 
           puzzle work. 

                                 ME AS BLACK FEMALE DETECTIVE 
                                 PERSONALITY
                        ... It’s useless. She could never 
                        love us...

           I type.

                                 ME AS GAY FRIEND PERSONALITY
                        ... You’re just saying that because 
                        we’re crazy...

                                 ME AS BITCH FRIEND PERSONALITY
                        ... He’s no different than us, 
                        girl. Everyone has all these 
                        different faces to hide behind. It 
                        comes from our insecurities, hiding 
                        our true selves...

           I eat pizza.

                                 ME AS FEISTY HISPANIC PERSONALITY
                        ... Love is the same way. It keeps 
                        changing. One minute it’s a red, 
                        red rose, the next minute it’s a 
                        machete, then it’s a rebellious 
                        teen french kissing his 
                        girlfriend’s bubble gum mouth, then 
                        it’s an old couple who don’t even 
                        have to speak to each other because 
                        they understand each other’s 
                        smallest movements... 

           I move stickies around.

                                 ME AS BITCH FRIEND PERSONALITY
                        ... That’s why we can love each 
                        other. Because love is infinite, and 
                        we’re infinite, it embraces every 
                        part of us. All encompassing...

           I type.

                                 ME AS GAY FRIEND PERSONALITY
                        ... It’s like what they say “Love 
                        is a many splintered thing.”

                                 ME AS BITCH FRIEND PERSONALITY
                        It’s not “splintered.” It’s “love 
                        is a many splendored thing,” like: 
                        beautiful, magnificent, swanky. 
                        Splintered sounds painful.
                                 ME AS BLACK FEMALE DETECTIVE 
                                 PERSONALITY
                        Well, it’s that, too.

                                 ME 
                            (to myself)
                        Yeah. It’s that, too.

           I stare at the computer screen and type the most beautiful 
           words in the universe: “Fade It Out, Bitches.” 

           It’s so quiet. And the sun comes through my window like 
           Crayola’s wet dream.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I want to tell myself not to do 
                        what I‘m about to do. 

           I stir, look at my bed. I stand.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But I can’t. Sometimes my past self 
                        knows me better than I do.

           I crouch by the bed and reach under it. I grasp for 
           something. Pay dirt. I pull out a shoebox and open it, 
           shifting some dusty items until I see: The note my mother 
           left me. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Hey! Viewer! What’s that over there?

           My eyes start to water.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Didn’t fall for that, did you? So I 
                        guess you can see this--

           I CRY. It’s sweet and pathetic.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I don’t know what’s happening here.
                            (beat)
                        My Granddad just died. FYI.
                            (beat)
                        And my mom abandoned me.
                            (beat)
                        And finishing a screenplay is a 
                        really emotional thing.

           I WEEP, and there is some snot.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ok, that’s just disgusting.

           INT. VILLAGE IDIOT - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           A banner congratulates me on finishing my script. Everyone is 
           there: SCOTT; SAMSON and HIS WIFE; MALLORY and her friend 
           OTHER DUDE; LYLE and his HORNY NEIGHBOR; BRYAN. I walk 
           through, smiling, nodding, shaking hands.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Things were as right as they could 
                        be. Scott and I had made up...
                                 SCOTT
                        Y’know, Marquez wrote other books...

           SCOTT hands me One Hundred Years of Solitude.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t internalize the title and 
                        think I’m implying you’ll die 
                        alone. Just read it.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Mallory had finally decided to give 
                        her friend date a real shot.

           MALLORY turns to OTHER DUDE.

                                 MALLORY
                        I need a drink. 

           OTHER DUDE smiles.

                                 OTHER DUDE
                        Three shots of tequila, coming up.

                                 MALLORY
                        Go.

           MALLORY rolls her eyes and shrugs at me.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Samson and Lyle were up to their 
                        old antics.

           LYLE pulls SAMSON aside and points to his HORNY NEIGHBOR.

                                 LYLE
                        Dude, she’s totally into DP. How’s 
                        your wife as a camerawoman?

                                 SAMSON
                        Read my lips: my naked balls will 
                        never be in a room with your naked 
                        balls. That goes double if there’s 
                        thrusting and touching involved. I 
                        don’t know what could have led you 
                        to believe otherwise.

                                 LYLE
                        But think about what a great story 
                        this would make!

                                 SAMSON
                        Unlike your stories with no endings, 
                        this one won’t have a beginning... 
                        which is sort of an ending.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Bryan was elated that I’d finished 
                        the script.

           BRYAN approaches me.

                                 BRYAN
                        The producer called me again on my 
                        way over here. He loves it. Great 
                        work and not a moment too soon: 
                        they’ve moved the start date for 
                        RAINBOW 2: THE REVENGE up two weeks.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But even with my boat pretty full, 
                        there was still something missing. 
                        And the longer I tried to ignore 
                        it, the more the absence ripped 
                        cavities into my chest.

           BRYAN hands me an envelope.

                                 BRYAN
                        So, I wanted to personally give you 
                        a first class ticket to six weeks 
                        of first class Malaysian pussy. You 
                        fly out Saturday. 

           I smile, but my heart’s not in it. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Saturday. Her elopement was 
                        supposed to be Saturday.

                                 BRYAN
                        Didn’t I tell you I’d get you 
                        everything you wanted?

           BRYAN senses it.

                                 BRYAN (CONT’D)
                        What? Don’t get dark on me.

                                 ME
                        I’m not dark. It’s just funny: you 
                        don’t like pussy and I don’t like 
                        Malaysia.

                                 BRYAN
                        So, what, try for more money?

           I think about it as SCOTT walks over.

                                 ME
                        Have you two met? Bryan, this is my 
                        best friend, Scott.

                                 BRYAN
                        You the guy with the book art?

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure.

                                 BRYAN
                        That’s pretty cool. What are you 
                        doing hanging out with a dick like 
                        this guy?

                                 SCOTT
                        I have low self-esteem. Being 
                        around him makes me feel better 
                        about myself.

                                 BRYAN
                        Yeah. I started repping him when I 
                        realized how much more attractive I 
                        look standing next to him at 
                        industry parties.
           BRYAN and SCOTT share a moment.

                                 ME
                        I can see my work here is done.

           EXT. VILLAGE IDIOT - SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           I walk out to get some air. 

           I need a moment so keep your distance. You can watch this 
           through the window... 

           I notice MY HEART, smoking. He offers me a cigarette. I take 
           it. We have a heart to heart. 

           I’d tell you what we said, but that shit was personal. 

           INT. VILLAGE IDIOT - BACK ROOM - LATER

           SCOTT gets in front of the room.

                                 SCOTT
                        Attention, ladies and gentlemen. 
                        The time has come to toast the man 
                        of the hour. The man who we’ve all 
                        come to celebrate. My best friend.

           EVERYONE raises their wine glasses.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Unfortunately, he’s not here.

           PEOPLE look around, not having noticed my absence.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        He did, however, leave a note.

           SCOTT pulls a note from his pocket.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                            (reading)
                        “I love you all so much. But I have 
                        to go to San Francisco for a little 
                        while. Scott will take good care of 
                        you. Love, Me."

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I’m told they took it well.

           INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

           I sprint through the airport, trying to outrun the cliche. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

           I hail a cab. Hop in.

           INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS

           The CABBIE glances into the rearview at me.
                                 CABBIE
                        Where to?

                                 ME
                        Don’t you guys have a bunch of 
                        heart sculptures somewhere?

                                 CABBIE
                        Yeah, buddy. We got hearts. We got 
                        a hundred and thirty of them.

                                 ME
                        Awesome. Take me there.

                                 CABBIE
                        Which one?

                                 ME
                        All of them.

                                 CABBIE
                        Are you crazy or something?

                                 ME
                        Something. I am definitely 
                        something.

           The cab takes off.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - LATER

           I hop out of the cab and run to a nearby heart sculpture. I 
           look around for HER. Nothing. Back to the cab.

           INT. CAB - MOMENTS LATER

           I hop in to see a TOURIST COUPLE in the cab.

                                 ME
                        Hey, sorry this cab is taken.

                                 TOURIST COUPLE GUY
                        Oh, we know. Gabriel--
                            (re: Cabbie)
                        --Told us what you’re doing. 

                                 TOURIST COUPLE GIRL
                        We want to see all the hearts, too.

                                 ME
                        It’s not just that. Uh.
                            (to Gabriel)
                        The next one please.
                            (to Couple)
                        See, there’s this girl...

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - LATER

           Another heart. Still no sign of HER. I accost a BYSTANDER.

                                 ME
                        Hey, you didn’t happen to see a 
                        wedding, or a girl with you know... 
                        just perfect.
                                 BYSTANDER
                        I’ll see what you want me to see 
                        for fifty bucks.

           The COUPLE snaps a picture by the heart.

                                 ME
                            (to Couple)
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - LATER

           The cab pulls up near a trail.

                                 GABRIEL
                        There’s a bunch of them along this 
                        trail.

           The COUPLE and I take off down the trail. I search each face 
           I cross, and question anyone that is standing still. 

           A group of SKATEBOARDERS look interested.

                                 SKATEBOARDER KID
                        Wait. You’re gonna bust up some 
                        dude’s wedding?

           He turns back to his GANG.

                                 SKATEBOARDER KID (CONT’D)
                        Yo, this dude’s gonna bust up a 
                        wedding. Hell, yeah.

           An ARTISTIC KID overhears and brightens up.

                                 ARTISTIC KID
                        Can I take pictures of this?

           I begin to amass a following.

           MONTAGE OF HEARTS 

           The sun moves across the sky, as each heart’s shadow 
           stretches across the ground... A PERSON calls their friend 
           who lives by a heart, they run out to look for HER... ANOTHER 
           PERSON tweets people to look for HER at the heart sculptures.

           The heart sculptures become a blur: One is a heart-shaped 
           spool of thread unwinding, one is a mosaic, one is a cut-
           along-the-dotted-line.

           A TV IN A WINDOW - plays a news story of our growing search.

           A HOTEL - I enter and search the heart by the lobby: no dice.

           The sun gets lower, and so does everyone else’s spirits. 

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET

           We pull up to the Golden Gate Bridge. I hop out.
                                 GABRIEL
                        The last one’s just over that hill.

                                 ME
                        She has to be here!

           The CROWD that has been following me is apprehensive. They 
           make me go by myself. 

           I walk over the hill and disappear from their sight. They 
           wait, nervously.

           Beat.

           I walk back over the hill, and hang my head.

                                 BYSTANDER
                        Bitch.

                                 TOURIST COUPLE GUY
                        Whore.

                                 ME
                        Guys, guys. Sometimes things just 
                        don’t work out. I’m sure I’ll learn 
                        something one day from all this. 
                        Become a better person... Or some 
                        shit.

           I look across the water and see: A giant Bow and Arrow 
           sculpture stuck into the ground.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Gabriel. What’s that?

                                 GABRIEL
                        That’s cupid’s bow.

                                 ME
                        How come we didn’t go there?

                                 GABRIEL
                        You specifically said heart 
                        sculptures. That’s not a heart.

           I have a sudden flush of hope.

                                 ME
                        But it’s pointed at the heart, 
                        Gabby! 

           The Crowd stirs. I take off running for it. 

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Some of the CROWD runs with me. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The bridge is longer than I 
                        thought, but all those 5k’s are 
                        paying off.

           The CROWD RUNNERS are a lot faster than me. 
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Although these San Frannies are 
                        healthy bastards. 

           EXT. CUPID SCULPTURE - MOMENTS LATER

           I come WHEEZING up. I have to stop and catch my breath.  I 
           notice that the CROWD has also stopped. They HUSH themselves, 
           look back to me and part.  Through them I see an unmistakable 
           form, kicking Cupid’s Arrow. 

           It’s HER. She looks up to see me.

                                 HER
                        Fuck you, man! 

                                 ME
                        I would love that. But we tried it 
                        once, and you got all spooked 
                        remember?

           She stabs me with her eyes.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. I’m sorry. 
                            (beat)
                        Hi.

                                 HER
                        Why do you have to complicate 
                        everything? 

                                 ME
                        So... you’re single?

                                 HER
                        Yeah. Congratulations! My life is 
                        one big mess.

           The Crowd waits.

                                 ME
                        We’re all a big mess, though... But 
                        that shouldn’t stop us from finding 
                        each other and being happy.

                                 MAN FROM THE CROWD
                        Give him a chance!

                                 HER
                            (to Man)
                        Believe me, he had a chance!

                                 MAN FROM THE CROWD
                        Give him another chance!

                                 HER
                        He pretended to work with sick kids 
                        and donate money to charity in 
                        order to sleep with me.

                                 MAN FROM THE CROWD
                        Nevermind! Fuck this guy!
                                 ME
                        Wait! I know I fucked up. And I’m 
                        sorry as hell. But I didn’t do it 
                        just to sleep with her. 
                            (to HER)
                        I did it to be near you. I did it 
                        because I knew I could love you.

                                 WOMAN FROM THE CROWD
                        So your relationship was built on a 
                        mountain of lies?

                                 HER
                            (to ME)
                        She’s right, don’t you see? This 
                        isn’t substantial. Love is still 
                        just a feeling. And just because 
                        you feel it today, doesn’t mean 
                        you’ll feel it tomorrow.

                                 ME
                        If you’d said that yesterday, you’d 
                        see you were wrong. Because I still 
                        love you today. 
                            (beat)
                        When I told you I loved you before, 
                        it was selfish. I get that. It was 
                        about me. I needed to say it for 
                        me. But the emphasis shouldn’t have 
                        been on the “I” or even on the 
                        “you.” It’s the “love” part that’s 
                        important.

                                 HER
                        You’re missing the big picture. I 
                        have doubts... about everything. 
                        And I don’t know if I can ever get 
                        past them.

                                 ME
                        You can’t worry about the big 
                        picture. That’s a trap, because 
                        we're all going to die someday.

                                 MAN FROM THE CROWD
                        Jesus, dude.

                                 WOMAN FROM THE CROWD
                        That shit ain’t working...

                                 ME
                        It’s true, though. We’ll die and 
                        the sun will explode, consuming the 
                        Earth, and entropy will turn the 
                        ever expanding universe into a 
                        cold, dead place -- until gravity 
                        pulls it back together into a 
                        singularity and it all starts again 
                        with another Big Bang.

                                 HER
                        That’s terrible.
                                 ME
                        But does that mean I can't go have 
                        a nice dinner tonight? Or that I 
                        can't pursue a career that makes me 
                        happy? Or spend as much time as 
                        possible with the girl I love? 
                            (beat)
                        We don't live in the big picture, 
                        we live today. And today, there's 
                        nothing more important than being 
                        together. It's the only thing that 
                        matters.

                                 HER
                        But... how can you be so sure? What 
                        makes us worth fighting for?

                                 ME
                        Because we're us. Nobody else gets 
                        to be us. They can’t be inside our 
                        heads and hearts to think and feel 
                        what we do. So fuck the universe 
                        and fuck the sun and fuck death. 
                        They don't get us. In the end, 
                        we’re special because we’re us. 

           Beat.

           She doesn’t say anything. 

           The CROWD seems on the fence. Until-

                                 MAN FROM THE CROWD
                        Aw, shit. Give him a chance.

                                 ME
                        I love you. I need you. I’m 
                        desperate for you. 

           I get down on one knee in front of HER, like I’m proposing.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll do everything I can to 
                        prove it to you every day.

           I take her hand.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        So the next time you get one of 
                        these...

           I slip the ring off her finger.

                                 ME (CONT’D)
                        ... You’ll know for absolute 
                        certain it’s what you want.

           I place the ring into her pocket. 

           A tear rolls down her cheek. She smiles at me.

                                 HER
                        You’ll prove it every day?

                                 ME
                        Like crazy.
           I stand up and she wraps her skinny arms around me. 

                                 HER
                        Take me home.

           WE KISS, and all hell breaks loose. You watch for a second, 
           and then drift your eyes away, to...

           A STREET CORNER

           MY HEART stands, watching, smoking a cigarette. He sees a 
           dollar bill and picks it up. 

           MY HEART’S POV: The dollar bill is actually a religious tract 
           about quitting addictions. 

           He puts his cigarette out on the tract, and throws them both 
           away. MY HEART inhales a DEEP BREATH of fresh air and walks 
           into the San Franciscan night.
                                                    FADE IT OUT, BITCHES
