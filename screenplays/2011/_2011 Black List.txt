                        The Black List was compiled from the suggestions of over 300 film executives, 
                        each of whom contributed the names of up to ten of their favorite scripts that were 
                        written in, or are somehow uniquely associated with, 2011 and will not have begun 
                        principal photography during this calendar year.  

                        This year, scripts had to receive at least six mentions to be included on the The 
                        Black List.

                        All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.  
                        The Black List apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation 
                        identification, and questionable 2011 affiliations.

                        It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

                        The Black List is not a “best of “ list.  It is, at best, a “most liked” list.

                        Enjoy.
