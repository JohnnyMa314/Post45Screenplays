           INT.  JEFF’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           JEFF, early 40s, is fast asleep in a room that bears a 
           woman’s touch.  The fluffy duvet matches the curtains, and 
           the bed is crowded with superfluous pillows.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Jeff used to be a fun guy.  There 
                        was this one party back in college 
                        when he hooked up with three girls 
                        in one night.  The third one wasn’t 
                        even at the party.  She was 
                        literally just running by.  The 
                        party’s in full swing, and Jeff’s 
                        out on the front porch, and here 
                        comes this chick, out for a jog, 
                        headphones and everything, and Jeff 
                        intercepts her and talks her into 
                        the house.  Everybody from college 
                        still talks about it, like, “Oh my 
                        God, remember when Jeff banged that 
                        runner?”  But that was over 20 
                        years ago.  And I don’t mean to 
                        sound like a prick, but he’s just 
                        not the same guy anymore. 

           MONICA, late 30s, is spooned up behind him, lightly snoring 
           into his ear.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The chick spooned up behind him, 
                        that’s Monica.  She’s the wife.  
                        And this is their typical sleeping 
                        dynamic.  It says a lot about the 
                        whole relationship.  I mean, if you 
                        ask me, there’s just something 
                        really uncool about a chick 
                        spooning a guy.  It makes me feel 
                        totally useless.

           The dresser is cluttered with framed photos:  Jeff and Monica 
           on vacation, wearing matching sombreros.  Jeff and Monica in 
           Old West costumes, at one of those theme park photo shoots.  
           Jeff and Monica at the spa, in bathrobes and mud masks.  Each 
           picture more incriminating than the next.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Yeah, the pictures pretty much say 
                        it all.  If you could time-travel 
                        back to the ‘90s and show these 
                        pictures to Classic Jeff, Classic 
                        Jeff would punch Married Jeff right 
                        in the fucking balls.  You know 
                        what, don’t even look at those.
           Jeff yawns, sits up, and drops his feet on the floor.  He 
           stretches his arms, warming up for that long walk to the 
           bathroom, when suddenly- a surprise in his lap.

           He’s got an erection.  And just like that, he’s wide awake, 
           with a nervous smile.

           He climbs back into bed and softly kisses Monica.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, sleepyhead.

                                 MONICA
                            (still sleeping)
                        Mmmmm.

                                 JEFF
                        Good morning. 

           She opens her eyes and checks the clock.  6:51.

                                 MONICA
                        The alarm’s set for seven.  I need 
                        my sleep.

                                 JEFF
                        Early bird gets the worm.

           She reaches under the covers, and she’s just at surprised as 
           he is to find an erect penis.  Now, she’s wide awake, too.

                                 MONICA
                        Your penis is hard!

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah...  so do you wanna?

                                 MONICA
                        We have to be done in nine minutes, 
                        and I won’t have time to cuddle you 
                        after.  

           She twists out of her bottoms.  Jeff does the same.

           Once they’re both naked from the waist down, she climbs on 
           top of him.

                                 MONICA
                        It’s been a while.  I might get 
                        rough, just so you know.

                                 JEFF
                        OK.  That’s fine.
                                 MONICA
                        You’re in the zone, just push.

                                 JEFF
                        I am pushing.

           She reaches down to help, but finds him deflating already.

                                 MONICA
                        Jeffreybaby, you’re at half-mast.

                                 JEFF
                        Give me a minute.  I just had it.

           He closes his eyes and concentrates.  As if that will help.  
           He goes completely limp right there in her hand, and Monica 
           slowly exhales.  

                                 MONICA
                        It’s been four weeks.  I’ve been 
                        sitting on this orgasm for almost a 
                        month.

                                 JEFF
                        I know, Monica, I’m sorry...  This 
                        never happened with anybody else, 
                        and some of those girls back in 
                        school were really subpar.

                                 MONICA
                        It’s fine.  I’m just gonna get up.

           She climbs off of him.  He grabs her hand.

                                 JEFF
                        No, wait.  How about I go down on 
                        you?

                                 MONICA
                        Aww, you’re sweet.  But that’s not 
                        really your strong suit.

                                 JEFF
                        What if I...  touch you?

           She’s obviously frustrated, but trying to be constructive.

                                 MONICA
                        OK, let’s see what you got.

           She settles back into bed.  Jeff runs his hand beneath the 
           sheets and finds her vagina.

                                 JEFF
                        How’s this?
                                 MONICA
                        What is that, morse code?  Be 
                        smooth.

                                 JEFF
                        Smooth.  Like that?

                                 MONICA
                        You’re all over the map, baby.  
                        Here, follow my lead.

           She slips her own hand under the sheets and guides his.

                                 MONICA
                        Oh, yeah.  Yeah, right there.

           Now, she’s turned on.  If you want something done right...

                                 JEFF
                        There?  I feel like we’re coloring 
                        outside the lines, no?

                                 MONICA
                        It’s good.  Just be quiet, please.

                                 JEFF
                        Sorry.

                                 MONICA
                        Here, let me take over for a 
                        minute. 

           Jeff retracts his hand and gives her some room to operate.  

           Monica bites her lip and closes her eyes.  Really working 
           that thing.  Going to town.  Jeff isn’t even in the game 
           anymore.

           Then, she pauses.

                                 MONICA
                        I’ve never done this in front of 
                        anyone.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re doing great.  Seriously.

                                 MONICA
                        I can’t finish with you watching.

                                 JEFF
                        Should I take over?
                                 MONICA
                        Or maybe you could just give me a 
                        minute?
                            (awkward pause)
                        I mean, it’s just quicker if I...

           It takes Jeff a moment to catch on.  Then, it sinks in.  He 
           climbs out of bed, feeling a little rejected.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll go brush my teeth.

                                 MONICA
                        I’m sorry, Jeffreybaby.  It’s just 
                        that, now I’m all, you know...

                                 JEFF
                        It’s OK.

           INT.  JEFF’S HOUSE, BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Jeff stands in front of the mirror, miserably brushing away.  

           Monica moans from the next room.  At least somebody is having 
           fun.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Like I said, he’s just not the same 
                        guy anymore.

           EXT.  JEFF’S OFFICE, PARKING LOT - JUST BEFORE 9AM

           WILMINGTON, DELAWARE:  Another day at the DIVISION OF 
           STATISTICAL ENUMERATION, a large, colorless office building. 

           Jeff’s gray Volvo rolls into the lot.

           INT.  RECEPTION - A MINUTE LATER

           STEVEN, 30s, is the secretary.  Dorky, upbeat, extremely 
           naive, wearing a thick pair of glasses, and fresh off the bus 
           from some hick town in Oklahoma.  He’s fairly effeminate, but 
           nobody knows for sure whether he’s in the closet or just a 
           delicate Southern gentleman.

           As soon as Jeff enters, Steven excitedly pops out of his seat 
           and approaches.  Hiding something behind his back.

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, good morning, Jeff!  You’re 
                        just in time!  Open your mouth and 
                        close your eyes!
                                 JEFF
                        Excuse me?

                                 STEVEN
                        Open your mouth and close your eyes 
                        and you will get a big surprise.

                                 JEFF
                        OK, even if you’re offering me 
                        food, and I sincerely hope you are, 
                        I really don’t want to play-

           Steven reveals a tray of assorted hors d'oeuvre samples.

                                 STEVEN
                        I want you to help me taste-test 
                        the amuse-bouche for tonight!

                                 JEFF
                        Amuse...?

                                 STEVEN
                        Amuse-bouche.  Finger foods.  This 
                        is my first time hosting, and I 
                        want everything to be just right.

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, I’m sorry, Steven, but I 
                        don’t think I can make it tonight.

                                 STEVEN
                            (confused pause)
                        Was it my invitations?  Was the 
                        calligraphy too hard to read?

                                 JEFF
                        No, it’s just-  I’m working on some 
                        personal stuff with Monica.  I’m 
                        gonna stay in with her tonight.  
                        But good luck with the, um, amuse-

                                 STEVEN
                        Amuse-bouche!  Just try one! 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m really not hungry.  And 
                        honestly, I don’t like other men 
                        shoving surprises in my mouth.

           Jeff proceeds into his office, leaving Steven a bit crushed.

           INT.  JEFF’S OFFICE - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jeff picks up the phone and dials.
                                 JEFF
                        Hey Dad, you busy?
                            (pause)
                        I got a question.  It’s a little 
                        awkward, but you don’t need to go 
                        into detail.  Simple yes or no will 
                        do.
                            (pause)
                        Are you and Mom still, um... 
                        intimate?  With each other?
                            (pause)
                        You’re kidding.  That much?  Do you 
                        ever have trouble, uh, performing?
                            (pause)
                        Well, good for you, but...  Dad, I 
                        asked you not to go into detail...  
                        OK, at least use biological terms, 
                        that’s my mother you’re talking 
                        about.  

           His co-worker VINCE barges in.  Vince is a fast-talking, red-
           blooded alpha male.  Early 40s, but emotionally stalled 
           around 21.  As usual, he’s all riled up about something, and 
           work is the last thing on his mind.

                                 VINCE
                        You fucking pussy.

           Jeff waves him away, but Vince snatches the phone and hangs 
           up.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey!  That was important, Vince-

                                 VINCE
                        Steven says you’re bailing tonight. 

                                 JEFF
                        It’s bad timing.  Monica and I are 
                        working on some personal stuff, and- 

                                 VINCE
                        It’s one night!  You can’t post 
                        bail for one night!?

                                 JEFF
                        Gimmie a break, man.  I got a ton 
                        of work to do here.

                                 VINCE
                        Oh, please.  This is neither the 
                        time nor the place.  You just wait 
                        ‘til Gene hears about this.
           INT.  BREAK ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

           The break room is dark, until Vince appears in the doorway 
           and flicks the lights on.  Jeff reluctantly follows.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, come on.  Don’t wake up Gene-

                                 VINCE
                        Gene, get up. 

           GENE, 70s, the grizzled, crotchety security guard is passed 
           out on the couch.  A man’s man, left over from simpler, 
           politically incorrect times.  

                                 GENE
                            (growls)
                        Fuck off.  I’m hungover.

                                 VINCE
                        It’s an emergency.

                                 GENE
                        I told you not to wake me if 
                        there’s an emergency.

                                 VINCE
                        Jeff’s bailing on Guys Night again.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m not bailing, I just...  I need 
                        to work on some personal stuff with 
                        my wife.

                                 VINCE
                        Personal stuff with his wife!

                        You want my advice?  Don’t be a 
                        queer.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s your advice for everything, 
                        Gene.  It’s offensive.

                                 GENE
                        Damn right that’s my advice, ‘cause 
                        you’re all a bunch of cupcakes, 
                        your whole generation.  You wanna

                        do, don’t be a queer.  Boss thinks 
                        I drink too much?  Don’t be a 
                        queer.  Steven might be a queer?  
                        Don’t be a queer.
                                 JEFF
                        Explain to me how spending the 
                        night with my wife makes me queer.

                        I need this, Jeff.  Ever since 
                        Jillian found those texts from 
                        Crazy Katie, I’ve been on lockdown.  
                        No happy hours, no golf, no 
                        business dinners, the only thing 
                        I’m allowed to do is Guys Night 
                        with you, and that’s only because 
                        she thinks you’re boring.  

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, I see.  You’re not allowed to 
                        do Guys Night unless I’m at Guys

                                 JEFF
                        Uh-huh.  Jillian knows that if I’m 
                        not there to babysit, you’re gonna 
                        drag everybody to a strip club.

                        Look, I already told her that 
                        you’re coming.  And as much as I 
                        enjoy lying to my wife, it’s just 
                        easier if you’re actually there.

                                 JEFF
                            (annoyed pause)
                        I’ll run it by Monica when I get 
                        home, OK?  No promises.

           INT.  JEFF’S OFFICE - JUST BEFORE 5PM

           The business day is winding down.  Jeff sits behind his desk, 
           staring out the window.

           Through the window, he can see Gene standing by the flagpole, 
           attempting to retire the flag.  But there’s a tangle in the 
           cable, and Old Glory is stuck at half-mast.  A Freudian omen.     

           Jeff turns his attention back to his computer.  He takes a 
           breath, and then slowly types a word into the search engine:   

           v... i... a... 

           A list of suggested results pops up as he’s still typing:
           viagra, viagra online, viagra samples, viagra prescriptions

           Jeff gasps, surprised by the computer’s presumption.  Trying 
           to act casual as he scrolls down through the results.

                                 VINCE
                        Be firm tonight.

           Jeff nearly jumps out of his seat.  He looks up to see Vince 
           standing in his doorway.

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 VINCE
                        With Monica.

                                 JEFF
                            (exhales)
                        I told you, I’ll run it by her.

                                 VINCE
                        No, see, that’s Married Jeff 
                        talking.  Classic Jeff would get 
                        right up in her face and be like, 
                        “Listen bitch, I need a night with 
                        my bros.”

                                 JEFF
                        Classic Jeff would be divorced by 
                        now.

           Jeff shifts in his seat and Vince lingers in the doorway, 
           neither saying anything.  An unofficial staring contest.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Jeff and Vince have been at the 
                        Division for, like, 15 years now.  
                        And Jeff always thought Vince was 
                        an asshole, even back when they 
                        were in their 20’s.  But you know 
                        how it is.  As a guy gets older, he 
                        doesn’t see his real friends much 
                        anymore, and he’s got nobody to 
                        socialize with except for the 
                        clowns from the office.  You hang 
                        around with a couple of nuts all 
                        day, the nuts become your best 
                        friends, whether you like ‘em or 
                        not.
           INT.  JEFF’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Monica is due home any minute.  Jeff is setting the stage for 
           romance.  He’s wearing a red satin bathrobe, cut way too 
           high, showing off his hairy thighs.

           He lights a few candles.  He unfolds a Snuggie and lays it 
           neatly over the couch.  He fidgets with the remote control, 
           scrolls through the digital shows, and cues up Dancing With 
           The Stars.  

           The door opens.  Monica enters, dressed in a sexy power suit.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey there!  Just in time.

           She smiles curiously when she sees the preparations.  Wine, 
           candles, Dancing with the Stars, the robe.  She takes off her 
           shoes and jewelry while verbally patting him on the head.

                                 MONICA
                        Aww, look at you!  What’s all this?

                                 JEFF
                        Well, I know how much you like 
                        romance, so-

                                 MONICA
                        And what are you wearing? 

                                 JEFF
                        It’s a sexy robe.  I feel kinda 
                        silly, but the craigslist ad said 
                        it was lucky.  So, I thought maybe-

                                 MONICA
                        Jeffreybaby, all this preparation 
                        is adorable.  But you know I have 
                        Book Club tonight.

                                 JEFF
                        On a Friday?

                                 MONICA
                        We had to cancel Tuesday night.  
                        Candice didn’t finish the book.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, but honey... I thought maybe...

                                 MONICA
                        Thought what?  Is your penis 
                        functional?
                                 JEFF
                        Not at the moment, but maybe if we 
                        take it slow and really concentrate-

                                 MONICA
                        That’s what you said last Friday, 
                        remember?  And we spent the whole 
                        night pulling taffy.

                                 JEFF
                            (frustrated pause)
                        So I’ll just watch DWTS by myself, 
                        I guess.

                                 MONICA
                        Now, don’t pout.  If I keep it 
                        under two glasses of wine, I’ll be 
                        home later tonight, and you can 
                        help me masturbate some more?  OK?

           INT.  BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Monica sits at her vanity, fresh from a shower, applying her 
           make-up.  Jeff enters the scene, frustrated and mopey.  The 
           sight of her in a towel, sexy and still a little wet, only 
           worsens his mood.

                                 JEFF
                        So...  maybe I’ll just go play 
                        cards with the guys.

           She stops what she’s doing and gives him a look.

                                 JEFF
                        What?  You’re going out, why can’t 
                        I?

                                 MONICA
                        You have brunch with Nonner and 
                        Poopy in the morning.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s tomorrow?

                                 MONICA
                        I wrote it on your planner a week 
                        ago.  9AM sharp.  

                                 JEFF
                        9AM?  What happened to 10?
                                 MONICA
                        Poopy never changes his clocks.  
                        His body can’t handle daylight 
                        savings at his age.  You know this.

                                 JEFF
                        9AM brunch is breakfast.

                                 MONICA
                        Jeffreybaby.  This is our future 
                        we’re talking about.

                                 JEFF
                        If it’s our future, why do I have 
                        to take your grandparents to brunch 
                        by myself?

                                 MONICA
                        Because you’re a big boy, you 
                        should be able to win them over 
                        without my help.  Poopy’s hiring a 
                        whole new team for the Dover 
                        office, so-

                        Poopy still calls me Jerry.  He

                        They hated Roger, too.  But Roger 
                        sucked it up and took them to 
                        brunch, and today, he’s Poopy’s

                        So basically, if I kiss your 
                        grandfather’s ass, I can go work 
                        for your ex-boyfriend.

                        Monica wasn’t always like this.  
                        Jeff introduced me after their 
                        third date, so I’ve known her

                        basically from the beginning.  And 
                        back in the day, she was a fun 
                        chick.  She used to be all about 
                        road head, believe it or not.  And 
                        I’m talking unsolicited road head, 
                        no awkward hints, she would just 
                        start doing it, the way some people 
                        play the license plate game.  
                        Nowadays, when they go somewhere, 
                        she doesn’t even let him drive, she 
                        says he’s not aggressive enough 
                        behind the wheel.  And this job 
                        thing, I think she’s being a 
                        capitol C about the job thing.  I 
                        could go on until I’m blue in the 
                        face, but I try to stay outta her 
                        business altogether.

           INT.  STEVEN’S APARTMENT, SITTING ROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Steven’s apartment is immaculate, yet cozy.  Tastefully 
           decorated with prints of fine art and antique furniture.  
           More like an old lady’s pad than a bachelor’s. 

           Vince sits on the couch, dully flipping channels.  Gene sits 
           beside him, shuffling a deck of cards like a pro.  No music, 
           no conversation, just the ticking of a grandfather clock.

           Steven emerges from the kitchen with a tray of fancy hors 
           d'oeuvres, which he lays carefully on the coffee table.

           And let’s clarify what everybody is wearing, because it says 
           a lot about them:  Vince is dressed in cheesy Ed Hardy stuff, 
           which he’s entirely too old and out of shape for.  Gene is 
           dressed in black, a ringer for Johnny Cash.  Steven is the 
           most fashionable, which only adds to his sexual ambiguity.

                                 STEVEN
                        Now, these over here are caprese 
                        salad samplers.  Great to nibble on 
                        if you’re watching your waistline.

                        Is something wrong with your TV or 
                        do you really only get 13 channels?

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m not sure how many I have total.  
                        I never go higher than PBS, because 
                        they always have something good on.
                                 VINCE
                        So 13 channels.  No ESPN, no HBO.

                        And these over here are picadillo 
                        empanadas.  They’re a tiny bit 
                        spicy, but I just figured, 
                        whatever!  It’s Guys Night!

                                 STEVEN 
                        Well, let’s see, I have ginger ale,  
                        Diet Coke, several kinds of juice-

                        You have nothing?  Not even beer?

           Steven shrugs, amused by his own forgetfulness.  And his 
           amusement only pisses Vince off more.

                                 STEVEN
                        I was in such a mad rush to get 
                        everything I needed for the finger 
                        foods-

                        Nobody gives a shit about the

                        wanted to eat finger foods I’d be 
                        at a goddamned bridal shower.

           Gene reaches into his jacket and produces a silver flask.

                                 GENE
                        I got 8 ounces of Beam.  You two

                        Well, not right now, but sometimes.  
                        When the light hits it just right.  

           Gene leans forward as they approach a dark, unmarked ramp.

                                 GENE
                        Wait wait wait.  Slow down.

                        Slow down for what?

                        Here’s the exit.  Turn here. 

           Vince slows and exits onto a spooky, single-lane road.

           EXT.  SERVICE ROAD / INT.  ROVER - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff watches uncertainly as the road leads them away from the 
           lights and traffic of the Expressway, deep into the dark, 
           dreary surrounding woods.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m pretty sure this is just a 
                        service road.

                                 STEVEN
                        Whatever the service is, I don’t 
                        want it.

           They ride in silence for a while, as a thick fog sets in and 
           blankets the car.

           The road beneath the tires turns to muddy gravel, leading to:

           EXT.  HARBOR / INT.  ROVER - CONTINUOUS

           A ghostly harbor, barely visible through the fog.  An 
           abandoned bait-and-tackle shop.  Sagging docks with empty 
           fishing slips in between, except for a few ancient, half-
           sunken rowboats.

                                 VINCE
                        Gene, this is the deadest dead end 
                        I’ve ever seen.

                                 GENE
                        Just drive.  Down by the docks.

           Vince exhales.  Whatever you say.  He shifts gears and creeps 
           down the sloping gravel toward the water.
           The Rover reaches the edge of the harbor.  The headlights 
           fall upon a pier that leads straight into the fog.  No end in 
           sight. 

                                 GENE
                        That’s it.  Go.

                        What do you mean, go?  That thing

                                 GENE
                        Listen knucklehead, you know some 
                        other way to Applejack Island?  

           Vince stares uncertainly into the fog.  Finally, he shifts 
           into first gear and inches forward.

           The old, rickety planks creak beneath the tires.

           They drive further.  Vince leans over the steering wheel, 
           nervously expecting the pier to fall apart beneath them.  

           Then, as they’re driving, the architecture evolves.  The 
           creaky planks are succeeded by steel and concrete.  Little by 
           little, the lane widens.

                                 VINCE
                        What the hell...?

           The fog dissipates.

           Suddenly, they’re driving along a huge, two-lane suspension 
           bridge, with steel girders and a smooth carriageway.

           Vince, Jeff, and Steven stare out the windows, witnesses to a 
           grand parlor trick.

           Then, they see the lights.  The bridge slopes down toward the 
           glow of a distant island.  An oasis in the mist. 

                                 GENE
                        And there she is.  My shorts are 
                        getting tighter already.

                                 JEFF
                            (quietly, to himself)
                        I’ll be damned...

           The bridge connects with land, and they reach the edge of 
           Applejack Island.

           The outskirts are dark and unfriendly.  A nameless, old-
           fashioned tavern and a few small shanties.  The dim 
           streetlights reveal a couple of random pedestrians, creepy 
           fishermen-types who watch the Rover pass with eerie stares.

           Instead of WELCOME TO APPLEJACK ISLAND, or something like 
           that, they pass a large sign that reads simply: LOCALS ONLY! 

                                 JEFF
                            (re: the sign)
                        Not exactly a warm welcome.

                        That’s probably just for 
                        atmosphere.  All these little 
                        coastal towns have signs like that.  
                        They’re trying to be kitschy.

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh sure, like when people fly 
                        little pirate flags on back of 
                        their boats.  Some of them aren’t 
                        even pirates, they’re just havin’ 
                        fun with you.

           They pass another sign: SERIOUSLY, FUCK OFF.

                                 JEFF
                        OK.  Rationalize that one.

                        And where are all the girls?  I 
                        thought this place was supposed to 
                        be the Atlantic City of New Jersey!

                                 JEFF
                        It’s more like the New Jersey of 
                        New Jersey.

                        Just keep driving.  There should be 
                        a garage up on Road.

                        Just Road, that’s what it’s called.  
                        They don’t name the streets here.

           The guys look up as they drive through the next intersection.  
           Sure enough, the sign reads simply, BOULEVARD and AVENUE.

                        Now that’s gonna be fun when we’re 
                        drunk.
           EXT.  TRAFFIC LIGHT - A MOMENT LATER

           They cruise a little further and stop at a traffic light.  In 
           the next lane is a black Cadillac with tinted windows. 

                                 STEVEN
                        The man in that car is staring at 
                        us.

           The other guys look over.  Sure enough, the DRIVER is 
           watching them with an unfriendly scowl.  He looks like a 
           typical leg-breaker, shaved head and Velour tracksuit.

           Gene rolls down the window.  Jeff slumps down in his seat.

                                 JEFF
                        Gene!  Don’t antagonize the locals-

           Too late.  Gene stares right back, and things heat up.

                        Can I help you with something, pal?

                                 DRIVER
                        Yeah, where do you think you’re 
                        goin’ with those Delaware plates?

                        than we’re stoppin’ by your mama’s 
                        house.  That’s where.

           A tense pause.  The door swings open.  The Driver jumps out. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, shit.  Here we go.

           But then- the Cadillac’s rear window rolls down, revealing a 
           middle-aged thug in the back seat.  This is CARLO, 50s, the 
           type of guy who can level a threat without raising his voice. 

                                 CARLO
                        Tommy.

           The Driver pauses.

                                 CARLO
                        Get back in the car.

           Tommy does as he’s told.  Carlo watches him climb back in the 
           driver’s seat, and then turns his cold stare to the guys.
                                 CARLO
                        Don’t mind my driver.  He’s a real 
                        hothead.

           Vince tries to loosen things up with his wiseass diplomacy.

                        help us out, we’re a little lost.

                        young wet pussy!

           Jeff, Gene, and Steven roll their eyes.  Carlo stares at 
           Vince with no hint of a smile.  An uncomfortable pause.

                                 CARLO
                        This town’s not exactly a meltin’

                        I don’t know how you boys found 
                        this place, but I think you better 
                        turn around, go home to Delaware, 
                        and don’t tell nobody you were 
                        here. 

           The light turns green.  Carlo rolls up the window, and the 
           Cadillac drives off.  

           INT.  GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATE

           The Rover creeps up the ramp of a shoddy parking garage and 
           screeches into an open spot.  The guys exit the car, still a 
           little on edge from the last scene.  

                                 JEFF
                        I think we should listen to that 
                        guy.

                                 STEVEN
                        I agree.  He had the most sinister, 
                        piercing brown eyes.

                        You made your point, OK?  We found 
                        The Island.  Apparently, there’s 
                        been a minor apocalypse since you 
                        were last here, but it’s real and I 
                        stand corrected.

                                 GENE
                        Give it one drink.  If your cock’s 
                        not hard after one drink, we’ll 
                        turn around and go home.  I 
                        promise.

                        Fine.  One drink.  But it’s not 
                        like this place is even remotely...

           He trails off as they turn a corner.  Welcome to the jungle.  

           EXT.  BOULEVARD - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys reach a sprawling strip of rowdy bars, cheap motels, 
           and dark nightclubs with no names.  Cobblestone streets with 
           gas lamps on the corners.  Occasional, random fireworks in 
           the air.  It’s like the French Quarter of the Old West.

           Any laws regarding open alcohol or public decency are 
           flagrantly ignored.  The sidewalks are a parade of drugs, 
           alcohol, and partial nudity.  Hot, trashy girls everywhere, 
           and every one of them quite obviously trying to get fucked. 

           The guys’ reactions are priceless.  Like spellbound kids 
           getting their first look at Disneyland.  Gene just smirks, as 
           if to say, I told you so.

                        reasonable hour, or I’ll never hear 
                        the end of it from, from, uh-

                        Monica.

                        Monica.  Exactly.  Point is, I 
                        agreed to one drink.

                        Look around, Jeff.  This is New 
                        Jersey.  Can-I-buy-you-a-drink 
                        doesn’t work here.  These chicks 
                        won’t even look at us unless we 
                        score a little blow.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re being ridiculous.  I’m not 
                        here to meet chicks and I don’t-

                        Observe.

           Here come two sexy JERSEY SLUTS.  Young, dumb, teetering on 
           high heels.  As they pass, Vince coughs and mumbles under his 
           breath:
                                 VINCE
                        Cocaine.

           The Sluts do a quick about-face and smile flirtatiously.

                        Oh, hello there.

                                 SLUT #1
                        Did you just cough the word 
                        “cocaine?”

                                 VINCE
                        Maybe.  Where are you girls going?

                        jazz music?

                                 SLUT #1
                        Nobody over 30 allowed. 

                                 VINCE
                        Nobody over 30.  Is that written in 
                        stone, like a law?  Or is it kinda 
                        flexible, like a restraining order?

                                 SLUT #2
                            (right to the point)
                        Do you have any coke or not?

                                 VINCE
                        Well, as a matter of fact-

                                 JEFF
                        No, we don’t.  Sorry.

           The Sluts exchange a look.  Forget these guys.  They exit.

                        Damn it, Jeff, I will not let you 
                        chaperone me here!  This town is my 
                        Mecca!  These people are my soul 
                        mates!

           A BUM approaches, hand outstretched.

                                 BUM
                        Brother man, you spare some change?

                        I’m going to F Club.  Who’s in?

                                 JEFF
                        They said nobody over 30.  We’re 
                        all over 30.  Gene would be retired 
                        by now if he didn’t hate his wife.

                        getting lazer-beamed by all the bad 
                        girls with daddy issues! 

                                 JEFF
                        You’re missing the point.  We’ll 
                        never get in. 

                                 GENE
                        Well.  Dirty Lou’s place used to be 
                        a few blocks that way.

                        Who’s Dirty Lou? 

                                 GENE
                        Town locksmith and a minor league 
                        paper hanger.  If he’s still in 
                        business, he can whip up some fake 
                        IDs.

                                 VINCE
                        Fake IDs from Dirty Lou.  That 
                        sounds foolproof.

                                 JEFF
                        Just a minute now.  I have a 9AM 
                        brunch.  I’m not getting a fake ID 
                        to chase two trampy girls to some-

           Jeff abruptly pauses.  The guys look at him expectantly.  A 
           firecracker explodes overhead, filling the sky with color.

                                 JEFF
                        Just a flurry, but I definitely 
                        felt something. 
                                 VINCE
                        It was those sluts!

                        Now, hold on.  It could be a fluke.

                                 GENE
                        That’s no fluke.  That’s The 
                        Island, workin’ her sexy magic.

                                 JEFF
                        No, that’s not-  I love Monica.  I 
                        have no desire to meet other women.

                                 VINCE
                        And you don’t have to meet other 
                        women, but you can’t deny what is 
                        happening down there.  Your dick is 
                        pointing at destiny.  Trust your 
                        dick for once.  Follow your dick.

           We hold on Jeff as he considers.

                        OK, I know a lot of females are 
                        saying, “Don’t do it, don’t do it.”  
                        Ladies, do me a favor, sit down and 
                        shut up for a minute.  The man 
                        clearly expressed fidelity to his 
                        wife, so what’s wrong with a little 
                        window-shopping?  I’m not sayin’ he 
                        should cheat on Monica with those 
                        two slam-pigs, I’m just excited for 
                        a change of scenery here.

           EXT.  DIRTY LOU’S LOCKSMITH STAND - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           DIRTY LOU looks like Yoda, but slightly taller.  Small, 
           wrinkled, eyes barely open.  His rickety operation is not 
           much bigger than a fruit stand.

           The guys are lined up against a blue backdrop, as the old man 
           adjusts the shutter on a large antique camera.

                                 STEVEN
                        This is so exciting!  I always 
                        wanted a fake ID but my folks 
                        wouldn’t allow it!

                        Still can’t believe we’re doing 
                        this.  I feel like I’m applying to 
                        be a pedophile.

                        Something Jonas.

                        It can be anything I want?  Shoot, 
                        let me think here.

                                 JEFF
                        Doesn’t make a difference, Steven.  
                        We’re only gonna use ‘em once.

                                 STEVEN
                        I always liked the name “Chase 
                        Hunter.”  I saw it on a soap opera.

                                 VINCE
                        Chase Hunter?  That sounds fake.

                                 JEFF
                        And redundant.

                                 STEVEN
                        No, wait.  Doctor Chase Hunter.

                                 GENE

                        Up here, Doc.  Smile.

           Steven looks up at Dirty Lou with a huge smile.  FLASH.

           EXT.  F CLUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The guys wander down a dark, vacant lane, beneath a sign that  
           reads simply, LANE.  The thumping bass of house music becomes 
           audible as they approach a large, windowless building.  The 
           DOORMAN is a short, surly guido.  
           The guys hand over their IDs.  Vince and Jeff manage to act 
           casual, but Steven is shaking in his boots, and Gene still 
           looks old and gray, even behind a pair of dark sunglasses.

                                 DOORMAN
                        You guys are all 29?

                        Big three-oh next year.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Yo, no offense, but... you gotta be 
                        the most strung-out looking 29-year-
                        old I ever met.

                                 GENE
                        Stay away from crystal meth.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Touché.

           The Doorman grills Steven as he hands their IDs back. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        Chase, you’re from Piscataway?

           Steven stares nervously into space.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Chase?

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, yes!  What?

                                 DOORMAN
                        Piscataway?

                        Yes, that’s where I live and 
                        practice medicine.

                                 DOORMAN

                            (nervous pause)
                        He’s my brother-in-law.

                                 DOORMAN
                            (instantly lightens up)
                        No shit!  Yo, tell him all the guys 
                        from F Club say what’s up.

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, I will, thank you.

           INT.  F CLUB, ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The guys pocket their IDs and head inside.  Once the Bouncer 
           is out of sight, Vince grins and slaps Jeff on the back.

                                 VINCE

                        only young twice!

           They pass a narrow locker room, where people are stuffing 
           their personal items into small, shoebox-size lockers.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t get it.  What’s with the

                        Must be a local thing.  You put 
                        your keys and stuff into a locker 
                        so you don’t lose ‘em when you’re 
                        drunk.  Actually kind of ingenious.

                                 JEFF
                        That seems less secure than just

           The guys proceed through a dark hallway, which leads them to:

           The coolest, sexiest party of all time.  Raised dance floors, 
           bathed in florescent light.  Plushly furnished private 
           bungalows, enclosed by billowing curtains.  Gorgeous half-
           naked dancers, in cages suspended from the ceiling.  And a 
           very young crowd.  Most of the girls fresh out of school.

                        Would you look at these buckets?  
                        They’re young enough to be our 
                        mistakes!
                                 JEFF
                        Jesus, why don’t we just crash a 
                        prom while we’re at it?

                                 VINCE
                        I know you’re joking, but prom 
                        season’s right around the corner.

           Vince leads everybody to the nearest bar and signals the 
           bartender.  The other guys are trying not to stare, but 
           they’re mesmerized by the entertainment.

                                 STEVEN
                        Well, what in the-?  Girls dancing 
                        in cages?  Now I’ve seen it all!

                                 GENE
                        Why is this stupid music so goddamn 
                        loud?

                                 VINCE
                        It’s house music, Gene!  It’s 
                        supposed to be loud and stupid!

           Jeff’s pocket vibrates.  He takes out his cell and checks the 
           caller ID:  Monica.

                                 JEFF
                        Ah, great.  I gotta take this.

                                 VINCE
                        Oh come on, man.  Can’t you go one 
                        night without being considerate to 
                        your wife?

           Jeff cranes his neck, looking for a respite from the noise.  

                                 JEFF
                        How am I supposed to hear anything 
                        in this place?

                                 GENE
                        Try getting your head outta your 
                        ass.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll be back in five minutes. 

           Jeff hurriedly exits the scene, phone ringing in his hand 
           like a time bomb.  Vince rolls his eyes.

                        so old.
                                 GENE
                        You just find me a panhead with a 
                        big ass and I’ll take it from 
                        there.

                        Steven, you’re the Greek chorus.  
                        Laugh at our jokes and corroborate 
                        any lies.  OK?

           No response.  Steven is watching a pack of guidos fist-pump 
           on the dance floor.

                        great time watching these maniacs 
                        over here on the dance floor.  They

                        watch Glee.

                                 GENE
                        You got nothing to be ashamed of, 
                        kid.  Far as I can tell, 
                        everybody’s a queer nowadays.  

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah, seriously.  Just tell us if 
                        you are, so we can be more 
                        sensitive when we make fun of you.

           INT.  NEAR THE COATROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff rushes to the back of the club, trying to escape the 
           music and crowd noise, the phone still ringing in his hand.  
           He finds a dark corner next to the coatroom- the only quiet 
           corner in the whole damn place.

           A young woman stands nearby, minding her own business, 
           tapping out a text message.  She resembles Audrey Hepburn, 
           petite with an air of delicate sophistication.
           Jeff settles into the corner, then snaps his phone open-

                                 JEFF
                        Hi, honey!  I-  

           -but in that same moment, Audrey Hepburn answers her own 
           phone and screams excitedly:

                                 AUDREY
                            (into her phone)
                        Heyyy bitch!  Where you at, you 
                        fuckin’ skank!?

           Jeff cringes and slaps his hand over the receiver.  We don’t 
           hear Monica’s reaction, but it’s not good. 

                                 JEFF
                        Monica, I-  No, it’s nobody!  I-

                                 AUDREY
                            (into her phone)
                        Yeah, hurry up and bring some coke!  
                        I’m so fucking horny for coke!  

                                 JEFF
                        Honey, pay no attention to-

                                 AUDREY
                            (into her phone)
                        I said, I’m so fucking horny for 
                        coke!  You’re so fucking deaf, Mom, 
                        I swear to God!

           Jeff lowers his phone and stares angrily at Audrey.  This 
           little bimbo is killing him.

           INT.  NEAR THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Back at the bar, Steven is reassuring Vince and Gene of his 
           heterosexuality.

                                 STEVEN
                        I just don’t get it.  Is it because 
                        I don’t have a ladyfriend? 

                                 VINCE
                        It’s because everything you say 
                        makes you sound like a gaylord.  
                        Such as the word “ladyfriend.”

                                 STEVEN
                        OK, in all honesty, I did have a 
                        prostrate exam when I turned 30, 
                        but I found it very uncomfortable.

                        Either way, it’ll do you good to 
                        have some sex.

                        Opposite sex.

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah, seriously.  Let’s go find 
                        some lay-ups.

           Vince and Gene pound their drinks and slam down empty 
           glasses.  Then, just as they’re making their move, the music 
           fades.  A pause, followed by the DJ’s voice, bellowing over 
           the sound system:

                                 DJ (O.S.)
                        What’s up, F Club!?  It’s now 
                        exactly 12 midnight, and you know 
                        what that means!

           The crowd cheers.  Girls scream, guys high-five.

           Vince, Gene, and Steven look at each other, confused.

                                 STEVEN
                        What happens at midnight?

           From somewhere above their heads, a loud electronic rumble 
           begins.  Like the sound of a giant washing machine.

           The crowd cheers even louder, as huge streams of thick blue 
           foam cascade down from the ceiling ducts.

                                 VINCE
                        Holy shit!  It’s a foam party!

                        A what?

                                 VINCE
                        They fill the whole club with foam! 

                                 GENE
                        What the hell’s the sense of that?

                                 VINCE
                        Because it’s scientifically proven 
                        to make girls horny!  Come on, 
                        doesn’t anybody read Maxim?

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, no.  I gotta get out of here!  
                        I’m allergic to foam!
                                 VINCE
                        Allergic?  To foam?  How do you 
                        even know something like that?

                                 STEVEN
                        Because I’ve been at one of these 
                        things before.  It was at a place 
                        called Bubbles, down in Key West-

                                 GENE
                        Right, ‘cause that’s where straight 
                        guys go to hang out.  Club Bubbles 
                        in Key West.

                                 STEVEN
                        Where’s the exit!? 

                                 VINCE
                        They’re about to flood this joint 
                        with hot, sexy foam and you wanna 
                        leave!?

                                 STEVEN 
                        I’ll break out in rashes all over 
                        my body, Vince!  When you had that 
                        rash on your ding-dong, who picked 
                        up all your creams at the pharmacy?  
                        That pharmacist looked at me like I 
                        was some kinda sex pervert!

           We hold on Vince, annoyed at being made to feel guilty.

                                 VINCE
                        Ahhh, fucking hell.  Come on.

           They set off in search of an exit.  Vince and Gene lead the 
           way for Steven, brushing foam away as giant mounds enclose 
           from all sides.

           Meanwhile, the rest of the crowd is having a blast.  Dancing, 
           hooking up, horsing around.  Vince spots two gorgeous girls 
           making out beneath a sudsy waterfall, and he curses Steven 
           under his breath.

           Finally, the guys reach the exit doors, but they’re 
           intercepted by a giant, juicehead BOUNCER.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Doors stay closed while the foam’s 
                        on.

                        You heard the man.  Tough break.
                                 STEVEN
                        Please sir, you don’t understand.  
                        I have an allergy!

                                 BOUNCER
                        Bro, I don’t care if your face is 
                        on fire.  Doors stay closed while 
                        the foam’s on.

           Steven spins around, surveying the club.  Huge banks of foam 
           everywhere.  Oozing toward our heroes, who stand trapped in 
           one of the last dry corners.

           Steven nervously scratches.  His face suddenly beat red, his 
           neck swollen with welts.

                                 GENE
                        Damn, you weren’t lying, kid.  
                        You’re redder than a Cherokee’s 
                        asshole.

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh no, it’s starting!  I’m itching 
                        in places I’m not supposed to 
                        scratch!

                        We’ll try the mens’ room!  Come on,

           INT.  NEAR THE COATROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff squeezes his cell with both hands as Loudmouth Cokehead 
           Audrey Hepburn loudly yaps away.

                                 AUDREY
                        -and bring me some tampons, OK!?

                        Tampons, Mom!  For my pussy!

           He taps her on the shoulder.  She looks up at him.

                        Thank you.

                                 AUDREY
                        I’m Audrey, by the way.

           She offers her hand, and Jeff quickly shakes it.

                                 JEFF
                        Jeff.  Now, if you don’t mind-

           He waves her away, and then returns to his call with Monica.

                                 JEFF
                            (into phone)
                        Honey, I’m so sorry.  Are you 
                        there?  Listen, I-

                                 AUDREY
                        Oh, fuck me, Jeff!  Fuck me hard!

           She screams it right over his shoulder.  Jeff snaps his cell 
           shut, wide-eyed.  He’s dead.

           INT.  BY THE RESTROOMS - CONTINUOUS

           Vince and Gene push foamy clubbers out of their way, clearing 
           Steven a path to the mens’ room.

           They’re not fast enough.  By the time they near the restroom, 
           a giant tidal wave of foam has concealed the entrance.  Now, 
           they’re helpless.  Surrounded on all sides by suds.

                                 STEVEN
                        We’re trapped!  What do I do?

           Vince looks up.  Directly above their heads is a steel cage.  
           A girl dancing inside, but plenty of extra room.

                                 VINCE
                        You’ll be safe in the cage.  Come 
                        on!

           Vince and Gene hold out their hands.  Together, they boost 
           Steven up.  He grabs the bottom of the cage and pulls himself 
           inside.  Just in the nick of time.

           Down below, the perfect storm of foam closes in on Vince and 
           Gene, swallowing them up like Egyptians in the Red Sea.
           INT.  INSIDE THE CAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The curvy, barely-dressed CAGE DANCER is in her zone.  
           Gyrating to the music, eyes closed.  She doesn’t even notice 
           Steven as he’s climbing up.

           Then, she turns around, and she’s face to face with him.

                                 CAGE DANCER
                        Hey!!  What the fuck-!?

                                 STEVEN
                        Please let me explain, ma’am.  My 
                        name is Steven Fortescue, and I’m 
                        about to break out with the most 
                        awful rash-

                                 CAGE DANCER
                        Get out!!

                                 STEVEN
                        Please let me stay!  I’ll dance if 
                        I have to!

                                 CAGE DANCER
                        Get out of my office!!  Now!!

           She starts throwing punches.  Steven puts his hands up and 
           shrieks.  There’s nowhere to go, and no way to dodge her.

                                 STEVEN
                        Please!  It’s an emergency!!

           The Cage Dancer shoves him with everything she’s got.

           Steven falls out of the cage, shrieking all the way down.

                                 STEVEN
                        Ahhhhhhhh!

           He disappears into the foam, and we hear a muffled thud as he 
           hits the floor. 

           The music stops.

           The crowd lulls, confused and alarmed by whatever just 
           happened.

           Vince and Gene rush through the foam, waving suds out of 
           their way, searching.

                                 VINCE / GENE
                        Steven!  
                        Where are you, kid?
           A few seconds go by, and no sign of him.  Did the fall kill 
           him?  Did the foam?

           Then, a creature bursts up from the froth with a mighty roar.

                                 STEVEN
                        Rrrrahhhhhh!

           Actually, it’s more like a cry of terror.  Steven has mutated 
           into a hideous freak.  His face swollen beyond recognition.  
           His eyes contorted, his ears and nose mushroomed, his lips 
           purple, his glasses gone.  He looks like the Toxic Avenger.

                                 STEVEN
                        Lettt meee out!!

           Girls scream.  Guys scream.  The crowd panics and flees as if 
           a ravenous zombie were loose in their midst.

           INT.  NEAR THE COATROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jeff turns a corner, and finally finds some privacy.  He 
           calls Monica.  Again.  She picks up after half a ring. 

           We don’t hear her end of the conversation, and we don’t have 
           to.  Jeff’s frantic, defensive tone says it all.

                                 JEFF
                        Monica!  I...  OK, listen, don’t 
                        get mad.  I’m at a nightclub.
                            (pause)
                        Yeah, I know, honey, but we’re only 
                        staying for one drink!  I promise!  
                        You have my word, I’ll be home by-

           Then, Jeff hears the screams.  He steps out from his corner 
           and approaches the crowd.  That’s when he sees:

           Steven, lurching through the foam, horribly disfigured, arms 
           outstretched.  Blind as a bat without his glasses.  Vince and 
           Gene are chasing after him, like two Dr. Frankensteins 
           pursuing an escaped monster.

           The rest of the crowd runs for their lives, screaming.

           A buxom blonde slips in the foam and falls to the floor, 
           helpless in the creature’s path.  She screams her lungs out 
           as Steven staggers toward her.  A classic horror movie 
           moment, and Steven’s the monster.

           Jeff blinks in disbelief. 

                                 JEFF
                        Honey, I’ll call you back!
           He snaps his phone shut and rushes into the foam to help his 
           friends.

           EXT.  F CLUB, BACK ALLEY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           The guys have retreated to a dark, smelly alley behind the 
           nightclub.  Luckily, there’s a hose.

           Steven is stripped down to his tightie-whities, leaning on a 
           dumpster, shivering while Vince sprays him down.  Still 
           swollen and disfigured, unrecognizable beneath the welts.

                                 VINCE
                            (quietly, to Jeff)
                        You got a boner yet?

                                 JEFF
                        Exactly what part of this situation 
                        should I find arousing?

           Jeff cleans Steven’s glasses, then hands them back.

                                 JEFF
                        Here, Steven.  I think you’re 
                        improving.

                                 GENE
                        Don’t patronize the kid.  He looks 
                        like a goddamn leper.

                                 STEVEN
                        I need Allergin.  It’s only gonna 
                        get worse unless we find a drug 
                        store and get me some Allergin. 

                                 GENE
                        How ‘bout you go wait in the car, 
                        and we’ll stop on the way home?

                                 VINCE
                        Wait next to the car.

                                 JEFF
                        Nobody’s waiting in the car.  
                        There’s gotta be a drug store on 
                        the island.

                                 VINCE
                        And what if there’s not?  We can’t 
                        go out in public with The Hunchback 
                        of Notre Dame.

           Jeff takes out his cell and holds it up to the moonlight.  
           The screen blinks and flickers as suds drip off.
                                 JEFF
                        Oh, son of a bitch!  That stupid 
                        foam screwed up my phone!

           Vince inspects his own- also soggy and useless.

                                 VINCE
                        Ah, fuck.  Mine too.

                                 GENE
                        And that’s why they had a locker 
                        room, you dumb shits.

                                 STEVEN
                        I need Allergin.

                                 JEFF
                        If I don’t call Monica back, she’s 
                        gonna think I’m out having fun!

                                 VINCE
                        Oh, forget about your bucket wife 
                        already.  They respect you more if 
                        you give ‘em dead air once in a 
                        while.

                                 GENE
                        Damn right, that’s why I don’t have 
                        a cell phone.  Technology is for 
                        queers.

                                 JEFF
                        I hung up on her mid-sentence.  You 
                        ever hang up on a woman who didn’t 
                        flip out about it? 

                                 STEVEN
                        I need Allergin!

                                 VINCE
                        OK OK!  We’ll find a phone!  We’ll 
                        find some fucking Allergin!  Jesus 
                        Christ, one little medical 
                        emergency and everybody freaks out!

           EXT.  THRIFT DRUG - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           In a dark corner of Applejack Island, the last of the Thrift 
           Drug stores still stands.  

           The guys exit the store.  Steven opens a bottle of Allergin, 
           pours some into a plastic spoon, winces as he swallows, and 
           then looks at his friends, hopeful.  But no change.
                                 STEVEN
                        How do I look?

                                 GENE
                        You should probably just chug that 
                        thing, kid.

           Steven grimaces as he takes another sip, now from the bottle.   

                                 JEFF
                        There’s gotta be a pay phone around 
                        here somewhere.

                                 VINCE
                        I think I saw one back in 1985.

           He spots one.  An old-fashioned phone booth, across the 
           street, in front of a dilapidated liquor store.

                                 JEFF
                        Bingo.

           EXT.  LIQUOR STORE - A MOMENT LATER

           Jeff hurries to the phone booth, only to find a frayed wire 
           where the receiver should be.

                                 JEFF
                        Damn it!

           He looks around, and notices two ADOLESCENT PUNKS, standing 
           at the side of the parking lot- actual punks, with mohawks, 
           piercings, spiked collars, etc.  12 years old, if that.

           He clears his throat and approaches.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey guys.  Sorry to interrupt the, 
                        uh, loitering, but do either of you 
                        have a cell phone I could use?  
                        It’s an emergency.

           The Punks exchange a look.  Not especially friendly.

                                 PUNK #1
                        It’s gonna cost you.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll give you five bucks.  Five 
                        bucks for five minutes.  Please, 
                        I’m desperate here.

                                 PUNK #1
                        We don’t want money.
                                 PUNK #2 
                        We want alcohol.

           Jeff stares at the Punks, and now it makes sense.  This is 
           why they’re staked out in front of a liquor store.

           Vince, Gene, and Steven approach, observing as Jeff 
           negotiates.  Steven now finally returning to normal.

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t buy you alcohol.  That’s 
                        against the law.  I’m offering you 
                        five bucks and good karma, fair 
                        enough?

                                 PUNK #1
                        Explain to me how to get drunk on 
                        good karma.

                                 VINCE
                        Just buy ‘em some booze, Jeff.  
                        Nobody likes a role model. 

                                 JEFF
                        They’re minors.

                                 VINCE
                        Oh, and you never snuck a drink 
                        when you were a kid?  I had my 
                        first beer when I was 13 and look 
                        at me now.  I’m basically a genius.

           Jeff stews for a moment, and then turns back to the Punks:

                                 JEFF
                        What do you want?

           INT.  LIQUOR STORE - A MINUTE LATER

           Jeff hands his credit card to the little old Korean behind 
           the register, who reaches beneath the counter and produces a 
           bottle of Absinthe.  And not the mass-produced, Americanized 
           brand.  This is the real shit, imported from Switzerland with 
           a green fairy on the label.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve never even heard of Absinthe.  
                        Is it strong?

                        gonna be absinthe from school for a

                        You know we could get arrested for 
                        this.  Contributing to the 
                        delinquency of a minor.

                                 GENE
                        Contributing my ass.  Those kids 
                        were delinquents when we got here.

           CA-CHING.  The Korean bags the Absinthe and hands it to Jeff.

           EXT.  LIQUOR STORE - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys exit the store, but the Punks are gone.  Jeff looks 
           around, confused.

                                 JEFF
                        Ah, great.  Where’d they go?

                                 PAUNCHY COP 
                        Looking for somebody?

           The guys spin around and see TWO COPS approaching.  One big, 
           paunchy, out of shape.  The other short, stocky, steroids for 
           breakfast.  Imagine Kevin Smith and Henry Rollins.

                                 JEFF
                        Excuse me?

                                 PAUNCHY COP
                        Who exactly are you lookin’ for?

           Jeff hesitates and turns to Vince for help.  No luck.

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah, Jeff.  Who are you looking 
                        for?

                        I really hope you guys aren’t 
                        buying alcohol for minors.

                                 JEFF
                        No, no sir.  Definitely not.

                                 PAUNCHY COP
                        You sure about that?  ‘Cause we 
                        just ran two of ‘em outta here.  
                        Two little fuckers, always hassling 
                        folks to buy ‘em Absinthe.

                                 JEFF
                        Uh-uh.  Haven’t seen ‘em.

                        abide on this island, and that’s 
                        drunk kids.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s a good policy.

                                 STEROID COP
                        What’s in the bag?

           Oh, shit.  The guys look at each other, but nobody answers.

                                 STEROID COP
                        Let’s have it.

           Jeff nervously hands the paper bag to Paunchy.  He reaches in 
           and reveals the bottle of Absinthe.  The cops share a look.

                                 PAUNCHY COP
                        OK, up against the car.  Hands on 
                        the hood.

                                 JEFF
                        Sir, please.  I can explain.

                                 STEROID COP
                        Hands on the hood, motherfucker!

           The guys do as they’re told.  The Cops pat them down.

                        Sir, if I may.  I studied law and

                        entirely circumstantial.

                        Yeah, that’s right.  That bottle 
                        was purchased for our own personal 
                        enjoyment.

                            (scoffs)
                        Oh, you guys drink Absinthe?

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah, that’s right.  We drink 
                        Absinthe.  We drink Absinthe on the 
                        reg.

           The Cops exchange a look.  Steroids hands Vince the bottle.

                                 STEROID COP
                        Bottoms up.

           Vince looks down at the bottle, and realizes what he just 
           signed up for.

           The Cops stare at him.  Doubting him.  Challenging him.

                        OK.  No sweat. 

           Vince opens the bottle and summons his nerve.  

           Then, he takes a swig.  Spontaneous combustion in his mouth.  
           Fire lapping the walls of his throat.  But he gets it down.

                        the spot.

           The Cops stare him down, not even close to satisfied. 

           Vince stares back.  Reluctantly, he takes another, bigger 
           swig.  He wipes his mouth, trying not to gag, but gagging 
           anyway. 

                                 VINCE

                        Here you go, Jeff.

           Vince passes the bottle to Jeff, and the Cops nod.  

           Jeff looks at the bottle, a cold sweat coming over him.  He 
           takes a gulp, coughs uncontrollably, and passes it to Gene.  

           Gene guzzles the Absinthe.  A commendable effort, but even he 
           can’t get it down without his eyes watering.

           The Cops grin as the guys pass the bottle back and forth, 
           Jeff and Vince gagging like schoolgirls.

           Steroids pulls his gun and FIRES at Vince’s feet.  Vince 
           jumps backwards, stunned.

           Steroids FIRES three more times.  BAM BAM BAM.  Each shot 
           coming closer to Vince’s heels.

                        OK!  OK!  I’m drinking!

           He guzzles more Absinthe, his heart racing.

           EXT.  STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Vince discards the empty bottle in a trash can as the guys 
           lumber across the street, aptly named Street.  Their mouths 
           still burning, their legs beginning to wobble.  All except 
           for Steven, who’s still chipper and sober.

                                 STEVEN

                        driver tonight.  If I’d a’ drank

                        chugging Absinthe.  That stuff

                        Absinthe was illegal for years.

                        That’s a bunch of hooey.  Some 
                        pussy Congressman probably crashed 
                        his car.  

           Gene suddenly pauses, staring uncertainly at the street in 
           front of them.

                                 GENE
                        Where’d that Yeti come from?

                        What?

           Everybody stops walking.  Up ahead of them, a HOOKER in a fur 
           coat is crossing the street.  Gene stares at her, fixated.

                                 GENE

                        You just keep walking straight back 
                        to Nepal, motherfucker!

           The Hooker looks up at him and nervously quickens her stride.

                        I say we just go back to the-

           Jeff takes a step forward, but his leg turns to jelly.  He 
           falls to his knees like an infant wavering in his first step.

                                 JEFF
                        Something’s wrong with my legs.

           Vince bursts out laughing.  Instantly wasted.

                                 JEFF
                        My legs.  I can’t feel my legs.  
                        This isn’t funny, Vince!  

           Vince laughs harder and harder, holding his sides, tears 
           streaming.  Not even reacting to Jeff anymore, just 
           uncontrollably cracking up.

           Steven stares at his friends, frightened.  Jeff losing power 
           over his limbs, Vince laughing like a mental patient.

           Gene rolls up his sleeves and lumbers toward the Hooker.  

                                 GENE
                        OK, fuckface.  I warned you.

           She sees him coming and runs off, screaming.

           Steven grabs Gene and pulls him back to the group.

                                 STEVEN
                        No, Gene!  There’s no such thing as 
                        Yetis in this part of the world!  
                        Leave that poor woman alone!

           Jeff grabs a lamppost for leverage and labors back to his 
           feet, legs quivering.
                                 JEFF
                        My feet are numb...  My legs are 
                        useless...  The impotency is 
                        spreading...  

           Vince howls with laughter, rolling on his back.

                                 STEVEN
                        Everybody pull yourselves together.  
                        Y’all are acting like a bunch of 
                        crazy homeless veterans! 

           Steven takes Vince’s hand and pulls him up off the ground.  
           Jeff wobbles toward them and grabs Steven for support.

                                 STEVEN
                        Let’s all just call it a night, OK?  
                        Does anybody remember how to get 
                        back to the garage?

           He looks around, overwhelmed, but can’t get a sense of 
           direction.  It’s a block full of dark, unmarked buildings, 
           possibly abandoned.

           Then, two SHOWGIRLS appear at the edge of the street.  Like, 
           actual Vegas showgirls, wearing sequinned costumes, 
           extravagant headresses and giant heels.  They hurry across 
           the road and approach what seems to be an empty building.

           But as the door opens and the Showgirls slip inside, the guys 
           catch a glimpse of a lively, crowded casino.  Chiming slot 
           machines, spinning roulette wheels, beautiful women, and 
           bouncy swing music.  It’s only a fleeting glance, and then 
           the heavy, sound-proof door swings shut again.

           The guys do a collective double-take. 

                                 STEVEN
                        OK, now I’m seeing things. 

                                 JEFF
                        No, I saw it, too. 

                                 VINCE
                        I saw girls. 

                                 GENE
                        I saw gambling.

                                 VINCE
                        Asian girls.

                                 GENE
                        Don’t wait up.
           Gene marches toward the casino.  Vince follows.

                                 STEVEN
                        Gene!  Vince!  Get back here, we’re 
                        supposed to stick together!

           Steven follows, with Jeff hanging on him, slowing him down.

           INT.  CASINO - HOURS PASSING

           This is where the night goes off the rails.  The guys 
           discover an underground Casablanca-style casino, and a wild 
           MONTAGE of high-rolling, hard-partying mayhem ensues.  
           Through the drunken haze, we see: 

           - Vince, playing craps with a group of girls.  Crashing the 
           photos of a second group.  He performs a magic trick for a 
           third group, making his wedding band disappear with a quick 
           sleight of hand.

           - Gene, at the blackjack table.  Betting big and drinking 
           bigger.  A cocktail waitress approaches with his drink.  In 
           one fell swoop, he grabs the drink, chugs it, smashes the 
           empty glass on the floor, grabs the waitress, kisses her, and 
           then smacks her ass as he returns to the game.

           - Steven, wearily attempting to control his friends.  Gene 
           raises another shot, Steven swats it away, Gene mouths the 
           words, Don’t be a queer.  Vince gets down on one knee, 
           proposing to a showgirl, and Steven pulls him up to his feet.  

           - Jeff, wandering through the casino, exploring the games, 
           marveling at the shiny machines.  Drunk off his ass, but 
           finally starting to enjoy himself.  Big smile.

           We see the casino through Jeff’s eyes.  People laughing and 
           cheering, machines chiming, time passing.  The world spins 
           around him, fast and fuzzy, louder and louder. 

           Then, he spots a pay phone.  Finally!  He rushes over, plunks 
           some change in, and dials.  The call rings, then goes to 
           voicemail.

                                 MONICA’S VOICEMAIL
                        Hi, it’s Monica.  Leave a message.

           He takes a deep breath.  Determined to leave a sober, 
           articulate message.

                                 JEFF
                        Monica, it’s me.  Listen, I know 
                        it’s late, and I know you’re 
                        concerned, but I will absolutely 
                        positively be at brunch at 9AM 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (cont'd)
                        tomorrow, and even though your 
                        grandparents are old and scary, I’m 
                        gonna charm the shit outta them and 
                        Poopy’s gonna give me a job, or 
                        else I swear to God I’ll cut his 
                        fucking throat.
                            (confused pause)
                        No, wait.  That sounded bad.  I 
                        don’t know where that came from.  
                        But anyway, what are you wearing?  
                            (confused pause)
                        Honey?  You still there?

           Jeff trails off, confused, when his eyes fall upon:

           Monica.  In the casino.  Crossing the crowd with three of her 
           girlfriends, all of them glammed up for a big night.

           Jeff stares at her, dumbfounded.  Where did she come from?  
           And what the hell is she doing here?

           He rubs his eyes, trying to clear the fog from his mind.  
           Then, he loses sight of her in the crowd.  

                                 STEVEN
                        Jeff!  There you are!

                                 JEFF
                        Huh?

           Jeff snaps out of his daze, the world clear and steady again.  
           Steven is at his side, exasperated.

                                 STEVEN
                        For goodness sake, you can’t just 
                        wander off like that!  We’re in a 
                        secret casino, y’all are drunk, and 
                        some of these games give the 
                        dealers an unfair advantage!

           Steven takes Jeff’s hand and leads him to a blackjack table, 
           where Gene is lost in the game and Vince is babbling to a 
           waitress.

                                 STEVEN
                        Now, you just stay put!  Buddy 
                        system from now on!

                                 JEFF
                        Monica.  She’s here somewhere.

                                 STEVEN
                        Her Book Club meets at a casino?

                                 JEFF
                        No.  But she’s here.  I saw her.
                                 STEVEN
                        Jeff, I think maybe that’s the 
                        Absinthe messing with your mind.  
                        Vince thought he saw Princess Diana 
                        by the craps table before. 

                                 VINCE
                        It was her!  She’s alive, damn it! 

                                 STEVEN
                        I pray to God that’s true somehow, 
                        but Princess Di wouldn’t be seen in 
                        a place like this!  She’s royalty!

           As Vince and Steven debate, Jeff spots the same group of 
           women.  Except this time, he gets a clearer look.  It’s not 
           Monica, just a passing resemblance.

           He pauses, relieved, as the lookalike walks by. 

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, you’re right.  It’s not her.  

                                 VINCE
                        Don’t worry, pal.  Even if she is 
                        here, she’ll never recognize you.

                                 JEFF
                        Why not?

                                 VINCE
                        Because you’re having fun.

           Vince and Steven both laugh.  

           Jeff doesn’t.  It lands hard.

                                 JEFF
                        Guys, how long have we been doing 
                        Guys Night for?

                                 VINCE
                        Shit, let me think.  The very first 
                        one was Jillian’s 35th birthday, 
                        that was about three years ago.

                                 JEFF
                        We’ve been doing Guys Night every 
                        month for three years and you’ve 
                        never seen me have fun?

                                 VINCE
                        Fun?  I can’t even remember the 
                        last time you laughed, and I say 
                        hilarious things constantly.
                                 STEVEN
                        You’re still good company.  Every 
                        boy scout troop needs a stiff old 
                        scoutmaster.

                                 JEFF
                        I used to be fun.  Back before I 
                        failed out of grad school, I 
                        partied so hard that I failed out 
                        of grad school.  
                            (pause)
                        I was different then.  I was 
                        Classic Jeff.  Classic Jeff once 
                        arm-wrestled a lesbian for a night 
                        with a bi-sexual cheerleader. 
                            (pause)
                        Now, I work 40 hours a week like 
                        it’s my job, and I can’t even get a 
                        boner.

                                 VINCE
                        Don’t talk that way.  I’m on a 
                        mission to get your dick hard 
                        tonight, and there aren’t many guys 
                        I would say that to.

                                 STEVEN
                        That’s right, Jeff.  That little 
                        old ding-dong’s gonna come back to 
                        life, and he’ll be sturdier than 
                        ever.  Just you wait.

                                 JEFF
                            (not convinced)
                        I hope you guys are right.  I’m too 
                        young to be this old.

           Jeff rubs his face, the spell of the Absinthe gradually 
           weakening.  Still drunk, but getting his wits back. 

           A round of cheers from the blackjack table.

           That’s when Jeff notices Gene’s huge pile of chips.  He’s 
           winning big, attracting a crowd.  Deadly serious, not 
           acknowledging anybody except the Dealer, and systematically 
           kicking her ass.

                                 JEFF
                        Wow.  Gene’s on fire.

                                 VINCE
                        Shhhh.  Don’t disturb him.  He’s in 
                        some kinda drunken gambling trance.
                                 JEFF
                        How much is he up?

                                 VINCE
                        I lost count when that redhead 
                        walked by, but somewhere around ten 
                        G’s.

                                 JEFF
                        Ten thousand dollars?  
                            (oh, shit)
                        How long have we been here?

           He stands on his toes, anxiously searching for a clock.  No 
           such thing in a casino.

                                 STEVEN
                        Mmm, I’d say three, four hours.

                                 JEFF
                        Three or four hours!?

           We cut back to Gene, who mumbles to himself and raps the 
           table with his knuckles.  Hit me.

           The Dealer hits him.

           Gene mumbles again, then makes a swiping motion.  I’ll stay.

           The Dealer flips her card.  She busts.

           A round of applause as Gene wins another stack of chips.  

           Gene grunts to himself and places another bet.

                                 JEFF
                        OK, we gotta leave!  Now!

                                 VINCE
                        Leave!?  Gene’s one blackjack away 
                        from that new liver, and you wanna 
                        leave!?

                                 JEFF
                        Just tell him to quit while he’s up 
                        and let’s go!  Monica’s gonna have 
                        my fucking balls for this!

           Vince exhales and throws his hands up.  What a buzzkill.  

           At that point, a large, surly PIT BOSS approaches Gene.  Six-
           foot-three, broad-shouldered, buzz cut, dark suit. 
                                 PIT BOSS
                        Excuse me, sir.  May I speak to you 
                        in private?

                                 GENE
                        Buzz off, flattop, you’re bad luck.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Allow me to rephrase the question.  
                        Leave your chips on the table and 
                        follow me.

           The smiles around the table suddenly vanish.  Vince steps in.

                                 VINCE
                        Whoa, what’s your problem, cowboy?  
                        We were just leaving.

                                 PIT BOSS
                            (to Vince)
                        You.  Shut your mouth.
                            (to Gene)
                        You.  This way.

                                 GENE
                        You.  Don’t be a queer.  I’m on a 
                        roll, now scram. 

           A tense pause.  The Pit Boss exchanges a glance with two 
           FLOORMEN- security guys who have been observing the exchange 
           from their stations.  Nobody moves. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Have it your way.

           He turns and leaves the table.  

           But obviously, this isn’t over.  The guys nervously scan 
           their surroundings.  They’re being watched by Floormen from 
           every corner.

                                 VINCE
                        Oh, crap.  What’d you do, Gene?

           The guys watch as the Pit Boss crosses the room and 
           approaches the CASINO MANAGER, who stands in the distance 
           with his back to them.  The Pit Boss whispers in the Casino 
           Manager’s ear. 

           So right now, the hierarchy is becoming apparent:  The 
           FLOORMEN are the muscle; a bunch of them scattered throughout 
           the casino, and they stay fairly invisible unless there’s a 
           problem.  The PIT BOSS is in charge of the Floormen.  And the 
           CASINO MANAGER is in charge of everybody.  He’s the guy you 
           really don’t wanna piss off.
           The Casino Manager turns around, and sure enough:  CARLO, the 
           heavy from the back of the Cadillac.  The same guy who told 
           them to leave town upon arrival.  He locks eyes with the 
           guys.  Instant recognition. 

                                 VINCE
                        Of course.

           Carlo nods to the Pit Boss, and both of them approach the 
           guys.  The onlookers quietly disperse.  Shit, meet fan.

                                 CARLO
                        My boys from Delaware.  You guys 
                        don’t take advice too well, do you.  
                        I tell you to go home, and you 
                        steal from my casino.

                                 VINCE
                        Steal?  Nobody stole anything! 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        The old man.  He’s a cheat.

                                 VINCE
                        Bull-shit!

                                 PIT BOSS
                        He was counting cards.

                                 VINCE
                        You can’t prove that!

                                 PIT BOSS 
                        He was counting out loud.

           Vince looks at Gene.  Gene shrugs, as if to say, yeah, maybe.

           Jeff and Steven swallow hard. 

                                 CARLO
                            (quietly, to the Pit Boss)
                        Take him downstairs.

           The Pit Boss gestures.  Two Floormen advance and grab Gene.

                                 VINCE
                        Hold on, hold on!  This is a big 
                        misunderstanding!  I can explain!

           Carlo cocks any eyebrow.  On that note, the Floormen pause, 
           Gene pinned tightly between them.  

           Carlo stares at Vince through narrow eyes.
                                 CARLO
                        Oh, yeah?  You got five seconds.

           Vince raises a finger, a determined expression on his face, 
           but says nothing.  Everybody watching him.

           Then, his face loses color.  He doubles over and pukes.

           Green vomit his the floor.  Everybody groans and recoils, 
           fearful for their shoes, momentarily distracted. 

           That’s when Gene spins around and punches one of the Floormen 
           across the jaw, laying him out across the blackjack table.  
           He kicks the other one in the balls. 

                                 GENE
                        See you in hell, suckers!

           Gene grabs Vince, and the guys run for it.  They scramble 
           through the maze of games and gamblers, searching for the 
           nearest escape. 

           But two new Floormen appear in their path, like linebackers 
           in the end zone.

           Gene thinks fast and snatches a tray of chips from a craps 
           table.  He throws it at the Floormen.  Chips fly everywhere.

           Before the chips even hit the ground, a crowd descends upon 
           them like buzzards on a carcass.  Greedy chaos.

           The guys plow through the frenzy and head for the exit.

           EXT.  CASINO - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys burst through the door and run for their lives.

           A few moments later, Carlo and his men emerge from the 
           casino.  Seriously pissed off, ready for blood.

           EXT.  ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys duck into a dark alley and race through the shadows.  
           As they’re running:

                                 JEFF
                        Damn it, Gene!  You can’t go around 
                        punching people in New Jersey!  
                        They invented the mafia here! 

                                 GENE
                        Oh, I suppose you little dandies 
                        had a better idea!
                                 JEFF
                        Were you counting cards or not!?

                                 GENE
                        No, I was rubbin’ a goddamned 
                        rabbit’s foot.  Of course I was 
                        counting cards!

                                 STEVEN
                        I just wanna go home!  This is a 
                        nice place to visit, but I don’t 
                        wanna die here!

           At that point, the bad guys appear behind them.  Still on 
           their asses, with the length of the alley between them.

           The guys reach the end of the alley and duck around the 
           corner.  That’s when they spot:

           EXT.  CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           The First Episcopal Church of Applejack Island.

                                 VINCE
                        Sanctuary!  

           They race toward the church and slam into the door.  Locked.

           Everybody looks around, and they spot another entrance.  The 
           church annex sits at the rear of the building.  Lights in the 
           windows.  They race for it.

           EXT.  ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           By the time the Floormen reach the end of the alley, they’ve 
           lost sight of the guys.  They look at each other, catching 
           their breath.

           A moment later, Carlo approaches.  The Floormen are afraid to 
           meet his eyes.  But he doesn’t explode, he just recalculates.

                                 CARLO
                        They’re driving a Land Rover 
                        Defender with Delaware plates.  Get 
                        eyes on every garage and parking 
                        lot in town, and don’t let ‘em 
                        leave the island.

           INT.  CHURCH ANNEX - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys burst into the annex and pull the doors shut behind 
           them.  Everybody out of breath, flushed with relief.
           One by one, they turn around.  That’s when they see:

           A room full of people, roughly 30 altogether, their folding 
           chairs forming a large half-circle.  Mostly men, a few women, 
           everybody staring at them.  Coffee and donuts in the back of 
           the room.  Apparently, some kind of support group.

           The shaggy, bearded ringleader at the head of the room waves 
           them over.  This is BARRY, 60ish, an aging hippie.

                                 BARRY
                        Hello there, welcome!  Come have a 
                        seat.  I’m Barry.

           The guys awkwardly shuffle toward the few free chairs, 
           exchanging dubious looks as they sit.

           For a long, strange pause, nothing is said.  Everybody just 
           watching the newcomers, sizing them up.

           Eventually, Barry turns to WADE, a shabby drifter-type.

                                 BARRY
                        Wade, would you like to continue?

                                 WADE
                        Uhh, yeah, so anyway, I told my old 
                        lady I was goin’ out for one drink.  
                        Course, there’s no such thing as 
                        one drink in this town.  I woke up 
                        three days later in the dumpster 
                        behind Clancy’s, with two black 
                        eyes and blood in my stool.  That 
                        was a year ago.  That was my rock 
                        bottom.

           Scattered mumbles and nods from the crowd.

                                 WADE
                        I almost relapsed tonight.  I got 
                        in a fight with the old lady, drove 
                        out here, walked up to Clancy’s and 
                        stood on the doorstep.  Took a lot 
                        of will power, but I walked away.  
                        And that’s how I got here.

           Polite applause from around the room.

                                 VINCE
                            (grumbles, to himself)
                        Jesus Christ, we’re in AA.

                                 BARRY
                        You did the right thing, man.  
                        Anybody else wanna share?
           AARON stands.  He’s slight, ineffectual, the sensitive type.

                                 AARON
                        I’m Aaron.  I’m from Toms River and 
                        I’ve been sober for three years.  
                            (breaks down, crying)
                        I got so tempted tonight.  Went out 
                        for a drive, just to clear my head, 
                        and before I knew it, I was back 
                        here on The Island.  I had a moment 
                        of weakness, but thank God, I made 
                        it here instead.

           Aaron sits, still sobbing.  Everybody claps.  Barry sniffles.

                                 BARRY
                        Amen, brother.  Glad you made it.  
                        Does anybody have any words for 
                        Aaron?

                                 GENE
                            (under his breath)
                        I got four words for him.

                                 JEFF
                        Shhh.

           The man seated next to Jeff stands up.  He’s a big, brawny 
           redhead named FITZIE.  A hardass fisherman-type.

                                 FITZIE
                        I’m Fitzie.  I live here on The 
                        Island, and I’m sober nine years.

           The crowd claps.  Jeff, Vince and Steven make sure to clap, 
           too.  Gene hiccups.

                                 FITZIE
                        When you’re a party boy, this 
                        island is paradise.  When you’re 
                        sober, it’s Guantanamo fucking Bay.

                                 CROWD
                        Hell yeah.
                        Damn right.

                                 FITZIE
                        So many times I thought about 
                        packin’ up and movin’ to the 
                        mainland.  Thing is, my house has 
                        been in the family for three 
                        generations.  So I’m still here, 
                        tryin’ to stay dry in a town 
                        overrun by drunks and whores.
                                 CROWD
                        Hell yeah. 
                        Damn right.

                                 FITZIE
                        Every night, I lie in bed, I listen 
                        to the sounds of other peoples’ 
                        parties.  When I fall asleep, I 
                        dream about murder.  Killin’ every 
                        single motherfucker on this island 
                        with a fillet knife.

                                 BARRY
                        OK, let’s try to stay positive 
                        here. 

                                 FITZIE
                        You know what my neighbors were 
                        doing when I left the house 
                        tonight?  Fillin’ a kiddie pool 
                        with Jack Daniels.  Whole block 
                        smells like whiskey.  I can handle 
                        the noise and the music, but the 
                        smell of Jack, it just pushes my 
                        crazy button.  I’d kill ‘em all and 
                        I’d sleep like a baby, I swear to 
                        fucking God.

           Vince holds his breath.  Jeff discreetly slides his chair 
           away from Fitzie.

                                 BARRY
                        OK.  Thanks for sharing, Fitzie.

           Scattered claps from around the room, and tension like a 
           thick fog.  Barry redirects the conversation.

                                 BARRY
                        Would any of the newcomers care to 
                        introduce themselves?

           Jeff and Vince check out the light fixtures, doing their best 
           to remain anonymous.  Gene hiccups.

                                 BARRY
                        Anybody?

           Steven stands up.  Jeff, Vince, and Gene look at him like 
           he’s walking into a firing squad.

                                 STEVEN
                        Hello, everyone.  My name is Steven 
                        Fortescue.  I’m originally from 
                        Ragbottom, Oklahoma, and I’m a 
                        Gemini.
           Polite applause from around the room, which encourages a 
           smile from Steven.

                                 STEVEN
                        And I would just like to say that I 
                        agree with this gentleman over 
                        here.  I have never cared for the 
                        smell of Jack Daniels.  It just 
                        smells like turpentine to me.

           A quiet pause.  Nobody is sure whether to clap at that.

                                 BARRY
                        Right on.  How’d you wind up here 
                        on The Island, Steven?  

                                 STEVEN
                        Oh, I’m just visiting.  Having a 
                        Guys Night with my friends.  

                                 BARRY
                        I see.  Is that what led you to our 
                        group tonight?  Is Guys Night a 
                        trigger for you?  

                                 STEVEN
                        A trigger?

                                 BARRY
                        A temptation to drink.

                                 STEVEN
                        No, I’m not drinking tonight.  To 
                        be totally honest, I’m just here to 
                        hide out for a while.

           What an idiot.  Jeff, Vince, and Gene scope out the nearest 
           exits.  Ready to make another run for it, if necessary.

           Barry turns deadly serious, staring at Steven as if he’s 
           reading his mind.

                                 BARRY
                        Steven, I’ve been doing this for 
                        twenty years.  Seen a lot of faces 
                        come through that door.
                            (tense pause)
                        But my first meeting, I was hiding 
                        out, too.  Sitting right where you 
                        are, just trying to live through 
                        the night.

           Steven exhales, relieved to have found a common soul.
                                 STEVEN
                        That’s exactly how I feel!  I just 
                        wanna live through the night.

                                 BARRY
                        Has your life become unmanageable?

                                 STEVEN
                        Unmanageable?  I do feel that way 
                        sometimes, sir.  Why, just a few 
                        hours ago, I was half-naked in an 
                        alleyway, gettin’ sprayed down by a 
                        strange hose, and I kept askin’ 
                        myself, how did it come to this?

                                 BARRY
                        I’ve been there, brother.  I’ve 
                        been half-naked in those alleyways, 
                        gettin’ sprayed by strange hoses 
                        for two bucks at a time.  

           Steven nods.  Not exactly on the same page.

                                 BARRY
                        Now, answer me this.  Are you here 
                        to admit that you’re powerless over 
                        alcohol?

                                 STEVEN
                        I am totally powerless!  I try to 
                        limit myself to just one, but if I 
                        have two or three, I get absolutely 
                        goofy!

                                 BARRY
                        We wanna help you, Steven.  Are you 
                        ready to accept help?

                                 STEVEN
                        I am, Barry!  I really am!

                                 BARRY
                        Embrace me, brother.

           Barry stands.  Steven approaches him.  They hug.  

           The entire crowd applauds.  Some standing, some cheering.  
           Fitzie is holding back tears.

           Jeff, Vince, and Gene stay in their seats.  Gene hiccups.
           INT.  CHURCH ANNEX - AN HOUR LATER

           The meeting is finally over.  Some people exiting, some 
           hanging around, bullshitting and drinking coffee.  

           Jeff, Vince, and Gene stand in the corner, impatiently 
           waiting for Steven, who’s saying his goodbyes.  

                                 JEFF
                        Well, that was the longest hour of 
                        my life, and I’ve seen every 
                        episode of Sex and the City.

                                 GENE
                        I’m about to take twelve steps 
                        right into oncoming traffic.

                                 VINCE
                        Can somebody please just grab 
                        Steven before they make him their 
                        new president?

           Steven finally returns, and he’s practically walking on air.

                                 STEVEN
                        Isn’t this fun?  I always thought 
                        these programs were full of hobos 
                        and Irishmen, but everybody here is 
                        so nice!

                                 GENE
                        Just wrap it up, will ya?  

                                 STEVEN
                        OK, OK.  I’m waitin’ on Maxine.  
                        She’s a new friend.

                                 VINCE
                        Hey, we’re not here to make friends 
                        with these partypoopers.  Let’s get-

           Vince trails off as Steven’s new friend approaches.  MAXINE 
           is a statuesque knockout, mid 30s.  Poised and sophisticated, 
           all brainy sex appeal, like a TV newswoman.

                                 MAXINE
                        Hey guys.  Steven says you need a 
                        lift?

                                 VINCE
                        Um, yeah, we’re parked at a garage, 
                        down by the, um, Boulevard.
                                 MAXINE
                        Sure, no problem.  I’m this way.

           She heads for the door, Vince stealing a look at her perfect 
           ass as she does.

                                 VINCE
                        God damn.  Where the hell was I 
                        when that woman was a drunk?

           EXT.  CHURCH ANNEX - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys exit the church and Maxine leads their way.  She 
           points to the lavish, towering condo at the end of the block.

                                 MAXINE
                        My condo’s over here.  Just gotta 
                        run upstairs, grab my car keys.

           INT.  MAXINE’S CONDO, ELEVATOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Maxine pushes the button for the top floor.  The doors close.  
           The guys stand shoulder to shoulder, quietly impressed.

                                 VINCE
                        So you live here on The Island?

                                 MAXINE
                        Just weekends, here and there.  
                        Whenever my girlfriends and I need 
                        the occasional break from married 
                        life.

                                 VINCE
                        Right on.  I take occasional breaks 
                        all the time.

                                 MAXINE
                        You guys are welcome to stay, hang 
                        out if you want.  If you’re not in 
                        a rush.

                                 JEFF
                        I have a 9AM brunch.

                                 MAXINE
                        9AM brunch is breakfast.

                                 JEFF
                        My point is, we’ve had a very 
                        exciting night and I’m afraid I 
                        need some sleep.
                                 MAXINE
                        And my point is, sleep is for 
                        people afraid of having a very 
                        exciting night.

           Vince cocks an eyebrow, impressed, then points at Maxine.

                                 VINCE
                        Winner.

           INT.  MAXINE’S CONDO - A MOMENT LATER

           Maxine leads the guys into her place.  Plushly furnished, 
           three bedrooms, fully-stocked bar, floor-to-ceiling windows 
           overlooking the ocean.  Gas fireplace blazing, club music on 
           the stereo.

                                 STEVEN
                        My goodness!  This must be the 
                        fanciest condominium I’ve ever 
                        seen, and I’ve seen at least four.

           Maxine slips behind the bar as the guys survey the room.  
           Vince plops down on the couch, making himself right at home.

                                 MAXINE
                        What are you guys drinking?

                                 VINCE
                        Are you kidding, after a night of 
                        AA?  I never wanted a beer so bad 
                        in my life.

                                 GENE
                        Same here.

                                 STEVEN
                        Ginger ale, if you have it.

                                 MAXINE
                        I’ve got Heineys, is that cool?

                                 VINCE
                        I would love some Heiney.

                                 JEFF
                        Now, I’m confused, Maxine.  Are you 
                        or are you not in recovery?

                                 MAXINE
                        If I don’t have a little fun 
                        sometimes, what’s there to talk 
                        about at the next meeting?
                                 VINCE
                        That’s probably the smartest thing 
                        I ever heard come out of a chick’s 
                        mouth.  Get Jeff a beer, too.

                                 JEFF
                        No, I’m fine.  I’m trying to sober 
                        up.

                                 MAXINE
                        Glass of water?

                                 JEFF
                            (sighs)
                        Yeah, sure.

           Maxine passes out drinks.

                                 MAXINE
                        Cheers.

           The guys mumble thank-yous, and Maxine returns to the bar to 
           fix one for herself.

           At that point, two sexy, barely-dressed women emerge from one 
           of the bedrooms.  BRENDA and KELLY, early 30s, are just as 
           gorgeous as Maxine, and also have that classy-whore vibe.  
           Both holding drinks, giggling in a way that suggests trouble.

                                 BRENDA
                        Oh, hey everybody!

                                 KELLY
                        Didn’t know we had company.

           The guys don’t realize that they’re staring.  

                                 MAXINE
                        Boys, these are my girlfriends.  
                        Girls, these are my new boyfriends.

                                 BRENDA
                        I’m Brenda.

                                 KELLY
                        I’m Kelly.

           The guys mumble hellos, all of them a little humbled.  

                                 KELLY
                        This should be interesting.  We’ve 
                        never taken on four at a time.

           The girls giggle.
           The guys do a collective double-take.  These chicks are 
           either aspiring comediennes or big-time sluts.

                                 BRENDA
                        I don’t know about Grandpa though. 

                                 KELLY
                        Hey Grandpa, do all your parts 
                        still work?

                                 GENE
                        Grab your ankles, let’s find out.

           The girls laugh loudly, impressed by Gene’s frankness. 

                                 GENE
                        Speaking of which, where’s the 
                        head?  I gotta poison the well.

           Maxine points the way, and Gene slips into the bathroom.   

           Kelly turns up the music.  Brenda dims the lights.  They 
           begin to dance together.  Slowly and playfully undressing 
           each other.  Boobs popping out all over the place.

           The guys can’t believe their eyes.  Jeff sits down next to 
           Vince, pulling Steven along with him.

                                 JEFF
                        This is totally shady.

                                 JEFF
                        Something’s off.  Hot, rich women 
                        don’t seduce middle-class guys for 
                        fun.

                                 VINCE
                        Of course they do.  It happens 
                        every night on Cinemax. 

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, get real.  I’m pretty sure 
                        these women are prostitutes.

                                 STEVEN
                        Prostitutes?  I don’t think their 
                        husbands would condone that.

                                 JEFF
                        They don’t have husbands, Steven.  
                        This is a shakedown.  They’re pros.  
                                 VINCE
                        OK, so what if they are?  We don’t 
                        have to fuck ‘em, we’ll just make 
                        ‘em put on a weird sex show.

                        Y’all are being silly.  Prostitutes 
                        are Puerto Rican with fishnet 
                        stockings and secret male genitals.  
                        I’m gonna ask Maxine- 

                                 VINCE
                        No, don’t ask her, that’s rude.

                                 STEVEN
                            (clears his throat)
                        Maxine, if you don’t mind my 
                        asking, just what do you do for a 
                        living?

           Maxine looks up from the lemon she’s slicing.

                                 MAXINE
                        I know what you’re getting at, 
                        Steven.  And no.  We don’t want 
                        your money.

           The guys chuckle nervously.  Maxine resumes slicing.

                                 MAXINE
                        I’m in medical sales.

                        Medical sales.  Good for you!
                            (quietly, to Jeff)
                        I’m pretty sure we can still talk 
                        ‘em into a weird sex show. 

                                 JEFF
                        You keep saying “weird.”  Why does 
                        it have to be weird?

                                 VINCE
                        OK, the usual sex show, whatever 
                        that is.  Let’s not forget the 
                        whole point of this evening, Jeff.  
                        Pun intended.

           Jeff looks up at Brenda and Kelly.  Grinding each other, 
           making eyes at them.  Meanwhile, Vince whispers in his ear 
           like a devil on his shoulder.
                                 VINCE
                        I know you’re getting a boner.  My 
                        Aunt Grace would have a boner by 
                        now.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s not gonna be easy to sustain 
                        with you whispering in my ear.

                                 VINCE
                        So you are?

                                 JEFF
                            (annoyed pause)
                        One drink.  Only because I don’t 
                        wanna be rude.  

           Vince grins.  Jeff sinks into the sofa and sips his water. 

           We hold on Brenda and Kelly, dancing and undressing, as Jeff 
           watches.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Now, some people would consider 
                        this cheating already.  I disagree, 
                        and I’m very firm on this.  See, if 
                        this were back in the day, Jeff 
                        would be finger-blasting one or 
                        both of these chicks already.  So 
                        let’s take a moment to admire his 
                        restraint, despite the fact that 
                        these two dumpsters are totally 
                        begging for it.  That’s called 
                        dedication, ladies.  If it were up 
                        to me, I’d be splitting somebody’s 
                        vulva in half.

           Just as Brenda and Kelly are about to start humping, Gene 
           returns.  His good humor noticeably absent.

                                 GENE
                        Put those drinks down, boys.  We’re 
                        leaving.

                                 VINCE
                        Like fucking hell we are.

                                 MAXINE
                        What’s your rush, Grandpa?  

                                 GENE
                        Better luck next time, lady.
                            (to the guys)
                        They want our organs.
           The party comes to an awkward halt.  Maxine puts her drink 
           down.  Brenda and Kelly stop dancing. 

                                 VINCE

                        Not like that, asshole.  There’s 
                        chlorhexidine in the bathroom and 
                        the tub’s full of ice.  This 
                        broad’s not in AA.  She was there 
                        lookin’ for clean kidneys.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’ve heard that urban legends are 
                        all totally based on true stories.

                        Where’d you hear that?

                        Friend of a friend.

                                 JEFF
                            (stands)
                        OK, maybe we should just leave.

           Maxine calmly reaches behind the bar.  She pulls out a 
           revolver and twists a silencer onto the barrel.

                                 MAXINE
                        Nobody’s leaving.  Sit down.

           Everybody freezes at the sight of the gun.  

                                 GENE
                        Put the piece away, kiddo.  You 
                        look like an idiot.

                                 MAXINE
                        Sit down, Grandpa.  

           She steadies the gun on Gene.

           Gene stares her down, unafraid. 

                                 GENE
                        I said put it away, bitch, before I 
                        start passin’ out knuckle 
                        sandwiches.
           Maxine cocks the hammer.

           We hold on Gene, sizing her up.

           We hold on Maxine, the gun steady in her hand.

           Gene approaches her.

           Maxine pulls the trigger.

                                 JEFF / VINCE / STEVEN
                        No!!

           PSHHHT.  Gene takes a bullet in the chest.  It knocks him off 
           his feet and onto his back.

           An incredulous pause.  

           A whisper of smoke from the silencer.  

           Jeff, Vince, and Steven stare at Gene’s body, motionless on 
           the floor.

           Maxine turns the gun on them.

                                 MAXINE
                        You three.  Sit.  Drink.

           The guys abruptly take their seats, as Vince clumsily pleads 
           for mercy.

                                 VINCE
                        Maxine, please...  You don’t wanna 
                        do this...  My organs are highly 
                        toxic and contagious...

           Maxine approaches and cocks the hammer again.  Jeff, Vince, 
           and Steven sink into the couch, point blank and helpless.

                                 MAXINE
                        Drink.

           They raise their drinks to their lips, hands shaking.  Steven 
           nervously examines his glass of ginger ale.

                                 STEVEN
                        I can’t drink this.
                            (frightened pause)
                        I’m allergic to ice.

           Maxine coldly stares at him.  Give me a break.

                                 VINCE
                        Just take the ice out, Steven.
           Steven nervously fishes the ice out of his glass, lays it on 
           the coffee table, and sips the ginger ale. 

           Maxine gestures with the gun.

           Vince and Jeff also take small, frightened sips.

                                 BRENDA / KELLY
                        Maxine! 
                        Look out!

           Suddenly, Gene is behind her.  She spins around, but not 
           quick enough.  He deflects the gun and punches her.

           Maxine hits the floor.  The gun skids across the carpet and 
           under a couch.

           Brenda and Kelly advance.  Gene backhands Brenda, knocking 
           her over a coffee table, and then slugs Kelly, dropping her 
           to the floor.

           Maxine pops up again.  Then Brenda, then Kelly.  Attacking 
           like sexy zombies.  Gene lays them out, one after the other, 
           with vicious right hooks.  

           Jeff, Vince, and Steven just watch, bewildered, as Gene beats 
           up three women without breaking a sweat.

           Finally, when all three are down at once, Gene turns to the 
           guys:

                                 GENE
                        The hell are you waiting for?  
                        Let’s get outta here!

           INT.  HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys burst out of the apartment and race down the hall.  
           They plow through the door of the stairwell and disappear.

           A moment later, Maxine staggers out of her room, her mouth 
           gushing blood.  She looks at the empty hallway and wipes her 
           mouth.  Defeat.

                                 MAXINE
                        Fuck!

           EXT.  CONDO - A MOMENT LATER

           The guys rush out of the condo, turn a corner, and catch 
           their breath at the side of the building.  Everybody scared 
           and bewildered.
                                 JEFF
                        Organ thieves!  I told you this was 
                        a bad idea, Vince! 

                                 VINCE
                        No, you said they were prostitutes!  
                        So we were both wrong!

                                 JEFF
                        Where’d they get you, Gene?  Are 
                        you shot?

           Gene confusedly pats himself down.

                                 GENE
                        It’s the damndest...  I don’t feel 
                        nothing...

           He finds a small hole in the front of his jacket, but no 
           wound in his chest.

           He reaches into his breast pocket and removes his flask.  A 
           hole in one side, a pimple on the other.  He shakes the flask 
           and hears a rattle.

           Stunned silence.  Steven crosses himself.

                                 GENE
                        Gentlemen, this might be a good 
                        time to go play some slots.

           He empties the flask into his hand, rolls a slug between his 
           fingers, and grins.  

           The other guys are too spooked to smile.

                                 VINCE
                        Holy shit.

                                 STEVEN
                        It’s a Guys Night miracle.

                                 GENE
                        My wife always said this flask was 
                        gonna kill me.  Well, I can’t wait 
                        to see her stupid face now.

           Steven leans against the wall, suddenly overwhelmed.

                                 STEVEN
                        I feel faint.  All this excitement, 
                        messing with my head.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t feel so hot either.
                                 GENE
                        Whatever they drugged us with, it’s 
                        kickin’ in.  Hopefully, nobody 
                        drank enough to get knocked out for 
                        good.

                                 VINCE
                        I’m scared.  I’ve never been 
                        drugged by anybody but myself.

                                 JEFF
                        Let’s get back to the car.  Fast.

           The guys hurry toward the street, where a taxi is parked on 
           the curb.

           The CABBIE, an enormous Puerto Rican woman in fishnet 
           stockings, possibly transvestite, rolls down the window.

                                 JEFF
                        Are you on duty?

           She takes a good, hard look at Jeff, and smiles.

                                 CABBIE
                        I am now, papi.

           EXT.  STREET / INT.  TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Vince, Steven, and Gene are in the back, all three of them 
           breathing heavy, eyes glazing over.  Like three lobotomies.

           Jeff sits in the passenger seat, sweating unnaturally, 
           struggling to stay awake, feeling the Cabbie’s eyes on him.

                                 CABBIE
                        You alright?

                                 JEFF
                        Just anxious to get home.

           They ride in silence for a while, Jeff fighting the sandman.

                                 CABBIE
                        You know, we runnin’ a special this 
                        weekend.

                                 CABBIE (cont'd)
                        there, work all that anxiety right 
                        out. 

                                 JEFF
                        Just drive, OK?

           He’s desperately trying to keep his eyes open, but his head 
           suddenly weighs 100 pounds. 

                                 CABBIE
                        Might even be able to find you a 
                        coupon...

           The Cabbie reaches over and grabs his dick.  Jeff abruptly 
           wakes up and swats her hand away.

                                 JEFF
                        Just drive!  Please!  Vince, are we 
                        almost there!?

           In the back seat:  Vince, Steven, and Gene are out cold.  

           Jeff reaches back and smacks Vince across the mouth.  WHACK.

                                 VINCE
                        OK!  Jesus!  I’m up, I’m up!

                                 JEFF
                        Do not leave me alone up here!

           Steven chuckles, and then goes back to sleep.

           WHACK.  Jeff smacks Steven even harder.   

                                 STEVEN
                        Hey!

                                 JEFF
                        You, too!  Keep your eyes open!

                                 GENE
                        Better give me one of those.

           WHACK.  Jeff smacks Gene across the mouth, and Gene opens his 
           eyes again.

                                 JEFF
                        Now do me.

           BAM.  Gene punches Jeff in the nose, rocketing his head back.  

                                 JEFF
                        Owww!  Jesus Christ, Gene!  That 
                        was a punch!
                                 GENE
                        Don’t be a queer.

                                 JEFF
                        Who’s a queer!?  Call me queer one 
                        more time, old man.  I’ll beat you 
                        like a fucking pinata.

           Stunned silence from the back seat.  

                                 VINCE
                        Holy shit.  He’s back.

                                 STEVEN
                        Who’s back?

                                 VINCE
                        Classic Jeff!  It’s him!

           A moment of quiet reverence, everybody staring at Jeff as if 
           he just sprouted wings.

                                 JEFF
                        No, not Classic Jeff.  Still 
                        Married.  But when Married Jeff 
                        gets loud, Classic Jeff wakes up, 
                        and nobody wants that.  So get me 
                        off this fucking island and spare 
                        yourselves the wrath.

           INT.  GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The cab pulls away as the guys enter the garage.  Jeff leads, 
           with Vince, Gene, and Steven sauntering behind.

           But as they reach their parking spot:

                                 JEFF
                        Well, look at this.  Car’s gone.

           Vince looks up.  An empty space where his Rover should be. 

                                 VINCE
                        My Rover.

                        Where the hell is my Rover?

           Now, he’s wide awake, flushed with panic.

                                 VINCE
                        This is a mistake.  Gotta be a 
                        mistake.  It’s the wrong level, or 
                        the wrong garage-
                                 STEVEN
                        No, this is right where we left it.
                            (pause)
                        You know, I think somebody stole 
                        it.

                                 VINCE
                        Oh, you think so, Steven?  Well, 
                        thank God we brought the fucking 
                        gumshoe over here!

                                 GENE
                        Let’s not get hysterical.  First 
                        off, we gotta file a report.  Maybe 
                        we can use the phone over at the 
                        massage parlor.

                        Who didn’t lock their door?  Tell

                                 JEFF
                        Doesn’t have to be unlocked to be 
                        stolen.

                                 VINCE
                        But did you or did you not lock 
                        your door?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, I did.  Back off.

                                 VINCE
                        Gene?

                                 GENE
                        ‘Course I locked the door.  We’re 
                        one block down from the chicken-and-
                        waffles place.  ‘Course I locked 
                        it.

                                 VINCE
                        Steven?

           Steven is half-asleep, wobbling in place.

                                 VINCE
                        Steven.

                                 STEVEN
                            (wakes up)
                        Yes, I did.  You said, “everybody 
                        lock up,” I took my little thing 
                        out, I hit the button, and I-
                            (confused pause)
                                 VINCE
                        You what?

           Steven quietly re-traces his steps.  He takes his keys out of 
           his pocket, examining the electronic lock on his keychain.

                                 VINCE

                        remote control from your Prius.

                                 STEVEN
                        Yes, I know that, Vince!  It’s just 
                        a habit is all.  Force of habit.

                                 VINCE
                        You stupid fucking rube!!  Do you 
                        have any idea how long and hard I 
                        worked for that car!?

                                 STEVEN
                        I thought it was a birthday present 
                        from your wife.

                                 VINCE
                        Exactly!!  I had to be nice to my 
                        bucket wife for seven fucking 
                        years!!

           Vince doubles over, practically hyperventilating with anger.

                                 VINCE
                        I’m gonna kill you, Steven.  I’m 
                        gonna kill you.  I...

           Then, as the drugs intensify, anger ebbs into exhaustion.

                                 VINCE
                        I’m gonna rest.  And then I’m gonna 
                        kill you.  Don’t go anywhere.

           Vince leans against the concrete wall, and then sits down.  
           As soon as his ass hits the pavement, he’s out cold.  
                                 JEFF
                        Ah, for Christ’s sake.  Not this 
                        again.

           WHACK.  Jeff slaps him across the mouth.  No response.  

                                 JEFF
                        Vince!  Wake up!

           WHACK.  He slaps him again.  Still nothing.  Vince is lightly 
           snoring already, dead to the world.

           Jeff turns around, and discovers that Gene and Steven are 
           also unconscious.  Sitting against a car, leaning on each 
           other, sleeping like babies.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, that’s just beautiful.  I’m in 
                        a goddamned nursery.

           He fights back a yawn, contemplating his next move.

           Suddenly, a black Hummer with tinted windows speeds up the 
           ramp.  It roars toward Jeff and stops at his feet.

           The doors open.  The Pit Boss and four Floormen emerge.

                                 JEFF
                            (quietly, to himself)
                        OK.  What now?

           The bad guys approach, surrounding him on all sides.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Get in the car.

                                 JEFF
                        I have a 9AM brunch.

           The Pit Boss chuckles and exchanges a look with the Floormen.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        It’s just been cancelled.  Get in 
                        the car before you get hurt.

           Jeff sighs.  By this point, he’s more bored and annoyed than 
           intimidated.  He looks at the Floormen, towering over him.  
           He looks at his friends, useless.

                                 JEFF
                            (under his breath)
                        Alright, you fucks.  You want 
                        Classic Jeff, you got him.

           Jeff slugs the Pit Boss.  CRACK, right in the jaw.
           The Floormen advance.  Jeff headbutts the first one in the 
           teeth.  He kicks the second in the kneecap.  Fighting as 
           dirty as possible.  

           It’s a valiant effort, but he’s completely outnumbered.  
           Before long, he’s on the ground.  Still kicking and biting, 
           but without much effect.

           The Floormen overpower him, pummeling him even as they’re 
           dragging him toward the Hummer.

           INT.  WINE CELLAR - AN HOUR LATER

           Somewhere among the columns of wine bottles, in a dark, dank 
           cellar:  Jeff is bound to a folding chair, hands zip-tied 
           behind him, wearing nothing but his underwear.  He’s bloody 
           and swollen, the living shit now thoroughly kicked out of 
           him.   

           Vince, Steven, and Gene are also tied to their chairs, also 
           in their underpants.  Everybody slowly coming to.  Their 
           clothes lay in a pile nearby, wallets tossed on top.

           Vince lifts his head, his eyes slowly adjusting.

                        reason we’re here is the same 
                        reason I always lose so much money 
                        on Guys Night.  Because Gene cheats 
                        at cards.

                                 GENE
                        I never cheated you, you’re just 
                        lousy at poker.  You can’t even

                                 JEFF
                        This is your fault, Vince.  
                        Everyone else was content to sit 
                        around Steven’s apartment being 
                        bored.  But no.  You wanna get 
                        drunk and chase girls and stay out 
                        all night, ‘cause you can’t stand 
                        being 40 years old and married.

           A quiet moment as Vince digests all that.  Jeff nailed him.

                        You know what, you’re right.  I’m 
                        pathetic.  I’m still chasing the 
                        highs that I felt when I was young 
                        and single, because honestly, I 
                        can’t find the high in being old 
                        and married.  My life is a lie.
                            (pause)
                        But I still think this is Steven’s 
                        fault.

                                 JEFF
                        I swear to God, if I don’t make it 
                        to brunch-

                                 GENE
                        Jesus Mary and Joseph, enough about 
                        the brunch!  It’s a phony meal 
                        invented by queers, why is it so 
                        goddamned important!?

                                 JEFF
                        It’s really none of your business, 
                        Gene.  But it’s about a job, OK?

           A confused pause.
                                 STEVEN
                        You have a job.

                                 JEFF
                        A good job.  Monica’s grandfather 
                        is opening a new branch in Dover.  
                        I’m gonna swallow my pride and kiss 
                        his ass, and get the hell outta the 
                        DSE.

           Another confused pause.  Nobody saw this coming.

                                 STEVEN
                        Why would you wanna leave the DSE?

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah, what are you, stupid?  You 
                        get paid to sit around and bullshit 
                        with your bros all day.  Why would 
                        anybody walk away from that?

                                 JEFF
                        You’re not my bro, Vince.  You’re a 
                        guy I work with.  There’s a 
                        difference.

           A bitter pause.  Nobody responds.  Now, the toothpaste is out 
           of the tube.

                                 VINCE
                        Well, fuck you, then.

           A door creaks open.  Carlo enters, followed by his goons. 

           For a little while, he says nothing.  He looks down at the 
           guys as if they’re a mess on the floor.

                                 CARLO
                        Gentlemen.  I’m sure you realize by 
                        now that our little town operates, 
                        as we like to say, under the radar.  
                        We like it that way.  And we stay 
                        under the radar by following one 
                        simple rule.  If you make enemies 
                        on The Island, you don’t leave The 
                        Island.

                                 STEVEN
                        Sir, I would like you to know that 
                        I personally was not participating 
                        in any of those card games earlier 
                        tonight.  Just for the record.
                                 CARLO
                            (to the Pit Boss)
                        Get that on the record, will ya?

           The Pit Boss slugs Steven across the jaw, knocking the 
           glasses right off his face.

                                 JEFF / VINCE / GENE
                        Hey!  
                        Leave him alone!

           Steven slowly lifts his head again, seeing stars, mouth open.  
           He starts to cry.

           Jeff, Vince, and Gene mutter under their breath, cursing 
           their captors, lamenting the whole night.

           Carlo extends his hand.  The Pit Boss collects the pile of 
           wallets and hands them over.

           Carlo opens the first wallet, and raises an eyebrow.

                                 CARLO
                        Who’s the badge?

                                 GENE
                        Right here.

           Carlo looks closer, reading the badge’s engraving.

                                 CARLO
                        Department of Corrections.  
                        Wilmington.  Retired.  

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah, that’s right.  Gene was a 
                        corrections officer for 32 years.  
                        Tell ‘em, Gene.

                                 CARLO
                        Oh, is that right?  32 years?  What 
                        a lovely coincidence.  I’d like you 
                        to meet some of New Jersey’s 
                        finest.  Also retired.

           The Floormen smirk.

           Gene flashes Vince a bored look.  Any other bright ideas?

           Carlo inspects Jeff’s ID, then Vince’s, not particularly 
           impressed by either.

                                 CARLO
                        You boys shoulda stayed in tonight.
           Carlo opens the last wallet, and his smile vanishes.

                                 CARLO
                        Chase Hunter?

           No response from Steven, still spinning from the punch and 
           softly crying.

                                 VINCE
                        Chase.

           Steven sniffles and looks up.

                                 CARLO
                        You’re Chase Hunter?

           Steven nods.

                                 CARLO
                        Any relation to Ace Hunter?

                                 STEVEN
                            (pause)
                        He’s my brother-in-law.

           That’s when Carlo feels his ulcer acting up.  Suddenly, he’s 
           afraid to meet Steven’s eyes.  He looks to his Pit Boss and 
           Floormen, who are equally spooked. 

           The guys exchange a look.  Now what?

           Carlo nervously gestures to the Pit Boss.  The Pit Boss 
           gestures to the Head Floorman.  The Floorman produces a 
           switchblade from the back of his pants.

           Steven can’t see anything without his glasses, but senses 
           somebody approaching.

                                 STEVEN
                        Who’s that?  What’s going on?  I’m 
                        allergic to semen!

           The Floorman slices through Steven’s bindings, as Carlo 
           stammers an apology.

                                 CARLO
                        We... we had no idea...

           Steven finds his hands freed.  He confusedly rubs his wrists 
           as the Floorman cuts the other guys loose.  

                                 CARLO
                        Please, Mr. Hunter, I can’t tell 
                        you how sorry...  This will never 
                        happen again...
           We hold on Steven, who wipes his eyes and clears his throat.

                                 STEVEN
                        Well.  See that it doesn’t.

                                 CARLO
                        ...Let’s put this whole incident 
                        behind us...  And I hope we don’t 
                        have to burden your brother-in-law 
                        with the details of this night...

                                 STEVEN
                        Unfortunately for you, mister man, 
                        he’s going to hear all about this.

                                 CARLO
                        Oh, but please...  Be reasonable...

                                 STEVEN
                        Reasonable?  We’ve been roughed up, 
                        stripped naked, and I just had the 
                        eyeglasses punched right off my 
                        face!  I was scheduled to take a 
                        jazzercise class tomorrow, and now 
                        I’ll have to spend my whole 
                        Saturday at Lens Crafters!

                                 CARLO
                            (nervously pleading)
                        Next time you’re in town, whatever 
                        you want, I’ll take care of you...

           Jeff, Vince, and Gene stare blankly at Steven.  Don’t push 
           your luck, idiot.

                                 STEVEN
                        No sir, I don’t think I’m ever 
                        coming back to this town.  Between 
                        these shenanigans here, and my 
                        friend’s car being stolen-

                                 CARLO
                        Whose car?

                                 VINCE
                            (nervous pause)
                        My Land Rover Defender.  Black.

           Carlo and his men exchange a look.  They have it, of course.

                                 CARLO
                        Let me see what I can do.  OK? 

           Carlo hurriedly exits the cellar, taking his goons with him.
           The guys are alone again.  They stand in silence for a 
           moment, confused and unbelievably relieved.  Finally, they 
           collect their clothes and get dressed.

                                 VINCE
                        OK, I don’t know how you did that, 
                        Steven, but don’t push it!

                                 JEFF
                        Seriously!  What are you waiting 
                        for, tickets to the buffet?

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m not ready to accept that man’s 
                        apology.  Our civil rights have 
                        been violated!

                                 GENE
                        We’re lucky our cornholes weren’t 
                        violated.  Now clam the hell up.

           Carlo returns to the scene.

                                 CARLO
                        Good news.  Your Rover turned up at 
                        a chop-shop across town, but I set 
                        ‘em straight.  She’s gonna be fine, 
                        they’re bringing her back now.  I 
                        even had ‘em throw in a wax job.

           We hold on Vince, who plays it cool, even though he wants to 
           kiss the guy.

                                 VINCE
                        OK, then.  Thank you.

           The guys head for the door, Carlo still desperately making 
           amends as they exit.

                                 CARLO
                        Mr. Hunter, please.  Any time 
                        you’re back on The Island, just ask 
                        for Carlo and I’ll take care of 
                        you.  Rooms, girls, drinks on the 
                        house.  Whattya say?

                                 STEVEN
                            (cool pause)
                        We drink Absinthe on the reg.

                                 CARLO
                        Of course.  Absinthe for everybody.  
                        All you can drink.
           EXT.  CASINO - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The guys squint and cover their eyes as they exit the casino.  
           Surprise, it’s morning.

                                 STEVEN
                        Is that the sun already?

                                 JEFF
                            (spots a clock)
                        7:33.  I got an hour and a half.

           Steven holds Vince’s arm for guidance as everybody hurries 
           down the steps toward the street.

           Right on cue, Vince’s Rover pulls up, stopping at their feet.  
           The Pit Boss steps out of the driver’s seat.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Mr. Carlo would like to express his 
                        sincerest apologies once again for-

                                 VINCE
                        Yeah yeah.  We’re all square.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Just be careful leaving town.  
                        There’s a checkpoint on the 
                        Expressway.

           The Pit Boss hands Vince the keys, and then exits the scene.

                                 VINCE
                        Over here, Steven.  Take these.

                                 STEVEN
                        Take what?

           He holds out his hand.  Vince presses the keys into his palm.

                                 STEVEN
                        The keys?  You’re giving me the 
                        keys!?  I can’t drive!

                                 VINCE
                        You’ll be fine.  I’ll ride shotgun, 
                        tell you how you’re doing.

                                 STEVEN
                        I’m legally blind without my 
                        glasses!

                        The guy said there’s a checkpoint.  
                        Just get us past the cops, and then 
                        I’ll take over.

                                 STEVEN
                            (raises his hand)
                        Vince, I can’t even tell how many 
                        fingers I’m holding up right now.  
                        That’s how blind I am.

                                 VINCE
                        Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m still burping up Absinthe.

                                 GENE
                        Don’t look at me.  I’m drunker than 
                        Churchill on Spring Break.

                                 JEFF
                        OK, well, somebody has to drive.

           At that point, a Bum staggers toward Vince.  The very same 
           Bum that approached them upon arrival.

                                 BUM
                        Brother man, you spare some change?

                                 VINCE
                        You again?  Man, don’t you have 
                        anything better to do?

           The Bum shuffles away.  

           But then, a lightbulb over Jeff’s head.  He catches up with 
           The Bum and makes a proposition.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, buddy, wait up.  By any 
                        chance, you know how to drive?

                                 BUM
                        I lived in a van for three years. 

                                 JEFF
                        Close enough.
                            (pulls out some cash)
                        Twenty bucks to drive us back to

                        the fucking windshield!

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, lighten up.  Just because he’s 
                        fallen on hard times doesn’t mean 
                        he can’t handle basic automotives.

                        Smell his breath.
                            (to the Bum)
                        Go ahead, sir.  Breathe on my 
                        friend.

                        No.  You stay away from me.

           The Bum approaches Vince, loudly exhaling. 

                                 VINCE
                        That’s enough!  Stop breathing on 
                        me, Bum!  
                            (back to Jeff)
                        He’s not driving, and that’s final!

           Jeff squares off with Vince, chest to chest, his voice low.

                                 JEFF
                        I have under 90 minutes to get to 
                        brunch, and somebody has to drive.  
                        If I don’t make it, I swear to God, 
                        I’m gonna knock you the fuck out 
                        and hook up with Jillian.  Got it?

           We hold on Vince, impressed and intimidated.  Finally:
                                 VINCE
                        After the checkpoint, we’re putting 
                        him in the trunk.

           EXT.  BRIDGE - A SHORT WHOLE LATER

           Applejack Island fades from view as the Rover speeds across 
           the foggy bridge.  A few seconds later, the island is 
           completely invisible again, lost in a cloud.

           EXT.  EXPRESSWAY / INT.  ROVER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The Rover cruises south along the Expressway.

           The Bum is driving, with Vince nervously scrutinizing him 
           from the passenger seat.  Jeff, Steven, and Gene are squeezed 
           into the back, Jeff nervously watching the clock.

                                 JEFF
                        You’re gonna have to speed up, man.

                                 BUM
                        I’m goin’ with the flow of the 
                        traffic.

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, but the left lane is wide 
                        open.

                                 BUM
                        Left lane is for passing, brother.

                        Oh, I don’t fucking believe this.  
                        The Bum is the voice of reason.  

           Traffic bottlenecks as they approach a blockade formed by 
           flashing lights and police cruisers.

                                 VINCE

                        Here we go...  

           The Rover rolls to a stop.  The guys cross their fingers as a 
           humorless STATE TROOPER approaches.

           The Bum rolls down the window and flashes a patchy smile.

                                 TROOPER
                        Morning.  Where you boys heading?

                                 TROOPER
                        Anything to drink?

                                 BUM
                        Scotch if you got it.

                            (quietly, to the Bum)
                        He means, have you been drinking.  
                        Idiot.

                                 BUM
                        Oh, no sir.  Designated driver for 
                        these four gentlemen.

           The Trooper takes a long look at the guys in the back seat.  
           Jeff nods.  Steven squints.  Gene hiccups.  

           Then tension mounts.  The Trooper stares without blinking.  
           Finally, he waves them forward.

                                 TROOPER
                        Drive safe.

                                 BUM
                        OK, you have a fine day now.  God 
                        bless you.

           The Rover creeps through the blockade.

           A collective exhale as they return to the open road.

                                 VINCE
                        You did great, Bum.  Pull onto the 
                        shoulder.  I’ll take it from here.

                                 BUM

                        back to Delaware.

                                 BUM
                        Fuck Delaware.  We’re going to New 
                        Orleans.

           Vince stares at him, unamused.  This Bum’s got a sense of 
           humor now.
                                 VINCE
                        Dude, if you couldn’t find adequate

                        you think you’ll find it in New 
                        Orleans?

                        I can’t go to New Orleans!  That 
                        town’s full of creoles and girls

                        You make a good case, Bum, but the 
                        answer is no.  Now pull over.

           Vince grabs the wheel and jerks it toward the shoulder.

                                 BUM
                        Get yo’ hands off this wheel, 
                        bitch!  We goin’ New Orleans!

           The Bum veers back into the center lane.

                                 VINCE
                        This is my car, Bum!

           Vince and The Bum wrestle for control.  The Rover lurches 
           dangerously between lanes as the Expressway nears a bridge.

                                 JEFF / GENE / STEVEN
                        Hey hey!
                        Watch the road, you assholes!  
                        What’s happening!?

           The Bum hits the gas.  The car accelerates.

                                 VINCE
                        OK, dickhead!  You asked for it!

           Vince reaches for the emergency brake.

                                 GENE
                        Not the e-brake!  You’re gonna-

           Vince jerks the brake.  Not smart at 80 miles per hour.

           The tires squeal.

           Heads whiplash.
           The Rover spins out of control, screeches across the 
           shoulder, and plows through a guardrail.  Right off the side 
           of the bridge.

           We hold on the guys’ faces for a moment in mid-air, when 
           gravity see-saws and death seems inevitable.

           The Rover hits water, head on.  The weight and speed of the 
           car plunges it almost completely underwater upon impact.

           EXT.  UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           A moment of hysteria before the guys realize that they’re 
           still alive.  And by that point, water is rushing in all 
           around them, air space condensing.

                                 STEVEN
                        What’s happening?  Why are my feet

                        Fuck the windows!  Everybody out!

           They evacuate the sinking vehicle, wrangling through the 
           windows as the water rushes in.

           EXT.  LAKE SURFACE - CONTINUOUS

           The bumper disappears.  The Rover is now fully submerged, 
           leaving nothing but a few bubbles.

           A moment later, the heads appear.  First Jeff, then Gene, 
           then Vince, everybody gasping for air.

                                 VINCE
                        Where is he...  Where’d he go...

           Vince spots The Bum crawling onto the shore.  He staggers to 
           his feet, then runs off and disappears beneath the overpass.

                                 VINCE
                        This isn’t over, Bum!  I’ll see you 
                        in court!  I’ll fucking ruin you!!

           Jeff, Vince, and Gene swim to shore.  They crawl to the muddy 
           bank, still catching their breath, Vince getting emotional.

                                 VINCE
                        This is so wrong...  No driver

                                 GENE
                        Oh, pull yourself together.  It’s 
                        only a car.

                                 VINCE
                        That car was my soul mate, Gene!  I 
                        haven’t cried since September 11th, 
                        when I lost four grand on that 
                        Ravens game.  But goddamn it-

                                 JEFF
                        Guys.  Where’s Steven?

           Oh, shit.  All three of them look around and make a terrible 
           realization.  Steven is still in the lake.

                        Steven!

           They rush back into the water, swimming as fast as they can 
           toward the remaining bubbles.

           They disappear beneath the surface.  The lake is still again. 

           A long, agonizing pause while the guys are underwater.

           Gene pops up first, alone, out of breath.  

           Jeff appears next, also alone.

           Finally, Vince returns to the surface- with Steven in his 
           arms.  And he’s unconscious.  Practically blue.

           The guys drag Steven back to solid ground.  They lay him down 
           in the mud, and Vince lightly slaps his cheek.

                                 VINCE
                        Steven.  Come on, buddy.  Wake up.

           No response.  Gene kneels over him, searching for a pulse.

                                 GENE
                        He’s not breathing.

           Jeff and Vince gasp.  A moment of dread.

                                 GENE
                        Get back.

           Gene tilts Steven’s head, opens his mouth, and begins CPR.
                                 VINCE
                        Jesus Christ, Gene.  You can’t let 
                        him die.  Please don’t let him die.

           Gene pumps his sternum, then breathes into his mouth.  

           Still no response.

                                 JEFF
                        Come on, Steven!  Come on!

                                 VINCE
                        Please don’t die, please don’t die.

           Gene pumps harder.  

           Still nothing.

           Vince is on the verge of tears, shaking, scared to watch.

                                 VINCE
                        I was such an asshole to him...  
                        All the names I called him, I never 
                        even told him he was my friend...

                                 JEFF
                        Come on, Steven...  Come on...

                                 VINCE
                        Fuck, Gene!  Are you doing it right 
                        or not!?

                                 GENE
                        Just shut up, Vince.

           Gene frantically pumps Steven’s sternum.  It’s the first time 
           we’ve seen him genuinely frightened.  But still nothing.

                                 VINCE
                        I’m sorry, Steven!  I’m so sorry!  
                        You’re my best friend, don’t you 
                        fucking die on me!

           Gene holds Steven’s nose and breathes into him.

           Then, very slowly, Steven lifts his arm.  He wraps a hand 
           behind Gene’s head.  

           Gene opens his eyes, mid-resuscitation.  The mouth-to-mouth 
           has turned into a kiss.  

           Gene recoils, spitting.  Relieved and repulsed at once.

           Steven sits up, dazed.  Jeff and Vince rush over and hug him.
                                 JEFF / VINCE
                        Steven!
                        You’re alive!

                                 STEVEN
                        What’s going on?  I still can’t 
                        see...

                                 JEFF
                        Gene saved your life.

                                 STEVEN
                        That was Gene?

                                 GENE
                        You fucking kissed me!

                                 STEVEN
                        You kissed me first!

                                 GENE
                        I was administering CPR, which you 
                        translated into French, you little 
                        daffodil!

                                 STEVEN
                        How long was I unconscious?

                                 GENE
                        You fucking kissed me, Steven!

                                 STEVEN
                        The last thing I remember-

                                 GENE
                        Ohhhh no, don’t even try to mince 
                        your way outta this one!  You gave 
                        me a big wet Hollywood kiss while I 
                        was saving your goddamned life!

                                 STEVEN
                        I like men.

           Everybody freezes.  Did he really just say that?

                                 JEFF
                        You what?

           Steven half-smiles, his eyes bright with discovery. 

                                 STEVEN
                        It’s...  it’s like nothing ever 
                        made sense until I felt Gene’s 
                        manly lips against my own.  I feel 
                        like Dorothy Gale in the land of 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVEN (cont'd)
                        Oz, like the whole wide world’s in 
                        color for the very first time!

                                 VINCE
                        He thinks he’s Dorothy.  Now, it’s 
                        official.

           A quiet pause, everybody watching Steven.  Steven with a 
           strange new sense of certainty.

                                 STEVEN
                        But... if I’m gay...  what happens 
                        to us?  
                            (sad pause)
                        Are you guys still my friends?

           Jeff and Vince look at each other and shrug.

                                 JEFF / VINCE  
                        Yeah.
                        Of course.

                                 STEVEN
                        Gene?

           A dramatic pause.  We hold on Gene as he thinks it over.  
           Finally, he cracks a smile and chuckles to himself.

                                 GENE
                        Kid, I don’t care what you are, 
                        long as you know what you are.  I’m 
                        just glad you’re alive.  

           EXT.  EXPRESSWAY, SHOULDER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The guys walk along the road, wet and dirty.  Jeff is two 
           steps ahead of the others, still doggedly bent on brunch.

                                 VINCE
                        Nothing like a good car wreck to 
                        sober you up.

                                 GENE
                        Me too.  Maybe for good.

                                 VINCE
                        What, like, on the wagon?  Don’t 
                        tell me that AA bullshit sunk in.

                                 GENE
                        No, jackass.  My flask is ruined.  
                        I got no choice.

           Vince chuckles.  Gene doesn’t. 
                                 GENE
                        But you know, I’ve been thinking.  
                        I’m gonna lay off the hard stuff.  
                        That bullet had my name on it, 
                        maybe Somebody’s trying to tell me 
                        something. 

           They reach an exit ramp.  Vince covers his eyes, looking into 
           the distance.

                                 VINCE
                        OK, there’s bound to be a store or 
                        something if we follow the exit.  I 
                        gotta call triple A, see if they 
                        got some kinda scuba team.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna follow the Expressway, 
                        try hitchhiking. 

                                 VINCE
                        Hitching, are you crazy?  You’ll 
                        never get a ride looking like that.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, no shit, Vince, but I can 
                        still make brunch if I get lucky. 
                        You do you, I’ll do me, and I’ll 
                        see you on Monday. 

           With no further goodbyes, Jeff abruptly turns and walks off. 

           Vince, Steven, and Gene exchange a look.  Finally, Vince 
           shrugs, and they walk off in the opposite direction.

           After a little while, Jeff pauses.  He looks back at them.

                                 GENE
                        You sure you’re alright, kid?

                                 STEVEN
                        Yeah, I’m OK.  You guys really 
                        don’t mind if I’m a homosexual?

                                 VINCE
                        You’re one of us, Steven.  Always 
                        will be.

                                 GENE
                        Damn right.  If you think you’re a 
                        queer, go ‘head.  Be a queer.  
                        Anybody got anything to say about 
                        that, I’ll give ‘em a knuckle 
                        sandwich.
           At that moment, Jeff can’t help but smile.  At a distance, 
           from behind, they resemble great guys.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey.

           The other guys stop walking and turn to face him.

                                 JEFF
                        When’s the next Guys Night?

                                 VINCE
                            (pause)
                        Are you serious?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m ready when you are, bro.

           Jeff and Vince share a look.  This is how guys make up.  
           Subtly, without much fanfare.

                                 VINCE
                        I’m glad you’re back, man.  But 
                        first things first, I gotta chill 
                        out with the wife for a while.  I 
                        think tonight’s my anniversary, 
                        anyway.

                                 JEFF
                        OK.  Let’s figure it out when we 
                        black back in.

           EXT.  EXPRESSWAY SHOULDER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Jeff wrings out his shirt, then wipes his muddy hands on his 
           pants.  Doing what little he can to clean up, but he still 
           looks like a disaster.  Filthy, tired, unshaven.

           A car approaches.  He musters a smile and extends his thumb.

           No luck.  The car zooms by.  This sucks.

           A few seconds later, another car approaches.  

           He holds his thumb higher.  Still no luck.  The car zooms by.

                                 JEFF
                        Oh, gimmie a break!  I’m not gonna 
                        kill you!

           Another car approaches.  A sedan with Delaware plates.

           Jeff waves his arms and steps toward the road.  Getting 
           aggressive.
           The car passes.  Then brakes.

           Jeff sighs appreciatively and jogs toward the car.

           The passenger door opens.  A woman emerges.

                                 MONICA
                        Jeff?

           Jeff freezes when he sees her.  Yeah, it’s Monica.  Returning 
           from a Girls Night, in a car full of women.  Still glammed up 
           from the previous night.

                                 MONICA
                        What.  The.  Hell are you doing 
                        here!?

                                 JEFF
                        Hi honey.
                            (pause)
                        You got room for one more?

                                 MONICA
                        What are you doing out here?  What 
                        happened to your face?  Why are you 
                        hitchhiking?  Why are you... wet?

                                 JEFF
                        It’s a long story.  It all started 
                        last night, at Steven’s apartment.  
                            (pause)
                        And I’d really like to leave it at 
                        that.

           Monica blinks in disbelief. 

           EXT.  DELAWARE BORDER / INT.  SEDAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           The car zooms past a sign that reads NOW ENTERING DELAWARE.

           Monica and Jeff sit in the back seat.  Monica with her arms 
           angrily crossed, Jeff sitting in a small puddle.

           Monica’s THREE GIRLFRIENDS are crammed in the front.  None of 
           them talking, just awaiting whatever juicy meltdown is on the 
           way.

                                 JEFF
                        You look really nice.

                                 MONICA
                        Don’t even try to butter me up.
                                 JEFF
                        It’s not a compliment, I’m just 
                        saying.

                                 MONICA
                        Saying what?

                                 JEFF
                        You lied to me about Book Club.

                                 MONICA
                        I most certainly did not!  I did go 
                        to Book Club, but Candice still 
                        hasn’t finished One Hundred Years 
                        Of Solitude.

                                 CANDICE
                            (from the front seat)
                        That books sucks.  Oprah lied.

                                 MONICA
                        The point is, we can’t talk about a 
                        book that Candice still hasn’t 
                        finished.

                                 JEFF
                        So you went out with your girls 
                        instead.

                                 MONICA
                        Don’t you turn this around on me!  
                        You’re wet and dirty and 
                        hitchhiking at 8:23 in the morning!  
                        I don’t know what you’ve been up 
                        to, but it’s obviously not very 
                        wholesome!

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, I wanted to stay home and 
                        attempt sex last night, remember?

                                 MONICA
                        At least I’m presentable!  You have 
                        brunch with Nonner and Poopy in 37 
                        minutes, and you look like a 
                        fucking Katrina refugee!

           Jeff hangs his head, and that’s when something catches his 
           eye.  The sunlight hits his arm at an angle that reveals the 
           faint profile of his old tattoo: the male symbol, plus 
           exclamation point.

           It’s the first time that he’s noticed it in a long time, and 
           at that moment, it sparks the old Classic Jeff fire.
                                 JEFF
                        Monica.
                            (solemn pause)
                        Fuck brunch.

                                 MONICA
                        Excuse me?

                                 JEFF
                        You heard me.  I’m not going 
                        anywhere near that fucking brunch, 
                        I’m not in the mood to watch Poopy 
                        gum down canteloupe.  Now, if you 
                        wanna talk about McDonalds’ 
                        breakfast menu, I’m down. 

           A hush falls over the car.  Monica’s girlfriends are quietly 
           stunned.  This war just went nuclear.

           INT.  JEFF’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER

           Jeff undresses, dropping his dirty clothes on the floor, 
           trudging toward the bathroom.

           Monica trails him, furious.

                                 MONICA
                        Fuck brunch!?  Fuck brunch!? 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna spend my Saturday like 
                        God intended- hungover on my 
                        goddamned couch, watching my TV.  
                        Is that too much to ask!?

                                 MONICA
                        This was supposed to be a fateful 
                        brunch!  This is your career!

                                 JEFF
                        Let’s get one thing straight.  I’d 
                        take a job as Adolf Hitler’s 
                        fucking bathroom attendant before I 
                        spend one day working for your 
                        disgusting old grandfather.

                                 MONICA
                        Poopy is not disgusting!!

                                 JEFF
                        When I do leave the DSE, it’ll be 
                        for something I wanna do.  And you 
                        know what, maybe I don’t wanna 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEFF (cont'd)
                        leave just yet.  I like my job.  I 
                        have friends there.

                                 MONICA
                        I never should have let you out!  
                        One night with those guys and they 
                        talk you out of upward mobility!

                                 JEFF
                        Oh OK, so you’re allowed to run off 
                        and have fun with your friends, but 
                        I’m not!

                                 MONICA
                        It’s called a double standard, 
                        Jeffreybaby!  Those fucking idiots 
                        bring you down!

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, well sometimes I think you 
                        bring me down.  And another thing, 
                        I’ve had enough of this “Jeffrey-
                        baby” business!  I’m not your 
                        fucking baby!  From this day forth, 
                        you call me Jeffrey-Man!  Got it!?

           Jeff continues to undress, piling wet clothes on the floor, 
           piece by piece.  Monica takes her jewelry off, slamming it 
           down on the coffee table, piece by piece.  

                                  MONICA
                        Well, maybe I should just leave, 
                        Jeffrey-Man!  

                                 JEFF
                        Fine.

                                 MONICA
                        Fine.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m getting in the shower.

                                 MONICA
                        I won’t be here when you get out.

                                 JEFF
                        Promise?

                                 MONICA
                        Oh, you better believe it, asshole.  
                        And don’t even think about-

           She trails off when she notices his dick.  Fully erect.  
           Pointing right at her.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And just like that, I’m back.  
                        She’s looking at me.  I’m looking 
                        at her.  And I’m harder than 
                        Chinese math.  All this honesty, 
                        all this impoliteness, all this 
                        unfiltered aggression, it fills me, 
                        it strengthens me, and I can’t 
                        relax for one second until Jeff 
                        throws her right down on her back 
                        and fucks the shit out of her.

           INT.  JEFF’S BEDROOM - A MINUTE LATER

           Jeff throws Monica down on their bed and makes intense, 
           passionate love to her.  

           Monica screams.  Jeff grins.  It’s wild.  It’s primal.  It’s 
           just what they need.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Being a dick gets you blamed for a 
                        lot of bullshit.  Always thinking 
                        with his dick, couldn’t keep his 
                        dick in his pants.  Etcetera, 
                        etcetera.  Wars are fought, empires 
                        fall, and I’m not gonna lie, most 
                        of the time, some guy’s fucking 
                        dick is to blame.  But we have been 
                        known, from time to time, to 
                        salvage true love.  To bring a 
                        dying romance back from the ashes 
                        and return it to hot, fiery glory.

                                 MONICA
                            (screaming)
                        I love you!  I love you!  Oh 
                        Jeffrey, I love you!

           Total ecstacy.

           INT.  JEFF’S BEDROOM - AN HOUR LATER

           Jeff and Monica lie side by side, in a sweaty, happy daze. 

                                 JEFF
                        What were we fighting about, again?

                                 MONICA
                        It was, um...  oh, I forget.  Who 
                        cares.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I think he finally gets it.  The 
                        babytalk, the brunches, the Dancing 
                        With The Stars- that’s what brings 
                        me down.  Fuck that shit.  Be good 
                        to your woman, but don’t ever 
                        forget that I’m down here.  Act 
                        like a man, and I’ll always be 
                        straight with you.  OK?  And 
                        Monica.  Yeah, I know she comes off 
                        a little bossy, but that’s what 
                        happens when an intelligent woman 
                        isn’t sufficiently challenged and 
                        stimulated.  I mean, yeah, she 
                        likes wearing the pants sometimes.  
                        But guess what she likes even more.  
                        Not wearing them.  Either way, I 
                        don’t think she’ll be such a tight-
                        ass anymore.  I’ll make sure of 
                        that.

           Monica rolls onto her side.  Totally, indescribably 
           satisfied.  Jeff spoons up behind her and kisses her.  A 
           perfect reversal of their positions from the opening shot.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        What I’ve been trying to say is, 
                        man and woman- they’re not exactly 
                        equal, that’s the wrong word.  What 
                        they are is complimentary.  His 
                        masculinity compliments her 
                        femininity.  And that brings me 
                        back to the subject of Guys Night.  
                        Hold it sacred, for that very 
                        reason, because a night with the 
                        guys is sometimes exactly what your 
                        woman needs. 
                            (pause)
                        Anyway.  I think I’ve made my 
                        point.

           THE END.
