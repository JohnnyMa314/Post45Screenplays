           FADE IN:

           QUEENS, NY. Late November. Leaves have turned and fallen.

           BRIDGES, BOULEVARDS, SUBWAYS and SIDEWALKS are packed with 
           people in constant motion.

           Among them, FIREFIGHTERS respond to calls, SANITATION WORKERS 
           clean the clutter and POLICE OFFICERS patrol.

           EXT. HOUSE. NIGHT.

           A small, Stucco-slathered Tudor; working-class Woodside. An 
           AMERICAN FLAG hangs out front.

           A driveway leads to a GARAGE. 

           INT. GARAGE. NIGHT.

           PEG BOARD walls hold TOOLS, RAPELLING LINES and RIFLES.

           A rugged MAN, 45, wearing BLUE COVERALLS and LATEX GLOVES, 
           seals a PORTABLE ELECTRIC SAW, METAL PARTS and PIPES into 3 
           JUMBO ZIPLOCK BAGS. 

           He hides the bags in the TANK of an INDUSTRIAL VACUUM.

           He wheels the vacuum into the back of a WHITE CARGO VAN.

           The Man dons a GREEN PARKA and hops into

           INT. VAN. NIGHT.

           where we see the STEERING COLUMN is CRACKED; it’s stolen.

           The Man drives out of the garage.

           EXT. CITIGROUP TOWER. NIGHT.

           The glass monolith stabs at the sky, by far the tallest 
           building in Queens. It’s late; only a few OFFICE LIGHTS burn. 

           INT. CITIGROUP TOWER, LOBBY. NIGHT.

           A SECURITY GUARD eyes a CLEANING CREW, all wearing ID BADGES 
           on BLUE COVERALLS, as they pass through a METAL DETECTOR. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You know the drill; badges in plain view, 
                        anything metal goes in the basket.

           A CLEANER sets off the ALARM. The Security Guard stops him. 
           The Cleaner pulls a CHAIN-WALLET from his pocket and plops it 
           in the basket.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (cont’d)
                        What are you, a Hells Angel? Go through, 
                        again.

           EXT. CITIGROUP TOWER. NIGHT.

           A PICK-UP drives into the lot and parks near the WHITE CARGO 
           VAN. A late CLEANING CREW MEMBER jumps out, zipping up his 
           blue coveralls. 

           Suddenly, ARMS WRAP AROUND his NECK and HEAD, choking him 
           unconscious. He crumbles to the ground, revealing 

           the Man in the GREEN PARKA, his face covered by a FUR-LINED 
           HOOD.

           INT. VAN. NIGHT.

           The BOUND and BLINDFOLDED Cleaning Crew Member starts to come 
           to, only to be GAGGED by the Man, who snatches his ID. 

           He grabs a BUCKET OF CLEANING SUPPLIES and pushes the 
           INDUSTRIAL VACUUM out.

           INT. CITIGROUP TOWER, LOBBY. NIGHT.

           The Man wheels the VACUUM to the GUARD STATION. The Guard 
           SIGHS.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You’re lucky we don’t shoot the 
                        stragglers. Badge in plain... 

           The Man shows the ID, puts his KEYS and the BUCKET in baskets 
           beside the METAL DETECTOR and walks through.

           The Man pulls the vacuum AROUND THE METAL DETECTOR.

           ON THE VIDEO MONITOR, his face is obscured by the hood. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD (cont’d)
                        They’re on 18. Buy yourself a watch.

           We follow the Man as he pushes the vacuum into the ELEVATOR.

           INT. 18TH FLOOR. NIGHT.

           The Man exits the elevator with the vacuum; he sees the CREW 
           cleaning offices. 
           Instead of joining them, he pulls the 3 JUMBO ZIPLOCK BAGS 
           containing the SAW, METAL PARTS and PIPES out of the vacuum’s 
           tank and enters the STAIRWELL.

           INT. 32ND FLOOR. NIGHT.

           The Man walks out of the stairwell past dark offices, toward 
           the only one with a LIGHT ON. A PLAQUE on the door reads:

                            “AARON NUSSBAUM, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR”.

           The Man sheds his parka to reveal the BLUE COVERALLS. 

           He removes the SAW, METAL PARTS and PIPES from the BAGS. 

           As the Man methodically assembles the metal parts and pipes, 
           we discover...

           he’s building a RIFLE.

           He rests the rifle against the wall and walks into

           INT. OFFICE. NIGHT.

           where AARON NUSSBAUM, 43, talks on the phone; if he’s working 
           this late, there’s a problem.

                                 AARON
                        (into phone)
                        ...the truth is, fellas, this company 
                        just spent 9-million dollars building an 
                        executive lounge a year after the bailout-

           Aaron nudges his TRASH CAN over to the Man.

                                 AARON (cont’d)
                        (into phone)
                        -Now, I may be the new guy here, but, I 
                        spent the last five years doing PR for 
                        Youngerman Health, and the most important 
                        thing I learned was this: perception is 
                        greater than truth. 

           The Man walks past the trash can, moves behind Aaron, CLOSES 
           THE BLINDS and dusts them, waiting for Aaron to hang up. 

                                 AARON (cont’d)
                        (into phone)
                        We can talk about the local contractors 
                        we used; helping the community. We can 
                        talk about the new employees we’ll hire 
                        to work in the lounge; creating jobs. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AARON (cont’d)
                        We can talk about how the improved morale 
                        will increase job performance and 
                        profits. We can talk about anything 
                        except the fact that we spent 9-million 
                        dollars to build a clubhouse for a bunch 
                        of overpaid VPs.
                        (flustered)
                        Forget it; I’ll write the release myself.

           Aaron hangs up, weary. The Man takes the trash can outside. 

           Aaron starts drafting the release, irritated.

                                 AARON (cont’d)
                        This fucking day is never going to end.

           He sees the Man standing in the doorway, aiming the RIFLE.

           Before Aaron can react, the Man SHOOTS HIM IN THE CHEST.

           Aaron slumps to the floor. The Man closes the door and pulls 
           out the PORTABLE ELECTRIC SAW.

           EXT. BYRNE’S HOUSE. DAY.

           Early morning. A humble duplex in Flushing; decent 
           neighborhood, not the best.

                                 SANDI KLEIN (V.O.)
                        WINS News time 6:37. Here's Lee Harris 
                        with our top story...

           INT. BYRNE’S BEDROOM. DAY.

           A CLOCK-RADIO blares 1010 WINS.

                                 LEE HARRIS (V.O.)
                        Sources close to the District Attorney's 
                        Office confirmed last night that Quentin 
                        Youngerman, CEO of the now defunct 
                        Youngerman Health Incorporated, will 
                        plead guilty Monday morning to embezzling 
                        50-million dollars from the company he 
                        inherited from his late father...

           HARD, SHORT GRUNTS fill the room as a HEAVY MEDICINE BALL is 
           flung repeatedly into the air by 

           DETECTIVE BRENDAN BYRNE, 29, who bangs out gruelling 
           crunches. Every time his back touches the floor, he hurls the 
           medicine ball up and lets it SLAM DOWN onto his stomach. 

           The last impact makes Byrne pause to catch his breath.
           His boyish good looks belie his determination.

                                 LEE HARRIS (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        The plea would send Mr. Youngerman to 
                        prison for 10 years and requires him to 
                        surrender all of his assets to help pay 
                        restitution to policyholders who lost 
                        money and health coverage when the 
                        company folded...

           Anger fuels Byrne’s body back into motion.

                                 BYRNE
                        Ten more, you bitch...

           Byrne throws the medicine ball higher.

           EXT. SALVO’S HOUSE. DAY.

           A modest house with an attached garage in Murray Hill.

                                 LEE HARRIS (V.O.)
                        Youngerman Health provided coverage to 
                        nearly 50,000 city employees, many of 
                        whom were left with unpaid medical bills 
                        in the wake of the scandal...

           INT. SALVO’S BEDROOM. DAY.

           A TRAIL OF RUMPLED CLOTHES leads to a BED, where DETECTIVE 
           WARREN SALVO, 48, sleeps through his RADIO ALARM.

           BESIDE THE ALARM CLOCK, are Salvo’s SHIELD and GUN.

                                 LEE HARRIS (V.O.)
                        Douglas Edison, the CFO of Youngerman 
                        Health is expected to be offered the same 
                        plea for his role in helping Quentin 
                        Youngerman embezzle from the company-

           Salvo’s wife, NANCY, 46, kills the radio. Her hair is 
           extremely short. She wears a New York Jets’ sweatshirt with 
           PINK ACCENTS commemorating breast cancer awareness.

           Nancy’s a neighborhood girl; a strong, stubborn survivor.

                                 NANCY
                        Warren... C’mon; get up.

                                 SALVO
                        Five more minutes.
                                 NANCY
                        You’ve been hitting snooze for the last 
                        half-hour. Super-cop’s probably at the 
                        station already. You really wanna hear 
                        his shit? Up and at ‘em! Let’s go...

                                 SALVO
                        Alright, alright. Go easy...

           Salvo sits up, bleary-eyed; his shoulders slouch as if some 
           divine entity has been stepping on him his whole life. 

           Nancy picks up Salvo’s blazer; she finds a HUGE STAIN.

                                 NANCY
                        What the hell happened to your jacket?

                                 SALVO
                        The McMillian Sweet-Sixteen happened.

                                 NANCY
                        What, you shoot someone there? 

                                 SALVO
                        I caught a couple kids spiking the punch. 
                        They ran, I tried to grab one of them and 
                        dumped the punch bowl all over myself.
                        (beat)
                        These asshole parents drop 30-grand on a 
                        birthday party, but didn’t even offer to 
                        pay for my dry-cleaning. It’s bullshit. 

           Nancy pulls the jacket inside out.

                                 NANCY
                        It’s fine. I’ll clean it.

                                 SALVO
                        I don’t want you to clean it. I want them 
                        to clean it.

           Nancy stuffs the jacket into the hamper.

                                 NANCY
                        Case closed, Detective. Get your ass in 
                        the shower.

           INT. BYRNE’S BEDROOM. DAY.

           Byrne, clean-shaven and neatly dressed, pockets his SHIELD. 
           He notices his HOLSTER is EMPTY.

                                 BYRNE
                        Hey, Pop...
           Concerned, he heads into

           INT. MARTIN’S BEDROOM. DAY.

           where he finds the BED MADE. 

           On the walls are NYPD SERVICE AWARDS for “MARTIN BYRNE”.

           On the dresser, a group of FRAMED PHOTOS OF A WOMAN, from 
           childhood to her late 40s; a CRUCIFIX hangs over one. 

           There’s also a PRAYER CARD for “KATHERINE BYRNE”.

           It’s a shrine.

                                 BYRNE
                        Pop? You downstairs?

           Worried, Byrne heads out of the room with urgency.

           INT. SALVO’S BATHROOM. DAY.

           Salvo rubs his THICK STUBBLE, picks lint from his MOUSTACHE 
           and checks his BLOODSHOT EYES in a mirror.

                                 SALVO
                        Another goddamn day.

           The bathroom door swings open. Salvo’s pretty and perturbed 
           daughter VANESSA, 16, bursts in, startling him. 

                                 VANESSA
                        You had to work a party in our 
                        neighborhood?! 

                                 SALVO
                        Jesus! What are you talking about? Get 
                        outta here!

                                 VANESSA
                        Thanks to you, I’m a social outcast.

           Vanessa shoves her SMARTPHONE in Salvo’s face; it plays a 
           VIRAL VIDEO from the PARTY: SALVO TOPPLES A TABLE and gets 
           DOUSED WITH PUNCH.

                                 SALVO
                        Where did you get that?

                                 VANESSA
                        From all of my friends. It’s on a YouTube 
                        channel that shows pranks and fails.
                                 SALVO
                        What the hell is a fail?

                                 VANESSA
                        Failures; screw-ups. Someone filmed you 
                        and posted it on the site. They call it 
                        “Narc Fail”.

                                 SALVO
                        Well, delete it. 

                                 VANESSA
                        I can’t delete it, dad; it’s going to be 
                        there forever. My life is over!

                                 SALVO
                        You think it’s over now, wait until you 
                        have kids.

           Salvo hands Vanessa a PILL ORGANIZER.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Go give Mom her pills.

           Salvo pushes her out of the bathroom and shuts the door.

           INT. BYRNE’S KITCHEN. DAY.

           MARTIN BYRNE, 52, sits at the table, CLEANING a 9MM PISTOL.

           Martin is retired NYPD; a solemn man, his triumphs on the job 
           are overshadowed by the tragedy of losing his wife.

           Byrne briskly walks in; he’s unnerved when he sees his father 
           with the gun.

                                 BYRNE
                        Pop, why are you cleaning my gun?

                                 MARTIN
                        Wanted to see if I still remembered the 
                        drill.

           ON THE TABLE, Byrne sees BULLETS. He covers his concern.

                                 BYRNE
                        You ready for inspection?

           Byrne sticks his finger inside the CLIP, pretending to check 
           for dirt. He’s really looking for bullets.

           It’s empty.
                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Did a good job on this clip.

           Martin reassembles the gun. He cleans the SERIAL NUMBER.

                                 MARTIN
                        Twenty-eight years on the job, I carried 
                        the same service-weapon. Smith & Wesson 
                        .38 Special; serial number 45899. When I 
                        put in my papers and handed over my 
                        pistol, the clerk said it was the 
                        cleanest gun he’d ever seen.
                        (beat)
                        I ever tell you that?

           Byrne loads the BULLETS into the clip.

                                 BYRNE
                        Once or twice.

           Byrne’s cell-phone RINGS. He answers.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        (into phone)
                        Byrne.
                        (beat)
                        Copy that. Wake Salvo; tell him to haul 
                        ass.
                        (to Martin)
                        Caught a body. Gotta run.

           Martin wishes he could come. Instead, he hands Byrne his gun.

                                 MARTIN
                        Be good; your mother’s watching.

           Byrne kisses his father on the head, grabs his KEYS and goes 
           for the door. He looks back at Martin, worried.

           EXT. BYRNE’S HOUSE. DAY.

           Byrne walks out. ON THE STEPS are weathered MEMORIAL CANDLES.

           INT. SALVO’S KITCHEN. DAY.

           Salvo’s son KEVIN, 12, is on the computer, mashing-up the 
           “NARC FAIL” VIDEO. He LAUGHS as his dad gets soaked with 
           punch in Auto-Tuned rapid-repeat.

           Nancy peels an orange over the GARBAGE CAN.

                                 NANCY
                        Kevin, stop playing and eat.
           Salvo, nattily dressed, plods in, CELL-PHONE to his ear.

                                 SALVO
                        (into phone)
                        Yeah, yeah. I’m on my way. Tell Super-cop 
                        to relax. The body ain’t going nowhere.

           Salvo hangs up. ON THE TABLE, he sees the DAILY NEWS, the 
           FRONT PAGE HEADLINE reads: 

                            “HEALTH CARE HUSTLER TAKES MEDICINE”.

           There’s a PHOTO of QUENTIN YOUNGERMAN, 39; GEEK CHIC, THICK 
           GLASSES and a WIDE SMILE. Not your old-school CEO.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Piece of shit.

                                 NANCY
                        Don’t think about it. He’s not worth it.  

           Nancy takes the paper away and hands Salvo a BOWL OF FRUIT.

                                 SALVO
                        Can’t. Gotta jet to a scene.

           Nancy waves her PILL ORGANIZER as she pours a glass of water.

                                 NANCY
                        If I have to take these; you have to eat 
                        fruit.

           Vanessa marches in, mortified to see Kevin tweaking the 
           VIDEO. She puts her SMARTPHONE down and goes off on Salvo.

                                 VANESSA
                        You see what you’ve done to me? This is 
                        so embarrassing; I cannot go to school 
                        today.

                                 SALVO
                        You’re going to school, Vanessa.

                                 VANESSA
                        I am never going to live this down-

           She stops when she hears her last statement repeat.

                                 VANESSA (cont’d) (V.O.)
                        -I am never going to live this down-

           Vanessa looks at the COMPUTER, where she sees HERSELF.
           She turns to KEVIN, who’s using her SMARTPHONE to stream her 
           live onto a YouTube channel.

           Kevin GIGGLES. Vanessa freaks.

                                 VANESSA (cont’d)
                        You’re streaming me?!

           Vanessa reaches for her Smartphone; Kevin plays keep-away.

                                 SALVO
                        (intrigued)
                        How’s he doing that?

                                 VANESSA
                        He’s live-streaming me onto the site! 
                        With my phone. Give it, you little shit!

                                 NANCY
                        Guys, knock it off!

           Kevin runs behind his mother, using her as a shield.

           Vanessa lunges for Kevin and bumps into Nancy, knocking her 
           PILL ORGANIZER onto the counter. PILLS SCATTER.

                                 NANCY (cont’d)
                        Goddamnit!!

           Everyone freezes. Salvo snatches the Smartphone from Kevin.

                                 SALVO
                        How do I stop it?

                                 VANESSA
                        Touch “stop stream”!

           Salvo does. They all eye the COMPUTER; the WINDOW GOES BLACK.

           Nancy gathers her PILLS; several sit amid TRASH in the CAN.

                                 NANCY
                        Great; they went into the trash.

           Nancy digs through the garbage. Salvo grabs her shoulder.

                                 SALVO
                        No. Let them do it.

                                 VANESSA
                        I’m not digging through the trash.
                                 SALVO
                        Those pills cost a fortune. You knocked 
                        them in there, you pick them out.

                                 NANCY
                        Honey, it’s alright.

                                 SALVO
                        It’s not alright!

           Angry, Salvo pulls out the trash bag and dumps it on the 
           floor. He glares at Kevin and Vanessa.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        You find every pill. Put them on the 
                        counter and clean this mess up. Now!

           Nancy rinses some pills and swallows them, upset.

           She goes into the garage. Vanessa and Kevin search the trash.

                                 VANESSA
                        Dad, you’re such an asshole.

           Salvo holds up Vanessa’s Smartphone.

                                 SALVO
                        You just lost your phone for a week, 
                        princess. No more fails, no more YouTube, 
                        no more BS.

                                 VANESSA
                        You can’t take my phone!

                                 SALVO
                        Perks of being an asshole.
                        (stern)
                        Every. Single. Pill.

           Salvo pockets the Smartphone and heads into

           INT. SALVO’S GARAGE. DAY.

           where Nancy angrily digs through OLD CRAP on SHELVES, making 
           PILES beside her STATION-WAGON.

           Salvo SIGHS; his day hasn’t even started and it’s ruined.

                                 SALVO
                        Nance, what are you doing?
                                 NANCY
                        We haven’t touched any of this stuff in 
                        years. I’ve decided we’re going to unload 
                        some of it on Ebay.

                                 SALVO
                        You don’t have to do this.

                                 NANCY
                        You’re moonlighting three, four nights a 
                        week and we still need money. I’m digging 
                        pills out of the goddamn trash, Warren!

                                 SALVO
                        I’m sorry-

                                 NANCY
                        -It’s not your fault. You’re doing 
                        everything you can. This is a way for me 
                        to contribute.

           Salvo surveys the shelves.

                                 SALVO
                        Maybe we can do this over the weekend? 
                        I’ll do it over the weekend. C’mon, go 
                        inside. 

                                 NANCY
                        The doctor told me it’s okay to get back 
                        into normal activities. I respect the 
                        fact that you’re concerned, but I’m going 
                        to do things that healthy people do. I’m 
                        going to cook, clean; I’m gonna go back 
                        to work- 

                                 SALVO
                        -I didn’t say I didn’t want you to do 
                        things. Sell this stuff, sell it all; 
                        shit, sell the kids. But, it’s cold in 
                        here. Go put on a coat; please...

           Salvo and Nancy share a look. They love each other deeply.

                                 NANCY
                        Only if you promise to get home safe.

                                 SALVO
                        Always.

           Nancy kisses Salvo, smiles and heads inside. 

           When she’s gone, Salvo searches the cluttered shelves.
           Hidden away, he finds a STUFFED SHERLOCK HOLMES DOLL; it’s 
           dirty, tattered and covered in cobwebs.

           There’s a slit up Sherlock’s back; the corner of an ENVELOPE 
           sticks out.

           Salvo pockets the doll and leaves.

           EXT. JAMAICA LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD STATION. DAY.

           NYPD SQUAD CARS line the sidewalk; LIGHTS FLASHING.

           Delayed COMMUTERS barred by POLICE TAPE, question OFFICERS. 
           ONLOOKERS gawk and GOSSIP.

           ON THE ELEVATED TRACK, a TRAIN sits idle short of the 
           PLATFORM, a few feet away from 

           a JUMBO ZIPLOCK BAG containing a SEVERED HUMAN LEG.

           CRIME SCENE TECHS photograph a SEARCH GRID.

           AT THE PLATFORM’S EDGE, Byrne watches and waits. A PATROLMAN 
           comes over.

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Byrne, how’s your father doing?

                                 BYRNE
                        Good; kicking retirement’s ass.

           Byrne checks his watch; Salvo’s late. He looks around. 

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Heard they just partnered you up with 
                        Warren Salvo.

                                 BYRNE
                        You mean Elliot Mess?

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Funny, but rumor is he left the 109th 
                        with a little dirt on him. 

                                 BYRNE
                        I know. That’s why I got my eyes open and 
                        my sponge ready. He pulls any shit, I’ll 
                        scrub him for sure.

           Byrne sees Salvo shuffle onto the platform in no particular 
           rush; he’s fiddling with Vanessa’s Smartphone.

           Byrne approaches Salvo, unhappy.
                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        You’re late. Again.

                                 SALVO
                        (unapologetic)
                        You know, you can take video with your 
                        phone and it goes right online.

                                 BYRNE
                        Yeah, I know what a fucking cell-phone 
                        can do.
                        (getting to work)
                        Conductor pulled into the station, saw 
                        the leg and called it in.

           Byrne and Salvo climb down a ladder to the tracks.

                                 SALVO
                        Probably a suicide.

                                 BYRNE
                        Probably not; the leg’s in a Ziplock bag.

           Salvo sees the ZIPLOCKED LEG. A CST snaps a photo.

                                 CST
                        Judging by the shoe, the hair and the 
                        musculature, the leg belongs to a man. No 
                        prints on the bag. The cuts are slightly 
                        cauterized; whatever made them was moving 
                        fast. 

                                 SALVO
                        Right between the rails. Dropped out of 
                        the back door of the train?

                                 BYRNE
                        Or, put here to make sure a conductor 
                        sees it.

           Salvo studies the LEG.

                                 SALVO
                        Goddamn osso buco. Must’ve used a chain-
                        saw or circular-saw. Wherever it went 
                        down, there’s gonna be a lot of blood.

                                 BYRNE
                        Yeah? That what your gut’s telling you?

                                 SALVO
                        Fuck you.
                                 BYRNE
                        (fed-up)
                        Fuck you! You show up half-an-hour late 
                        and state the obvious, and I’m not 
                        supposed to break your balls?!

           They’re about to tussle, when the Patrolman SHOUTS from the 
           PLATFORM.

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Byrne, call came over the wire; they 
                        found another body part on the tracks.

                                 BYRNE
                        Where?

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Nassau County.

           EXT. MINEOLA LIRR STATION. DAY.

           Further out on Long Island, the SUBURBAN STATION is 
           surrounded by NASSAU COUNTY SQUAD CARS, CST TRUCKS and a 
           MEDICAL EXAMINER’S VAN.

           ON THE TRACKS, ANOTHER ZIPLOCKED LEG.

           Hunched over the leg is DETECTIVE FRANK PITKA, 38, wry, 
           obese, with a THICK MOUSTACHE. Pitka chews a Milky Way. 

           He may be the unhealthiest cop we’ve ever seen. 

           He sees Byrne and Salvo approaching.

                                 PITKA
                        Brendan, how the hell are you, kid? 

           He shakes Byrne’s hand.

                                 BYRNE
                        Good, Frank. You?

                                 PITKA
                        Living the fucking dream.

           Byrne points to Salvo.

                                 BYRNE
                        My partner, Warren Salvo.

           Salvo offers his hand to Pitka.
                                 PITKA
                        Frank Pitka; good to know you.
                        (beat)
                        I started out in Queens; worked a few 
                        years with Brendan’s dad.
                        (beat)
                        I hear we’ve got bookends.

           They look at the ZIPLOCKED LEG. Pitka takes another mouthful 
           of Milky Way.

                                 PITKA (cont’d)
                        No prints on the bag. Nothing else 
                        around. Think it got tossed off a train.

                                 SALVO
                        How do you do that without being seen?

                                 BYRNE
                        And, where’s the rest of him?

           A NASSAU COUNTY PATROLMAN hurries over.

                                 NASSAU PATROLMAN
                        When it rains it pours; more body parts 
                        out in Cold Spring Harbor.

                                 PITKA
                        For a guy without legs, dude gets around.

           EXT. COLD SPRING HARBOR LIRR STATION. DAY.

           More rural; wealthier. Otherwise, the same scene; SUFFOLK 
           COUNTY SQUAD CARS, CST TRUCKS and a MEDICAL EXAMINER’S VAN.

           ON THE TRACKS, a third ZIPLOCK BAG; this one holds AARON 
           NUSSBAUM’S RIGHT HAND and HEAD.

           Byrne, Salvo and Pitka make their way to DETECTIVE LUTHER 
           COLEMAN, 55, African-American, athletic and affable.

           He’s also sporting the police-issue MOUSTACHE.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Brendan; they told me you caught this 
                        case. 

           Byrne shakes Coleman’s hand.

                                 BYRNE
                        They figured you old moustaches needed 
                        some young eyes on this thing.

           Coleman shakes Pitka’s hand.
                                 COLEMAN
                        Frankie, looking svelte as ever.

                                 PITKA
                        Luther; still the only black cop in 
                        Suffolk County.

           Salvo offers his hand to Coleman.

                                 SALVO
                        Warren Salvo.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Luther Coleman. How do you like working 
                        with the second coming here?

                                 SALVO
                        He completes me.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I knew Brendan when he had skids in his 
                        Underoos; worked Queens ten years with 
                        his dad.
                        (to Byrne)
                        How’s your dad holding up, kid?

                                 BYRNE
                        The same. How’s Junior?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Still at home. A handful. But, we’re 
                        hanging in.

                                 SALVO
                        Teenager?

                                 COLEMAN
                        He’s twenty-one.

                                 SALVO
                        Fucking kick him out.

           Coleman seems somewhat offended by Salvo’s comment; he gets 
           down to business.

                                 COLEMAN 
                        We got a right hand and a head.

                                 PITKA
                        Fingerprints and dental records, yippee.

                                 BYRNE
                        All we need now is the scene of the 
                        crime.
                                 COLEMAN
                        Three stations, three counties, three 
                        jurisdictions; this is a mess. Wanna draw 
                        business cards for the lead?

                                 BYRNE
                        Lead goes with the scene of the crime. We 
                        need to find out if this guy came in from 
                        the Island or out from the City.

                                 SALVO
                        Let’s go to the video tape.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, HOMICIDE DIVISION. DAY.

           Mismatched desks, ancient file cabinets, peeling paint; New 
           York’s Finest get the worst accommodations.

           IN THE BULLPEN, Byrne, Salvo and QUEENS DETECTIVES review 
           FOOTAGE from the JAMAICA STATION; the PLATFORMS are packed 
           with PEOPLE carrying BAGS. 

           The Detectives jot down DESCRIPTIONS and TIMES.

                                 BYRNE
                        I’m going blind.

                                 SALVO
                        Friday morning rush; everyone going into 
                        the City has a bag or a suitcase.

           Salvo opens a DRAWER and grabs another LEGAL PAD; we see the  
           SHERLOCK HOLMES DOLL.

           A DETECTIVE comes over. Salvo promptly shuts the drawer to 
           hide Sherlock.

                                 1ST DETECTIVE
                        Byrne, Salvo; the vic’s prints aren’t in 
                        the system. 

                                 BYRNE
                        Wonderful.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, LOBBY. DAY.

           OFFICERS and DETECTIVES come and go in constant motion, past 
           a WALL-MOUNTED TV showing NY1 NEWS.

           ON TV, RUSCHELL BOONE stands outside JAMAICA STATION.
                                 RUSCHELL (V.O.)
                        ...all we know at this point is that the 
                        Port Jefferson Branch of the Long Island 
                        Rail Road has been shut down in both 
                        directions...

           Martin enters, holding a BROWN BAG LUNCH.

           OFFICERS, pleased to see Martin, crowd around him.

                                 QUEENS OFFICERS
                        Look what the cat dragged in.
                        How are you, Martin?
                        Couldn’t stay away, huh, pal?

                                 MARTIN
                        Bringing the kid lunch.

                                 1ST QUEENS OFFICER
                        He’s up in the bullpen. 

           Martin heads for the STAIRS. The Officers watch him.

                                 2ND QUEENS OFFICER
                        Thought that guy would be running this 
                        place. Why’d he retire?

                                 1ST QUEENS OFFICER
                        Probably that horror-show with his wife.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, HOMICIDE DIVISION. DAY.

           Martin enters the bullpen, where Byrne, Salvo and the Queens 
           Detectives are glued to the LIRR FOOTAGE.

                                 MARTIN
                        How can anyone work in this magnificent 
                        shithole?

           Byrne looks up, surprised to see his father.

                                 BYRNE
                        Pop...

                                 MARTIN
                        Brought you some lunch, kiddo.

           Martin hands Byrne the brown bag. He spots Salvo’s NAMEPLATE.

                                 MARTIN (cont’d)
                        So, you’re the new partner?

                                 SALVO
                        Guilty as charged. Nice to meet you.
           Salvo extends his hand. Martin shakes it.

                                 MARTIN
                        From the way Brendan described you, I 
                        thought you were older.

           Salvo grimaces and lies to Martin.

                                 SALVO
                        Your son’s a mench.

                                 BYRNE
                        You’ll never guess who’s working this 
                        case with us; Frank Pitka and Luther 
                        Coleman.

                                 MARTIN
                        Assholes the both of them; but, good 
                        cops. Don’t let them give you any shit.

           Byrne dumps out the contents of the bag, revealing a WALLET.

           Martin sees the wallet, realizes his mistake.

                                 MARTIN (cont’d)
                        Son of a bitch; I was rushing out of the 
                        house-

           Martin checks his back pocket.

                                 MARTIN (cont’d)
                        -Maybe there’s a PB&J in my back pocket.

           The Detectives LAUGH, so does Martin.

                                 MARTIN (cont’d)
                        (smiling)
                        What I meant was, I’ll buy you lunch.

           Martin grabs his wallet and pulls out some cash.

                                 BYRNE
                        Pop, it’s alright. I need to touch base 
                        with someone. Be back in a few. 

           Byrne heads for the stairs.

           Martin eyes the FOOTAGE on Byrne’s computer.

                                 MARTIN 
                        You boys on this Rail Road thing?
                                 SALVO
                        Body parts left on the tracks, all the 
                        way out to Suffolk County. Good times.

                                 MARTIN
                        Christ, I’m glad I’m retired.

           But, we sense Martin would rather be here than anywhere.

           ON A WINDOWSILL, Martin sees a DONATION BIN for “COPS IN 
           NEED”. He slips a few dollars in the bin. 

           Salvo notices and grins.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, 4TH FLOOR. DAY.

           Byrne makes his way into an office marked:

                          “PATROLMAN’S BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION”.

           INT. PBA OFFICE. DAY.

           It’s cramped, every inch covered in PAMPHLET RACKS and 
           POSTERS about physical, mental and legal strains of the job.

           Byrne makes sure he’s alone, then finds TWO PAMPHLETS:

                             “RECOGNIZING SIGNS OF DEPRESSION” and

                             “BADGE OF LIFE: SUICIDE PREVENTION”. 

           The PBA REP comes in.

                                 PBA REP
                        Byrne, how you doing?

           Byrne steps away from the pamphlet rack.

                                 BYRNE
                        Good. Great. You?

           The PBA Rep notes the pamphlets in Byrne’s hand.

                                 PBA REP
                        Can’t complain.
                        (beat)
                        There anything you need to talk about?

           Byrne covers.

                                 BYRNE
                        These? No, it’s... it’s embarrassing, 
                        actually... I got a new partner last 
                        month; I’m messing with him.
                                 PBA REP
                        Salvo, right?

                                 BYRNE
                        Yeah.

                                 PBA REP
                        Well, don’t mess with him too much, the 
                        guy’s got “gun eater” written all over 
                        him.

           Byrne’s cell-phone RINGS. He answers.

                                 BYRNE
                        (into phone)
                        Byrne.
                        (beat)
                        Alright; be right there.

           Byrne waves to the PBA REP and heads for the door.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, HOMICIDE DIVISION. DAY.

           Byrne hurries into the bullpen to find Salvo putting on his 
           coat; he notices Martin is missing.

                                 BYRNE
                        Where’s my dad?

                                 SALVO
                        Catching up with the Lieutenant.

           Byrne grabs his coat and stuffs the PAMPHLETS in a pocket.

                                 BYRNE
                        What do we have?

                                 SALVO
                        A torso was found at the Citigroup Tower.

                                 BYRNE
                        (joking)
                        Shit, I hope it’s our guy.

           INT. UNMARKED CAR. DAY.

           Byrne drives; he’s quiet, lost in thought. His COAT is 
           bundled beside Salvo on the bench seat. Salvo doesn’t have 
           enough room.

                                 SALVO
                        I’ve noticed you don’t wear your coat 
                        when you drive.
                                 BYRNE
                        It’s cumbersome. Gets in the way.

                                 SALVO
                        Yeah, I know what you mean.

                                 BYRNE
                        If something jumps-off and I gotta chase 
                        a perp, I don’t need a heavy coat holding 
                        me back.

                                 SALVO
                        The only thing dumber than a criminal who 
                        runs, is the cop who chases him. It’s a 
                        good way to get snuffed.

                                 BYRNE
                        I do whatever I have to do to close 
                        cases. It’s called fighting crime, Salvo.

                                 SALVO
                        Your problem, Super-cop, is you still 
                        believe this is a fight we can win. That 
                        fucking peach-fuzz idealism makes you 
                        think you’re supposed to right every 
                        wrong. Work the job a few more years, 
                        grow yourself a moustache and you’ll 
                        realize the best we can hope for in this 
                        fight is a draw. The only thing you’re 
                        supposed to do is survive. Come home at 
                        the end of the day.

                                 BYRNE
                        What happens when you come home to find 
                        that perp you didn’t chase has hurt your 
                        family? Will you settle for a draw, then?

                                 SALVO
                        Trust me, the guy would never make it 
                        past my wife.

           They pull into the CITIGROUP TOWER PARKING LOT and pass 
           OFFICERS searching the WHITE CARGO VAN.

           Byrne parks; he and Salvo hop out to

           EXT. CITIGROUP TOWER. DAY.

           where they head to the entrance. Salvo is startled by a 
           GIRLIE RINGTONE.

           He pulls Vanessa’s SMARTPHONE from his coat; he sees a TEXT:

                             “saw ur dad on youtube, wtf?”
                                 SALVO
                        (to Byrne)
                        You know what a “fail” is?

                                 BYRNE
                        Yeah, I’m looking at one.

           Salvo pockets the Smartphone and they go inside.

           INT. 32ND FLOOR. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo find the OUTER OFFICE flooded with UNIFORMED 
           OFFICERS taking statements from EMPLOYEES.

           AARON NUSSBAUM’S OFFICE is TAPED OFF. CSTs gather evidence.

           AT THE RECEPTION DESK, the haggard Cleaning Crew Member talks 
           with a Uniform, who excuses himself to update our guys.

                                 3RD QUEENS OFFICER
                        We found a cleaning crew member bound and 
                        gagged in the back of a stolen van. He 
                        got choked-out from behind; didn’t see a 
                        perp. His ID was missing. The Killer used 
                        it to enter the building at twelve-ten in 
                        the morning. Got the saw and gun past the 
                        metal detectors inside an industrial 
                        vacuum. No prints on the vacuum or van.
                        (beat)
                        Suspect wore a green parka with a hood. 
                        Surveillance video doesn’t show a face.

                                 BYRNE
                        Appreciate it.

           The Officer heads back to the Cleaning Crew Member; Byrne and 
           Salvo approach AARON NUSSBAUM’S OFFICE.

           They stop at the POLICE TAPE; on the floor, they see the 
           TORSO with a BULLET WOUND in the chest.

           The office is COVERED IN BLOOD.

           One of the CSTs comes over.

                                 2ND CST
                        We’re going to need time to process the 
                        whole office.

                                 SALVO
                        Somebody really loved this guy.

           Byrne pulls out his cell-phone.
                                 BYRNE
                        I’ll update Pitka and Coleman. Call the 
                        house mice; tell them to focus on Rail 
                        Road footage after 12 AM.

                                 SALVO
                        And guys in green parkas.

           Salvo pulls out his cell-phone.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY.

           Later, Byrne, Salvo, Pitka and Coleman are gathered in a 
           conference room with Uniformed Officers.

                                 BYRNE
                        Vic’s name is Aaron Nussbaum, 43; he 
                        lived in Suffolk County and worked for 
                        Citigroup in Communications. 
                        (beat)
                        Prior to working for Citigroup, he did PR 
                        for Youngerman Health. 

           There are perceptible GROANS from the Cops in the room. 

                                 SALVO
                        The shithead Quentin Youngerman’s set to 
                        enter a plea on Monday. We should look at 
                        the possibility that this is related to 
                        his embezzlement.

                                 BYRNE
                        But, Aaron wasn’t charged with any 
                        crimes; he was just a mouth over at 
                        Youngerman. People hate banks as much as 
                        they hate health care insurers; his 
                        murder could be linked to his job here.
                        (beat)
                        We’ve got Nassau and Suffolk Officers 
                        working this case. We’ve agreed that lead 
                        goes with the SOC, so Salvo and I will be 
                        primary on this one. All departments and 
                        officers involved will get credit when we 
                        catch this guy.

           A 3RD CST comes into the conference room.

                                 3RD CST
                        Office is yours.

           INT. OFFICE. DAY.

           Byrne, Salvo, Pitka and Coleman examine AARON’S TORSO with 
           the CSTs. 
                                 2ND CST
                        Looks like he was shot in the chair, then 
                        cut up on the floor. Center-mass wound 
                        from a small-caliber, high-velocity 
                        round; a rifle. Killed instantly. We 
                        pulled the bullet out of the wall; it’s 
                        good for ballistics.

           IN AARON’S WALLET, Byrne finds an ID, CREDIT CARDS, CASH and 
           a MONTHLY LIRR PASS.

                                 BYRNE
                        Got a monthly LIRR pass; for the 
                        Ronkonkoma branch. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Body parts were left on the Port Jeff 
                        branch.

                                 PITKA
                        Maybe Port Jeff is the Killer’s branch?

                                 SALVO
                        Perp gets in clean, gets out clean; the 
                        bags on the tracks are clean. He’s 
                        careful. But, this... it’s sloppy. This 
                        one part of it. Doesn’t line up.

           Salvo surveys the BOOKSHELF; BLOOD SPATTER speckles 
           everything except ONE PRISTINE WHITE DOCUMENT. 

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        (to 2nd CST)
                        Over here. Shoot this.

           The 2nd CST photographs the shelf. 

                                 BYRNE
                        What do you see?

                                 SALVO
                        Everything on this shelf is covered in 
                        blood, except this.

           Salvo dons LATEX GLOVES and grabs the DOCUMENT, it’s held 
           together by a binder clip. 

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        (reading)
                        “Purge the Affliction”. By, You and Me.
                        (looks up)
                        It’s a manifesto.

           Byrne turns to the 2nd CST.
                                 BYRNE
                        Process it and make us copies.

                                 PITKA
                        Mani-fucking-festo; I smell overtime, 
                        boys.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Yeah, we’re all getting rich today.

                                 BYRNE
                        (to Salvo)
                        Now, we know this sick shit is personal.

           Salvo flips through the document.

                                 SALVO
                        Guy leaves a 56-page document; sprinkles 
                        the vic all over the Island. This isn’t 
                        personal. This is a statement.

           EXT. NORTH SHORE DINER. DAY.

           A NEON and STAINLESS STEEL clad Queens staple.

           A rimmed-up, tinted-out HONDA CIVIC pulls in, BASS POUNDING. 

           REYNALDO JIMENEZ, 28, lady-killer handsome, hops out and 
           walks into the diner, past

           a LONE FIGURE loitering near the door; his face covered by a 
           GREEN PARKA. It’s our KILLER.

           INT. NORTH SHORE DINER. DAY.

           Reynaldo smiles at the cute HOSTESS.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Hi, Reynaldo.

                                 REYNALDO
                        Hey, sweetness.

           She hands him a NY TIMES; he hands her the cash.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Your usual booth?

                                 REYNALDO
                        After you.

           The Hostess grabs a MENU, they flirt as she walks Reynaldo to 
           a BOOTH by the WINDOW.
                                 REYNALDO (cont’d)
                        You changed your hair.

                                 HOSTESS
                        I wanted to look good for you.

                                 REYNALDO
                        Well, you look great.

           She smiles, smitten. The Hostess notices the TIMES’ FRONT 
           PAGE, there’s a PHOTO of QUENTIN YOUNGERMAN and the HEADLINE:

                             “YOUNGERMAN OFFERED 10YR PLEA”. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        How could a nice guy like you ever work 
                        for a prick like Youngerman?

                                 REYNALDO
                        I didn’t know he was a prick.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Do you think he’s really gonna give back 
                        all that money?

                                 REYNALDO
                        I don’t care what Quentin does as long as 
                        he leaves me the hell out of it.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Enjoy your lunch; I’ll see you on the way 
                        out.

           Reynaldo watches her wiggle away. He flips to the 
           CLASSIFIEDS, takes out a pen and starts to circle jobs.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see the Killer approach Rey’s Honda. A  
           CROWBAR slides out of his sleeve, into his gloved hand.

           The Killer SHATTERS the HONDA’S WINDOWS and DENTS the HOOD. 

           All the PATRONS turn and look out the window. Including Rey.

                                 REYNALDO
                        What the fu-

           Rey bolts out of his booth to

           EXT. NORTH SHORE DINER. DAY.

           where the Killer drops the CROWBAR and runs away. 

           Rey surveys his wrecked ride, awestruck and angry. 
           The Hostess hurries outside, concerned.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Rey-

           Rey grabs the crowbar and chases the Killer DOWN THE STREET.

                                 REYNALDO
                        You’re dead, motherfucker!

           The Killer turns a corner. Rey, clutching the crowbar, 
           charges into 

           EXT. ALLEY. DAY.

           where he finds a DEAD END and FOUR METAL DUMPSTERS.

           No one is around. Not even the Killer.

           Rey eyes the dumpsters; he’s got the son of a bitch.

                                 REYNALDO
                        Nowhere to go, asshole!

           CLANG! Rey swats the first dumpster with the crowbar.

                                 REYNALDO (cont’d)
                        You don’t want to come out? I’ll come in 
                        after you!

           Rey flips open the FIRST DUMPSTER, nothing but TRASH. He 
           opens the SECOND DUMPSTER, just GARBAGE.

                                 REYNALDO (cont’d)
                        I’m gonna fuck you up!

           Furious, Rey yanks open the THIRD DUMPSTER. 

           BOOM! A FLASH GRENADE blinds Rey, who drops the crowbar and 
           shields his eyes.

           The Killer climbs out of the FOURTH DUMPSTER, holding the 
           RIFLE.

           Rey, squinting, can barely see. The Killer shoves him against 
           the wall and aims the rifle at Rey’s head, execution-style.

                                 REYNALDO (cont’d)
                        (pleading)
                        Wait! Please, no-

           BANG! BANG! BANG! BULLETS tear through Rey and into the wall.

           Rey drops to the ground. The Killer walks out of the alley.
           EXT. NORTH SHORE DINER. DAY.

           Concerned PATRONS and the HOSTESS have gathered. They see the 
           Killer, holding the RIFLE; his face covered by the hood.

           They give him a wide berth as he walks past.

                                 KILLER
                        Call the police.

                                                            CUT TO:

           a POLICE HELICOPTER, flying over the neighborhood around

           EXT. NORTH SHORE DINER. DAY.

           where the area is cordoned-off by POLICE TAPE and surrounded 
           by NYPD SQUAD CARS and QUEENS OFFICERS. 

           The MEDICAL EXAMINER wheels a BODY BAG past REY’S BATTERED  
           CIVIC and into a VAN.

           Byrne, Salvo, Pitka and Coleman hurry toward the OFFICER 
           holding the LOG BOOK. They sign in.

                                 BYRNE
                        Who’s lead on this?

                                 LOG OFFICER
                        Garret and Medina.

           The Log Officer points to DETECTIVES GARRET and MEDINA, 30s; 
           goatees, God-complexes, a perfect pair of pricks.

           Salvo isn’t happy to see them.

                                 SALVO
                        Just what the fuck I need.

           Once they’ve signed in, Byrne, Salvo, Pitka and Coleman 
           proceed to Garret and Medina, who eye Salvo; there’s bad 
           blood between them.

                                 GARRET
                        Salvo, back on your old stumbling 
                        grounds, huh?

                                 MEDINA
                        Thought we’d seen the last of you.

                                 SALVO
                        I’m like a bad penny.
                                 GARRET
                        What, you need three partners to help you 
                        out these days?

                                 SALVO
                        Byrne’s with me; Pitka’s Nassau and 
                        Coleman’s Suffolk.

                                 MEDINA
                        Stay on your toes, fellas; Sherlock here 
                        couldn’t handle things at the 109th.

                                 SALVO
                        Something in the building triggered my 
                        allergies.

           Byrne’s heard enough.

                                 BYRNE
                        Let’s put our dicks away and try to close 
                        this thing.

           Medina holds up REYNALDO’S DRIVER’S LICENSE.

                                 MEDINA
                        Reynaldo Jimenez, 28; unemployed. Most 
                        recently worked as a Sales Rep for 
                        Youngerman Health; which is why you got 
                        invited to the party.

                                 GARRET
                        Ate lunch here every day the last few 
                        months. Neighborhood guy; no warrants, no 
                        arrests.

                                 BYRNE
                        He wasn’t charged when Youngerman got 
                        raided?

                                 MEDINA
                        Only Quentin and the CFO were charged. No 
                        one else had the authority to pull money 
                        out of the company.

                                 GARRET
                        Judging by the fact that Rey was checking 
                        the classifieds when he got smoked; I’d 
                        say he didn’t have millions of dollars 
                        tucked in his mattress.

                                 BYRNE
                        Take us through it.
                                 GARRET
                        Perp is outside before Rey arrives; once 
                        Rey’s inside, the perp smashes Rey’s car. 
                        Rey chases him into the alley, where he 
                        gets dead. Three shots, execution style.

                                 MEDINA
                        Lured Rey right into a trap.

                                 SALVO
                        Anybody get a look at the perp?

                                 MEDINA
                        Half the people in the diner. Guy comes 
                        out of the alley, rifle in hand. His face 
                        was covered, but he was wearing a green 
                        hooded parka.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Green parka; sounds like our guy.

                                 GARRET
                        What do you know about this asshole?

                                 PITKA
                        He’s got a gun and a grudge; other than 
                        that, jack-shit.

                                 GARRET
                        Youngerman Health covered a lot of City 
                        employees. Lotta people in uniform lost 
                        their insurance when it collapsed. 
                        Sanitation wears green parkas. 

                                 BYRNE
                        It’s a direction. Keep us posted.

           Byrne, Salvo, Pitka and Coleman walk to their cars. Salvo 
           waits until he’s out of earshot of Pitka and Coleman. 

                                 SALVO
                        Byrne, we do not want Garret and Medina 
                        anywhere near this case.

                                 BYRNE
                        (blowing him off)
                        I’m sure they’re saying the same thing 
                        about you, Sherlock.

           Salvo’s upset, but bites his tongue. Byrne removes his coat, 
           tosses it onto the front seat and hops behind the wheel. 
           INT. UNMARKED CAR. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo drive in silence. Salvo nudges Byrne’s coat 
           to make more room on the seat.

                                 SALVO
                        Seriously, this coat-off-while-driving 
                        thing; it’s gonna be a problem.

                                 BYRNE
                        We’ve got multiple homicides, and you’re 
                        thinking about my coat?

                                 SALVO
                        No, I’m thinking I got less room on the 
                        seat; you’ve got the heat turned up... 
                        I’m boiling.

                                 BYRNE
                        Take your coat off.

                                 SALVO
                        Put yours on. You can’t chase a perp with 
                        your coat on; bullshit. Pretend it’s a 
                        fucking cape.

                                 BYRNE
                        This really bothers you?

                                 SALVO
                        This is supposed to be a partnership; I 
                        should get half the goddamn seat-

                                 BYRNE
                        -Jesus fucking Christ.

           Byrne whips his coat into the back. When he does, the 
           PAMPHLETS fall out onto the seat.

           Salvo picks up the pamphlet for “BADGE OF LIFE”. He’s 
           genuinely concerned.

                                 SALVO
                        This is suicide stuff; for retired cops. 
                        Is it for your dad?

                                 BYRNE
                        No, they’re not for my dad, they’re for 
                        me. If I have to keep listening to you 
                        complain, I’m gonna blow my fucking 
                        brains out.
                                 SALVO
                        Nice. But, seriously, if there’s a 
                        problem-

                                 BYRNE
                        -My father’s not a “gun eater”.

           Salvo tries to reassure Byrne, but there’s sadness under the 
           surface.

                                 SALVO
                        I’ve only spent five minutes with your 
                        dad, but, I’ll tell you this; you don’t 
                        need to worry about him.
                        (beat)
                        There are two kinds of cops that put 
                        bullets in their heads: ruined guys and 
                        “gun eaters”. Ruined guys keep seeing 
                        vics in their dreams, thinking they 
                        could’ve saved them if they were a better 
                        cop. They send apology letters to 
                        families involved in cases they couldn’t 
                        close. They relive a clean shooting over 
                        and over until they convince themselves 
                        they should never have pulled the 
                        trigger. They feel guilty for shit they 
                        didn’t do. It fucking ruins them. They’re 
                        tragedies.
                        (beat)
                        A “gun eater” is a whole different 
                        animal. He deserves every last bit of 
                        guilt, because he got dirty. He took a 
                        little money, planted evidence, maybe 
                        even dumped someone that could’ve made 
                        trouble. He tells himself the badge gives 
                        him the right. But, every time he crosses 
                        the line, he adds a little more guilt. 
                        And when it’s all over, and that badge is 
                        gone, he realizes guilt is all he’s got; 
                        growing inside him like cancer... 
                        incurable. So, he ends up slumped over on 
                        a couch, brains decorating the room; gun 
                        cleaning kit on the coffee table to make 
                        it look like an accident.
                        (beat)
                        Your dad’s not a “gun eater”, and the job 
                        didn’t ruin him. He lit up when he walked 
                        into that bullpen. He loves every memory 
                        he has.

           Salvo tears up the pamphlets. Byrne studies him.
                                 BYRNE
                        I was going to give you those pamphlets 
                        as a joke, but now I’m thinking you might 
                        need them. I’m recognizing signs of 
                        depression.

                                 SALVO
                        I planned on being retired by now, but I 
                        got no savings, a 2nd mortgage and two 
                        kids to put through college. Depression 
                        is the only thing I got that’s free.

                        Well, cheer up; maybe you’ll get shot 
                        today. Get some line of duty benefits.

                                 SALVO
                        A hundred-grand for getting snuffed won’t 
                        last my family two years.

                                 BYRNE
                        I was kidding, Salvo.
                        (beat)
                        Besides, it’s hard to get killed when 
                        you’re the last guy to show up at the 
                        scene.

           Byrne LAUGHS. Salvo shakes his head.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, HOMICIDE DIVISION. DAY.

           DETECTIVES buzz in the BULLPEN. A DRY-ERASE “MURDER-BOARD” 
           displays the FEW CLUES; lots of WHITE SPACE. 

           LIRR SURVEILLANCE STILLS of the KILLER in the GREEN PARKA 
           don’t reveal his face.

           Blown-up driver’s license PHOTOS of AARON and REYNALDO are 
           labelled “DEAD”. 

           Byrne, Salvo, Pitka and Coleman arrive and get down to work. 
           Byrne stops at the 1st Detective’s desk.

                                 BYRNE
                        Got that list for me?

                                 1ST DETECTIVE
                        Youngerman Health offered coverage to 
                        firemen, policemen, sanitation... there 
                        are 50,000 names on this list.

                                 BYRNE
                        Cross reference it with arrests and prior 
                        convictions. Start with sanitation.
           Byrne heads to his computer; Pitka and Coleman add info to 
           the murder-board. Salvo scours the MANIFESTO.

           LT. ALLEN, 60, authoritative but approachable, comes out of 
           his office.

                        Had a car take him home; he was a little 
                        tired.

                        Where are we?

                                 BYRNE
                        Man in a green parka was seen at both 
                        murders. Both vics shot with a rifle. 

                                 LT. ALLEN
                        If you’re a shooter, why cut up the first 
                        vic?

                                 BYRNE
                        We don’t know. We’re looking at people 
                        who were covered by Youngerman Health.

                                 LT. ALLEN
                        Do we have a number on how many employees 
                        worked at Youngerman? We may need to get 
                        the word out to them.

           A 2nd Detective searches “YOUNGERMAN HEALTH” on his computer.

                                 2ND DETECTIVE
                        It’s hard to say. Youngerman was around 
                        for 40 years; it was a decent-sized 
                        company, but they started to purge 
                        employees in the year before Quentin got 
                        busted.

           Salvo finds something of interest in the MANIFESTO. He looks 
           up at the MURDER-BOARD.

                                 SALVO
                        I think I know why he cut up Aaron.
                        (beat)
                        A manifesto was left in Aaron’s office. 
                        56 pages of rants about health care and 
                        greed; lunatic shit. But, this section 
                        reads, “...foot-soldiers Reynaldo Jimenez 
                        and Theresa Innes; right-hand man Douglas 
                        Edison and head of the company Quentin

                        We found one leg in Queens, one leg in 
                        Nassau and a right hand and head in 
                        Suffolk.

           Salvo moves to the murder-board. He writes “FOOT-SOLDIER” and 
           “LEG” under REYNALDO’S PHOTO.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Reynaldo, a “foot-soldier” gets snuffed 
                        in Queens; where we found a leg. Theresa 
                        Innes is the other “foot-soldier”. 

           The 1st Detective pulls up Theresa’s DMV record.

                        address in Nassau County.

                                 SALVO
                        Where the other leg was found.

           Byrne checks something on his computer.

                        Douglas Edison, the “right-hand man”, 
                        lives in Suffolk, where the right hand 
                        was found, along with the head-

                        his daddy’s mansion in Suffolk County.

           The Detectives place a PHOTO of Theresa Innes and MUGSHOTS of 
           DOUGLAS EDISON and QUENTIN YOUNGERMAN with the corresponding 
           COUNTIES and BODY PARTS.

                                 SALVO
                        The body parts were left in specific 
                        counties to send a message.

                                 PITKA
                        And that message is, “I’m fucking crazy”.

                        Crazy doesn’t plan to get around metal 
                        detectors, security guards and 
                        surveillance cameras. Crazy doesn’t lure

                        This is a hit-list; there are three

           exhausted and triumphant, crosses the FINISH LINE.

           AT THE END OF THE HALL, they find a RACK OF RUNNING SHOES, an

                        I should’ve switched insurers when

                        telling me there was no way Quentin could 
                        live up to his old man. Zack Youngerman 
                        personally called to congratulate us when 
                        the kids were born. You got the sense 
                        that the guy cared. After he died, 
                        Quentin set up these seminars at fancy 
                        hotels in Midtown. He wanted to reassure 
                        the policyholders that he could handle 
                        the job. He said, “My father was always 
                        there for me; I will always be there for 
                        you.” He seemed sincere.

                        later, in the middle of chemo, we got a 
                        letter from the hospital saying the bills 
                        weren’t being paid. We can’t get anyone 
                        at Youngerman on the phone; for days, 
                        weeks. We weren’t going to stop the 
                        chemo, so the bills kept piling up. I’m 
                        asking other cops and they’re having the 
                        same problems. And then, Youngerman gets 
                        raided. I see Quentin being lead out in 
                        cuffs; there’s no money, no more company, 
                        no more coverage... I’ve got two kids, a 
                        sick wife and no health insurance.

                                 BYRNE
                        There are other insurers approved by the 
                        Department.

                                 SALVO
                        That’s the fucking icing. According to my 
                        new insurance company, Nancy’s cancer is 
                        a “pre-existing condition”. Now, thanks 
                        to Obama-care, they have to cover her. 
                        But, thanks to capitalism, the premiums 
                        are astronomical. And, we’re still 
                        responsible for the bills Youngerman 
                        didn’t pay.

                                 BYRNE
                        They’ve seized Quentin’s assets. Once 
                        they’re liquidated, the policyholders 
                        will get their money.
                                 SALVO
                        They’ll never get back everything Quentin 
                        took, and there’s 50,000 people waiting 
                        for a piece of that pie. I can’t bank on 
                        that money.
                        (beat)
                        All I can do is work the job until the 
                        day I die, moonlight as much as possible 
                        and spend what little free time I have 
                        praying to God my wife doesn’t get worse.

           Byrne can see Salvo’s hurting. 

                                 BYRNE
                        I didn’t know about your wife; I’m sorry.

                                 SALVO
                        I’ll wrangle these people, but don’t ask 
                        me to kick down any doors or pull some 
                        Super-cop shit. I gotta make it home at 
                        the end of the day.

           EXT. DOUGLAS EDISON’S HOUSE. DAY.

           A small house in Suffolk County. 

           THREE SUFFOLK COUNTY SQUAD CARS pull up. SIX UNIFORMED 
           OFFICERS, guns drawn, fan out and approach the house, looking 
           for any signs of trouble.

           An Officer KNOCKS on the door. After a moment, DOUGLAS’ WIFE, 
           43, answers; she’s all mascara and attitude.

                                 1ST SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        Is this Douglas Edison’s house?

                                 DOUGLAS’ WIFE
                        It’s my house; my soon-to-be-ex-husband 
                        currently resides in the garage. 

                                 2ND SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        We need to speak with him.

                                 DOUGLAS’ WIFE
                        He’s at work. 

                                 3RD SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        Where does he work?

                                 DOUGLAS’ WIFE
                        What did he do now?
                                 4TH SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        Where does he work?

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. TARGET. DAY.

           A super-store in a SUFFOLK COUNTY STRIP MALL. It’s a normal 
           shopping day, until 

           THREE SUFFOLK COUNTY SQUAD CARS pull up. Pitka’s right behind 
           in his UNMARKED CAR. 

           INT. TARGET. DAY.

           We move past a DISPLAY of TELEVISIONS showing NY1; ROMA TORRE 
           follows “BREAKING NEWS”.

                                 ROMA (V.O.)
                        ...helicopter is still over the scene in 
                        Flushing where a man has been shot near a 
                        diner. Police have yet to identify the 
                        victim or release a description of the 
                        suspect or suspects...

           BY A FLAT SCREEN TV, we find DOUGLAS EDISON, 45, a wiry 
           weasel wearing KHAKIS and a RED SHIRT with the TARGET 
           “BULLSEYE” LOGO.

           Douglas is with a CUSTOMER.

                                 DOUGLAS 
                        ...It’s got 1080p and an HDMI input, so 
                        the picture quality is fantastic...

           Douglas notices

           Pitka and SIX SUFFOLK OFFICERS headed straight for him. He 
           gets extremely uneasy.

                                 DOUGLAS (cont’d)
                        I just need to... head to the back... for 
                        a second-

           Douglas takes off. Pitka and the Officers chase him into

           INT. STORE ROOM. DAY.

           where Pitka manages to tackle Douglas, pin him down and 
           HANDCUFF him. Pitka is sweaty, winded and pissed.

                                 PITKA
                        You better have a damn good reason for 
                        making me run!
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Cops hate me; I’m afraid of the police.

                                 PITKA
                        Well, there’s someone you need to be more 
                        afraid of.

           Pitka pulls Douglas to his feet, hands him off to a Suffolk 
           Officer and hunches over to catch his breath.

           EXT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           COLEMAN’S UNMARKED CAR leads FIVE SUFFOLK SQUAD CARS up to 
           the manicured lawn of the humongous house. 

           Coleman and TEN SUFFOLK OFFICERS fan out around the sprawling 
           property, searching; all seems quiet.

           IN THE DRIVEWAY, Officers pass a SIX-CAR GARAGE, with 
           customized spaces for Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches, 
           but the cars are conspicuously absent.

           IN THE BACKYARD, Coleman and some Suffolk Officers find a 
           HUGE POOL, a GAZEBO and a HELIPAD, but no helicopter.

                                 COLEMAN
                        God, tell me they seized the helicopter.

           INT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           The DOORBELL CHIMES. The PHONE RINGS. OFFICERS move around 
           outside; inside, we see no one. 

           The ANSWERING MACHINE picks up.

                                 QUENTIN (V.O.)
                        You’ve reached Quentin Youngerman, please 
                        leave your death-threat after the beep.

           BEEEEEP!

                                 5TH SUFFOLK OFFICER (V.O.)
                        This is the NYPD; officers are outside 
                        your home-

           EXT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           Coleman stands beside the 5th Suffolk Officer, who’s on his 
           cell-phone. The Officer shakes his head, “no”.

                                 5TH SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        Answering machine.

           Coleman dials his cell-phone.
           INT. NYPD MONITORING CENTER. DAY.

           DOZENS of NYPD TECH OFFICERS, wearing HEADSETS, monitor 
           COMPUTER SCREENS. 

           An NYPD TECH answers a call.

                                 NYPD TECH
                        (into headset)
                        Monitoring.

                        This is Detective Luther Coleman, Suffolk 
                        PD; I’m outside Quentin Youngerman’s 
                        house and he’s not answering the door or 
                        the phone.

           The NYPD Tech accesses Quentin’s monitor on a COMPUTER.

                                 NYPD TECH
                        (into headset)
                        The computer shows Quentin is inside the 
                        house. History shows the monitor hasn’t 
                        moved in about 35 minutes.

           EXT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           Coleman, on his cell-phone, looks at the house.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        Can you authorize a breach?

           Coleman signals the Suffolk Officers that they can breach.

                                 COLEMAN (cont’d)
                        (into phone)
                        Stay on the line.

           Coleman lowers his cell and draws his gun. He leads the ten 
           Suffolk Officers to the FRONT DOOR. 

           He motions, “three, two, one”.

           Coleman kicks open the door; he and the Officers flood into

           INT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           where they search ROOM-TO-ROOM, looking under COUCHES and 
           BEDS, in CLOSETS, BATHROOMS, a HOME OFFICE and GYM.

           There’s no sign of anyone.

           Coleman puts his cell to his ear.
                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        Quentin’s not here.

           INT. NYPD MONITORING CENTER. DAY.

           The NYPD Tech clicks away at his keyboard.

                                 NYPD TECH
                        (into headset)
                        The ankle-monitor is still in the house; 
                        if Quentin cut it off, we’d get a signal. 
                        As far as I can tell, it’s intact and in 
                        that house.

           INT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           Coleman lowers the phone. He moves into the KITCHEN, Officers 
           check under a table and in the cabinets.

           Coleman notices some FLOOR-TO-CEILING CABINETS are ASKEW.

           Coleman motions for an Officer to provide cover. He touches 
           the cabinets; the whole unit moves. 

           It’s a HIDDEN DOORWAY.

           Coleman opens the door, revealing a STAIRCASE.

           Coleman and the ten Suffolk Officers, guns drawn, move slowly 
           down the staircase to

           INT. BASEMENT. DAY.

           where they find a MAZE-LIKE WINE CELLAR, home to HUGE WINE 
           RACKS holding THOUSANDS of BOTTLES. 

           There is an ominous, distant HUM. 

           Coleman and the Officers warily weave through the maze, 
           carefully turning corners; the HUM grows LOUDER and LOUDER, 
           until they find

           a BUBBLING JACUZZI, where QUENTIN YOUNGERMAN, 39, relaxes 
           with a nice GLASS OF WINE. 

           His feet rest on the edge, ANKLE-MONITOR attached.

           Quentin puts on THICK GLASSES, surveys the cops and smiles.

                                 QUENTIN
                        I heard you guys roaming around up there, 
                        but I really didn’t want to get out of 
                        the Jacuzzi.
           Quentin’s kind of a dick. Coleman puts his cell to his ear.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        We’ve got him; he’s fine.

           Coleman hangs up. Quentin sits on the edge of the Jacuzzi; 
           he’s covered in TATTOOS and wears a SPEEDO.

                                 QUENTIN
                        You guys should hop in; you look tense.

           EXT. SOUTH BROOKSIDE AVENUE. DAY.

           The TRANSPORT CAR moves through the Nassau County coastal 
           community.

           INT. TRANSPORT CAR. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo look out the windows. Their PATROL RADIOS 
           CHATTER.

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        This is Coleman; we have Quentin secure.

           A few moments later.

                        It’s Pitka; Douglas is secure.

                        We are en route to Theresa; she’s not 
                        answering her cell.

           Byrne clicks off his radio. 

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, they see FREEPORT HIGH SCHOOL. Behind 
           it, the ATHLETIC FIELD.

           EXT. FREEPORT HIGH SCHOOL FIELD, PARKING LOT. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo drive in. There’s only one car in the lot; a 
           BLACK CHEVY TAHOE.

           Byrne and Salvo hop out. Byrne pops the trunk, there’s a 
           SHOTGUN mounted under the deck-lid. 
           Byrne pulls a BULLETPROOF VEST from the trunk; he and Salvo 
           hurry toward 

           EXT. FREEPORT HIGH SCHOOL TRACK. DAY.

           where they see THERESA INNES, 39, running. She’s pretty, 
           smart and in great shape.

           UNDER THE BLEACHERS, Byrne sees SOMEONE IN A HOODED PARKA. 

                                 BYRNE
                        Under the bleachers; parka. Get Theresa.

           Salvo heads for Theresa. Byrne draws his gun and approaches 
           the person in the parka. It appears to be a MAN.

                        PUT ‘EM ON YOUR HEAD!

           Byrne quickens his pace, gun trained on the Suspect.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        TURN AROUND AND KNEEL DOWN!

           The Suspect complies. Byrne gets right up on him and pulls 
           his hood down to reveal

           an OVERGROWN, acne-faced TEENAGER.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)

                        I’m cutting man; I’m sorry. Chill.

                                 BYRNE
                        Get up. Get up and go back to school.

           The Teenager, terrified, stands up.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Run ten laps first, for pissing me off.

           Byrne shoves the Teenager away. He takes a deep calming 
           breath; he’s clearly tense.

           Byrne heads over to where Salvo is putting the BULLETPROOF 
           VEST on Theresa; she’s stunned. 
                                 THERESA
                        I can’t believe Aaron and Rey are dead.

           Salvo straps her into the vest.

                                 BYRNE
                        We’re going to take you back home. We’ve 
                        got officers there already.

                                 THERESA
                        I knew something like this would happen; 
                        I knew it.

                                 SALVO
                        My heart weeps.

           Byrne and Salvo, keeping watch, lead Theresa to 

           EXT. FREEPORT HIGH SCHOOL FIELD, PARKING LOT. DAY.

           where they usher her toward their transport car. 

                                 THERESA
                        I can drive myself.

                                 SALVO
                        Lady, this is police protection, not a 
                        police escort.

                                 BYRNE
                        Ma’am, the safest place in the world 
                        right now is the back seat of our car.

           Byrne opens the back door of the transport car; Theresa 
           slides in.

           Byrne hops behind the wheel; Salvo gets in the passenger 
           side.

           INT. TRANSPORT CAR. DAY.

           BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS PARTITION, Theresa is nervous; she tugs 
           at the uncomfortable bulletproof vest.

           UP FRONT, Byrne drives. Salvo keys his RADIO.

                                 SALVO
                        (into radio)
                        This is Salvo; we’ve got Theresa Innes 
                        and we’re bringing her home. Send the 
                        units from the dealership to her house.

                                 1ST NASSAU OFFICER (V.O.)
                        10-4.
           Salvo eyes Theresa in the rear-view mirror; he’s seething, 
           but CLEARS HIS THROAT and does his job.

                                 SALVO
                        You said you knew something like this 
                        would happen. Do you know of anyone 
                        specifically who’d want to hurt you?

                                 THERESA
                        I was a Claims Manager; I dealt with 
                        policies for hundreds of people. I was 
                        their point of contact, the person they 
                        cursed-out when things went bad.

                                 BYRNE
                        And, with Quentin in charge, things were 
                        bad.

                                 THERESA
                        Quentin’s father came from poverty to 
                        build a successful, trustworthy company 
                        with a loyal following. Quentin grew up 
                        in a mansion and never heard the word 
                        “no”. He never thought about people, he 
                        thought about profits.
                        (beat)
                        It’s hard to make profits when you insure 
                        people in dangerous, stressful jobs 
                        during a recession and health care 
                        reform. Things at Youngerman changed 
                        quickly. My co-workers were getting laid-
                        off left and right; we got a directive to 
                        question all claims, postpone payments to 
                        doctors...
                        (beat)
                        I worked as hard as I could to help 
                        customers and keep customers, hoping the 
                        economy would change. I didn’t know 
                        Quentin and Doug were funneling money out 
                        of the company... 

                                 BYRNE
                        Did Aaron or Rey know?

                                 THERESA
                        Nobody knew, Quentin had Doug cover his 
                        tracks by setting up checking accounts in 
                        the names of practices and clinics who 
                        were no longer on our list of providers. 
                        The claims were fake, the doctors didn’t 
                        know they were getting paid, because they 
                        didn’t know the accounts existed. And 
                        only Quentin had access to the accounts. 
                        He bled Youngerman dry.

                        (beat)
                        One day, police come rushing in, they 
                        arrest Quentin and Doug, and Youngerman 
                        Health is just... gone. I found out when 
                        everyone else found out.
                        (beat)
                        I worked at Youngerman for fifteen years 
                        before Quentin took over. I was a 
                        dedicated employee. This ruined my life. 

           Salvo looks Theresa dead in the eye. He holds up his wallet, 
           there’s a PHOTO of NANCY.

                                 SALVO
                        Do you recognize this woman? This is my 
                        wife. She met with you about a year ago. 
                        She couldn’t get you on the phone for 
                        weeks, so she went down to your office in 
                        the dead of winter, in the middle of 
                        chemo to ask why you stopped paying for 
                        her treatment. 
                        (beat)
                        Do you remember her?

           Theresa doesn’t have the answer Salvo wants.

                                 THERESA
                        No. I don’t remember her.

                                 SALVO
                        Then don’t give me this shit that it was 
                        only Quentin who didn’t care about 
                        people.
                        (beat)
                        As far as I’m concerned, you’re all 
                        getting what you deserve.

                                 THERESA
                        I don’t expect you to believe that I 
                        didn’t know what was going on, but the 
                        truth is, this was all Quentin. He’s the 
                        master-manipulator.

                                 BYRNE
                        He managed to manipulate himself into a 
                        ten-year prison stint.

                                 THERESA
                        Yeah, only 10 years; for embezzling 50-
                        million dollars. Because they offered the 
                        poor little man-child who lost his 
                        beloved daddy a plea if he gave back 
                        everything he had left.

                        The problem is, Quentin Youngerman is a 
                        pathological liar; diabolically greedy. 
                        The only thing he loved about his father 
                        was his money. Quentin would never give 
                        back all that cash without a plan.
                        (beat)
                        I calculated what the police got back 
                        from Quentin and what his frozen assets 
                        are worth. It’s just an estimate, but I 
                        think Quentin could have 15-million 
                        dollars hidden away.
                        (beat)
                        Would you be willing to do 10 years in a 
                        minimum security prison if you knew you’d 
                        end up with 15-million dollars?

           Byrne and Salvo share a look. 

                                 SALVO
                        Coleman’s with Quentin; we should clue 
                        him in.

                                 BYRNE
                        Use your cell, Quentin might be in 
                        earshot of a radio.

           Salvo takes out his cell-phone and dials.

           He doesn’t see THERESA’S TAHOE pull alongside them. 

                                 THERESA
                        That’s my car-

           We glimpse the slightest bit of a GREEN SLEEVE and the BARREL 
           OF A RIFLE, before

           BANG! THERESA’S HEAD EXPLODES, splattering BLOOD ON THE 
           PARTITION.

           Instant chaos.

                                 BYRNE
                        Down! DOWN!

           Byrne ducks. Salvo drops his phone, whips out his 9MM, opens 
           his window and FIRES, as

           Byrne slaps the car into REVERSE and floors it; speeding 
           backwards to create distance between them and the Killer.

           Salvo UNLOADS HIS CLIP into the TAHOE as it SCREECHES away. 

           The Tahoe’s REAR WINDOW SHATTERS, BULLETS PELT BODY PANELS, 
           it SWERVES and CRASHES INTO A FENCE.
           Byrne tries to spin the transport car around; he loses 
           control and SLAMS the DRIVER’S SIDE INTO A BUILDING.

           The DRIVER’S DOOR BUCKLES, AIR BAGS POP. STEAM SPEWS from 
           under the HOOD.

           Suddenly, all is quiet, but not calm.

                                 SALVO
                        You alright?

           Byrne is dazed; he’s pinned in.

                                 BYRNE
                        I’m stuck, but... I’m... I’m okay.

           Salvo looks out his WINDOW, adrenaline fighting fear.

                                 SALVO
                        I think I hit the guy.

           Salvo looks back at the BLOODY PARTITION; Theresa’s mottled 
           hair and mangled face rest against it.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        She’s dead.

                                 BYRNE
                        (furious)
                        Fucking SHIT!

           Salvo looks out his window again.

                                 SALVO
                        I think I hit the guy.

                                 BYRNE
                        Go check it out; I’ll call for back-up.

           Salvo forces his door open and pulls himself out to

           EXT. NASSAU STREET. DAY.

           where he slides a fresh clip into his gun.

           We see GASOLINE LEAKING from the transport car as Salvo makes 
           his way down the street.

           It’s a marine-industrial area; OLD WAREHOUSES, a seasonal 
           place and it’s off season. 

           No one is around to help.
           Salvo sees the BACK OF THE TAHOE tangled in a HIGH BARBED-
           WIRE FENCE bordering a MARINE SALVAGE YARD. 

           Getting closer, he discovers the GREEN PARKA slung over the 
           top of the fence.

           Salvo, extra-cautious, checks the area; no sign of the 
           Killer. 

           He must have gone into the MARINE SALVAGE YARD.

           Salvo reaches for the RADIO mounted on his vest; it was 
           BROKEN in the crash.

                                 SALVO
                        Shit.

           Salvo looks inside the TAHOE; in the back of the DRIVER’S 
           SEAT, he sees BULLET HOLES. 

           STUFFING spills out of the front.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Tell me I got him.

           Salvo climbs onto the TAHOE’s roof; he finds BULLET HOLES in 
           the back of the PARKA.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        I got him.

           Salvo scales the fence and drops into 

           EXT. MARINE SALVAGE YARD. DAY.

           where he’s surrounded by a labyrinth of ROTTING BOATS.

           Gun drawn, he creeps down a ROW OF WEATHERED HULLS; hundreds 
           of places to hide.

           He’s startled by a GIRLIE RINGTONE.

           Salvo pulls out Vanessa’s SMARTPHONE to silence it. He sees a 
           TEXT from “Robbie” that reads:

                             “r u wet?”

           Salvo’s brow furrows.

                                 SALVO
                        Are you wet? Who the fuck is Robbie?
           A KIMBER .45 PISTOL is pressed against the back of Salvo’s 
           head by THE KILLER, who’s dressed in a BULLETPROOF VEST.

           Lodged in the back of his vest, we see TWO BULLETS.

           His RIFLE hangs over his shoulder.

                                 KILLER
                        (deathly calm)
                        Toss your weapon.

           Salvo tosses his gun. He surreptitiously presses RECORD on 
           Vanessa’s SMARTPHONE.

                                 KILLER (cont’d)
                        Turn around and kneel down.

           Salvo sweats, he knows he’s going to die.

                                 KILLER (cont’d)
                        Interlace your fingers behind your head.

           Salvo does, keeping the Smartphone in his shaking hand.

                                 KILLER (cont’d)
                        Put the phone down and interlace your 
                        fingers behind your head!

           Salvo puts the Smartphone down, camera pointed at the Killer.

                                 KILLER (cont’d)
                        Who are you?

                                 SALVO
                        Detective Warren Salvo. 
                        (beat)
                        Wanna tell me who you are?

                                 KILLER
                        Someone who doesn’t like to be shot.

                                 SALVO
                        (voice wavering)
                        Hey, you and me both.
                        (beat)
                        Look, man; I’ve got a wife and kids-

                                 KILLER
                        -What are you doing here?

           Salvo’s confused.

                                 SALVO
                        What?
                                 KILLER
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 SALVO
                        I’m arresting you, asshole.

           The Killer LAUGHS. Salvo, however, is near tears. 

           The Killer pushes an OVERTURNED ALUMINUM SKIFF down on top of 
           Salvo and runs off.

           Salvo worms his way out from under the skiff, grabs his GUN
           and Vanessa’s SMARTPHONE and scurries to the fence.

           EXT. NASSAU STREET. DAY.

           Salvo hurries toward the crash-site. As he approaches, he 
           sees the BACK of the TRANSPORT CAR engulfed in FLAMES.

                                 SALVO
                        Shit! Shit.

           Salvo races to help Byrne. He rounds the corner, where he 
           sees the FLAMING WRECKAGE, and, just beyond it, he spots

           Byrne, who sits in the street, holding his head in his hands.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Christ, I thought you were in there.

                                 BYRNE
                        It caught fire; I managed to get out... 
                        barely.
                        (beat)
                        Did you get the guy?

                                 SALVO
                        No.
                        (beat)
                        But, I don’t think he’s sanitation. I 
                        think he’s a cop.
                        (beat)
                        He was wearing a bulletproof vest; he 
                        initiated a textbook perp-stop on me. 
                        “Turn and kneel; interlace your fingers.” 
                        He spoke like a cop and he didn’t shoot 
                        me when he got the drop on me.

           Salvo pulls out the Smartphone.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        I tried to film the bastard.
           Salvo fiddles with the Smartphone and plays the VIDEO. Byrne 
           watches, seeing only the KILLER’S PISTOL, OLD BOATS and the 
           SKY as the stand-off unfolds.

           The video ends; we never see the Killer’s face.

                                 BYRNE
                        You didn’t get him.

                                 SALVO
                        Not his face. But, I got his number. 
                        Look...

           Salvo rewinds the footage, pausing on the KILLER’S PISTOL. We 
           see the SERIAL NUMBER.

                                 BYRNE
                        (reading)
                        KNY5117.

                                 SALVO
                        We got his serial number. If it’s 
                        registered-

                                 BYRNE
                        -It’s registered, alright; to a cop.
                        (beat)
                        KNY511 is the serial number for the 
                        Kimber .45s NYPD SWAT Officers use. 5-11 
                        is the call-sign for SWAT.
                        (beat)
                        He didn’t shoot you, because it’s his 
                        service-weapon. It’s traceable.

                                 SALVO
                        (realizing)
                        We can get his ID from Records; put it 
                        out over the radio; get his picture to 
                        the media-

                                 BYRNE
                        -This guy is an active-duty police 
                        officer; what are the odds that he’s 
                        doing this by himself?

                                 SALVO
                        He was the only one putting a gun to my 
                        head.

                                 BYRNE
                        Think about it, Salvo. The perp is on the 
                        job; he knows police procedure. He told 
                        us who he was targeting because he knew 
                        we’d throw cops at them. You were right; 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        this whole thing is calculated, 
                        organized. The body parts, the manifesto; 
                        it was all designed to get us to surround 
                        the Targets with cops.
                        (beat)
                        You said the Targets are getting what 
                        they deserved; how many other cops do you 
                        think feel that way? We just served 
                        Theresa up on a platter.
                        (beat)
                        I called in for back-up. Any minute now 
                        this place will be crawling with 
                        uniforms. If they’re working with this 
                        guy, we’re sitting ducks.

                                 SALVO
                        We can’t leave a murder-scene based on a 
                        hunch.

                                 BYRNE
                        How did this asshole know where we were? 
                        How did he know what radio channel we 
                        were on? Somebody told him. This is 
                        bigger than one dirty cop.
                        (beat)
                        I’d rather be wrong and breathing than 
                        right and dead. 

           Salvo’s conflicted.

                                 SALVO
                        There’s gotta be another way-

                                 BYRNE
                        -How many cops have we seen today? It 
                        could be any one of them-

                                 SALVO
                        -ALRIGHT! Alright, goddamnit; let’s go.

           Byrne and Salvo run down the block and turn onto

           EXT. NASSAU SIDE STREET. DAY.

           where, far in the distance, they see TRAFFIC LIGHTS and GAS 
           STATION SIGNS; a major intersection.

           SMOKE RISES into the sky behind them.

                                 SALVO
                        We need to get an ID off that serial 
                        number. Records can track the 
                        registration.
                                 BYRNE
                        They can also tip this bastard off. We’ve 
                        gotta do this outside the Department.

                                 SALVO
                        It’s a service-weapon; the NYPD’s got a 
                        contract with Fritz Gunsmiths for bulk 
                        orders. They’ll have the serial number, 
                        ID and background check on file.
                        (beat)
                        They’ve got a store out in Jericho; 
                        twenty miles from here.

                                 BYRNE
                        Good. We’ll find a way to get to Jericho. 
                        First, we need Pitka and Coleman to get 
                        Douglas and Quentin away from the police 
                        as quietly as possible.

           Byrne pulls out his cell-phone as they head for the 
           INTERSECTION.

           EXT. TARGET. DAY.

           THREE SUFFOLK OFFICERS stand guard. A HANDWRITTEN SIGN in the 
           WINDOW reads:

                             “SORRY, WE’RE CLOSED”.

           INT. TARGET, EMPLOYEE BATHROOM. DAY.

           Pitka, alone, leans over the sink; he SWEATS PROFUSELY.

           A small LEATHER CASE rests on the counter.

           Someone KNOCKS.

                                 PITKA
                        Occupied!

           Pitka unzips the leather case, revealing HYPODERMIC NEEDLES.

           He reaches for one, hands shaking. His CELL-PHONE RINGS.

                                 PITKA (cont’d)
                        Shit.

           He answers.

                                 PITKA (cont’d)
                        (into phone)
                        Pitka.
                                 BYRNE (V.O.)
                        It’s Byrne. We’ve got a problem. The 
                        Killer shot Theresa Innes, right in the 
                        back of our car. He’s a cop. He pulled a 
                        SWAT .45 on Salvo. We’re gonna try to get 
                        an ID off the gun.

                                 PITKA
                        (into phone)
                        Salvo saw him?

           EXT. NASSAU SIDE STREET. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo keep moving toward the intersection.

                                 BYRNE
                        (into phone)
                        We think more cops are involved. I need 
                        you to get Douglas to Jones Beach. It’s a 
                        State Park, so the NYPD doesn’t patrol 
                        there; this time of year, there won’t be 
                        any people. We’ll meet you there. Tell 
                        the uniforms you’re taking Douglas to a 
                        safe-house. Do not use the radio or any 
                        open lines of communication. Do not tell 
                        anyone where you’re really going.

           Salvo is concerned.

                                 SALVO
                        There’s only one way into Jones Beach and 
                        we’ll be backed up against the ocean.

           Byrne looks at Salvo as he talks to Pitka.

                                 BYRNE
                        (into phone)
                        At the beach, we’ll be able to see who’s 
                        coming and no one can sneak up on us.
                        (beat)
                        I’ll update Coleman.

           Byrne hangs up. He and Salvo quicken their pace.

           INT. TARGET, EMPLOYEE BATHROOM. DAY.

           Pitka hangs up his phone. He looks at his reflection and 
           wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                 PITKA
                        Fuck me bowlegged.

           Pitka puts the needle back in the case, zips it closed and 
           walks out.
           INT. TARGET, BREAK-ROOM. DAY.

           Douglas sits at a table, uneasy. THREE MORE SUFFOLK OFFICERS
           surround him; they don’t hide their disdain for Douglas.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’m sorry I tried to run.

           The Officers don’t respond.

                                 DOUGLAS (cont’d)
                        And, I’m sorry if any of you were 
                        negatively effected when Youngerman 
                        collapsed.

           An Officer glares at Douglas.

                                 6TH SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        You’re sorry? My wife’s an EMT; you 
                        assholes screwed us both.

           Douglas looks around, all the Officers seem menacing.

           Pitka barrels in, startling Douglas. He gets a SODA from the 
           VENDING MACHINE, acting natural; he’s still SWEATY.

                                 PITKA
                        Hey guys; just got word from HQ, I need 
                        to take Douglas to a safe-house.

           Douglas hops up, more than happy to go.

           EXT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           TWO SUFFOLK OFFICERS guard the front door.

           TWO MORE OFFICERS keep watch out back.

           INT. QUENTIN’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM. DAY.

           Quentin, now fully dressed, sits in an antique armchair, 
           doing the NY TIMES’ CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

           SIX SUFFOLK OFFICERS occupy the room; some finger the ORNATE 
           ART OBJECTS.

           Quentin pours himself another glass of wine.

           He offers the bottle to the Officer nearest to him.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Wine? 
                                 7TH SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        I got nine years sober.

                        Your loss. I grow the grapes myself.

           Coleman comes in, cell-phone to his ear.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        ...thanks, Byrne; see you there.

           Coleman hangs up.

                                 COLEMAN (cont’d)
                        Time to go, Quentin.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Go where?

                                 COLEMAN
                        Safe-house.

                                 QUENTIN
                        There are a hundred cops here. What house 
                        could be safer than this? 

                                 COLEMAN
                        The Department thinks it’s in your best 
                        interest to go to a controlled 
                        environment.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Since the killer that you people can’t 
                        seem to find is outside this house, I 
                        think it’s in my best interest to stay 
                        inside this house.

           Coleman relents; plays nice.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Fair enough. I was just trying to protect 
                        you.

           Quentin goes back to his CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

                                 COLEMAN (cont’d)
                        Doing the crossword?

                                 QUENTIN
                        Sweet detective work.
                                 COLEMAN
                        (not so nice)
                        Give it to me.

                                 QUENTIN
                        So, what’s this; Good-cop/bad-cop all in 
                        one cop?

                                 COLEMAN
                        I was doing the crossword this morning; 
                        didn’t get to finish because of this mess 
                        you started. Give me the crossword 
                        puzzle.

                                 QUENTIN
                        You do the New York Times’ crossword?

                                 COLEMAN
                        What, I don’t look like someone who does 
                        the Times’ crossword?
                        (beat)
                        Because I’m a lowly civil servant... or, 
                        because I’m black?

           Quentin senses Coleman’s building anger.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Easy, bro.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Don’t give me that “bro” shit. I’m not 
                        your brother, Wonder Bread. I’ve been 
                        doing the New York Times’ crossword since 
                        before you were born. Now, give me the 
                        puzzle before I SLAP YOU PURPLE!

           Quentin holds out the crossword puzzle. Coleman snatches it 
           away and grabs Quentin’s pen.

           Quentin talks to the Officers around him.

                                 QUENTIN
                        You heard that, right? He threatened me.

                                 8TH SUFFOLK OFFICER
                        Didn’t hear a thing.

           Coleman eyes the puzzle; he writes in an answer.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (menacingly teasing)
                        You couldn’t get 18-across? What’s wrong 
                        with you, Q? You’re supposed to be smart. 
                        How could you not get 18-across?
           Coleman sticks the crossword in Quentin’s face; for 18- 
           across, COLEMAN has written:

                             “KILLER IS A COP; NOT SAFE HERE”.

           Quentin looks at Coleman, who stares dead at him.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. QUENTIN’S MANSION. DAY.

           Coleman leads Quentin out the front door in HANDCUFFS. 
           Coleman turns to the Suffolk Officers standing guard.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Quentin wants to go to a safe-house.

           Coleman walks Quentin to his unmarked car. As Quentin steps 
           in the back, Coleman notices his ANKLE-MONITOR.

           Coleman glances back at the OFFICERS outside the house.

           EXT. INTERSECTION. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo find SHOPS, GAS STATIONS and BARS.

                                 SALVO
                        Christ! I should’ve seen this coming.

                                 BYRNE
                        Seen what? What are you talking about?

                                 SALVO
                        If this SWAT shithead is getting help 
                        from other cops, there’s a good chance 
                        Garret and Medina are involved. 

                                 BYRNE
                        The leads on Reynaldo?

                                 SALVO
                        When I was at the 109th, they were 
                        working a homicide. They chased a murder 
                        suspect into an alley and shot him three 
                        times. It was a bad shooting; the suspect 
                        didn’t have a gun. Garret and Medina 
                        covered it up; said it was dark in the 
                        alley, the suspect turned around, they 
                        thought he was packing... bullshit; they 
                        dumped him. They’re dirty.

                                 BYRNE
                        You have proof the shooting was bad?
                                 SALVO
                        It wasn’t my case; I wasn’t in the alley.
                        (beat)
                        But, I know they dumped him.  

                                 BYRNE
                        You know, but you didn’t do anything?

                                 SALVO
                        I had no proof. And, even if I did, I 
                        would’ve just ended up in a room 
                        somewhere with the brass, Internal 
                        Affairs and a PBA lawyer; talking into a 
                        recorder, knowing I’d be labelled a rat 
                        for the rest of my career... I didn’t 
                        want to rock the boat.

                                 BYRNE
                        So, you jumped ship.
                        (beat)
                        Where was this information two hours ago?

                                 SALVO
                        Two hours ago, you didn’t give a shit 
                        what I said.

           TWO SQUAD CARS, LIGHTS and SIRENS on, speed past and turn 
           toward the SMOKE in the distance.

                                 BYRNE
                        We need a car.

           Byrne spies a BAR with CARS in the lot. A MAN walks out of 
           the bar, pulls out his KEYS and unlocks his CAMRY.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Follow my lead.

           Byrne hurries across the street, Salvo on his heels. They 
           trot into

           EXT. BAR, PARKING LOT. DAY.

           where the Man pulls his Camry out of its parking spot.

           Byrne taps his SHIELD against the windshield.

           The Man stops and rolls down his window, confused.

                                 BYRNE
                        (authoritative)
                        Step out of the vehicle for me, sir.
                                 MAN
                        There a problem, Officer?

                                 BYRNE
                        I’m Detective Garret, this is Detective 
                        Medina; we have reason to believe you’re 
                        driving while intoxicated.

           Salvo stifles a smile.

                                 MAN
                        I’m in a parking lot; I’ve gone three 
                        feet.

                                 BYRNE
                        The engine is running, the car is moving; 
                        that’s driving.
                        (beat)
                        Turn off the engine; leave the keys in 
                        the ignition and step out of the car, 
                        sir.

           The Man gets out; he’s upset.

                                 MAN
                        This is ridiculous; you don’t have 
                        probable cause.

                                 SALVO
                        You just walked out of a bar, chief.

                                 BYRNE
                        Walked? More like stumbled.

                                 MAN
                        I was not stumbling; I had two drinks!

                                 BYRNE
                        So, you admit to drinking. I don’t have a 
                        choice here, sir. I have to issue a field 
                        sobriety test. If you fail, Detective 
                        Medina and I are going to arrest you for 
                        DWI. 

                                 MAN
                        Test me all you want.

           Byrne points to a LINE PAINTED on the PAVEMENT.

                                 BYRNE
                        Walk that line; arms out wide, one foot 
                        in front of the other, heel-to-toe.

           The Man walks the line with no problem; clearly sober.
                                 MAN
                        You’re wasting your time.

                                 BYRNE
                        Keep going. Keep going.

           The Man walks to the other end of the lot. Byrne and Salvo 
           hop into his Camry and speed off.

           INT. CAMRY. DAY.

           Byrne drives. Salvo looks back at the angry Man. 

                                 SALVO
                        We just stole a car.

                                 BYRNE
                        Cops don’t steal, they commandeer.

           Byrne smiles. Salvo does, too. 

           EXT. STRIP MALL. DAY.

           Pitka’s unmarked car is parked behind a building on the 
           opposite side of the strip mall from Target.

           INT. PITKA’S CAR. DAY.

           Pitka wipes SWEAT from his brow. His RADIO CHATTERS.

                        Any officers with information-

           Pitka cuts off the radio.

           Douglas, handcuffed and belted into the back seat, looks at 
           Pitka in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He’s nervous.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Why are we just sitting here?

                                 PITKA
                        We’re waiting for someone.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Are you okay? You’re sweating.

           Pitka unzips his NEEDLE KIT. 
           IN THE BACK, Douglas sees Pitka raise a NEEDLE and tap it.

                                 DOUGLAS (cont’d)
                        A needle? What is that for? Are you going 
                        to drug me?

                                 PITKA
                        It’s for me. Relax.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        You’re shooting up?

                                 PITKA
                        It’s insulin, you idiot. This whole day’s 
                        got my sugar out of whack.

           Pitka sticks the needle into his gut. He EXHALES and puts the 
           needle back in his kit.

                                 PITKA (cont’d)
                        Fucking family curse.

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, Pitka sees

           COLEMAN’S CAR pull up, Quentin in back.

           EXT. STRIP MALL. DAY.

           Pitka gets out of his car. Coleman does, too.

           Douglas glares at Quentin, who mocks him with a kissy-face.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Here’s where it gets interesting.

           INT. CAMRY. DAY.

           Byrne drives along the Jericho Turnpike. He pulls into the 
           lot for FRITZ GUNSMITHS.

           His cell-phone RINGS. He puts the call on SPEAKER.

                                 BYRNE
                        (into phone)
                        Coleman, you’re on speaker. Do you have 
                        them?

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        Yeah, we’ve got them; but, there’s a 
                        wrinkle...
           EXT. STRIP MALL. DAY.

           Pitka and Coleman move away from their cars as they talk. 
           Coleman has his cell on SPEAKER.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        ...If cops are involved, they can track 
                        Quentin’s ankle-monitor. It’ll lead the 
                        shooter right to us. 

                                 BYRNE (V.O.)
                        What are our options?

                                 COLEMAN
                        If we cut the monitor off, he’ll know 
                        we’re on to him.

           INT. CAMRY. DAY.

           Byrne sets his cell on the dash. Salvo leans in.

                                 SALVO
                        (into phone)
                        We need to get the monitor off without 
                        cutting the strap.

                                 COLEMAN (V.O.)
                        The only way to do that is to break 
                        Quentin’s ankle.

                                 PITKA (V.O.)
                        I don’t think he’s gonna go for that.

           Salvo eyes Byrne.

                                 SALVO
                        Tell Quentin he can either live with a 
                        broken ankle, or die with the monitor on.

           EXT. STRIP MALL. DAY.

           Pitka and Coleman share a look; Salvo makes sense.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        We’re gonna keep you guys on the call.

           Pitka and Coleman walk back to Coleman’s car.

           Coleman places the cell-phone on the roof.

           Pitka opens Quentin’s door. Quentin isn’t happy.
                                 QUENTIN
                        I want my lawyer, right now! You said we 
                        were going to a safe-house-

                                 COLEMAN
                        -Like I told you, the man who killed your 
                        employees is a police officer. We have 
                        reason to believe other cops are 
                        assisting him. We had to get you away 
                        from the police while we figure out who 
                        else is involved.

           Pitka pops Coleman’s trunk; mounted on the deck-lid are a 
           SHOTGUN and NIGHT-STICK. 

           Pitka grabs the night-stick.

           He digs through BULLETPROOF VESTS, DUCT TAPE and ROAD FLARES 
           until he finds

           a FIRST-AID KIT.

           Coleman kneels down to eye-level with Quentin.

                                 COLEMAN (cont’d)
                        The problem is, the police can track your 
                        ankle-monitor. We have to get it off of 
                        you without cutting it.

                                 QUENTIN
                        You can’t. Believe me, I’ve tried.
                        (beat)
                        You’d have to cut my foot-

           Quentin sees Pitka come up behind Coleman with the FIRST-AID 
           KIT and the NIGHT-STICK.

           The awful realization dawns on Quentin.

                                 QUENTIN (cont’d)
                        -No... No way. You can’t do this.

                                 COLEMAN
                        We’ve been sitting here for a while, 
                        Quentin.

                                 PITKA
                        The Killer could be on his way right now.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Then fucking shoot him when he gets here.

                                 COLEMAN
                        He’s probably not alone.
                                 PITKA
                        This is the only way. We’re not happy 
                        about this.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Bullshit, you’re loving this.

           IN PITKA’S CAR, Douglas watches the argument between Pitka, 
           Coleman and Quentin; he’s concerned.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Something’s wrong.

           BY COLEMAN’S CAR, Pitka pulls an ACE BANDAGE from the First-
           Aid kit.

           Coleman takes out his WALLET; he holds it up to Quentin.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Bite down on this.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Bite down on my nuts! This is brutality-

           Pitka shoves the wallet into Quentin’s mouth.

                                 PITKA
                        It’s for your own good. 

           Quentin, shaking, realizes he has no choice. He bites down on 
           the wallet, BREATHING HEAVY.

           Coleman removes Quentin’s shoe. Pitka grips the night-stick.

           IN PITKA’S CAR, Douglas, glued to the scene, puts things 
           together.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Oh my God...

           BY COLEMAN’S CAR, Coleman holds Quentin’s ankle against the 
           DOORJAMB. 

           Quentin’s hyperventilating. 

                                 PITKA
                        Find a happy place. 

           Pitka swings the night-stick as hard as he can. CRACK; 
           Quentin’s FOOT TWISTS in an impossible direction.

           INT. CAMRY. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo hear Quentin’s SCREAMS through the phone. 
                                 BYRNE
                        I hope he’s got good health insurance.

           EXT. STRIP MALL. DAY.

           Quentin spits out the wallet; he SCREAMS, spittle flies, 
           tears streak his cheeks.

                                 QUENTIN
                        You motherfuckers... motherfuckers...

           Coleman jiggles Quentin’s LIMP FOOT to take off the monitor.

                                 COLEMAN
                        It’s almost over, Q. There we go.

                                 PITKA
                        Good boy, Quentin. Now, lets make you a 
                        little less uncomfortable. 

           Pitka wraps Quentin’s ankle with the ACE BANDAGE.

                                 PITKA (cont’d)
                        Keep that leg still.

           Coleman closes the car door, grabs his wallet, and tosses the 
           ANKLE-MONITOR in a DUMPSTER. 

           He takes his phone off the car’s roof.

                                 COLEMAN
                        (into phone)
                        We’re heading to Jones Beach.

           Coleman hangs up and hops in his car. Pitka gets into 

           INT. PITKA’S CAR. DAY.

           where Douglas is in complete shock.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Did you just break his ankle?

           Pitka puts the car in drive.

                                 PITKA
                        Bet you never saw that shit on Cops.

           EXT. FRITZ GUNSMITHS. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo make their way into the giant gun shop.
           INT. FRITZ GUNSMITHS. DAY.

           Everything you need to kill anything you want.

           Byrne and Salvo approach the DEALER; they flash their BADGES.

                                 DEALER
                        How can I help you, Officers?

                                 BYRNE
                        We need the registration info for a 
                        Kimber .45. Serial number: KNY5117.

           The Dealer types the number into his computer.

                                 DEALER
                        SWAT gun.

           The Dealer turns the computer screen so Byrne and Salvo can 
           see. There’s a PHOTO of the KILLER, in UNIFORM; all of his 
           particulars are listed.

                                 DEALER (cont’d)
                        That .45 is registered to a Victor Udell, 
                        SWAT sniper with ESU-10 in Long Island 
                        City. Purchased nine years ago.

           Salvo stares at the photo; he nods, that’s the guy.

                                 BYRNE
                        Thanks.

           Byrne quickly heads for the door. Salvo follows.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        (upset)
                        This just gets better and better.

                                 SALVO
                        You know him?

                                 BYRNE
                        I remember him. When I worked Narcotics, 
                        we used his team to raid a couple stash 
                        houses. The guy’s a fucking adrenaline 
                        junkie. 
                        (beat)
                        You know those doors you don’t want to 
                        kick down anymore? Udell lives to kick 
                        them down.

           They head out to
           EXT. FRITZ GUNSMITHS. DAY.

           where they approach the Camry.

           Salvo uses Vanessa’s SMARTPHONE to check his EMAIL. He opens 
           an ATTACHMENT labelled:

                             “YOUNGERMAN VIC LIST”.

           It’s a MASSIVE ALPHABETICAL LIST. Salvo scrolls until he 
           finds the surnames “TESTAVERDE” and “VALENS”.

           Salvo’s confused.

                                 SALVO
                        Udell isn’t on the list of Youngerman’s 
                        victims.

                                 BYRNE
                        Maybe he’s just the muscle; a hired gun.

                                 SALVO
                        We need to find out how deep this goes.

           They hop in the Camry and drive off.

           EXT. JONES BEACH. DAY.

           Ice-cold waves batter a jetty.

           Behind the dunes, is the JONES BEACH TOWER.

           EXT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           The 230-FT TOWER stands on a grassy knoll at the center of a 
           traffic circle.

           It’s the tallest structure for miles.

           Byrne and Salvo are parked just off the spoke that leads to 
           the beach. They can see anyone coming.

           They get out of the Camry when Pitka and Coleman arrive, 
           bundling themselves in their coats.

           Pitka and Coleman climb out of their cars. Byrne gets right 
           down to business.

                                 BYRNE
                        We’ve been off the radio for an hour. By 
                        now, they know we’re missing and they’ve 
                        figured out you’re not at a safe-house.
                                 PITKA
                        Have you figured out who “they” are?

                                 SALVO
                        All we know is it’s a cop named Victor 
                        Udell and he must have help.

                                 BYRNE
                        Well, they can’t track us, now.
                        (beat)
                        Open the doors; I want to hear what these 
                        two have to say.

           Pitka and Coleman open their rear doors; Quentin and Douglas, 
           handcuffed in the back seats, are a few feet from each other.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Does the name Victor Udell mean anything 
                        to either of you?

                                 QUENTIN
                        You assholes broke my ankle. You said you 
                        were taking me to a safe-house. I am not 
                        saying another fucking word until I talk 
                        to my lawyer!

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Forget the goddamn lawyers, Quentin; if 
                        you know something, say something!

                                 QUENTIN
                        I know it’s a bad idea to be wearing a 
                        shirt with a bull’s-eye on it.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Fuck you, Quentin. I’m working at Target 
                        because you ruined my life!

           Douglas turns to the Detectives.

                                 DOUGLAS (cont’d)
                        I don’t know Victor Udell, but I know 
                        that Quentin has millions of dollars 
                        hidden somewhere-

                                 QUENTIN
                        -Don’t get stupid, Dougie-

           Byrne slams the door in Quentin’s face; muffling his RANT.

           Byrne pulls Douglas out, they walk to the front of Pitka’s 
           car. Salvo joins them.
                                 BYRNE
                        Listen to me very carefully, Douglas, and 
                        think about your answer.
                        (beat)
                        Did you ever mention Quentin’s hidden 
                        money to any police officer after 
                        Youngerman was raided?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        No.

                                 SALVO
                        You’re sure?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’m positive. The plan was based on the 
                        fact that no one really knew how much we 
                        took.

                                 BYRNE
                        So the authorities could only estimate 
                        what they wanted back.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        But, the estimate was based on our 
                        records... my records.
                        (beat)
                        Quentin was embezzling a little here and 
                        there for months, then he started taking 
                        larger amounts. When I caught on, I 
                        confronted him and he told me I should 
                        take some for myself. That’s when we set 
                        up the checking accounts and the fake 
                        claims. We didn’t mean to destroy the 
                        company, but we just kept taking more and 
                        more. I realized Youngerman was on the 
                        verge of collapsing and we were going to 
                        get caught.
                        (beat)
                        Quentin thought he could manipulate the 
                        system. If we gave the DA records of what 
                        we took and agreed to surrender all of 
                        our assets as restitution, he’d offer us 
                        a plea. But, the records I gave the DA 
                        were fake, the numbers were off.
                        (beat)
                        Quentin has 12-million in cash.

                                 SALVO
                        12-million reasons to want you dead.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’ve made arrangements for the real 
                        records to be released in the event of my 
                        death. Quentin knows. If I die, the whole 
                        plan is revealed and Quentin goes to jail 
                        for a lot longer than 10 years.
                        (beat)
                        If you get me somewhere safe; I’ll give 
                        you the records-

           BANG! A SNIPER-ROUND HITS BYRNE in the chest. He’s wearing a 
           vest, but the impact drops him like a rock.

           Douglas freaks, he takes off running toward the beach; he’s 
           out in the open.

           Pitka and Coleman take cover behind Pitka’s car.

           Salvo drags Byrne behind Coleman’s car.

           Byrne’s got the wind knocked out of him; he clutches his 
           chest in pain.

                                 SALVO
                        How you doing, kid?

                                 BYRNE
                        He got... the vest. Just... the vest. 

                                 SALVO
                        (to Pitka and Coleman)
                        He’s gotta be on the Tower! 

                                 BYRNE
                        Get... Douglas.

           Salvo looks back at 

           DOUGLAS, who runs as fast as he can with his hands cuffed 
           behind him. 

                                 SALVO
                        Douglas, DON’T!
                        (to Byrne)
                        The guy’s gonna kill himself running out 
                        there.

                                 BYRNE
                        Then... cover him!

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman SHOOT up at the Tower. Byrne 
           watches, as

           Douglas stumbles toward the beach, CRYING.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Please don’t shoot me. Please don’t shoot 
                        me. Please don’t-

           BANG! Douglas is killed by a SNIPER-SHOT THROUGH THE THROAT.

           BEHIND COLEMAN’S CAR, Byrne is furious.

                                 BYRNE
                        Goddamnit!

           SNIPER-ROUNDS HIT THE HOOD and WINDSHIELD.

           Byrne opens the rear door and yanks Quentin out. They huddle 
           behind Coleman’s car, as BULLETS POP THE TIRES and SHATTER 
           WINDOWS.

           Quentin can see DOUGLAS sprawled out on the ground, BLOOD 
           POOLING around his body. Quentin is terrified.

                                 QUENTIN
                        He’s gonna kill me.

                                 BYRNE
                        Just stay down!

           Salvo scurries

           BEHIND PITKA’S CAR, where he joins Pitka and Coleman as they 
           shoot at the Tower.

           A SNIPER-ROUND hits the CAMRY; RADIATOR FLUID leaks from 
           underneath.

           More precise SHOTS FLATTEN the Camry’s TIRES.

                                 SALVO
                        He’s taking out the cars!

                                 PITKA
                        I’m almost out of ammo; we have to make a 
                        move.

           Salvo sees a DOOR at the base of the Tower.

                                 SALVO
                        We go for the door; the closer we get, 
                        the more exposed he’ll have to be to 
                        shoot at us. Keep cover on the way in.

           Coleman and Pitka nod. Salvo moves to the back of the car, he 
           can see Byrne and Quentin. Byrne rubs his chest where the 
           bullet hit his vest.
                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        We’re going for the Tower; stay behind 
                        the car!

           Salvo creeps back to Pitka and Coleman.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Do not stop firing at that Tower until we 
                        hit the door!

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman ready their guns and bolt out from 
           behind Coleman’s car. 

           They FIRE constantly at the top of the Tower, as they storm 
           the door.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman barrel into

           INT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           where they find a SPIRAL STAIRCASE wrapped around a massive 
           WATER TANK. It’s dark; MUFFLED GUNSHOTS ECHO.

                                 PITKA
                        (looking at the stairs)
                        This is a cruel fucking joke. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Deep breaths, Frankie.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman ascend the steps.

                                 SALVO
                        He knows we’re coming; be ready.

           EXT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           BEHIND COLEMAN’S CAR, Byrne has gathered himself. BULLETS 
           PELT the vehicle; Quentin curls up in the fetal-position.

           Byrne looks for better shelter; 30 feet away he sees

           a BATHHOUSE. There’s no cover between it and them.

           INT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman, HUFFING and PUFFING, approach the 
           top of the stairs; the GUNSHOTS grow LOUDER.

           A CRACK OF SUNLIGHT creeps through a DOOR.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman pause just outside the door; they 
           eye each other; this is it.
           Coleman signals, “three, two, one”.

           They burst through the door to

           EXT. JONES BEACH TOWER, ROOF. DAY.

           where Salvo and Pitka go left, Coleman goes right. 

           Guns drawn, Salvo and Pitka scurry from corner to corner. 

           Only one side of the Tower left; Salvo and Pitka charge 
           around the corner to find

           Coleman, and a ROPE tied to the edge of the roof.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman step cautiously to the rope; they 
           glance over the edge to see

           UDELL, he’s RAPELLING down the side of the Tower.

           Udell SHOOTS up at the Tower to cover himself. Salvo, Pitka 
           and Coleman jump back.

           BEHIND COLEMAN’S CAR, Byrne takes a peek and spots Udell 
           halfway to the ground.

                                 BYRNE
                        (to Quentin)
                        C’mon; we have to go!

           Byrne helps Quentin to his feet and they scramble to 

           THE BATHHOUSE, which is closed for the season. Byrne SHOOTS 
           OPEN THE DOOR and pulls Quentin inside.

           BY THE TOWER, Udell makes it to the ground; he sprays cover-
           fire as he sprints toward the BATHHOUSE.

           INT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman race down the stairs.

           INT. BATHHOUSE. DAY.

           Byrne drags Quentin past SHUTTERED SHOPS, RESTAURANTS and 
           REST ROOMS. 

           He spies the GLASS DOOR of a WELCOME CENTER. 

           Byrne SHATTERS THE GLASS with the butt of his 9MM and shoves 
           Quentin inside.

           He looks back to see UDELL load a fresh BANANA CLIP as he 
           enters the BATHHOUSE.
           Byrne hurries into

           INT. WELCOME CENTER. DAY.

           where, beyond a LOBBY, are several small OFFICES; he leads 
           Quentin down a HALLWAY to 

           a BACK OFFICE; they duck behind a DESK.

           Quentin trembles with fear.

                                 QUENTIN
                        I’m going to die. I’m going to die.

                                 BYRNE
                        Shut up.

           Byrne checks his clip. He peeks OUT THE ONLY WINDOW; it’s 
           blocked by a RED VAN.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        The window’s blocked.

           Byrne hears the CRUNCH of SOMEONE STEPPING ON BROKEN GLASS.

           IN THE LOBBY, Udell’s BOOTS CRUSH SHARDS of glass as he walks 
           through the SHATTERED DOOR.

           EXT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           Salvo, Pitka and Coleman take cover behind the BULLET-RIDDLED 
           CARS. 

           They see the BATHHOUSE, its DOOR OPEN. They RELOAD, race to 
           the door and head into

           INT. BATHHOUSE. DAY.

           where they spread out, moving slowly past the shuttered 
           shops, restaurants and rest rooms. 

           They come upon the WELCOME CENTER and see the SHATTERED GLASS 
           DOOR. They fan out into

           INT. WELCOME CENTER. DAY.

           where they search OFFICE-TO-OFFICE; there’s no sign of Byrne, 
           Quentin or Udell.

           Salvo finds himself alone as he approaches the BACK OFFICE; 
           he moves inside.

           When he does, Byrne pops up from behind the desk, gun drawn; 
           they nearly shoot one-another.
           Salvo takes cover behind the desk.

                                 BYRNE
                        Udell is in the office.

                                 SALVO
                        Pitka and Coleman are, too. We need to 
                        get Quentin out of here.

                                 QUENTIN
                        I’m not going anywhere. You people 
                        fucking suck at this.

                                 BYRNE
                        Udell doesn’t want to kill you.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Really?! That’s not the pattern I’m 
                        seeing.

                                 BYRNE
                        He could have easily picked you off in 
                        the back of that car. He wants you alive.

                                 SALVO
                        He wants the money you’ve got hidden 
                        away.

                                 QUENTIN
                        I’ll give him the fucking money; it’s at 
                        my vineyard in Southampton. The money’s 
                        in Southampton.
                        (screaming)
                        I’LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY! I’LL GIVE-

           Salvo covers Quentin’s mouth.

                                 SALVO
                        Shut the fuck up!

           GUNFIRE ERUPTS in another OFFICE. 

                                 BYRNE
                        We’ve gotta help Pitka and Coleman.

           Byrne turns to Quentin.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Stay under this desk; do not move; do not 
                        speak.
                        (to Salvo)
                        We need to draw Udell out.

           Byrne and Salvo head for the door; they slip into
           THE HALLWAY, where they follow the sound of GUNFIRE.

           Suddenly, BULLETS TEAR INTO THE WALL beside them.

           Byrne and Salvo retreat into ANOTHER OFFICE and take cover.

           A FUSILLADE of GUNFIRE PEPPERS the WALLS and CEILING around 
           and above Byrne and Salvo.

           Salvo blindly UNLOADS HIS CLIP in the direction of the shots.

           Then, as quickly as it started, it ends. 

           All is SILENT.

           Byrne and Salvo gather themselves; that was intense.

           Salvo looks for another CLIP in his holder; he’s out.

                                 SALVO
                        I’m out of bullets. 

           Byrne checks his clip; he’s good.

                                 BYRNE
                        Stay behind me.

           They move to the door, peeking into

           THE HALLWAY; no sign of anyone. They search OFFICE-TO-
           OFFICE... 

           No one. No sound but their own BREATHING.

           They reach the LOBBY, still nobody.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Pitka! Coleman!

           No response. Concern grows.

                                 SALVO
                        He got them; he must’ve got them.

                                 BYRNE
                        PITKA! COLEMAN!

           Nothing. 

                                 SALVO
                        Quentin.
                        (to Byrne)
                        Shit...
           Byrne and Salvo hurry to 

           the BACK OFFICE, where they’re shocked to discover

           COLEMAN and UDELL shoving Quentin out the unblocked window.

                                 BYRNE
                        Coleman?

           Coleman trains his gun on Byrne.

                                 COLEMAN
                        Sorry, kid.

           Udell throws a FLASH GRENADE at Byrne and Salvo; they dive 
           into the hallway as it fills the room with BLINDING LIGHT.

           Moments later, Byrne and Salvo make their way through the 
           SMOKE, and climb out the window to

           EXT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           where they see the RED VAN driving off. 

           Pitka’s behind the wheel; Coleman rides shotgun. In the back 
           seat, Udell holds Quentin hostage. 

           They’re all in this together.

           Salvo, bewildered, can only watch them speed away.

                                 SALVO
                        What the fuck just happened?!

                                 BYRNE
                        (building his theory)
                        Pitka and Coleman were in on it. They 
                        must’ve heard the rumor about Quentin 
                        hiding money. We gotta go after them.

           Byrne snaps into action, he examines the BULLET-RIDDLED CARS. 

           RADIATOR FLUID pools around the Camry; its TIRES FLAT.

                                 SALVO
                        Go after them?! Two of the detectives on 
                        this case just took off with the perp. We 
                        need to find out what the fuck is going 
                        on.

                                 BYRNE
                        Quentin wasn’t afraid of going to jail; 
                        they had to make him afraid.

                        The murders were orchestrated to scare 
                        Quentin into revealing the money.

           COLEMAN’S CAR has SHATTERED WINDOWS and THREE FLAT TIRES.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        They needed to get Quentin away from the 
                        cops and get the monitor off of him so 
                        they couldn’t be tracked. You wanna know 
                        what’s going on? They fucking used us!

           Byrne leans into Pitka’s car; he turns the key, it STARTS. 
           But, it has THREE FLATS.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        We need to change out the tires-

           Salvo, still reeling, stares off into the distance.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        -Salvo! We need three tires. There’s a 
                        spare in each trunk; we’ll take the good 
                        tire off Coleman’s car.
                        (beat)
                        Let’s go!

           Byrne pops the trunk on Pitka’s car; he yanks out the SPARE 
           TIRE and JACK. 

           Salvo hops into

           INT. COLEMAN’S CAR. DAY.

           where he pops the trunk.

           ON THE VISOR, Salvo finds a PHOTO OF COLEMAN and his SON, 21, 
           he’s BEDRIDDEN, severely PHYSICALLY DISABLED.

                                 SALVO
                        Coleman’s son is crippled?

           BESIDE HIM, Byrne jacks up Pitka’s car.

                                 BYRNE
                        He was born with Cerebral Palsy; he needs 
                        round-the-clock care.

           Salvo remembers something. He pulls Vanessa’s SMARTPHONE from 
           his pocket and scrolls through the YOUNGERMAN VIC LIST.

           He finds “COLEMAN, LUTHER” and, further down, “PITKA, FRANK”.
                                 SALVO
                        (to himself)
                        They’re both on the list.
                        (to Byrne)
                        Coleman and Pitka were both covered by 
                        Youngerman. Was Pitka sick?

                                 BYRNE
                        He’s got diabetes; his kids, too.
                        (beat)
                        Are you going to help me or not?!

           Byrne pulls the FLAT TIRE off of Pitka’s car.

           Salvo climbs out to

           EXT. JONES BEACH TOWER. DAY.

           where he moves to the open trunk of Coleman’s car, as Byrne 
           mounts the SPARE TIRE on Pitka’s car. 

           Salvo’s putting things together.

                                 SALVO
                        The LIRR stations didn’t link the 
                        victims; they linked the detectives. 
                        Pitka and Coleman work the precincts 
                        where the stations are. 
                        (beat)
                        The body parts were left at those 
                        stations to get Pitka and Coleman 
                        involved.

           Salvo stares at the LIST on the Smartphone, he scrolls up 
           until he finds another name:

                             “BYRNE, MARTIN”.

           Salvo is stunned and suspicious.

           Byrne hurries to Coleman’s car, looking for the spare; he’s 
           standing inches from the trunk-mounted SHOTGUN. 

           Salvo snatches the shotgun and trains it on Byrne.

                                 BYRNE
                        What the fuck are you doing?

                                 SALVO
                        The stations link the detectives. Pitka, 
                        Coleman and you.

                                 BYRNE
                        Get that gun off me.
                                 SALVO
                        You know these guys. Your dad vouched for 
                        them. Your dad is ON THIS FUCKING LIST!

                                 BYRNE
                        There are thousands of cops on that list! 
                        You’re on that list, Salvo. You got 
                        screwed by Quentin, too. You’re the one 
                        with the sick wife. You’re the one who’s 
                        moonlighting to pay your bills and 
                        bitching about never being able to 
                        retire.
                        (beat)
                        You’re just as likely to be dirty as 
                        anyone else on that list. And, you’re the 
                        only one pointing a gun here.

                                 SALVO
                        I asked you if your father was covered by 
                        Youngerman, you said “no”. You lied.

                                 BYRNE
                        I lied because my personal life is none 
                        of your goddamn business! We are not 
                        friends. We don’t fucking discuss our 
                        problems.

           Salvo keeps the shotgun on Byrne.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        They’re getting away-

                        (rolling his theory)
                        -Your dad loved being a cop. He’s only a 
                        few years older than me. Why did he 
                        retire? He’s sick, isn’t he? He got sick, 
                        Youngerman didn’t pay the bills; he was 
                        in a deep hole and couldn’t work to get 
                        out of it-

                                 BYRNE
                        -He’s not sick, and he has money. My 
                        mother’s life-insurance and his pension. 
                        And, if my dad knew he was going to get 
                        millions of dollars, why would he want to 
                        kill himself?!
                        (beat)
                        Those pamphlets were for my dad. He 
                        blames himself for my mother’s death. 
                        Some scumbag shot her on our doorstep 
                        while he was out on patrol. He couldn’t 
                        catch the guy and, after a while, he 
                        couldn’t do the job anymore.

                        replaced by money.

                        My father’s not sick, and he’s not dirty.

                        If he’s not dirty, then it’s you. 

                                 BYRNE
                        If I’m dirty, why are you here? Why would 
                        you be involved at all? You’re a loose 
                        end; a big, dumb fucking problem with a 
                        gun. 
                        (beat)
                        We’re both loose ends. And, the only way 
                        to tie us up, is to kill us off. Nothing 
                        steals the focus of an investigation like 
                        dead cops. You and I get snuffed during 
                        the course of a murder-spree, Pitka and 
                        Coleman survive and the perp gets away. 
                        No one ever asks about the money. They’re 
                        too busy looking for a cop-killer they’ll 
                        never find.

           Salvo lowers the shotgun; Byrne’s made his case.

                                 SALVO
                        We’re not dead, yet. We can walk away.

                        We’re the lead detectives on this case.

                        scene; we’re in this up to our eyeballs. 
                        If we don’t close this case, our careers 
                        are over.

                        know how many other cops are involved. If 
                        we walk, we won’t last the rest of the

                        The only way to end this, is to take them 
                        down. I’m doing it with or without you.
           Byrne wheels the SPARE TIRE over to Pitka’s car. Salvo has no 
           choice, he slides the jack under Coleman’s car.

           INT. SALVO’S GARAGE. DAY.

           Nancy, bundled in her coat, has organized the clutter into 
           PILES beside her STATION-WAGON.

           Behind her, an UNMARKED CAR parks at the curb. 

           The 1st and 2nd Detectives get out and approach her.

           Byrne and Salvo speed toward Southampton in Pitka’s car; 
           LIGHTS FLASHING.

           Byrne, behind the wheel, looks determined.

                        Quentin mentioned his vineyard during the 
                        seminar I went to... I’m trying to find 
                        video...

           YOUTUBE CLIPS of QUENTIN come up on the screen. 

           Salvo plays one. Quentin, in a suit, is on stage; he’s 
           professional and polished, the total opposite of the man we 
           know.

                        ...my father was passionate about two 
                        things: good health coverage for 
                        hardworking people and good wine.

                        Shortly after he died, I planted a block 
                        of grape vines at our vineyard. It takes 
                        10 years for vines to grow into something 
                        worth drinking.

                        need to be carefully maintained. It 
                        reminds me that my father’s legacy is 
                        also sacred. His legacy also needs to be

                        Is there a “navigate” tab?

                                 SALVO
                        Yeah.

           Salvo presses the tab; we hear a SYNTHESIZED NAV VOICE.

                                 NAV VOICE (V.O.)
                        Continue on Sunrise Highway east for 33 
                        miles.

           EXT. OLD PORT ROAD. DAY.

           Off the highway, the landscape is pastoral. Pitka’s car is 
           flanked by flat brown fields of grass and endless blocks of 
           fenced-in GRAPE VINES.

           EXT. PANACEA VINEYARD. DAY.

           Weathered WINE BARRELS form an ARCH at the entrance.

           Byrne and Salvo park behind the barrels for cover. 

           Set far back from the road, a tall, rustic WINERY is 
           surrounded by ROWS OF VINES.

           Out front, is UDELL’S RED VAN.

           Byrne and Salvo get out and assess the scene.
                                 SALVO
                        A tall building surrounded by flat open 
                        space; perfect for a sniper to pick us 
                        off.

           Byrne checks the CLIP in his 9MM.

                                 BYRNE
                        I’ve got seven rounds.
                        (beat)
                        You’re sure you’re out?

           Salvo checks his 9MM; the CLIP is empty.

                                 SALVO
                        I’m completely dry. Didn’t plan on going 
                        to war today.

           Byrne pops the trunk; he hands Salvo the SHOTGUN from under 
           the deck-lid. 

           Salvo pops out the SHELLS; there are only THREE.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Seven bullets and three shells. We’re 
                        outnumbered and outgunned.  

           They gaze at the WINERY in the distance; knowing an ambush 
           awaits.

                                 BYRNE
                        Not ideal.

                                 SALVO
                        What would your dad do?

           Byrne looks at Salvo.

                                 BYRNE
                        Even now, he’d be the first one charging 
                        in there.

           Salvo stares at the SHOTGUN, then the WINERY; over the 
           entrance, is a WIDE WOODEN AWNING.

                                 SALVO
                        They’re waiting for us; they’ll see us 
                        coming. If we can get under that awning, 
                        we’ll be clear of any sniper-fire.
                        (beat)
                        I’d say it’s a half-mile of open space 
                        from here to there. 

           Salvo eyes the CAR; BULLET HOLES dot the body.
                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Fish in a barrel.

           Byrne digs in the trunk, he finds DUCT-TAPE and TWO 
           BULLETPROOF VESTS. He’s got a plan.

                                 BYRNE
                        We tape these two vests across the 
                        windshield. Maybe pinch the ones we’re 
                        wearing between the side windows-

                                 SALVO
                        -You want us to take off our vests?

                                 BYRNE
                        If Udell gets an angle on us; he’ll hit 
                        us with head shots; if we cover as many 
                        windows as we can and stay low, we’ll 
                        make it to the awning.

           Byrne strips off his vest.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Give me your vest.

           Salvo removes his vest and hands it to Byrne. Salvo looks at 
           the long stretch of open ground between them and the winery, 
           doesn’t like the odds.

                                 SALVO
                        I should call Nance. I need to call my 
                        wife.

           Byrne nods, he understands.

           INT. SALVO’S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

           Nancy, upset, paces; TELEPHONE in hand.

           The 1st and 2nd Detectives sit on the couch.

                                 NANCY
                        You can’t tell me you don’t know where my

                                 1ST DETECTIVE
                        He was taking someone into protective 
                        custody; there was an accident or an 
                        incident, we’re not sure.
                                 2ND DETECTIVE
                        All we know is he’s not answering his 
                        cell and he hasn’t checked in over the 
                        radio. Neither has Byrne.

           The PHONE in Nancy’s hand RINGS. She answers quickly.

           Nancy, confused, glances at the Detectives.

           Salvo walks away from the car for privacy, as

           Byrne DUCT-TAPES the BULLETPROOF VESTS to the WINDSHIELD.

                        Nancy; I’m into something deep out here. 
                        Cops are involved; lots of cops. We can’t 
                        trust anyone on the job. I need you to 
                        get away from the cops; don’t ask them to 
                        leave, they might suspect something. Tell 
                        them you’ve gotta take the kids 
                        somewhere.

                        Go to Byrne’s house. His dad is the only

           Nancy holds the phone tightly to her ear, keeping distance 
           from the Detectives.

           Salvo looks back at Byrne, who clinches a bulletproof vest in 
           the driver’s-side window.

                        I love you, too.

           Salvo hangs up. He takes a moment to gather himself.

           INT. SALVO’S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

           Nancy hangs up. She’s worried. She turns to the Detectives.

                                 NANCY
                        The kids are coming home from school. I 
                        need to get their snacks ready. Can I get 
                        you anything from the kitchen?

                                 1ST DETECTIVE
                        We’re okay for now.

                        We’re going to find your husband.

           Nancy’s not sure if that was supportive or sinister. She 
           slips into the kitchen.

           EXT. PANACEA VINEYARD. DAY.

           Byrne pinches the last bulletproof vest in the passenger-side 
           window.

           Salvo surveys the “armored” car. It might as well be a 
           coffin. 

                                 SALVO 
                        After Garret and Medina shot the suspect 
                        in the alley, their story checked out: 
                        they chased the guy, the alley was dark, 
                        he turned around, they shot three times.
                        The suspect didn’t have a gun, but Garret 
                        and Medina said they couldn’t see in the 
                        dark. All they knew was the guy was 
                        considered armed and dangerous.

                        But, this little old man who lived in a 
                        basement apartment kept coming to the 
                        station, saying there was a light on in 
                        the alley when the shooting happened. He 
                        heard the shots. He could see the floor 
                        of the alley from his street-level 
                        window. The light was on; it didn’t go 
                        out until after the shots were fired. 
                        (beat)
                        Turns out, the suspect was a police 
                        informant. I was sent to investigate. I 
                        found a bodega around the corner with a 
                        security camera. In the footage, you 
                        could just make out the wall at the end 
                        of the alley. Sure enough, you could see 
                        the glow of the light on the night of the 
                        shooting. You could see the three muzzle 
                        flashes.
                        (beat)
                        About thirty seconds after the shots, the 
                        light goes out. It was bright as day in 
                        that alley. The informant didn’t turn 
                        around to shoot; he turned around because 
                        he ran into a dead end. Garret and Medina 
                        were lying; it wasn’t a clean shoot. They 
                        executed the guy. I don’t know why; my 
                        guess is he was gonna inform on them.

           Salvo takes a deep breath; this is tough.

                        The clerk didn’t want anything to do with

           the passenger seat. 

           There’s a small patch of uncovered windshield above the 
           center of the dash; through it we see

           the WINERY, as Byrne and Salvo race toward it.

           THUMP-CRACK! A bullet hits a vest on the windshield; the 
           GLASS SPIDER-WEBS.

                                 BYRNE
                        Son of a bitch!

                                 SALVO
                        What, you didn’t think he’d shoot at us?

           THUMP-CRACK! Another hit, more CRACKS. 

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        The windshield won’t hold much longer!

           Byrne floors it; he can barely see out the windshield.
           THUMP-CRACK! Another shot; the WINDSHIELD CAVES IN, just in 
           time to see

           UDELL’S VAN, as they CRASH into it. Both vehicles slide under 
           the WIDE WOODEN AWNING. 

           INT. SALVO’S KITCHEN. DAY.

           Nancy throws together some snacks. She hears VOICES in the 
           living room, and hurries into

           INT. SALVO’S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

           where Vanessa and Kevin, backpacks on, make small-talk with 
           the Detectives.

                                 1ST DETECTIVE
                        You must be Kevin; you look just like 
                        your old man.

                                 KEVIN
                        Ugh, don’t tell me that.

                                 2ND DETECTIVE
                        How was school?

                                 VANESSA
                        It was school.

                                 NANCY
                        Kids, there are snacks in the kitchen. 

           Vanessa and Kevin go into the kitchen. Nancy turns to the 
           Detectives.

                                 NANCY (cont’d)
                        Under the circumstances, I think I should 
                        take the kids to their aunt’s. If 
                        anything’s happened to Warren, I don’t 
                        want them here, when we... find out...

                                 1ST DETECTIVE
                        We can drive you.

                                 NANCY
                        They’ll know something’s wrong. It’ll 
                        just take a few minutes. I’ll come right 
                        back. You can wait-

           Nancy doesn’t let them answer, she puts on her coat and grabs 
           her keys and purse.
           EXT. WINERY. DAY.

           Pitka’s car is wedged between Udell’s VAN and the building, 
           wrecked.

           Byrne and Salvo crawl out through the windshield and take 
           cover.

           Salvo tries to pull a BULLETPROOF VEST from under a TIRE, but 
           it’s pinned.

                                 SALVO
                        Shit.

           They have no vests to protect them.

           Byrne peeks into the WINERY LOBBY.

                                 BYRNE
                        It’s clear; let’s get in there.

           Byrne tries the door; it’s locked. He motions to Salvo, who 
           SHOOTS THE DOOR OPEN.

           Byrne draws his gun; Salvo follows him into

           INT. WINERY, LOBBY. DAY.

           where they look around, guns drawn, but don’t see anyone.

           There’s evidence of a shoot-out; BULLET HOLES mar the walls; 
           an OVERTURNED TABLE was used as cover.

                                 SALVO
                        There was a shoot-out.

           BEHIND THE COUNTER, they discover a TRAIL OF BLOOD. 

                                 BYRNE
                        We got blood.

           Byrne and Salvo cautiously follow the blood to 

           a TASTING ROOM, where they find Pitka huddled in a corner. 
           He’s been shot in the gut; his bulbous belly torn open. 

           Sweaty and pale, Pitka doesn’t have long to live.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Pitka. Pitka; what happened?
                                 PITKA
                        Udell... turned on us.
                        (labored breath)
                        It’s every man for himself...

           Pitka chokes on his own blood and dies. Byrne stares at 
           Pitka; they had history.

                                 BYRNE
                        Guy had four kids.

                                 SALVO
                        Whoever controls Quentin controls the 
                        money.

           Byrne and Salvo look around; at the back of the room are TWO 
           STAIRCASES, one leads UP, the other, DOWN.

           Byrne heads UPSTAIRS; Salvo goes DOWNSTAIRS.

           MOVING DOWNSTAIRS, Salvo creeps along; he spies BULLET HOLES 
           in the walls, SHELL CASINGS on the steps and QUENTIN’S 
           GLASSES on a landing.

           He’s on the right path.

           MOVING UPSTAIRS, Byrne finds a WINDOW; he looks OUTSIDE, 
           beside the winery he sees a HELICOPTER.

           He moves into

           INT. FERMENTATION ROOM. DAY.

           where he’s dwarfed by MASSIVE STAINLESS STEEL TANKS; they’re 
           each coated in a THICK LAYER OF ICE.

           It’s so cold Byrne can see his BREATH.

           He moves slowly, carefully. In the distance, he spots PUFFS 
           OF BREATH, pluming from behind the LAST GIANT TANK.

           Byrne approaches the tank, gun raised.

           INT. BARREL ROOM. DAY.

           Cavernous and dimly-lit.

           Salvo slinks through a CANYON OF WOODEN CASKS. Countless 
           places to hide. He turns at every sound.

           Salvo rounds a corner and finds Coleman clutching Quentin. 

                                 COLEMAN
                        Don’t move!
           Coleman has his gun trained on Salvo; he shields himself with 
           Quentin.

           Salvo aims his shotgun at Coleman.

                                 SALVO
                        Let him go, Coleman. Quentin’s not gonna 
                        give up the money; he knows you’ll kill 
                        him when he does.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Shoot him!

                                 COLEMAN
                        Shut the fuck up!

                                 SALVO
                        I know why you’re doing this, Coleman. I 
                        saw the photo of your son. Think about 
                        how much he’ll miss you-

                                 COLEMAN
                        -I will put you in the fucking ground, 
                        Salvo!

           EXT. NORTHERN BOULEVARD. DAY.

           Nancy’s station-wagon moves through afternoon traffic.

           INT. NANCY’S STATION-WAGON. DAY.

           Nancy drives, Vanessa beside her, Kevin in the back seat.

           Nancy incessantly checks the rearview mirror.

                                 VANESSA
                        Mom, where are we going?

           INT. WINERY. DAY.

           IN THE FERMENTATION ROOM, Byrne inches toward the tank. 
           Another PUFF of BREATH. He rushes around the tank to find...

           a VALVE, releasing spurts of hot air into the cold room.

           There’s no one else here.

                                 BYRNE
                        Shit.

           IN THE BARREL ROOM, Salvo and Coleman point their guns at one-
           another.
                                 SALVO
                        It’s over, Coleman. Pitka’s dead. Udell 
                        has turned on you; you’re never gonna 
                        make it out of here.

                                 COLEMAN
                        I got news for you, Salvo; neither are 
                        you!

           Quentin SQUINTS; trying to focus on something behind Salvo.

           Salvo sees Quentin squinting; he makes the connection.

                                 SALVO
                        Down!

           Salvo and Quentin both drop. 

           Behind Salvo, Udell aims his RIFLE; he SHOOTS COLEMAN in the 
           head.

           Salvo and Quentin take cover behind a STACK OF BARRELS.

           As Salvo keeps watch for Udell, Quentin digs the HANDCUFF KEY 
           out of Coleman’s pocket. 

           Quentin uncuffs himself. He finds a SHOVEL against the wall, 
           uses it as a crutch and limps away.

           Salvo hides between the wall and barrels. 

           IN THE AISLE, Udell eyes WOODEN SUPPORTS under the stacked 
           barrels. He steps back and SHOOTS THE SUPPORTS.

           BEHIND THE BARRELS, Salvo watches them wobble; they’ll crash 
           down on him any second.

           Salvo FIRES A SHOTGUN ROUND to force Udell to move, then 
           scrambles away to

           ANOTHER STACK OF BARRELS, dodging SHOTS from Udell. 

           Salvo has no choice; he FIRES HIS LAST SHELL in Udell’s 
           direction and makes a break for a ROW OF CASKS.

           We follow Udell as he rounds the corner and finds SALVO’S 
           DISCARDED SHOTGUN; he smiles, Salvo has no weapon.

           Udell creeps past casks, rifle ready. 

           IN A DARK CORNER, Udell sees the back of SALVO’S COAT; he 
           appears to be huddled behind barrels.
           Udell SHOOTS; a bullet pierces the coat, a RIVER OF RED 
           FLOWS.

           Udell tugs on the coat, revealing...

           it’s draped over a barrel; MERLOT leaks from a bullet hole.

           Udell hears the CLICK of a gun being cocked behind him.

           Salvo sticks his 9MM in Udell’s back.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        The only thing dumber than the cop who 
                        runs, is the perp who chases him.
                        (beat)
                        Drop the rifle.

           Udell doesn’t move.

                                 UDELL
                        Where’s your partner?

                                 SALVO
                        Drop the rifle, now!

           Udell does. But, he whips out his PISTOL.

           Before Udell can turn and fire, Salvo uses the butt of his 
           9MM to knock the .45 out of Udell’s hand.

           The pistol slides under a stack of barrels.

           Salvo presses his gun to Udell’s head.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Interlace your fingers behind your 
                        fucking head. You know the drill.

           Udell does; Salvo readies his CUFFS.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Now, kneel down.

           Udell doesn’t move.

                                 UDELL
                        You have no idea what you’re doing, do 
                        you?

                                 SALVO
                        (enjoying this)
                        I’m arresting you, asshole.
           BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! CLICK! CLICK! Byrne unloads his 
           9MM into Udell, who falls to the floor, head and neck riddled 
           with bullets.

           BLOOD pools around him. Udell is dead.

           Salvo looks at Byrne, incredulous.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Why did you shoot?! I was about to cuff 
                        him!

                                 BYRNE
                        I found your shotgun; I knew you were out 
                        of ammo. 

                                 SALVO
                        I fucking had the guy!

                                 BYRNE
                        I couldn’t take the chance of him getting 
                        the drop on you!

                                 SALVO
                        He could’ve told us who else was 
                        involved!

           Salvo, flustered, rubs his face; he holsters his pistol.

                                 BYRNE
                        We need to find Quentin. Now that Douglas 
                        is dead, his lawyer is going to release 
                        the real records. Quentin has to get the 
                        money and run, or he’ll lose it all. 
                        There’s a helicopter outside; he can fly 
                        himself and the money out of here.
                        (beat)
                        I’m starting to think Quentin could’ve 
                        been behind this whole thing.

                                 SALVO
                        There’s a million places to hide money in 
                        here. 

                                 BYRNE
                        But, the property was seized by police; 
                        it’s going to be sold off. He’d have to 
                        guarantee that the money wouldn’t be 
                        found while he was in prison.

           Salvo remembers something.
                                 SALVO
                        “It takes 10 years for vines to grow into 
                        something worth drinking. You don’t 
                        disturb the soil or the vines for 10 
                        years...”

                                 BYRNE
                        The money’s in the vineyard.

           Byrne checks his CLIP; he’s out. 

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Shit. I’m out.

           He grabs UDELL’S RIFLE and checks the CLIP, only ONE BULLET.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        One fucking round.

           Byrne checks Udell for more clips, nothing.

                                 BYRNE (cont’d)
                        Where’s his pistol?

                                 SALVO
                        It slid under the barrels. Quentin’s 
                        unarmed, let’s go.

           Byrne and Salvo head for the stairs.

           EXT. BYRNE’S HOUSE. DAY.

           Nancy pulls up; she makes sure there are no cop cars around. 
           She leads Vanessa and Kevin to the door and RINGS THE 
           DOORBELL.

           After a few moments, Martin answers. Oddly, his eyes light up 
           like he’s seen a long-lost love.

                                 MARTIN
                        Katherine.

           Nancy’s confused, even more when Martin hugs her tightly.

                                 MARTIN (cont’d)
                        Katherine, my angel.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m not Katherine; I’m Nancy Salvo-

           Martin leans over and ruffles Kevin’s hair, smiling.
                                 MARTIN
                        -Brendan; come to see your father off to 
                        work?

           Kevin recoils.

                                 MARTIN (cont’d)
                        Don’t be embarrassed, boy.
                        (notices Vanessa)
                        Who’s your little lady friend?

           Vanessa is creeped out.

                                 VANESSA
                        Mom, who is this guy? What’s going on?

                                 NANCY
                        Mr. Byrne. I’m Nancy Salvo. Your son 
                        Brendan is my husband’s partner.

           Martin is suddenly very confused.

                                 MARTIN
                        Partner? Brendan’s a child.
                        (beat)
                        Katherine? You’re not making any sense.

           Martin stares blankly at them; he’s completely lost. It’s not 
           just forgetfulness. It’s much worse.

           Nancy whips out her cell-phone.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m sorry; there’s been a mistake...

           Nancy types a TEXT.

           EXT. WINERY. DAY.

           Byrne and Salvo, standing by the HELICOPTER, are surrounded 
           by acres of GRAPE VINES on TRELLISES.

                                 BYRNE
                        He couldn’t have gone far on that ankle.

           Salvo examines the ground around them, he notices CUTS in the 
           soil from the shovel blade; they lead into the vines.

                                 SALVO
                        He’s using something as a crutch.

           Byrne and Salvo follow the CUTS in the soil. The GIRLIE 
           RINGTONE is heard.
           Salvo pulls out the Smartphone; he sees a TEXT:

                        “At Byrne’s.
                        His dad has Alzheimer’s. 
                        He can’t help us. 
                        What now?”

           Byrne looks back at Salvo as they move through the vines.

                                 BYRNE
                        Turn that thing off!

           Salvo stares at the words “dad has Alzheimer’s”. He covers.

                                 SALVO
                        Some prick is sexting my daughter.

                                 BYRNE
                        Let’s deal with the asshole in front of 
                        us, okay?

           Salvo, determined, stays close behind Byrne.

                                 SALVO
                        Yeah, let’s do that.
                        (beat)
                        I’m turning it off.

           Salvo taps the Smartphone’s screen. 

           He keeps the Smartphone in his hand as they cut across rows 
           of vines, passing trellises until, in the distance, they see

           QUENTIN, digging up the soil with the SHOVEL.

           Byrne readies Udell’s rifle and hurries toward Quentin, Salvo 
           fast on his heels.

                                 BYRNE
                        Hands in the air, Quentin!

           Quentin sees Byrne and Salvo; he has no choice. He drops the 
           SHOVEL and raises his hands, crushed.

                                 QUENTIN
                        Fuck.

           In the hole Quentin’s digging, Byrne and Salvo see a BAG 
           brimming with STACKS OF MONEY.

           Salvo CUFFS Quentin, then looks around. It’s idyllic, 
           isolated; they’re all alone.
                                 SALVO
                        I just realized something. No one knows 
                        we’re here, no one knows about this 
                        money. We’ve got one Target left and one 
                        bullet left.

           Quentin, cuffed and vulnerable, is concerned. 

                                 QUENTIN
                        Whoa, wait, wait. You’re the good guys, 
                        right?

           Salvo looks at Byrne.

                                 SALVO
                        12-million dollars solves a lot of 
                        problems.

                                 BYRNE
                        I don’t have any problems, Salvo.

           Salvo steps away from Quentin.

                                 SALVO
                        I think you do. I think you got a big 
                        problem. You’ve gotta figure out how 
                        you’re gonna kill both me and Quentin 
                        with one bullet.

           Byrne eyes Salvo, his face impassive.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        That’s the only way it works, isn’t it? 
                        All of the victims shot with the same 
                        gun.

                                 BYRNE
                        I think you’re losing it, partner.

                                 SALVO
                        Funny you should mention “losing it”.
                        (beat)
                        I sent my wife and kids to your house, 
                        because I thought they’d be safe with 
                        your father.

           Salvo holds up the SMARTPHONE.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Nancy sent me that text; your dad has 
                        Alzheimer’s. All day long you’re telling 
                        me he’s fine, but he’s sick.
                        (pointed)
                        Sick like Pitka; sick like Coleman’s son. 
           Byrne’s demeanor hardens, he turns the rifle on Salvo.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        That’s why your dad retired. That’s why 
                        he wants to kill himself. He knows what’s 
                        ahead of him. The burden he’s gonna be.

           Quentin looks up at Byrne, realizing.

                                 QUENTIN
                        You’re in on it, too.

                                 SALVO
                        When you destroyed Youngerman Health, you 
                        screwed a lot of cops. His father was one 
                        of them.

           Byrne turns the rifle on Quentin.

                                 BYRNE
                        We can make this work, Salvo. You’ve 
                        looked the other way before. If you say 
                        Udell snuffed Quentin before I shot him, 
                        you can walk away with a lot of money. 
                        Money you need.

           Salvo uses Byrne’s words against him.

                                 SALVO
                        Yeah, but how many cops have I seen 
                        today? Any one of them could be in on it. 
                        If I walk away, I won’t last the rest of 
                        the day.

                                 BYRNE
                        It was only Pitka, Coleman and Udell; no 
                        one else knows.

                                 SALVO
                        What about Garret and Medina?

                                 BYRNE
                        A happy accident; they don’t know 
                        anything.
                        (beat)
                        We can say Udell was acting alone. Pitka 
                        and Coleman die heroes; their families 
                        get line-of-duty benefits. You get a 
                        share of the money.

                                 SALVO
                        Udell isn’t on the list, what’s his 
                        motive?
                                 BYRNE
                        Udell was dirty. The only thing he liked 
                        more than kicking down doors was shaking 
                        down dealers. That’s why we brought him 
                        in; he was expendable.

                                 SALVO
                        You were gonna kill him all along.
                        Udell must’ve figured that out. That’s 
                        why he turned on you.  
                        (beat)
                        I’m guessing Udell got suspicious when I 
                        shot him in the back. In the salvage 
                        yard, he asked me what I was doing here. 
                        He wasn’t expecting me. He wasn’t 
                        supposed to get chased, or shot at, or 
                        arrested. He was supposed to get away. 
                        (beat)
                        But, you couldn’t let Udell get away; 
                        you’re Super-cop. You couldn’t arrest 
                        him, either; he’s a loose end. You had to 
                        dump him. And, you had to get away from 
                        the rumor about Quentin’s money. 
                        (beat)
                        That’s where I came in. Nothing steals 
                        the focus of an investigation like a dead 
                        cop. If Udell didn’t take me out, then 
                        you would; as long as the bullet came 
                        from Udell’s rifle.
                        (beat)
                        All day you’ve been lying to me; cutting 
                        me off from the Department, making 
                        yourself the only person I could trust, 
                        so you could lead me into an ambush. But 
                        now, you need me alive to make this work.

           Byrne trains the rifle on Salvo.

                                 BYRNE
                        You’re on that list, Salvo. Your wife is 
                        sick. You know I can put this on you and 
                        Udell. Two dirty cops, Sherlock; one 
                        turns on the other. Udell shot you out 
                        here; I shot him in the winery. 
                        Ballistics backs that, too.

                                 SALVO
                        Then shoot me. After that you can beat 
                        Quentin’s brains out with the shovel.

           Quentin is really freaking now.
                                 QUENTIN
                        You don’t have to do that; I-I won’t 
                        talk, we can make a deal-

                                 SALVO
                        -Get little bits of Quentin all over you. 
                        Leave both our bloody bodies beside a 
                        fresh, empty hole in the ground. That 
                        won’t raise any questions when the CSTs 
                        scour this place.
                        (beat)
                        Face it, Byrne, you’re not getting rich 
                        today.

                                 BYRNE
                        You think we did this to get rich? We did 
                        this for the cops that got screwed. 
                        Pitka, Coleman and I were going to take 
                        our cuts, but most of the money was going 
                        to the people who needed it. Youngerman’s 
                        victims get out from under, the 
                        embezzlers get taken out and two dirty 
                        cops get killed; everybody gets what they 
                        deserve.

                                 SALVO
                        Aaron, Rey and Theresa didn’t know about 
                        the embezzling. They were innocent.

                                 BYRNE
                        Innocent? That Publicist released 
                        statement after statement, lie after lie, 
                        telling us everything was okay at 
                        Youngerman. The Sales Rep sold policies 
                        even when he knew the company wasn’t 
                        paying bills. And, the Claims Manager, 
                        that bitch promised to help people, to 
                        help your wife, knowing every claim would 
                        be denied. They knew something was wrong 
                        and they did nothing; told no one.
                        (beat)
                        You would think they’re innocent, Salvo. 
                        Garret and Medina gave you a stack of 
                        cash to keep quiet, and what did you do? 
                        Nothing. You did nothing and you told no 
                        one. Sometimes, it’s what you don’t do 
                        that makes you guilty.

                                 SALVO
                        You masterminded a killing-spree, Byrne. 
                        What does that make you, a saint? There’s 
                        no coming back from this.
                                 BYRNE
                        Bullshit. Tomorrow, my life goes back to 
                        normal. I get up every day, go to work 
                        and close cases. I put in my twenty years 
                        and retire.

                                 SALVO
                        But, there’s gonna be this bag of money, 
                        hidden someplace. And you’ll know what 
                        you did to get that money. The guilt and 
                        regret will wear away at you, because 
                        that money is proof you went against 
                        everything you believe in. Everything 
                        your father believes in. 
                        (beat)
                        You’ll be lying everyday to the people 
                        you love and lying to yourself that you 
                        had to do what you did. And, you’ll end 
                        up eating your gun.

                                 BYRNE
                        I’m not like you. You did nothing. I got 
                        justice.

                                 SALVO
                        You crossed the line. And, you got 
                        caught.

                                 BYRNE
                        Right, you got me. Congratulations; you 
                        finally closed a case. It’s too bad 
                        nobody’s ever going to know about it.

           Salvo smiles.

                                 SALVO
                        Oh, I think they’ll know about it.

           Salvo shows Byrne the SMARTPHONE; he’s streaming Byrne’s 
           confession live onto YouTube.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        It’s a live stream. Say “hi” to everybody 
                        on YouTube. I’m thinking of calling it 
                        “Super-cop Fail”.

           Byrne is stunned; for the first time, he’s not a step ahead.

                                 BYRNE
                        Son of a bitch.

                                 SALVO
                        It’s a shame, too. I was just starting to 
                        hate you less.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        (beat)
                        Put down the gun.

           Byrne moves the rifle back and forth between Quentin and 
           Salvo, breaking down.

                                 BYRNE
                        No.

                                 SALVO
                        It’s done, Byrne; it’s over. 

                                 BYRNE
                        NO! Shit. SHIT!

                                 SALVO
                        Nobody else needs to get hurt-

                                 BYRNE
                        -SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up!
                        (beat)
                        I was trying to help!

           Byrne aims at Salvo.

                                 SALVO
                        Help yourself, Byrne. Put down the gun.

           Salvo holds up the Smartphone; it’s still streaming.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        You really gonna do this? For everyone to 
                        see... For your dad to see?

           Byrne, conflicted, lowers the rifle, then raises it; his 
           world collapses.

           Byrne’s eyes well up with tears.

                                 BYRNE
                        My dad had nothing to do with this, 
                        Salvo. You tell them he had nothing to do 
                        with this. He’s not a “gun eater”.

           Salvo knows where this is going.

                                 SALVO
                        Don’t fucking do it, Byrne. DON’T-

           In a flash, Byrne sticks the rifle in his mouth.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        -NO!
           Before Salvo can stop him, Byrne pulls the trigger, BLOWING 
           HIS BRAINS OUT.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Goddamnit!

           Byrne’s body slumps to the floor. 

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        Shit. Jesus. SHIIIIIT!

           Quentin gazes at Byrne, horrified. He looks over at Salvo.

                                 QUENTIN
                        My lawyers are going to have a fucking 
                        field-day with this.

           Salvo kicks Quentin in the face, knocking him unconscious. 

           Salvo dials the Smartphone.

                                 SALVO
                        (into phone)
                        Nancy, honey. I’m alright. I’m gonna be 
                        late, but I’m alright. You’re safe...

           We rise up into the sky above the vineyard.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT. NIGHT.

           In the LOBBY, the WALL MOUNTED TV plays NY1. Roma Torre 
           covers “BREAKING NEWS”.

                                 ROMA (V.O.)
                        ...several police officers are dead on 
                        Long Island, one of the officers 
                        committed suicide live on the internet. 
                        It’s believed that Detectives from 
                        several precincts were involved in a plot 
                        to steal money hidden by Quentin 
                        Youngerman, who is in police custody 
                        tonight. An undisclosed amount of money 
                        was recovered at the scene of the crime, 
                        a vineyard...

           Many Detectives and Officers watch the report. 

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, HOMICIDE DIVISION. NIGHT.

           The 1st and 2nd Detectives clean out BYRNE’S DESK, BAGGING 
           anything that looks like evidence.

           They find a BLANK POSTCARD from the JONES BEACH TOWER.
           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM. NIGHT.

           Lt. Allen, TWO INTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICERS and a PBA LAWYER sit 
           at a table with Salvo, who stares at a RECORDER. 

           It’s been an awful day; their faces are all grim. 
           Particularly Salvo’s.

                                 1ST INTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER
                        You swear that your statement of the 
                        events is accurate to the best of your 
                        recollection?

                                 SALVO
                        It is. Yes.

           Lt. Allen gets up.

                                 LT. ALLEN
                        I want you to know that IAB has my full 
                        cooperation on this-

                                 2ND INTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER
                        -We’re not quite done, Lieutenant.
                        (beat)
                        In the video, Detective Byrne stated that 
                        you, Salvo, had “looked the other way 
                        before” and that “Garret and Medina gave 
                        you a stack of cash to keep quiet”-

                                 PBA LAWYER
                        -Boundaries, boys; this is a statement, 
                        not an interrogation-

                                 1ST INTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER
                        -We’re the bad-cop police; this case is 
                        lousy with bad cops. Detective Byrne made 
                        specific allegations against Detective 
                        Salvo and Detectives Garret and Medina.

                                 PBA LAWYER
                        Internal Affairs, always looking for a 
                        fresh neck to hang.
                        (to Salvo)
                        Don’t answer anything else.

           The 2nd Internal Affairs Officer switches off the RECORDER.

                                 2ND INTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER
                        How about off the record?
                        (beat)
                        We’re going to talk to Garret and Medina, 
                        Salvo; you know that.
           Salvo shrugs his Lawyer off and leans forward.

                                 SALVO
                        Turn the fucking thing on, then. I want 
                        this on the record.
                        (beat)
                        This one doesn’t end in a draw.

           INT. 103RD PRECINCT, HOMICIDE DIVISION. NIGHT.

           Salvo pulls the ENVELOPE out of the SHERLOCK HOLMES DOLL and 
           hands it to the 1st Internal Affairs Officer, who seals the 
           $10,000 in an EVIDENCE BAG.

                                 SALVO
                        Tell Garret and Medina I’m keeping the 
                        doll.

           The Internal Affairs Officers leave.

           Salvo dusts off the doll and props it up on his desk.

                                 SALVO (cont’d)
                        See you tomorrow, Sherlock.

           Salvo grabs his blazer and walks past NIGHT SHIFT DETECTIVES, 
           busy at their desks. Something catches his eye...

           Salvo moves to the window. He looks at the DONATION BIN on 
           the windowsill, it reads:

                             “COPS IN NEED”. 

           Salvo takes out his wallet and drops all his cash in.

           Salvo puts on his blazer and heads out.

           EXT. SALVO’S HOUSE. NIGHT.

           Salvo unlocks the door. He’s barely inside the house when 
           he’s swarmed by Nancy, Vanessa and Kevin. He hugs them 
           tightly.

           He made it home.

                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                              END.
