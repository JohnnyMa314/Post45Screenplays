           EXT. PACE HOUSE - ROOF - EARLY MORNING

           A bleak sky pours gray down onto the roof of a lone farmhouse. 
           The bare feet of a TEENAGE GIRL stand at the edge of the
           third floor.  Scabs and puss spot her red and blackened legs.

           The toes of the girl's feet dangle off the edge.  Next to
           her feet, the binder of a book rests atop the roof.  It
           appears to be without pages.

           Slowly, one of the girl's feet raises up over the long drop. 
           Then, her leg extends forward and hovers over the edge a
           long moment.  

           Pieces of paper drift on the wind as the girl shivers,
           standing on one leg before the long fall.

           THREE WEEKS EARLIER:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - AFTERNOON

           In the center of two dead corn fields, a pickup truck kicks
           up dust as it shimmies up a long driveway.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           WADE, weathered and aged with hints of rough attractiveness,
           wipes the sweat from his worn, tanned face with his large
           hands.  He lights a cigarette with shaky fingers and glares
           across the cab at MAGGIE, who stares out the window, black
           shades covering her eyes.

           Wade turns back to the road as the teenage girl rubs a patch
           on her arm.

                                 WADE
                        Don't touch it.  The doctors said
                        the less you aggravate it, the longer
                        you'll...

           Wade studies the girl, then turns back to the road.  Maggie
           rubs her buzzed head and closes her eyes tightly.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Do you have any idea what you've
                        done to us?

           Maggie glances at Wade, then back out the window.  She puts
           her finger on the glass and begins to draw in the dust as
           the truck  bounces up and down on the road.
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Molly keeps asking about you.  You
                        know what we tell her?

           Maggie continues to draw.  Wade puffs a cloud of smoke.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Had to say you went to stay with
                        Allie for a few weeks.  So don't say
                        any different.  We'll tell her when
                        we're ready.  Caroline thinks we
                        should tell them both now.   But I
                        talked her out of it.  And Bobby
                        still ain't said a word.

           Maggie stares at Wade and covertly rubs the patch on her
           arm.  Wade pays no attention.  Maggie pulls a cigarette out
           of her father's pack on the dash.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

           She lights it.  Wade reaches across and snatches the cigarette
           from her mouth.  She glowers at him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        What the hell do you think you're
                        trying to do?

           He tosses it out the window.  Teary eyed, Maggie mumbles
           something.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        What was that, young lady?

                                 MAGGIE 
                        I said what does it matter.  I'm
                        already dead.

           Wade stares at the girl as she puts her head on the passenger
           door window, wiping her eyes.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           CAROLINE, a short-haired, earnest looking woman, sits and
           stares out of the bay window of the living room, watching
           the pale truck draw nearer to the house.  She sighs, putting
           her long fingers over her strained face.

           A land-line phone RINGS.  Caroline stands and answers it.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Hello?...  Hi Linda...He just got
                        home with Maggie.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        He said as soon as he drops her off
                        and she says hi to the kids, he'll
                        run the two of them over to your
                        house.  So it'll be about another
                        hour and a half.  Thanks again for
                        taking care of them through this....I
                        know.  Well, the doctors said Maggie
                        will be fine for a while.  She has
                        an appointment with Vern in a few
                        weeks, but the minute she starts to
                        show signs, we're supposed to take
                        her in for re-examination.  I'm just
                        glad we found her and she's
                        home...Well, I think if you want,
                        come by sometime in the next few
                        weeks.  It'd be good for her to see
                        her you...All right.  You too.  Thanks
                        again.

           Caroline hangs the phone up and closes her eyes, gripping a
           rosary.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Dear Lord, please...please have mercy.

           MOLLY, short, cute, and curly-headed, runs through the living
           room.

                                 MOLLY
                        Mommy.  Daddy's home!

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know, baby.

           Caroline scoops up Molly.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Did you pack your bag?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Molly?

                                 MOLLY
                        Yeah.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Okay.  Pretty-Pony going?

           Molly looks up, her expression in thought.
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        You're not going to take Pretty-Pony?

           Molly squirms to get down and as Caroline sets her down, the
           girl sprints up the nearby stairs, past BOBBY, who stands in
           the doorway.

           The boy, twice Molly's height, stares up at Caroline, then
           turns his dark eyes up the stairs, then back down to Caroline. 
           He picks up a bag at his feet.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie's here, Bobby.  You want to
                        see your sister?

           Bobby stares at her a moment longer, nods, then awkwardly
           walks into the next room.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The truck slides up to the house and the engine clatters
           off.  Molly sprints out of the front door and jumps into
           Wade's arms as he steps out of the cab.  

                                 WADE
                        Well, hello there darlin'.  

                                 MOLLY
                        Hi, daddy.

           Wade looks back into the cab.

                                 WADE
                        You getting out?

           Maggie yanks the handle and exits.  She grabs a backpack out
           of the back and she suddenly stops, tears falling past the
           rim of the glasses.  She looks up and, noticing Caroline in
           the doorway of the house, quickly wipes the tears.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        You got those?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           She throws the backpack over her shoulder, grabs a bag from
           the bed and starts toward the house when Molly steps out
           from the side of the truck and looks up at her.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hi.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi.
           Molly's face goes curious.

                                 MOLLY
                        What happened to your arm?

           Maggie looks up at Wade, who stares blankly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I...got hurt.

                                 MOLLY
                        I scratched mine.

           She shows her tiny, band-aid covered wound.

                                 MOLLY (CONT'D)
                        But mommy fixed it.  Who fixed yours?

                                 MAGGIE
                        The doctors.

                                 MOLLY
                        You had to go to the doctor?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Mine's a little more than a scratch.

                                 WADE
                        Maggie.  Why don't you give your
                        sister a hug and say bye.  The kids
                        are going to stay with your aunt for
                        a while.

           Maggie stares coldly at Wade, then bends and shares a hug
           with Molly.  They break and Molly smiles up at Maggie,
           eliciting a small smile from the teenager.

           Molly sprints back to the doorway and Caroline bends and
           hugs her, then places a backpack on the little girl's back. 
           Then, she kisses the girl on the forehead and scoots her
           along.

           Molly sprints back to the truck and hops in, playing with a
           doll.  Bobby exits the house, walking right by Caroline and
           stopping suddenly as he notices Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi, Bobby.

           The boy stares at her a moment, then looks up at the sky,
           squinting.  Then, he stares back down at Maggie.  Wade watches
           the two stare at each other, then walks over to Bobby.
                                 WADE
                        Come on, kiddo.  Let's get you to
                        your aunt's.  Maggie, I'll be back
                        shortly.  Head inside and put your
                        stuff in your room.  We cleared it
                        out and Caroline made it up for you.  
                            (shouting)
                        Caroline, honey.  I love you.

           Caroline walks over to Wade with a big smile on her face and
           hugs him.  They kiss, then Wade smiles back at her, mumbling
           something which makes her smile grow.  Wade walks back to
           the truck and hops in.

           Maggie stares up at Caroline.  Then, she drags her feet up
           to the house, rubbing her arm.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

                                 WADE
                        Bobby, you okay?

           The boy looks up at him, and finally nods.

                                 MOLLY
                        Daddy?  

                                 WADE
                        What, baby?

                                 MOLLY
                        What's this?

           Molly points to the drawing in the dust on the passenger
           side window.  Wade notices.  Drawn into the dust of the window
           is the symbol for contamination. 

           Wade leans over the two children and quickly wipes it from
           the window.

                                 WADE
                        Nothing, baby.  It's nothing.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie steps through the threshold of the door and stops,
           studying the kitchen.  Caroline mindlessly clears the table.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Want to help me with these dishes?

           Maggie stares at the woman, who turns back to her.  Maggie
           sets her stuff down and slowly picks a glass up from the
           counter, staring at it.
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        You and your father missed dinner. 
                        We had corn dogs again.  He's been
                        slaving in the fields, trying to get
                        them back to life.  He's talked to
                        several people from different counties
                        and no one's got any of the crops
                        going.  But then again--

           Caroline stops suddenly, a dish in her hand, and lowers her
           head.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Where did you go?

           Maggie stills herself, surprised.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Where did you go?

           Maggie rubs at the patch on her arm.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        You just up and left.  Your father
                        searched for you.  He scoured the
                        damned city for two weeks.  No phones. 
                        Out of walkie distance.  No food. 
                        And no one was supposed to be out of
                        the house.  You left us, and he went
                        for you.  So tell me.  Where did you
                        go?  

           Tremors creep over Caroline's arms.  Maggie stares hard at
           the ground.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I didn't--

                                 CAROLINE
                        Where, Maggie!

           The glass in Maggie's hand crashes to the floor, SHATTERING. 
           Caroline glares at Maggie.  The young girl avoids eye contact.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was in a shelter.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Where?

                                 MAGGIE
                        K.C.

           Silence befalls the kitchen.  Caroline snaps out of it.
                                 CAROLINE
                            (breathy)
                        Why?  Why did you leave?

           Maggie stares down at the shattered glass.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        You left your family.  You left your
                        father.  You left Molly and Bobby. 
                        You abandoned us.

           Maggie's face tightens.  Caroline shakes her head.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Just tell me why.

           Maggie raises her head slowly and removes her sunglasses for
           the first time.  Pink, blotchy skin surrounds her bloodshot
           eyes.  They glimmer with a gray tint as she stares daggers
           at Caroline.  Caroline looks suddenly shaken.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Dear Lord.  Dear Lord.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I watched people die there.  And I'm
                        not just sick.  I lost my life.  
                            (she chokes a cry)
                        And yeah.  I left.  I left to keep
                        from hurting you.  Molly and Bobby. 
                        Dad.

                                 CAROLINE
                        But--but we never asked that of you. 
                        We would never--

                                 MAGGIE
                            (pointing to her eyes)
                        And I never asked for THIS.
                            (beat)
                        But it doesn't matter.  This is what
                        I am now.  I'm dead, Caroline.  Don't
                        you get that?

           Maggie grabs her bag and stalks past Caroline, who backs
           away.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Bathed in the light of the bleakness outside, Caroline
           prepares a meager dinner from canned and other nonperishable
           foods.  Leaning across the counter, she switches on a radio. 
                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        --and up to five hundred and twenty
                        eight thousand now, nearly all from
                        inner cities and metropolitan areas. 
                        All infected or dead.  People in
                        rural areas were less affected, though
                        it appears the nation's crops have
                        died out.  It would seem that while
                        other countries were hit harder than
                        ours, the nation has still fallen
                        under the weight of this...outbreak. 
                        What will we do now?  What can we do
                        now?  Tonight I have with me one of
                        Washington's top--wait, I'm sorry. 
                        I can't even call it that anymore. 
                        Can I? 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yes.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        It just seems odd, given the giant
                        hole that now sits there.  Apologies. 
                        But, tonight I have with me one of
                        the government's top political
                        advisors to Homeland Security.  Mrs.
                        Jane Sandowski.  Jane, you were
                        talking to me before the show about
                        your husband.  Would you care to
                        elaborate on that now? 

                                 JANE SANDOWSKI (O.S.)
                        Well, as I was telling you, my husband
                        was recently infected, and after the
                        month that he was allowed home, I
                        was ordered to bring him back in for
                        quarantine. 

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        I'm terribly sorry. 

                                 JANE SANDOWSKI (O.S.)
                        It was one of the single most
                        difficult days of my life.  And many
                        of the country have lost family in
                        this misfortune.  We just--

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Misfortune?  With all due respect,
                        and my deepest sympathies, I believe
                        that maybe, maybe, the events leading
                        up to the outbreak were misfortunes. 
                        But not now.  Let's don't mix our
                        adjectives at this point.  Now, we're
                        in an apocalypse.
           Caroline flinches at the words.

                                 JANE SANDOWSKI (O.S.)
                        Please.  I understand the fear that
                        the country is feeling, but apocalypse
                        is a bit dramatic.  You said it
                        yourself that many of us survived. 
                        And there are over--  

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Wait.  Dramatic?  Jane, I believe
                        you said it.  You lost your husband. 
                        Do you have no respect for your own
                        dead husband?  To call this any less
                        than--

                                 JANE SANDOWSKI (O.S.)
                        Please, please.  It is our position
                        that everyone should remain calm and
                        continue living their lives, just as
                        you were before.  It's been over two
                        months and the world hasn't stopped. 
                        Earth's axis are still in tact. 
                        We're still spinning.  Life must go
                        on.  We need to begin rebuilding and
                        reorganizing the nation. So, as I
                        was saying, the government's stance
                        is--

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The government's stance?!?  The
                        president and vice president were--

           Caroline powers off the radio and closes her eyes, praying. 
           The rumble of a truck engine creeps through the room. 
           Caroline looks out the window and watches as Wade's truck
           pulls into the drive.  

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Wade slides the truck to a halt, puts it in park and sits a
           moment.  He stares over at the passenger window, at the
           smeared picture.  Then, he wipes it again.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Wade comes through the door slowly, a .22 rifle hanging from
           his shoulder, and finds Caroline waiting for him, staring up
           at him somberly.  They hug for a long moment. 

                                 WADE
                        Where is she?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Her room.
                                 WADE
                        You leave her be?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Mostly.

                                 WADE
                        Mostly?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I asked her where she was.

                                 WADE
                        I asked you to leave her be.

           Caroline stares up at him.  Wade sets down his rifle, kneels
           to pull off his boots and notices bits of glass on the floor. 
           He looks up at Caroline. 

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Mostly?

           Caroline paces out of the kitchen.  Wade sighs.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - LATER

           Maggie's bags sit near a bare wall, next to piled boxes
           sitting against the opposite.  Maggie sits on a thin bed,
           staring out a lone window at a darkening sky.  

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        Knock, knock.

           Maggie turns listlessly to the door.

                                 WADE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        You decent?

           She turns back to the window.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           Wade slowly pushes the door open, standing in the frame.

                                 WADE
                        Caroline's making you something to
                        eat.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm not hungry.

                                 WADE
                        They said that'd happen.  How you
                        feeling?
           Maggie puts her index finger on the glass.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.  I'll leave you be.

           He turns.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Two weeks?

           He stops.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You spent two weeks out there?

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why?

                                 WADE
                        My job.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It's your job to protect them.

           Wade hangs his head.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I'm contagious, daddy.  More now.

                                 WADE
                        The kids are at your aunt's.  They'll
                        be there a while.  Caroline and I
                        know the precautions.  We'll be fine. 
                        We just want you...

           Maggie plays with the bandage.  Up close, the skin around it
           glows with a red and black rash.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You'll be able to say goodbye to me
                        soon.

           Wade stares at his daughter a long moment.

                                 WADE
                        Just eat something.  Pretend.  For
                        me.  Please.

           Maggie pulls the bandage off, revealing a rotten patch of
           flesh the shape and size of a quarter.  Wade CLOMPS down the
           wooden stairs.
           INT. PACE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Caroline and Wade sit across a long table from each other,
           Maggie to Wade's right.  Maggie stares down at her food. 
           They sit in silence for a long moment.

           Wade scoops food into his mouth slowly, watching the two
           women.  Maggie plays with her food, never taking a bite.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        Maggie.  Where are your bandages? 
                        If we're going to--

           Maggie drops her fork and stands quickly, sliding the chair
           back.  She paces quickly out of the room, up the stairs and
           SLAMS a door.

           Wade slowly drops his fork in his plate and stares up at
           Caroline.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        I know.  I know.  But I can't look
                        at it.  I can't see it,
                        knowing...knowing what's going to
                        happen.  I can't.  Wade...

                                 WADE
                        I know.

           Wade stands and drags the side chair over to Caroline and
           sits next to her, holding her hand.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I've asked Him and asked Him.

                                 WADE
                        I know.

                                 CAROLINE
                        And I don't feel anything.  I feel
                        so alone.

                                 WADE
                        I'm here.

           She looks at him, then down at their interclasped hands.  A
           desperate smile flashes on her face.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know.

           Wade lowers his head.

                                 WADE
                        He's there.  He's not left us yet.
                                 CAROLINE
                        I just don't understand.  It's not
                        like it was supposed to be.

           Wade and Caroline sit in a hollow silence.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie, slumped across her bed, pulls a phone from a box at
           her side.  She stands and plugs it into a jack and puts the
           receiver to her ear.  DIAL-TONE.

           She dials three numbers.  The bandage on her arm is replaced.

                                 OFFICIAL MALE VOICE (O.S.)

           Maggie slowly lowers the receiver.

                                 CONCERNED FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Hello?  I need your address before I--

           Maggie puts the phone down.
           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MORNING

           Maggie, seated on a swing-set, moves languidly back and forth. 
           She notices a small toy on the ground and leans to pick it
           up.  She plays with the small porcelain soldier between her
           fingers.  A dark gray ring around the bandage marks the
           spreading dead skin on her arm.

           She pulls back on the swing and begins to sway higher and
           higher.  Higher and higher.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Caroline opens a deep freeze near the door and pulls out a
           large bin.  She opens it and retrieves two large, frozen
           tomatoes, then exits.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Caroline walks around a few chairs and exits the porch to
           the dead grass and straight up to a large generator.  She
           evaluates the display and then flips one of three switches. 
           It vibrates to life.

           Wade looks up from the distance, an axe in one hand and a
           long piece of wood in the other.  He smiles briefly at
           Caroline and she waves to him.  Then, she returns to the
           porch.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Caroline puts the tomatoes on a plate in the microwave and
           starts it.  While it defrosts, she notices an inhaler on the
           ground, under the table where Maggie first sat, upon arriving. 
           She bends and picks it up, reading the canister:

           ALBUTEROL.  PRESCRIPTION FOR: PACE, MARGUERITE JANE

           The microwave BEEPS and she retrieves the plate, then turns
           and stares out of the window at Maggie.  She begins to dice
           the tomatoes.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie smiles, faintly, and pulls back higher on the swing. 
           She closes her eyes, basking in the gray sky, and for a short
           moment, she smiles.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Caroline stares out at Maggie, intently.
           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie's bandaged arm shakes, then suddenly gives out and
           her hand slips from the chain.  The swing twists and contorts. 
           Maggie screams out, flopping back and forth before finally
           spilling out to the ground and crying out.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Caroline darts out of the kitchen and into the:

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Lying on her face, Maggie pushes herself up slowly.  Caroline
           drops to her side.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Are you okay?  

           Maggie grunts.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie?  Are you--

           As she helps the girl turn over, she notices the girl's broken
           finger.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, Lord.  Your finger.

           Maggie notices it and starts to shake.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Come on.  Come inside.

           She helps Maggie up.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Seated at the table, Maggie winces down at her broken finger. 
           Caroline fumbles through the cabinets. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know it's up here somewhere.  Your
                        father is always hurting himself out
                        in the fields.  Where is it!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Caroline?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I think he might have put it in the--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Caroline!
           Caroline stops short and notices Maggie's hand.  A small
           amount of gooey black liquid crawls out of the broken finger. 
           Maggie stares up at Caroline with reddened eyes, ringed with
           dark skin.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I--I...

           Caroline moves past the girl into the living room.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I'll call.  I'll call the doctor.  
                            (shouting)
                        Wade!

           Maggie stands and slowly inches to the counter, staring down
           at the diced tomatoes.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        WADE!  WADE!

           Maggie picks up the large knife and stares down, in a trance,
           at her broken finger and the black puss seeping from it.

           Caroline's low murmurs echo in through the kitchen.  Maggie
           shakily lowers her finger to the cutting board.  She raises
           the knife, near-spasms running through her.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I got through to Dr. Kaplin's office.

           Maggie slowly lowers the knife, her face pained.  Then, in a
           flash she flings it up again, and in one fell swoop, the
           knife comes down and her finger lobs off, into the tomatoes.  

           Maggie sinks to her knees, weeping tearlessly and silently
           to herself.  After a short moment, she rises and stares down
           at the blackened finger.  She picks it up and drops it into
           the sink, down the drain.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 CAROLINE
                            (on phone)
                        Yes, she's infected.  Almost five
                        months.  Can you please patch me
                        through to Vern...Yes...Yes, I
                        understand, but--

           A GRINDING SOUND suddenly arises from the kitchen.  

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                            (on phone)
                        No.  I'm here.  Yes, he is.  No.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        No, she's my stepdaughter.  I'm her
                        emergency...

           The GRINDING SOUND continues.  Caroline drops the phone and
           slowly paces to the frame of the kitchen door.  The empty
           kitchen echoes the sound of the garbage disposal.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Caroline inches to the sink, a shocked look on her face.  Up
           close, the GRINDING SOUND spurts and clatters.  She flips a
           switch on the wall and the disposal stops.  Leaning over,
           she notices a small, lined spatter of black liquid from the
           edge of the sink to the drain.

           EXT. EMPTY FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie sprints through the dead field.  Nearing the wood
           edge, she slows and stares up at the sky, it, too, dead. 
           She stops and kneels down, cradling her injured hand in her
           other.  It drips black liquid from the wound of the
           amputation.  

           She scoops up a bit of dirt with her good hand and studies
           it.

           The sound of tree branches SNAPPING echoes out of the wood
           edge. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?

           Maggie stands quickly, dropping the dirt.  She stares into
           the gray woods, backing away slowly.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Daddy?

           In the distance, a stone's throw away, two shadows emerge,
           one taller and one shorter.  The shadows stop.  Maggie, too,
           stops but her eyes stay fixed on the shadows.

           They emerge from the wood edge in jerky motions.  Maggie
           watches, paralyzed, as the lifeless body of a DEAD MAN pulls
           on the hand of a DEAD GIRL at his side.  They slowly look at
           each other, blackened dead skin spotting their bodies. 

           Maggie's mouth gapes as the dead man and girl begin to jerkily
           move closer to her with sad, piteous looks on their faces.  
           A gray mist shrouds their pupils and their heads wobble
           slightly. 

           The tiny dead girl trips and falls to her knees.  The dead
           man stops and stares down at the girl.  
           Then, he picks her up and gives her a nudge on the back. 
           The girl continues forward.

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        Maggie.

           Maggie jumps, startled.  She turns around to find Wade,
           sweating and breathing heavily just behind her.  His gaze,
           though, locks steady on the two dead bodies moving slowly
           closer to them.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Get behind me.

           He garnishes an axe in one hand, his other clenched tightly
           into a fist.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?

                                 WADE
                        Maggie.  Get behind me.  Now.

           Maggie turns back to the man and girl stumbling to her, then
           she moves behind Wade.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy.  Don't.  Please.

           Wade finally breaks his gaze and shares a look with Maggie.

                                 WADE
                        Go back to the house.

           He simply turns his back on her, staring at the man and girl.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?

           She puts her hand on his sweaty shoulder and he pulls away
           from her grip.  A tear falls from his eye.

                                 WADE
                        Go.

           She slowly backs away, leaving him standing before the two
           sad, dead creatures moving towards him.  

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie stumbles into the yard and Caroline quickly runs to
           her and puts a blanket around the girl's shoulders. 

           CROAKING CRIES from the distance send crows scattering into
           the lifeless sky from the fields behind the two women.  
           Caroline jerks her head in the direction only a moment before
           ushering Maggie toward the house.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wade, leaned over on the edge of the couch, his head in his
           hand, talks quietly into the phone.

                                 WADE
                        Nathan and Julia.  Yeah, his
                        daughter...Hell, I don't know...I
                        don't know!  Ray, you tell me.  How
                        the HELL--

           He stands, suddenly angry.  His voice raises.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Ray, we've known each other since
                        high school, but I swear to God, if
                        you come near Mag, I will cut your
                        goddamn head off.  She--she...I'll
                        deal with it.

           He paces to the bay window and stares out at the blackness.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Just get something out here and get
                        the remains.  They're in the south
                        edge of the field.  And Ray.  
                            (beat)
                        Tell Bonnie I'm sorry.

           He sinks back into the couch and closes his eyes.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Maggie used to
                        babysit Julia.  She's just six fucking
                        years old.  And as my daughter was
                        walking away, I put an axe to the
                        girl.  They weren't right, Ray. 
                        This whole goddamn thing ain't right. 
                        What have we done to ourselves. 
                        What the hell did we do?  

           He lowers his head.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I know.  I know.  Just get out here. 
                        Get them out of my field.

           Wade drops the phone onto the base and stares up at the lit
           fireplace, then up at a series of photos.  One in particular
           shows Wade and a stringy, but beautiful woman, SARAH, holding
           a young Maggie on her lap. 
           Caroline descends the stairs.  Wade breaks concentration.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        How is she--

           Caroline shushes him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                            (lower)
                        Is she asleep?

           Caroline nods, then sits down on the ottoman across from
           Wade.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        How's her finger?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Well.  It's gone.  She made sure of
                        that.  But I got it bandaged up. 
                        She won't go to the hospital or the
                        doctor.  

                                 WADE
                        I figured that.  You think she--

                                 CAROLINE
                        Wade.  She's fine for now.  How are
                        you?

           Wade lowers his head and Caroline takes his hands in hers.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Did you talk to Bonnie?

           Wade shakes his head.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        What'd Ray say?

                                 WADE
                        Said he don't know why they were
                        like that.  But no one had seen Nathan
                        in a few weeks.  And since school's
                        are shut down, they ain't seen Julia
                        either.

           They sit in silence.

                                 CAROLINE
                        They're in a better place.  They're
                        with Him.

           Wade looks up with red eyes.
                                 WADE
                        How do you know?  You didn't see
                        their eyes.  You didn't see the look
                        in Julia's face.  I killed his little
                        girl.  The same little girl I used
                        to bob on my knee when Nathan and
                        Bonnie came over.  Same girl that...
                        I killed her, Caroline.  In cold
                        blood.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        You did not.  You are no killer. 
                        They'd already moved on.

                                 WADE
                        There was life in her eyes.  They
                        weren't dead  But they weren't alive. 
                        I swear.  They looked at me.  They
                        looked dead at me.  And she watched,
                        with those piercing eyes, as I put
                        Nathan down.  Two swings to his neck
                        and he fell, dead for good.  She
                        grabbed my leg and started dragging
                        herself up my pants.  I pushed her
                        off.  And I...I...Tell me how He
                        could let something like this happen?   

                                 CAROLINE
                        All things happen for a rea-

                                 WADE
                        For a reason?  A reason?  What reason
                        is this?  What reason is it that I
                        had to kill my neighbor and his
                        daughter?  What reason is there, out
                        there in this god forsaken world,
                        for my daughter, my Maggie, my Daisy,
                        to end up like this?  Why her?

           He hangs his head.  Caroline pulls Wade's head to her bosom.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Dear Lord.  Please show forgiveness.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAWN

           In the far distance, the gray sky, barely lit, casts ghostly
           shadows of the emergency unit bagging the pieces of Nathan
           and Julia.

           Just beyond the porch, Wade and Caroline observe the event. 
           Caroline pulls the blanket around her in closer and grabs
           Wade's hand, her rosary wrapped around hers. 
           The emergency unit slams the doors on the wagon and shuts
           off the flashing lights.  Then, it pulls away and back onto
           the dirt road.  Behind it, an old car sits idling.  The
           driver's door opens and a distraught, aged woman exits.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        Is that Bonnie?

           Wade ignores her, staring back at the woman as she stands
           just behind the car door, glaring out at the two of them
           with glossy eyes.  Then, her gaze turns upward toward the
           house. 

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        My God.  She watched them.  She
                        watched them put Nathan and Julia in
                        those bags.

           Wade follows Bonnie's gaze and looks up at the window atop
           the house, where Maggie stands, staring back out at the field. 
           Bonnie climbs back in her car and slowly pulls out of the
           field and onto the dirt road, exiting the Pace land.

           FOUR DAYS LATER:

           INT. PACE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Caroline leans on Maggie's door. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        Will you please just let me help?

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        I appreciate it.  But no.  I just
                        want to be alone right now.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Why won't you just let me help you?

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Help me?  I'm not going to be home
                        schooled just to up and die in a few
                        months.  I don't think Washington or
                        Chief Sitting Bull can help with
                        that.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Come on.  You don't know you're going
                        to die.  The Lord works in mysterious
                        ways.  I've been praying.  Matthew
                        eight, two to three says that a man
                        with leprosy came and knelt down
                        before Jesus and said, "Lord, if you
                        are willing, you can make me clean." 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        And Jesus reached out his hand and
                        touched the man.  "I am willing," he
                        said.  Then he shouted, "Be Clean!" 
                        And immediately, the man was cured
                        of his leprosy.  There are so many--

           Maggie swings the door open and rips the sleeve of her shirt
           up, revealing a gaping wound on her arm, caked with blackened
           skin.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know why I wear long sleeve
                        shirts?  Because of this.  This ain't
                        leprosy.  It isn't cancer.  This is
                        death.  See these?!?

           She yanks the sunglasses from her face, revealing bloodshot
           eyes, purely dilated and glossed over with gray.  Dark rings
           envelop them from forehead to lower cheek.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        This isn't some freak case of... 
                        whatever!  I'm dying Caroline.  No. 
                        No.  I'm dead.  I died a few weeks
                        ago.  My body just hasn't decided to
                        let go.    

                                 CAROLINE
                        How can you say that?  You're standing
                        there.  You're talking to me.  I
                        don't care how many times you say
                        it, you're not--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes I am.  I feel it.  No, wait.  I
                        don't feel.  That's the point.  I
                        don't feel anything anymore.  I lost
                        that a week ago.  I don't feel pain. 
                        I don't feel heat or cold.  I don't
                        taste.   I don't feel.

                                 CAROLINE
                        But your finger...

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was in shock, Caroline.  I didn't
                        feel it.  I was in shock that my
                        finger was pulled half off my hand.

           A brief silence pangs.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What do you want?  
                                 CAROLINE
                        I just want to help.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You can't.

                                 CAROLINE
                        But He can.  He can heal--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Him?!?  He did this to me.  Your God
                        did this to me.  He damned me.  I
                        spent my whole life in church, when
                        daddy and I went and then when you
                        made me.  And I know exactly where
                        I'm going.

           Caroline's eyes flood with tears.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        And I can't do that anymore either. 
                        I've been trying.

           She slams the door in Caroline's face.  The woman exhales
           loudly and it quickly becomes a choked cry.  She puts her
           arm on the door frame to brace herself.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        Oh God.  No.  No.  What have you
                        done?

           EXT. FOREST - LATER

           Wade trudges through a thicket of trees, carrying his axe. 
           His hands are filthy with soil.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - LATER

           Wade paces up the dirt road, back to the house.  He stares
           up at the sky, then out at his field, wiping the sweat from
           his brow and shaking his head.  He scans the horizon.

           His house, on a slight hill, stands alone, dark against the
           barren sky.  Behind it rests the shed and generator.  And
           something else.  Someone in a seat in the middle of the back
           yard.  Caroline.

           Wade stares, a puzzled look on his face.  He walks quickly,
           then picks up speed, running to the back yard.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

                                 WADE
                        Caroline?  Caroline, are you okay?
           Wade slows to a jog, noticing Caroline's posture.  Sitting
           upright in a rocking chair, in the middle of the yard, she
           stares out at the murky horizon, wrapped in a blanket.  She
           clutches at her rosary. 

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline, what's wrong?  What's going
                        on?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Nothing.

                                 WADE
                        Something's going on.  Why are you
                        out here?  It's cold out.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        I can't feel anything from Him
                        anymore.  I can't feel Him.

           Wade bends over, breathing heavily.  

                                 WADE
                        What?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I--I don't know.  I'm scared.  She's
                        dying.  And I can't feel His presence
                        to help her.

                                 WADE
                        I know.

                                 CAROLINE
                        And she's going to Hell.

                                 WADE
                        What?

                                 CAROLINE
                        It's the only explanation.

           Wade straightens, still huffing.

                                 WADE
                        What?

                                 CAROLINE
                        She's gone to us.  They're all gone. 
                        All of them.  The world.  It's gone. 
                        We're all sinners.  And they...those
                        poor things...are going to Hell.

           She turns to him for the first time.
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        We were spared.  His mercy spared
                        us.

                                 WADE
                        Caroline.  What's happened to you?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I don't know.  I think I'm finally
                        understanding.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Daddy!

           Wade turns to see Maggie standing in distant doorway of the
           house.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Daddy, there's a man on the phone
                        for you.

           Wade looks back at Caroline, who stares out at the horizon
           again, a blank look on her face.  Then, back to Maggie.

                                 WADE
                        I'll be in in a minute, Daisy.

           Maggie retreats back inside.  Wade turns back to Caroline.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline.  I'm going to say this to
                        you only once.  My daughter is not
                        going to Hell.  I don't know what
                        the hell happened to you today.  Or
                        what got into your head.  But I need
                        you to snap out of it.  I'm hanging
                        on by a thread, and that means she's
                        already falling.  So, please.  Don't
                        do this.  I need you.  She needs
                        you.

           Caroline ignores him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline!

           She turns to him, seemingly awake now.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I need you.  Please.

           He backs slowly away and trots off to the house.
           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           As Wade enters, Maggie stands from the table and hands him a
           phone with a long cord.  She palms the receiver.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy, what's going on?

                                 WADE
                        I don't know.  She--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy, the bank says they're going
                        to foreclose.

           Wade opens his mouth, then stops.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        They said you're months late on the
                        farm.

           He slowly takes the phone out of her wounded hand.

                                 WADE
                        Let me be, Dais.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy, what--

                                 WADE
                        Maggie!  Let me be.

           Maggie slowly backs away and disappears into the living room. 
           Wade looks out the window a moment at the dead farm then
           sits, the phone to his ear.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Hello?

                                 BANK MAN (O.S.)
                        Hello, Mr. Pace.  I'm George Garmen. 
                        I'm calling on behalf of Evans Bank. 
                        There appears to be an outstanding
                        balance on your mortgage and your
                        three home equity loans are past
                        due.  Now, given the situation and
                        the outbreak, the government has
                        issued what's called a Leniency Policy
                        which grants every citizen a two
                        month grace period.  Now, this covers--

                                 WADE
                        A two month...
                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        Grace period.  Yes, Mr. Pace.  This
                        covers all debt, whether outstanding
                        or not.  Did you receive the letters
                        and pamphlets about this policy from
                        the post office?  I know there's
                        been a large mixup with the mail and
                        it wasn't running for nearly two
                        weeks, but I see there were five
                        issued and two were postmarked several
                        weeks ago.

                                 WADE
                        Yes.  I got them.

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        So you are aware of the policy. 
                        You're aware that the policy's
                        effective end date is in a month?

           Wade starts to shake his head.

                                 WADE
                        I'm sorry, Mister...

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        Garmen.

                                 WADE
                        Mister Garmen.  I'm sorry, but I
                        believe you said you were calling on
                        behalf of the bank?  Evans Bank in
                        Kansas City?

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        That is correct, sir.

                                 WADE
                        Do you live there?  In K.C.?

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        Yes, sir.  I--

                                 WADE
                        Mister Garmen, when was the last
                        time you left the city?

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        It's been--

                                 WADE
                        Before the outbreak?

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        Yes, sir.
                                 WADE
                        I'm going to assume that you've seen
                        the infected.

           A pause.

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        Yes.  Yes, sir.

                                 WADE
                        My daughter was infected about a
                        month and a half ago.  Is that in
                        your papers?

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        Yes, sir.  

                                 WADE
                        Concerning the...equity loans. 

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        I show three equity loans, taken out
                        for...cash.  Her name is listed in
                        the notes--

                                 WADE
                        Mister Garmen, I used one of those
                        loans to track down my daughter. 
                        You see, she'd gone missing for a
                        while, after the outbreak.  It took
                        me weeks to find her.  When I finally
                        did, I was forced to stay at a hotel
                        for a few days by the hospital while
                        my daughter was being looked at.  I
                        tried to find the best doctors I
                        could.  For medical attention and
                        evaluation, as mandated by the
                        government.  Now, that's where the
                        other two loans come into play.  I
                        used every penny to pay for a group
                        of doctors to tell me that my baby
                        girl is officially dead, like the
                        rest of the poor, dead bodies walking
                        around out there.

                                 GEORGE GARMEN (O.S.)
                        I--I'm sorry, Mister Pace.  The
                        insurance companies can provide more
                        information on--

                                 WADE
                        I'm not finished.  That's just what
                        happened first.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Now, the reason I ask if you've ever
                        been out of K.C. in the last few
                        months is that the country ain't
                        much like it used to be.  See, that
                        outbreak not only killed my daughter,
                        who, by the way, is upstairs walking
                        around.  But it also killed most of
                        the crops in the United States.  And
                        Europe.  And parts of Russia.  What
                        was it they said about Asia and
                        Australia?  They were "too far out
                        of the fallout zone" for crops?  Got
                        the people, not the crops.  But as
                        for us, the folks that plow the land
                        for our food.  Well, it's just as
                        dead as the sky we're forced to look
                        at.  As dead as my daughter.  So
                        thank you, Mister Garmen.  Thank you
                        for the two month grace period. 
                        Now, just give me a few more with my
                        daughter before you take the land,
                        and I'll be out of the house and you
                        can give it back to the bank.  

           The lines goes silent.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Now, please stop calling. 

           Wade slams the phone down on the receiver and huffs out a
           breath, quietly shaking.  

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.)
                        You all right?

           Wade simply looks up at her, his eyes showing his rage.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Bank?

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.

           She sits next to him and grabs his hand.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Again?

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.  
                            (beat)
                        Cockroaches and banks.  

           She looks over at him quizzically.
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Cockroaches and banks.  Seem to be
                        the only things that survive these
                        things.

           A small smile creeps over her face.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie sits on the center of the couch, listening to Wade
           and Caroline, picking at the black hole in her arm.  A small
           section of her forearm muscle hangs, drooping off the bone. 

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm just...

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        I know.

           Maggie carefully pulls her long sleeve down over the
           disgusting wound and closes her eyes.  She sits for a long
           moment.

           TWO DAYS LATER:

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

           Wade smokes a cigarette, staring out at the one-lane road
           passing under the truck.  Maggie stares out the window at
           the half-dead foliage of the woods.  

           She pulls her sunglasses off her face briefly, revealing
           dilated pupils and deep-set rings under her eyes.  She blinks
           rapidly then replaces the glasses.

           EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - LATER

           Wade's pickup truck shimmies through the small town.  Signs
           denoting closed businesses litter the windows of the
           buildings. 

           The truck pulls past a police cruiser and ambulance, rolling
           up to the opposite curb next to a man in a uniform staring
           up at a building.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Wade rolls the dirty, squeaky window down.

                                 WADE
                        Ray.

           RAY, the plump officer, pulls a small smile as he turns and
           steps to the truck.
                                 RAY
                        Hey Wade.

           Ray squints and leans in, looking at Maggie.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.

           She ignores him, staring out the window.

                                 WADE
                        What's going on?

           Ray's face goes cold.

                                 RAY
                        It's Grace.  Another heart attack.

                                 WADE
                        Jesus.  Is she all right?

                                 RAY
                        They're in there with her right now. 
                        Should be bringing her down soon. 
                        She's pretty bad off, but Chris said
                        she'll survive to have another. 

           Wade leans out and looks up at the building.  Ray does the
           same.

                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Her third since Gerald died.  I heard
                        infection has to spread for at least
                        five weeks before the brain will
                        keep living after the organs fail. 
                        He was infected for three days before
                        his heart gave out.  Probably better
                        that way. 

           Ray cringes ever so slightly, staring in at Maggie, though
           she still ignores him.  A silence passes.

                                 WADE
                        Ray.  Thanks.  For the other day.

           Ray looks up at the bleached sky.

                                 RAY
                        Shouldn't have ended like that. 
                        Bonnie should have taken them in.  

                                 WADE
                        She infected?
                                 RAY
                        I don't know how she's not.  Turns
                        out she was keeping them in their
                        den for over a month.  Found over
                        twenty pounds of raw burger in the
                        fridge. 

                                 WADE
                        Jesus.  

                                 RAY
                        Yeah.  Just couldn't let go.

                                 WADE
                        It's her family.  Was her family.

           Another silence.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Don't the hospitals keep records of
                        their progress?  Did she not take
                        them in?

                                 RAY
                        She did.  Once.  To K.C.   But since
                        it was out of state and right after
                        the outbreak, they didn't bother
                        following up.  K.C.'s had over eighty
                        thousand cases of infected.  Guess
                        Nathan and Julia fell to the wayside. 
                        I got in contact with chief of
                        medicine out there at Saint Paul and
                        gave them a rash of shit.  Hell,
                        Wade.  If you hadn't done what you
                        done, a lot worse could have happened. 
                        A whole hell of a lot worse.

                                 WADE
                        I...

                                 RAY
                        Save it.  Wasn't your fault.

           A brief silence as the wind rolls through.

                                 WADE
                        Bonnie?

                                 RAY
                        In custody.  Not sure how it's going
                        to pan out.  They're considering it
                        a felony and she's slated for transfer
                        in a few weeks.  Fucking jails are
                        still open.  Ask me, they ought to--
                                 WADE
                        Ray.

           Another silence.  Then, Ray nods toward Maggie.

                                 RAY
                            (quieter)
                        How is she?

                                 WADE
                        Heading to the doctor's now.

           Ray nods.  

                                 RAY
                        Well, all right.  
                            (leaning in)
                        Maggie.  You take care, okay?

           Maggie turns her gaze to him, her expression blank through
           the sunglasses, and then back out the window.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           Wade nods toward TWO PARAMEDICS exiting the building, wheeling
           out a stretcher with an ELDERLY LADY strapped to it.  Ray
           notices, slaps the truck and walks toward the medics.

                                 RAY
                        Call me sometime tomorrow.  I'm going
                        to need your statement about the
                        other day.

           Wade stares out at the paramedics as they slowly push the
           stretcher to the ambulance.  Then, he rolls up the window.

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WAITING AREA - LATER

           Maggie's sunglasses sit atop her head as she stares out the
           small waiting-room window at a group of teenagers in a distant
           parking lot chatting and laughing. 

           She frowns and sits next to Wade, who reads a newspaper. 
           The headline of the paper reads: TWO BILLION INFECTED.  FOUR
           BILLION SCARED.

           Maggie leans over in the plastic chair and notices two
           children a few feet in front of her with toys in their hands,
           staring up with wide eyes.  She smiles, but in doing so, the
           red, cracked skin around her eyes begins to open.  One of
           the kids begins to cry.

           A DISTRESSED WOMAN notices.
                                 DISTRESSED WOMAN
                        James.  Carrie.  Get over here. 
                        Right now.

           Maggie realizes, and pulls her sunglasses onto her face. 
           The kids move slowly to the seats next to the woman.  Maggie
           sits back hard, slamming the chair against the wall.  Wade
           lowers the paper, looking at the woman.   

                                 WADE
                        Lauretta.

           The woman, LAURETTA, flashes a fake smile.

                                 LAURETTA
                        Wade.  How are you?

                                 WADE
                        Been better.  You?

           Lauretta glances at Maggie then back.

                                 LAURETTA
                        Fine.  How are Molly and Bobby?

                                 WADE
                        Good.  Staying with my sister for a
                        little while.

                                 LAURETTA
                        Oh?

           Maggie folds her arms.

                                 LAURETTA (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  How are you doing?  

                                 WADE
                        Tip top, aren't you, Daisy.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Peachy.

           Lauretta frowns.  A NURSE opens a door and steps out, holding
           a clipboard.

                                 NURSE
                        Maggie?

           Maggie stands quickly.  The nurse smiles.

                                 NURSE (CONT'D)
                        Follow me, dear.  Wade, you can come
                        too.  You two doing okay?
           Wade stands, drops the paper in front of Lauretta's feet,
           the headline bold and exposed, then smiles and exits the
           waiting area.

           INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie sits on the bedding with patient garb tied around
           her.  A light KNOCK rattles the door.

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        Dais?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           He enters.

                                 WADE
                        How you--

           He notices her arm.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, Maggie.

           He grabs her wrist lightly and examines it.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  Baby.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't feel it.

           He looks up at her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        It's okay, daddy.

           Another rap on the door startles Wade.  DR. KAPLAN, a tall,
           distinguished, but warm man, enters slowly.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Afternoon, Wade.

                                 WADE
                        Vern.

           He shakes Wade's hand and smiles at Maggie.  

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Maggie, how are we doing today?

           Maggie shrugs.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Good.  I guess.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Good.  Good.

           Dr. Kaplan pulls some gloves on, then steps in front of
           Maggie, feeling her neck.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        You eating?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 WADE
                        No.

           Dr. Kaplan smiles down at Maggie.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        It's okay.  I know it can be scary,
                        Maggie.  But the best thing you can
                        do is try to get some food in you. 
                        Some nutrition.  Not sure yet if any
                        food has any affect on it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm never hungry.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        That'll pass.  You'll get your hunger
                        back.  Just make sure that you get a
                        lot of vegetables with the meat.

           He breathes heavy on his stethoscope and places it on her
           back.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Take a deep breath in.

           She does.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Now let it out.

           She does.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Again.

           Wade watches as the doctor checks several times.
                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Lungs are good.  Scans show  that it
                        looks like the asthma receded already. 
                        And your heartbeat is abnormally
                        strong.  That's a good sign.  From
                        what we've seen, the heartbeat is an
                        indicator. 

           He whips off the gloves and places new ones on.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Now let's see about that scratch.

           She looks up at him as he lifts her arm lightly.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Hmm.  Looks like the origin site is
                        spreading.  Maggie?  You been picking
                        at it?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.

                                 WADE
                        Yes.

           Maggie stares at her father.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        I know it itches.  But you have to
                        leave it alone.  Unfortunately there's
                        no antibiotics for this.  So you
                        have to just ignore it as best as
                        possible, okay?

           She nods.  Dr. Kaplan notices Maggie's missing finger and
           stops, staring it.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  

           He examines closer.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        What happened here?

                                 WADE
                        She had a bit of an--

                                 MAGGIE
                        I cut it off.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Why did you cut your finger off?
           He evaluates the amputation wound.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I--I don't know.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Those decisions should not be yours
                        to make, Maggie.  Let me make those.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What did it matter?  What good is a
                        finger if my arm is falling off?

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Maggie, your arm isn't going to fall
                        off.  We don't know a lot about this
                        virus yet, but we know that while
                        the original bite sites may decay,
                        they eventually stop.  There could
                        be...

           He looks up to see the girl's scared face.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Listen.  If something happens, please
                        just call me. 

           He pulls a small scraper from a drawer.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to take a sample, okay.  I
                        want to send it off to K.C. for
                        evaluation. Tell me the second this
                        begins to hurt.

           She begins to shake as he slowly scrapes away a piece of the
           flap of skin hanging from her arm. 

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Doing okay?

           She nods and he continues to scrape and put the samples in
           Petri dishes. 

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        You know, Allie's been asking about
                        you.  She said she's tried calling a
                        few times.

           Maggie remains silent.
                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        You should give her a call.  It's
                        been hard around here.  On everyone. 
                        And I think it'd be good for you.

           Dr. Kaplan scrapes once more, puts it in the dish, then pulls
           off his gloves, carefully.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        All done.  Last thing to do is put
                        some dressing on it.  I'll have Judy
                        come in and take care of that.  I
                        have to see a few other patients. 
                        But before I do that.  Wade, can you
                        give us a minute?

           Wade stares between them, then nods.

                                 WADE
                        I'll be right outside, Dais.

           He exits and the doctor pulls up the stool and sits across
           from Maggie.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Maggie, I want to go over a few things
                        with you again.  Is that okay?

           She nods.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        I know you're aware there's no cure. 
                        But the more you stick to my
                        directions, the longer you'll have. 
                        You understand?

           She nods.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Have you been able to get out and do
                        things?

           She stares down at her feet.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  You have a little while
                        left.  I want you to get out and go
                        try to enjoy it.  Spend some time
                        with friends.  Give Allie a call and
                        go do whatever it is that you girls
                        do.  She knows what's going on here.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        She knows the transfer methods of
                        the infection just as you do.  
                            (beat)
                        Maybe get your father to take you
                        into the city for a week.  Okay?

           She nods.  He grabs her hand with his.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        I know it's dark right now.  I know. 

           He shakes his head.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Go have fun, kiddo.  I'm going to
                        give you a few notes with what I've
                        said.  I want you to follow them,
                        okay?  And keep that arm bandaged. 
                        Remember, it's saliva and blood that
                        transfers, so this infection can
                        still spread.  And Maggie.  When you
                        come back, I want to see all nine of
                        your fingers.  

           She nods.

           EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Wade notices Dr. Kaplan walking up to him and blows the smoke
           from his mouth.

                                 WADE
                            (mumbling)
                        Shit.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        How many times do I have to tell
                        you?

                                 WADE
                        Everyone's got their vices, Vern.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Well, try to pick one that doesn't
                        involve cancer.

           As Dr. Kaplan nears him, Wade shakes his hand.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        She's getting dressed.  I just wanted
                        to talk to you a minute.  You know
                        the deal, right?  Transfer methods?
                                 WADE
                        News has been going on and on--

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        But you know?

                                 WADE
                        Spit to spit.  Blood to blood.  Blood
                        to spit.  So on. 

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Yes.  Just keep gloves on her.  She'll
                        be safe around everyone.  Just make
                        sure they know that.  Last thing you
                        want are close family members backing
                        away from her.  She needs all the
                        love she can get right now.
                            (beat)
                        Come here.

           Dr. Kaplan leads Wade to the side of the building.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        Give me one.

           Wade smiles and pulls a cigarette out and lights it for him.

                                 WADE
                        They're stronger--

           Dr. Kaplan looks up at him while puffing.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Remember when we used to sneak out
                        of biology and do this?  Me and Sarah
                        and you and Karen?

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        It's a wonder I got into med school.

                                 WADE
                        Hell it seems like so long ago. When's
                        the last time you had one?

           Kaplan take as deep drag and exhales the smoke.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        The funeral. 

           He lowers his head and sighs.

                                 WADE
                        I know.  I know.

           A silent moment passes.
                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        You doing okay? 

           Kaplan takes another long drag.

                                 WADE
                        I don't know.  I feel like it's my
                        fault.

           Wade heaves out a big sigh.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I just...I just swore to Sarah I'd
                        never let anything happen to her.  I
                        raised her alone for ten years,
                        protecting her as best I could.  But
                        I never quite knew how to be her
                        father.  I was always daddy, but I
                        felt it was just a title.  With
                        everything that happened--I mean,
                        every time I looked at her, I saw
                        Sarah's stubborn twinkle in her eyes. 
                        I pulled back, Vern.  It was...it
                        was too much.  Then, when I met
                        Caroline, the damn girl began to
                        drift away.  When Bobby and Molly
                        came, she grew almost invisible. 
                        And I know I did this to her.  I
                        know I pushed her away and...and
                        when that boy came along, she just
                        left.  And now...  

           Kaplan drops the cigarette and smothers it with his shoe.

                                 DR. KAPLAN
                        Wade.  

           Dr. Kaplan places a hand on Wade's shoulder.

                                 DR. KAPLAN (CONT'D)
                        She loves you more than you can know. 
                        Her body's dying but her heart ain't. 
                        Spend time with her.  As much time
                        as you can.  Because there's not
                        much left.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie lies on her bed, reading a book.  She looks up at a
           KNOCK at the door.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Come in.

           Wade enters.
                                 WADE
                        I ain't intruding am I?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  Just reading.

                                 WADE
                        Oh yeah?  What?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Slaughterhouse Five.  Found it in
                        one of the boxes.  It's kind of weird.

           Wade sits down on the bed next to Maggie.

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.  That was your mother's.  She
                        was always a big bookworm.  To this
                        day, I don't know what she saw in me
                        at the get-go.  She had it all:
                        brains, looks, legs, and a heart of
                        gold.  Me?  Well, maybe it was my
                        big old truck.

           He laughs.  Maggie stares at him questioningly.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        That beat up thing out there, yeah. 
                        Point is, we dated for a long time. 
                        She'd always push books on me and
                        I'd always laugh and turn them down. 
                        Politely, though.  Your mother had
                        one hell of a backhand.  But in my
                        mind, what was there in a bunch of
                        words that I couldn't get out of a
                        movie or the television.  I didn't
                        have time anyway with the farm and
                        all.  Well, shortly after we got
                        married, you came along.  When she
                        was pregnant, we used to lay in bed
                        at night watching TV and just talking. 
                        One night, your mother turns to me,
                        glowing with you in her, that giant
                        belly sticking half a mile out of
                        her shirt, and says, "are you ever
                        going to read to her?"  Out of the
                        blue.  Well, I stared at her and
                        said "of course." She proceeded to
                        giggle a wicked little laugh and
                        asked me how I was going to read to
                        you if I was illiterate.  I thought
                        she'd said illiterate.  I think now
                        about it now and she probably said
                        alliterate, but it doesn't matter.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Well, my pride wounded, I got up and
                        walked downstairs to the living room
                        and picked up one of the baby books
                        we'd bought and brought it back
                        upstairs.  I turned off the damned
                        TV and laid down and for the rest of
                        the night, I read to you, while you
                        were in your momma's stomach, just a
                        tiny thing.  "A Daisy's Journey,"
                        was what it was called.  I read it
                        to you every night.  When it came
                        time to pick a name, I thought it
                        was a clear sign.  Daisy.  I couldn't
                        think of any other name better
                        fitting.  But your mother, being the
                        most difficult pain in the ass that
                        she was, hated it.  We went round
                        and round, and in the end, I got my
                        way.  Well, we both did.  Marguerite. 
                        It's the common name for Daisy. 
                        Your mother always was too damn smart
                        for her own good.   

           Maggie smiles.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I don't guess I ever told you that.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  You never did. 

                                 WADE
                        She kept that garden out back in
                        those woods for about a year after
                        you were born.  But with everything
                        that needed done around here, and a
                        new baby girl, she couldn't keep up
                        with it.  But Daisy.  

           Wade sniffs, then stands and walks toward the door.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?  What did you want to tell
                        me?

                                 WADE
                        Doesn't matter.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy.

                                 WADE
                        I wanted to thank you.  For tonight.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I know Caroline's cooking can taste
                        like pig shit at times, but it meant
                        a lot to me that you ate it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I have a secret weapon.  I can't
                        taste anything anymore.

           Wade smiles.

                                 WADE
                        She's trying, Mag.  Cut her a little
                        slack.

           He exits.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - LATER

           Maggie stands in front of the mirror, rubbing her buzzed
           head, staring at it for a long time with pain in her face.

           ONE WEEK LATER:

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Maggie stumbles down the stares lazily, half awake.  She
           stops, noticing Caroline sitting on the edge of the couch,
           next to the radio.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Caroline?

           Caroline throws out a hand to shush her.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...While hospitals are reporting
                        record admittance concerning what
                        the media has sensationally coined
                        as the "Necroambulist," or more
                        literally, "Walking Dead" virus. 
                        Though a cure has yet to be officially
                        developed, the Chinese have created
                        a vaccination intended to prevent
                        the virus from spreading.  

           Maggie sits across from Caroline in a chair.

                                 MAGGIE
                        A cure?

                                 CAROLINE
                        A vaccination.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't remember.  What's that?

                                 CAROLINE
                        A cure treats you and makes you
                        better.  Vaccinations prevent someone
                        from getting it.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        So you and daddy can be safe?

           Caroline shrugs.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The vaccination, developed from traces
                        of the virus itself, and of other
                        unstable viruses, such as the rabies
                        virus, and a compound of synthetic
                        chemicals, has produced nearly an
                        eighty eight percent survival rate
                        in all test cases.  However, while
                        the results of the test cases seem
                        optimistic, the virus itself has
                        been characterized to cause different
                        results in different species.  Rats,
                        for instance, become catatonic almost
                        overnight, and when given the
                        opportunity, will eat until they
                        burst.  Rabbits take nearly three
                        weeks and die of starvation before
                        changing.  Humans, as we've seen,
                        vary, taking up to four months to
                        change.  They also experience a
                        craving for meat, based on the virus's
                        protein deficiency.  So the
                        vaccination may or may not be able
                        to inhibit one from acquiring the
                        virus.  There are--

           Maggie stands, running her wounded hand over her buzzed head.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where's daddy?

                                 CAROLINE
                        He's setting the traps.

                                 MAGGIE
                        The traps?  Why?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Says there's been things getting on
                        the land and if he's going to get
                        the fields going, he don't want them
                        in.
           Caroline leans back over, listening to the radio as Maggie
           enters the:

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie walks in and leans over the sink, looking down at the
           garbage disposal.  The phone suddenly RINGS.  She answers.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hello?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey, kiddo.  How are you?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Good.  Aunt Linda took us to get ice
                        cream today.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That's great.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        My scratch is better.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That's good, Mol.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Is your scratch all better?

           Maggie stares down at her covered arm.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  Not yet.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        When can we see you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't know.  You guys want to come
                        visit?

                                 MOLLY  (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Want to come this weekend?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Yeah.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Molly, there's something--

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Is Mommy around?  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.  Yeah, she is.  Hold on.

           Maggie cradles the phone in her hand a moment.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                            (yelling)
                        Caroline.  Phone.
                            (into the phone)
                        Molly, she's coming.  I have to go,
                        okay?  I love you. 

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Bye.

           Maggie lays the phone down on the counter and walks to the
           door.  Caroline enters.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Who is--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Molly.

           EXT. FIELD'S EDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie stalks up to Wade as he kneels down in the dirt,
           sweating.  Farm instruments and traps lay next to him in
           disarray.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You still haven't told them?

                                 WADE
                        What?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You haven't told Molly?  Or Bobby?

                                 WADE
                        Maggie, I--

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm not going to play like this isn't
                        happening.  I'm not going to lie to
                        them.  Tell them or I will.

           Maggie turns and stalks off.
                                 WADE
                        Maggie?  Come on.  Maggie!

           THREE DAYS LATER:

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie's eyes flicker open in the dark.  She sits up in bed
           and stares around her room.  She fumbles her hand around her
           mouth and sticks a finger inside.  She lets out a whimper.

           She rushes out through a hallway and into:

           INT. PACE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie flips on the light and looks in the mirror, spreading
           her mouth open.  In the mirror, she sees a tooth missing.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  No.  

           She screams out.  Again and again.  She slides down the sink. 
           A light turns on in the hallway and Wade sprints into the
           bathroom, kneels to her and cradles her in her arms.

                                 WADE
                        What happened, baby.  What happened?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't want to die, daddy.  I don't
                        want to die.  I don't want to die. 
                        I don't...

                                 WADE
                        Shh.  It's okay.  It'll be okay.  I
                        swear.  It'll be okay.

           Caroline stands in the doorway, a horrified look on her face.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - MORNING

           Maggie sits on her bed, her back to her door.  A KNOCK raps.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.)
                        Maggie?  You awake?

           Caroline slowly enters. 

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        How are you feeling?

           Maggie doesn't move.
                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Molly and Bobby are here.  And your
                        Aunt.  You want to come downstairs? 
                        You don't have to come down for long. 
                        I know you aren't feeling well.  But
                        I think it'd be good for them to see
                        you.  And for you to see them.

           Caroline grabs the rosary around her neck.  Maggie doesn't
           move.  

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie?

           Maggie eerily stands and turns, a few blisters on her scalp.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't want to right now.  Is that
                        okay?

           Caroline stares for a moment, then nods.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Okay.  Okay.  Maybe later.

           Caroline exits.  Maggie walks to the window and stares out
           at the dead field for a long moment.  Then, she gazes down
           at the hard stony walkway below.

           She places her palm on the window and looks down at her
           missing finger.  Then she looks down at her hand, and the
           tooth in it.  

                                 BOY'S VOICE  (O.S.)
                        Are you dying?

           Maggie closes her hand and turns to find Bobby in the doorway.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Bobby?

                                 BOBBY
                        Dad said you were sick.  But you're
                        dying, huh?  

           Maggie nods.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        A few kids at my school got infected
                        and died.  I knew one of them.  This
                        kid named Stephen.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 BOBBY
                        I didn't like him.  But I didn't
                        want him to die.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 BOBBY
                        Does it hurt?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  Not anymore.

                                 BOBBY
                        What happened to your finger? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I cut it off.

                                 BOBBY
                        Why?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't know.  I think because it
                        reminded me that I'm dying.

           A pause.

                                 BOBBY
                        How come we're staying with Aunt
                        Linda?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Because I'm contagious.

                                 BOBBY
                        Contagious.  Oh.

           Bobby stares around the room.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        I miss you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I miss you too.  

                                 BOBBY
                        All right.  Don't tell them I came
                        up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I won't.
           Bobby smiles at her briefly then leaves.  Maggie sits down
           on her bed, looking back down at her tooth in her hand.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maggie walks downstairs and looks out the window at the family
           outside on the front porch.  She stares at them longingly.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENT LATER

           Caroline, Wade, and LINDA, a small woman with hints of Wade's
           features, all sit in fold-up chairs.  Bobby walks around the
           yard with his arms out.  Molly, on the edge of the porch,
           plays with a doll.

           Maggie walks out and catches the eye of Linda, who stops mid-
           sentence, gets up and goes to the girl, hesitating a moment,
           then hugging her awkwardly, without touching skin, for a
           long time.  She lets go and looks the girl over.  Her rubber-
           gloved hands rub each side of Maggie's face with gentle love.

                                 LINDA
                        You look beautiful.

           Maggie smiles.  

                                 LINDA (CONT'D)
                        Come sit.

           Maggie sits down in an open seat next to Linda.  Molly walks
           up and before Maggie can grab for her, Caroline quickly walks
           over and puts gloves on Molly's little hands.  Then, she
           sets her gently on Maggie's lap.

                                 LINDA (CONT'D)
                        How have you been?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm okay.

                                 WADE
                        Vern said she was progressing well.

                                 LINDA
                        Well, she's strong.  It's her mother
                        in her.

                                 WADE
                        Truth.

                                 LINDA
                        What have you been doing?  Tell me
                        everything.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I...I--

                                 WADE
                        She's been helping out around here.

                                 LINDA
                        Let the girl talk, Wade.  I swear. 
                        And what have you got this poor thing
                        doing around here?  She should be
                        out with her friends.  Having fun.
                            (to Maggie)
                        Go head, baby. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I haven't been able to do much.  
                            (beat)
                        Started reading momma's books.

                                 LINDA
                        Oh yeah?  Which ones?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, just one right so far.
                        Slaughterhouse Five.

                                 LINDA
                        Yeah?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           Linda smiles and goes silent.  Molly points at the blisters
           on Maggie's head.

                                 MOLLY
                        You hurt yourself again?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Molly, don't touch.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, Moll.  I'm sick.  

           She looks at her father questioningly, then begins to bob
           Molly on her lap.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I'm dying.

                                 MOLLY
                        You're dying?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.
                                 MOLLY
                        Mommy says when you die, if you're
                        good, you go to Heaven.

                                 CAROLINE
                        That's right baby.

           Molly looks between the two, then up at Maggie for a long
           moment.  Then, she smiles.

                                 MOLLY
                        You can be with your mommy.

           Maggie nods.  Linda notices Maggie's discomfort.

                                 LINDA
                        Molly?  You want to help your father
                        grill up the hot dogs?

           Molly nods ferociously.  Maggie picks her up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        All right, Moll.  Helicopter time.  

           Molly starts to make sputtering sound.  Maggie twirls her
           around.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Maggie, watch--

           Maggie twirls Molly, following Wade to a nearby grill. 
           Halfway there, she stumbles and her arm gives out, nearly
           dropping Molly.  She tries to conceal it, failing.  

           Caroline stands, staring at the two, but Linda grabs her
           arm.  Maggie lowers Molly, who stares up at her.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ran out of gas. 

                                 WADE
                        You all right?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 WADE
                            (to Molly)
                        Come help me with the hot dogs.
                            (to Maggie)
                        You sure?

           She nods and watches Molly slowly run up to Wade.  He stares
           back at Maggie with repressed fear in his eyes, pulling the
           gloves from Molly's hands with caution.  
           Then, the two begin to lay the hot dogs on the grill.  

           Bobby grabs Maggie's hand out of the blue and smiles up at
           her.  Maggie notices the glove on his hand and forces a smile.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           Leaned into a van, Caroline buckles Molly into her child-
           seat and kisses her on her forehead.  Wade hugs Linda and
           the short woman hops in the driver's side.  Bobby sits in
           silence in the back-seat.  

           Caroline steps back to Wade and grabs his hand.  Maggie stands
           just beyond them, and watches as the van pulls away.  Caroline
           and Wade turn back to go inside.  

           Maggie stares on.  Bobby turns in the back window and waves
           slowly.  Maggie raises her hand and waves back.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maggie sits in a large chair, listening to the radio and
           reading through a yearbook.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Wade and Caroline sit next to each other holding hands on
           the front porch.  Wade puffs on a cigarette.

                                 WADE
                        I'm just saying you don't need to
                        get so touchy with her, that's all.

                                 CAROLINE
                        She nearly dropped Molly.

                                 WADE
                        Molly's fell down those stairs and
                        laughed about it.  I think a two
                        foot fall wouldn't kill her.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I don't care.  I'm--

                                 WADE
                        Let it go, Caroline.  That girl in
                        there is experiencing all kinds of
                        hell we don't even know about, and
                        probably never will.  She don't need
                        you harassing her on top of it. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        Wade, I--

           Wade stands abruptly and walks to the railing.
                                 WADE
                        You ever wonder what's going to happen
                        when it comes time?  You ever wonder
                        how you're going to feel about it?

                                 CAROLINE
                        The Lord will--

                                 WADE
                        No!  Not the Lord.  You.  How will
                        you feel?  What are you going to
                        feel when that girl in there, that
                        girl who has tried repeatedly with
                        you, that girl who loved and cared. 
                        How are you going to feel when she
                        finally changes?  When she finally
                        dies.

           Caroline stares up at him for a long moment, then in at Maggie
           on the couch.  Maggie smiles genuinely for the first time,
           unaware of Caroline watching.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline.  I love you.  And there
                        ain't nothing gonna stop that.  But
                        Maggie has been the first woman of
                        my life since the day she was born.  

           Wade rests his hand on Caroline's shoulder, then walks off
           and flicks the cigarette into the yard.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - LATER

           Lying on her bed reading, Maggie looks up at Caroline in the
           doorway.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Hey.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey.

                                 CAROLINE
                        The phone's for you. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who is it?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Allie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Caroline, I really don't want to
                        talk to anyone right now.
           Caroline sits on the bed.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Listen.  There are things that we
                        just can't deal with on our own. 
                        The bible tells us that--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh God.  Are you really doing this? 
                        Fine, I'll go talk to her.

           Caroline grabs Maggie's hand.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.

           Maggie looks down at Caroline's hand still clinging to hers.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline?

           Caroline smiles up at Maggie then lets go.  Maggie looks
           down at her, a tinge of curiosity in her eyes, then she exits.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie grabs the phone, sighs, then puts it to her ear. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey!

                                 ALLIE  (O.S.)
                        Oh my God.  She lives.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Shut up. 

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Where have you been?  I mean, when--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Haven't been feeling well.

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Well, how are you feeling right now?

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?
                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Trent, Candace, and a few other people
                        are heading out to the reservoir for
                        the night.  I know it's not a trip
                        into K.C. or anything.  But it's the
                        last few weeks before school starts
                        up again.  And I don't think any of
                        our parents are going to let us out
                        much further than that, especially
                        the good Doctor Kaplan.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Trent?

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  You heard?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.  Your dad told me he went to
                        K.C. to get checked out after I left. 

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Yeah.  He's at four weeks right now.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is he okay?

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Seems okay.  But don't take my word
                        for it.  Come see for yourself.

           Maggie stares down at her missing finger.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't know.  I've been--

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Come on, Pace!

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't--

                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Maggie.  No one is going to say
                        anything.  No one cares.  We all
                        just miss you.  All right, fine, I
                        miss you.

           Maggie hesitates.

                                 MAGGIE
                        All right.  When are you--
                                 ALLIE (O.S.)
                        Twenty minutes.  Don't you bail on
                        me, Pace.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm not making any promises.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie slams open the closet doors and looks at her wardrobe. 
           Then, she picks a few items out and looks them over, throwing
           them on the bed.  She finds a dress and lays it out.

           She throws on some makeup and touches it up several times,
           attempting to cover the blisters on her scalp.  

           Removing her pants, she notices a few pieces of dead skin on
           her leg.  She stares up at the dress, then down at her leg.  

           She plops down on the bed and stares at herself in the mirror:
           her face narrow from weight loss, her eyes seem larger; the
           small amount of hair on her head unable to cover the blisters;
           the blackened wound under the bandage worsening.  She puts
           her head in her hands.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie, in jeans and a sweatshirt, grabs her sunglasses,
           despite the night, and slides them on.  Then, she puts on a
           pair of gloves and a hat.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS 

           She steps out onto the porch in time to see a pair of
           headlights in the distance.  Wade sits in the chair on the
           porch still, drinking a beer.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy, I'm--

           He smiles and waves approval.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks.

           She ambles out to meet the oncoming car.  Wade watches her
           go, a small smile on his face.

           INT. ALLIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           ALLIE, thin and not overtly attractive, adjusts her thick-
           rimmed glasses and smiles over at Maggie. 

                                 ALLIE
                        What's with the glasses, Corey Hart?
                                 MAGGIE
                        You don't want to know.  And before
                        you ask, the same for the gloves.

           Allie smiles.

                                 ALLIE
                        How are you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        How do I answer that?

                                 ALLIE
                        With words.  Remember, I know about
                        it.  My dad is a doctor.  Ten weeks. 
                        Cravings for meat.  Occasional loss
                        of motor functions.  Loss of feeling. 
                        Tear ducts...you get the point.  I
                        know.  So, what I'm really asking
                        is, how. are. you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Other than all that?  Absolutely
                        fantastic.

           Allie and Maggie laugh.

                                 ALLIE
                        Pace.  You're the strongest girl I
                        know. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 ALLIE
                        I was wondering one thing.  Since
                        dad won't tell me.  And it's not in
                        any of the reports. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, I don't have it anymore.

           Allie stares at her, a small smirk on her face.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Yes, I know what you're talking about. 
                        And my period is officially gone. 
                        Gone.  

                                 ALLIE
                        Lucky.
           EXT. RESERVOIR CAMP-SITE - LATER

           A group of TEENAGERS sit around a campfire.  Maggie and Allie
           sit next to BARBARA, a tall, awkward girl.  Across from them,
           CANDACE, a short, tanned girl buries herself into the chest
           of a stocky boy, MASON.  

           A little further away, but somewhat alone, sits TRENT.  The
           average looking teenager exhibits similar features as Maggie,
           albeit a little less:  Dark ringed eyes, blotchy skin, dead
           in areas, and a large bandage over his neck. 

                                 ALLIE
                        I think so.  But my dad said that
                        Mister Moore and Miss Hawks aren't
                        coming back.

                                 MASON
                        I don't see why they're opening the
                        schools back up this soon.

                                 CANDACE
                        We need to get back to normal
                        sometime.

           Maggie watches Trent as he pokes the fire with a stick.

                                 MASON
                        Baby, come on.  This ain't normal. 
                        Trent, you tell them.  Are you coming
                        back?

                                 TRENT
                        No.  My dad pulled me.  He said what's
                        the point.

                                 MASON
                        See, baby.  How's that normal?

                                 BARBARA
                        She said we need to get back to
                        normal.  And we do.  Sorry Trent,
                        but 
                            (to Mason)
                        how long do you think we should wait
                        to go back to school?

                                 MASON
                        I'm just saying now ain't the time. 
                        It's too soon.  There are still some
                        running around out there.

                                 CANDACE
                        And so you bring me out here? 
                                 MASON
                        Baby.  There are a ton still out
                        there.  But there ain't none left up
                        here.  I'm saying we should wait
                        until all the school districts can
                        start back up again.  At the same
                        time.

                                 BARBARA
                        Well, what about the Andersons?

           Allie looks at Maggie.

                                 MASON
                        They were the last ones.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What about me?  What about Trent?

           The group goes silent.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Well? 

                                 MASON
                        Come on, Mag.  You're not one of
                        them things.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm not?  I was bit.  Just like all
                        the rest.  

                                 MASON
                        But, you're not one of them.  Not
                        now.  And probably--

                                 MAGGIE
                        But I will be.  What then?

                                 MASON
                        I'm sorry.  I was just saying--

           Trent gets up and walks away, back to one of the cars.

                                 CANDACE
                            (to Mason)
                        What did I say?  What did I say?  I
                        said no talking about it.  Didn't I?

           Maggie gets up and follows Trent.  Allie watches.

           INT. TRENT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie gets in the car and Trent looks at her.
                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 TRENT
                        It's not your fault.  It's my own
                        fault.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How is it your fault?  He was--

                                 TRENT
                        Not him.  This.

           He points at his neck.

                                 TRENT (CONT'D)
                        I did it to myself.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?  What do you mean?

                                 TRENT
                        I was working out in my dad's field
                        when I came across one of them.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           EXT. TRENT'S FATHER'S FIELD - DAY

           The bleak sky pours down on Trent as he looks up from behind
           a tractor engine and spots a NAKED WOMAN walking slowly
           through the fields.  He runs to her aid.

                                 TRENT (V.O.)
                        She wasn't anyone from town.  So I
                        got a little worried.  I asked if
                        she was okay and she just stared at
                        me.  She was naked.  That was the
                        only way I could tell it was a woman. 

           Sores, scratches and lacerations cover the woman's body. 
           Trent shakes as he apprehensively looks her over from a
           distance.  She simply stares at him awkwardly.

                                 TRENT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And she just stared at me, for a
                        long time.  I'd heard that you
                        shouldn't go near them, but she wasn't
                        trying to do anything to me.  And
                        she looked pretty hurt.  So I walked
                        over to her and put my shirt around
                        her.  She looked up at me again with
                        those eyes.
           As he wraps his shirt around her, the woman's gray and misty
           eyes study him with curiosity.

                                 TRENT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I started to walk her back to the
                        house and she let me.  We got about
                        halfway there before she stopped.  I
                        tried to pull her on, but she wouldn't
                        budge.  I turned and called out to
                        dad and that's when she grabbed me. 
                        Not hard.  But enough that it scared
                        me.  When I turned back, her eyes
                        were on me again, curious now.

           The woman's mouth opens a bit as she looks him over.  Her
           head cocks to one side.

                                 TRENT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Like she was studying me.  I grabbed
                        her hand and held it and turned back
                        to call for dad again.  I was on the
                        ground in pain before I knew what
                        had happened.  She bit me.

           Trent scurries away from beneath the woman.  Her bloody mouth
           gapes open and her eyes turn to fear.

                                 TRENT (CONT'D)
                        Not a bunch.  Just once.  Almost
                        like she was curious what I'd taste
                        like.  She stood there, staring down
                        at me.  And she had what looked like
                        regret or fear or something in her
                        eyes.  Like she hadn't meant to do
                        it.  It wasn't ten seconds later
                        that my dad shot her in the chest
                        with his twenty two.

           A single shot explodes into her chest.

                                 TRENT (CONT'D)
                        She stumbled back and looked up at
                        him.  He put another into her head
                        and she fell.  But her eyes stayed
                        open.  They were wide open, and on
                        me still.

           Trent locks eyes with the woman.  The hint of apology in her
           eyes is gone, replaced by fright. 

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. TRENT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie grabs Trent's hand, but he doesn't notice.
                                 TRENT
                        Dad took me to the hospital and they
                        told him that we had to go to K.C.
                        for evaluation.  Didn't have the
                        right equipment here.  That was last
                        month.  And now, now they're about
                        to open up the schools again.  And
                        everyone's getting back to normal. 
                        But not me.  And not her.  I didn't
                        even find out what her name was.  Or
                        if she had a family.  When we got
                        back, she was gone.  Dad said the
                        cleanup crews came and got her and
                        burned her body.

           Maggie removes her sunglasses, studying the boy's face with
           her red eyes as he stares out into the darkness.

                                 TRENT (CONT'D)
                        I just didn't think it would happen
                        like this.  I didn't think things
                        would start to get back to normal
                        and we'd still be here, dying.  
                            (beat)
                        Can you still feel it?

           Maggie shakes her head. 

                                 TRENT (CONT'D)
                        Dad said it'll go away soon.  Said
                        Doctor Kaplan told him that I'd stop
                        feeling before long.  Also said I
                        was doing good.  But I know I ain't. 
                        I know it's worse for me.  Because
                        of where she bit me.  
                            (beat)
                        I see her eyes, Mag.  When I look in
                        the mirror.  I see her eyes in mine.

           Trent stares out at the campfire and the teenagers talking.

                                 TRENT (CONT'D)
                        I forgive her though.  I forgive
                        her.  She didn't mean it.  I know
                        she didn't.

           EXT. CAMP-SITE - MORNING

           Maggie wakes up and crawls out of a sleeping bag.  The rest
           of the group still asleep, she quietly steps out of the woods,
           to the edge of the road beyond and sits down.  

           Barely visible through the haze, the sun gleams a dawn orange. 
           Maggie stares out at it, just creeping above the horizon. 
           Squinting, she slides on her sunglasses.  
           She sits there a long moment, staring at the sun as the sky
           fades back to gray. 

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER

           Maggie steps around Allie's car and leans into the driver's
           side window.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thanks.

                                 ALLIE
                        Shut up.  You promise you'll hang
                        out this weekend?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I promise.

                                 ALLIE
                        All right.  I'm holding you to it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        When don't you.

           Maggie smiles then backs away.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        See ya this weekend.

           Allie watches Maggie begin to walk away, then gets out of
           her car and jogs over to her.  She stands before her, gets
           ready to hug her, then doesn't.  They stare at each other a
           tense moment.  

                                 ALLIE
                        I love you, Pace.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love you, too.

           Allie backs away and wipes her eyes.

                                 ALLIE
                        Shut up. 

           Maggie smiles.  Allie jogs back to her car and hops in, waving
           and backing the car out.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie slowly walks up to the porch.  Wade, bent over,
           hammering in a loose wooden slat pauses to look up at her.

                                 WADE
                        Well?  Have fun?
           Her stale, gloomy expression melts into a small smile.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Well?

           She walks in, smiling.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Maggie lies in bed, reading a book.  Wade knocks on her door
           and slowly walks in.

                                 WADE
                        Dais.  You know what Vern said.  We
                        should get you outside.  Get you
                        doing something.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I am doing something.

                                 WADE
                        Something more active.  Why don't
                        you go outside.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy, I'm enjoying this.  Get.

           He smiles and exits.

           THREE DAYS LATER:

           INT. PACE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

           In just a tank top and sweat-pants, Maggie leans into the
           mirror, examining the patches of hair growing around her
           scabbed scalp. 

                                 MAGGIE
                            (yelling)
                        Daddy!  Where are the clippers?

           Caroline drifts into the bathroom.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        There's no need to shout.

           Maggie glares at her.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        They're downstairs.  

           Caroline slides on some gloves, then puts her hands on
           Maggie's face, near the girl's eyes.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Not too close.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I'll be fine.  

           Caroline gives her a stern look, then leans in and analyzes
           the girl's eyes.  She makes a small face, leaning further
           in, her neck close to Maggie.  Maggie sniffs once, then again.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You smell that?

           Caroline sniffs.

                                 CAROLINE
                        No.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You sure?

           They both sniff.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I don't smell anything.  Maybe your
                        father is cooking up something he
                        shouldn't be.  I tell him and I tell
                        him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Smells like...I don't know.  Meat or
                        something.

           Caroline finishes looking at the girl's eyes.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Looks okay.  Still really dilated
                        though.  Doctor Kaplan's directions
                        said to try and use eye drops every
                        night.  You been using them?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I swear.  

                                 CAROLINE
                        All right.  I'll go get the clippers.

           Caroline exits.  Maggie leans into the mirror, widening her
           eyes with her fingers, staring at the enlarged pupils.
           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caroline floats down the steps casually.

                                 CAROLINE
                            (to herself)
                        Wade Pace.  I swear.  How many times
                        have I told you that it's too late
                        to be grilling those--

           She stops halfway down the stairs, staring at Wade asleep on
           the couch.  She glances up the stairs a long moment, rubbing
           her neck, realization on her face.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Caroline?  You find the clippers?

           Caroline shivers, still holding her neck.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Caroline?

                                 CAROLINE
                        No.  No.  Hold on a sec.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Why?  You gonna go yell at Dad for
                        cooking this late?

           Caroline's faces quivers.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie splashes her face with water and, coming up, sees
           Caroline in the mirror. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you find them?

           Caroline nods.  She hands Maggie the clippers.  In her other
           hand, Caroline grips tightly to a pair of scissors. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Thanks.  I know it's kind of gross,
                        but I'm getting used to my hair this
                        short.  Better this than bald patches.
                            (noticing the scissors)
                        I can't use those.  I shake too much. 
                        You know that.

           Caroline stares at the girl.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What's daddy cooking?
           Caroline's white-knuckled grip on the scissors tightens.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline?  Hello?

           Caroline's grip tightens, then suddenly eases.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Nothing.  I--I told him he doesn't
                        need to be eating this late.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know he's just going to sneak
                        something in the middle of the night.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thanks by the way.

           Maggie plugs the clippers in and begins to cut her hair,
           careful around the blisters and dead skin.  Caroline stares
           a moment, then she sets the scissors on the counter as she
           exits.  Maggie studies the scissors a moment before continuing
           to buzz her head.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - BACK PORCH - MORNING

           Wade hammers a nail into the top of two adjoining wooden
           boards.  Maggie holds the bottom one while Wade hammers
           another nail into the top.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What's it called again?

                                 WADE
                        A tap joint.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tap joint?

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.  Hold it still.  See, these
                        two keep it from moving while those
                        keep it locked in place.

           Maggie holds the boards still as Wade raises a few more and
           they all come up together, revealing a section of a fence.

                                 MAGGIE
                        A fence?

                                 WADE
                        A fence.
                                 MAGGIE
                        What for? 

                                 WADE
                        A little project I have going.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh?  Secret project?

           A shrill howl bellows through the yard.  Wade stands.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Traps?

                                 WADE
                        I'd bet.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Fox?

                                 WADE
                        Sounds like it.  I'll-

                                 MAGGIE
                        I can get it.

           Wade stares at her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I've been doing it since I was ten. 
                        Besides, you have your little secret
                        boy's club to build.

                                 WADE
                        Funny.  Funny girl.

           She saunters off backwards, kicking dirt up at him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Dais.  Take the twenty two.

           Maggie turns, limping slightly, but sauntering her best.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know.

           EXT. FRONT FIELD - LATER

           The thin rifle in her hands, Maggie makes her way slowly
           through the dead earth.  She grunts in frustration.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where are you? 
           She stops, looking around her, squinting through her
           sunglasses.  She hears a scratching noise and drops to her
           haunches, breathing heavily.

           She readies the gun quickly, then realizing her index finger
           is missing, she rests her middle finger over the trigger. 
           Only the wind is heard through the field.

           She slowly stands and the scratching sound echoes again. 
           She slowly moves forward, rifle readied and shaking.

           In front of her she notices the trap and its captive, a fox,
           scratching the bark of a nearby tree through the metal
           gratings.  

           Maggie lowers the .22 and slowly walks up to the trap.  The
           fox begins to whimper.

           Maggie stares down at it intently, her body completely still. 
           She sniffs once and then sets the .22 on the ground.  Kneeling
           to her hands and knees, she crawls to the front of the trap
           and sits, studying the fox's fear and its frightened eyes.

           She sniffs again.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Wade hammers two more nails into a thick section of wood. 
           He looks up and finds Maggie walking quickly up to the house.

                                 WADE
                        Dais?

           She ignores him, walking faster, her shirt covered in red.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Mag?  Maggie! 

           He rises and walks, then runs after her.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie bursts through the door and quickly makes her way
           through the kitchen and just before reaching the living room,
           Wade slams the kitchen door open.

                                 WADE
                        MAGGIE!

           She stops, her father now breathing heavy behind her.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  What's going on?  Are you
                        hurt?
           She remains still and silent.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.)
                        What's going--

           Caroline comes around the corner in front of Maggie, with
           the girl between her and Wade, and stops, frightened.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh God, Maggie, what happened to
                        you?

           She moves forward, but Wade raises his hand.

                                 WADE
                        Caroline!  Stop!  Don't.

                                 CAROLINE
                        What are you talking about?

           Caroline moves to Maggie and grabs the girl before she
           suddenly goes limp.  Caroline kneels to her and cradles her
           in her chest.

                                 CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie?  What happened?

           Wade slowly steps forward, shock on his face.  As he inches
           closer, he sees Maggie's glasses broken and a deep cut beneath
           her eye.  Her shirt, however, is covered with fresh blood.

                                 WADE
                        Oh my God.  Mag...

           He kneels to them and Maggie suddenly convulses and shouts,
           sliding away from them.  They stare with horrified looks.
           Maggie shivers in the corner.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Baby.  Dais.  What happened?

           Maggie begins to cry tearlessly.  Realizing it, she SCREAMS.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I'll call the doctor.

           Caroline begins to stand, but Maggie juts an arm forward.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (shouting)
                        NO!
           Caroline hesitates, then continues toward the phone.

                                 WADE
                        Caroline.  No.

                                 CAROLINE
                        What?!

                                 WADE
                        Just give her a minute.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Wade.  We have to--

                                 WADE
                        Caroline!  PLEASE!  Give her a minute. 
                        Please.  Just one minute!

           Caroline nods quickly, nervously.  Wade nods back, then turns
           his attention to Maggie.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Daisy.  Daisy, just look at me. 
                        Baby.

           Maggie lifts her head and looks up at her father.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Good, baby.  Good.  

           Wade slowly moves forward.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Now.  What happened out--

           She moves away.  Wade stops abruptly.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  Okay.  I'm not...I'm not
                        moving.  Baby.  I just need to know
                        what happened.  It's okay.  Just
                        tell me what happened.  Daisy. 
                        Please.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (jittering)
                        It was afraid of me.  I didn't know
                        it.  I didn't know it.  I didn't.  I
                        swear.

                                 WADE
                        What was, the fox?

           Maggie nods jarringly.
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Okay.  It's okay.  What happened?

                                 MAGGIE
                            (jittering)
                        I...I could smell it.  It smelled. 
                        It smelled like--I...I...I couldn't
                        stop.  I couldn't stop.  I just wanted
                        to help it.  I just wanted to...but...

           She looks up at him suddenly, her deep-set, dry, dark red
           eyes piercing.  A drop of blood dribbles down her pale chin.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Daddy.  Please.  Please help me.

           Wade slowly moves forward, then he grabs her and pulls her
           into him with a giant embrace, a tear streaming down his
           cheek.

                                 WADE
                        It's okay.  It's okay.  

           She sobs in his chest.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.

           He turns his head, still holding her and looks at Caroline,
           whose eyes gleam with tears.  Caroline's hand still holds
           the phone, unconsciously.  Wade shakes his head and Caroline's
           hand comes off the phone as if she never knew it was there.

           EXT. FRONT FIELD - LATER

           Wade trudges through the dirt, a pained expression on his
           face.  He stares around the field, then finds the trap.  He
           walks past the discarded .22 and stares down at the trap a
           long moment.

           Claw marks rake the back of the trap and the tree behind it. 
           The fox, lying on its side, is relatively clean, save for a
           single bite, a small hole in its side.  Its stomach rises
           and falls slowly.  Foam bubbles heavily around its mouth.

                                 WADE
                        Jesus.

           Wade kneels, never taking his eyes off the animal and
           retrieves the .22.  The fox's now-red eyes look at him and
           its lips curl back, revealing a sharp set of small teeth. 

           Wade brings up the .22, aims and fires.  The shot echoes
           loudly in the field.  The fox dies instantly, a bullet hole
           in its head.  Wade stares at it a moment longer.
           INT. DARKNESS - LATER

                                 WADE (O.S.)
                        But I'm only a flower, said the daisy. 
                        I don't have any legs.  The
                        caterpillar laughed and said, you
                        don't need legs to go with me.  Just
                        hop on my back.  The daisy said,
                        thank you caterpillar, and together
                        they walked to the spring.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - EVENING

           In the yard, TODDLER-MAGGIE jumps in the air reaching out
           for a firefly.  She barely misses.  She smiles around her
           though as fireflies hover like speckled lanterns in the fading
           sunlight.

                                 WADE (V.O.)
                        At the spring, the daisy met a beetle. 
                        Have you seen my mother, asked the
                        daisy.  No, said the beetle, but you
                        could fly with me.  But I'm only a
                        flower, I don't have any wings, said
                        the daisy.  The beetle laughed and
                        said, you don't need any wings to
                        follow me.  Just hop on my back.  
                        The daisy said, thank you beetle,
                        and together they flew to the garden.  

           On the porch, a YOUNGER WADE leans across the threshold of
           the house's front door.  He smiles in and beckons SARAH, a
           young and beautiful woman with passionate fire in her eyes.

                                 WADE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        At the garden, the daisy met a honey
                        badger.  Have you seen my mother,
                        asked the daisy.  Why yes, said the
                        honey badger.  She has been looking
                        for you.  I'll take you to her. 
                        Burrow with me.  But I'm only a
                        flower, I don't know how to burrow,
                        said the daisy.  The honey badger
                        laughed and said, just hop on my
                        back.  Deep in the soil, the honey
                        badger said, she's right up there. 
                        The daisy said, thank you, honey
                        badger.  

           From the doorway, Sarah observes as her young daughter giggles
           in the midst of swarm of fireflies.  She clasps hands with
           Wade and smiles.
           Then, Maggie trips and falls to her stomach over a patch of
           dark soil.  Sarah steps forward with concerned eyes, but
           Wade holds her back and nods for patience.

                                 WADE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And the daisy wiggled and wiggled
                        and wiggled and finally he popped
                        up, out of the soil, and there was
                        his mother looking down at him. 
                        There you are, little daisy, said
                        his mother.  Where have you been?

           Picking herself up off the ground, Maggie notices a daisy in
           the soil.  She pulls the flower up and out of its root. 
           Then, she smiles.  Sarah exhales and Wade smiles. 

                                 WADE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Then, he said, I was with cricket,
                        and caterpillar, and beetle, and
                        honey badger.  And what did you learn,
                        asked the daisy's mother.  I learned
                        to walk and to jump and fly and to
                        burrow.  And the daisy--the dais--

           Wade's voice breaks off into a small sob.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Maggie's red, swollen eyes slowly open, staring up at the
           ceiling.  She finds herself under her covers in her bed. 
           She begins to sit up and then notices Wade in the chair next
           to her. 

           Pale and asleep, Wade's hand extends out, wrapped around the
           .22.  In his lap rests a children's book.  Maggie stares at
           him a long moment before pulling back the covers to reveal a
           clean shirt and pants.  She checks her skin and it, too, is
           clean, save for the dead skin in areas.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?

           Wade stirs, dropping the book and sitting upright.

                                 WADE
                        Mag, you all right?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Are you--are you...

           He notices his arm around the .22 and then moves it out of
           the way, setting it in a corner.
                                 WADE
                        No, baby.  Never.  I came straight
                        from the field.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What happened?

                                 WADE
                        You passed out.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did I...did I hurt anyone?

                                 WADE
                        No, baby.  Everyone's okay.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where's Caroline?

                                 WADE
                        She went to stay with your Aunt for
                        a while.

           Maggie stares down at her feet, a listless lull in her eyes.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm so hungry.

                                 WADE
                        I know.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It's time, isn't it?

                                 WADE
                        No.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't want to hurt anyone.

                                 WADE
                        You won't.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How--

                                 WADE
                        Because I'm here.  I'm here, baby. 
                        I won't let that happen.

           Maggie sniffs once then exhales loudly.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        It's okay.  Are you dizzy?  Can you
                        walk? 
           Wade stands and helps her out of bed.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Let's get you something to eat.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Wade and Maggie sit at the table.  Maggie devours a plateful
           of sausage and bacon.  Wade drinks a cup of coffee.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where did you get this?

                                 WADE
                        I froze some a while back.  Hid it
                        from Caroline.

           He smiles sadly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It tastes so good.

           Wade sips. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        She's afraid of me, isn't she.

           Wade nods.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        It's happening faster than it should.

           Wade nods again.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        When did she leave?

                                 WADE
                        Yesterday. 

           Maggie stops eating and looks up at him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        You...you were out for about a day. 

           She drops a piece of bacon into the plate.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        You passed out, here in the kitchen. 
                        Yesterday morning.

           Maggie stares down at her plate.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don't feel well.  
                                 WADE
                        Okay.  Let's get you back up to bed.  

           Wade stands, leans over and helps Maggie up.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - MAGGIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Wade helps Maggie into bed and kisses his hand and touches
           it to her forehead.

                                 WADE
                        Your mother would be proud of you. 
                        You know that?

           Maggie curls into a ball toward Wade.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Will you stay with me a while.

           Wade nods, then seats himself against the wall, on her bed.
           She places her head in his lap..

           INT. PACE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie sprints into the bathroom, shuts the door, flips the
           toilet seat up and vomits heavily.  Again and again.  

           Completely drained, she stands, shaking and goes to the
           mirror.  Her darkened features exaggerated now, she finds
           herself a ghost of what she used to be.  The few sores on
           her head are larger.

           She hangs her head over the sink.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - WADE'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Wade, shirtless and asleep in his bed, breathes heavily. 
           The room is splashed with a dim, gray morning light.  

           In the doorway, Maggie's silhouette stands, staring in at
           Wade.  She stands there for a long moment, unmoving. 
           Groaning.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MORNING

           Wade nails a few pieces of wood together, sweating under the
           gray sky.  Maggie steps out of the doorway of the kitchen
           and Wade notices.

                                 WADE
                        What are you doing down here?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tired of being in bed.
                                 WADE
                        You hungry?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 WADE
                        You want me to cook you something?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  I just want to sit out here
                        with you.

                                 WADE
                        Pull up a chair.  I could use the
                        company.  

           She drags a chair near him and sits down.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Caroline called this  morning.  She
                        wanted to know how you were doing. 
                        Her and Molly.

           He slams the hammer down into another nail.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        And Bobby.

           He finishes nailing the piece in.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He talked to me.

           Wade stops, looks up, then goes back to hammering.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        When they were over.  He came up and
                        talked to me.

                                 WADE
                        I know.  He'd talk to me, too, off
                        and on.  Made me promise not to tell
                        Caroline.  I think he thought he was
                        trying to prove something to her
                        about you.  Maybe get her to stop
                        treating you so distantly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        But you told her anyway.

                                 WADE
                        She's his mother, Mag.  Of course I
                        did.  She was worried sick about the
                        boy.
           Maggie stares off at the horizon.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Now, I know you and her never got
                        along so well.  And I know deep down,
                        you resented me getting with her. 
                        But I love her.  Not like I loved
                        your mother.  This...this is
                        different.  She's a good woman.  And
                        despite what you might think, she
                        loves you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

           Wade stops, dropping the hammer and leaning on the wood,
           sweating.

                                 WADE
                        What would you have her do, huh?  We
                        sent Molly and Bobby off to your
                        aunt's and she hasn't seen them nearly
                        at all since I brought you back. 
                        She ain't seen her own kids for over
                        two weeks.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        And neither have you.

                                 WADE
                        But I'll get to see them again.  I
                        don't get to see...

           Maggie and Wade share a long silent moment.  Then, Maggie
           stands and walks away, back to the house.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie sits on the couch, picking at a small piece of dead
           skin on her hand, staring off into the distance.  The radio
           plays lightly through the room.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        ...sixty eight infected dead, and
                        over forty two uninfected left injured
                        or dead.  During the riot, sixteen
                        soldiers were killed, bringing the
                        final death toll up to over one
                        hundred, becoming the largest single
                        tragedy in Kansas City history, not
                        counting the outbreak.  A
                        representative of the Kansas City
                        Saint Paul Hospital said that this
                        kind of reaction was not expected

                        given the small number of employees
                        that actually knew about the
                        vaccination's arrival.  Early
                        shipments of vaccination were expected
                        late yesterday afternoon and each
                        vial was allocated to hospital
                        employees, intended to prevent medical
                        staff from being infected with the
                        W.D virus during treatment. 
                        Government officials have not yet
                        made an official statement, but have
                        since posted nearly four times as
                        many security personnel at the
                        hospital.  We were, however, able to
                        speak with one of the protesters
                        early this morning. 

                                 EXCITED WOMAN (O.S.)
                        I lost my husband last night.

           She breaks off crying.

                                 EXCITED WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        He...he was just trying to get
                        something for us, so we could spend
                        time with our son.  In safety.  He's,
                        our son, he's infected.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Over forty eight families have removed
                        early-stage infected family members
                        from the hospital since this morning,
                        despite the recent government law
                        prohibiting stage-three infected
                        individuals outside quarantine.  One
                        concerned father said,

                                 UPSET MAN (O.S.)
                        They have vaccinations for medical
                        staff, for  but not for the rest of
                        our community?  Not for the families? 
                        We're what matters.  We're the ones
                        who will spend their last days with
                        them.  Not the hospital.  They just
                        put them away in a locked room like
                        a bunch of sick animals.  I'd rather
                        my wife spend her last day's with me
                        than in some packed hospital with
                        other infected.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.S.)
                        It is unclear at this time what the
                        government will do about these--
           Wade walks by and switches the station.

                                 WADE
                        Why are you listening to this crap?

           He tunes the radio to an old song and it plays melancholy
           through the living room.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I got dinner made.  Let's...

           He looks down at Maggie and her eyes stare off into the
           distance.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Hey. 

           He waves his hand in front of her face.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.

           She snaps out of it and looks up at him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?

                                 WADE
                        You hear any of that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.  What did you say?

                                 WADE
                        Dinner's ready.  Let's go eat.

           He grabs her hand and gently helps her up.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Maggie breathes heavy, eating a plateful of meat.  Wade stares
           down at his plate.  They continue like that for several
           moments.

           Maggie drops her fork and stares down at her food, her red
           eyes pained.

                                 WADE
                        Dais?

           She ignores him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Daisy, what's wrong?
           She vomits a small amount of her food into her plate and
           Wade quickly backs his seat away.  She gets up immediately
           and runs outside, vomiting.

           Wade puts his head in his hands.

           Moments later, Maggie's vomiting stopped, Wade gets up and
           heads to the door.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Wade opens the door to a trail of vomit, looks up and finds
           Maggie's body out in the backyard.  

                                 WADE
                        MAGGIE!

           He sprints to her and kneels down to her side.  She looks up
           at him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Let me go.  Let me go.  I can't do
                        this.  I can't do it.

                                 WADE
                        No.  No.  

           He picks her up in his arms and carries her back to the house.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Wade carries her through the living room, puts her on the
           couch and puts his hand on her face.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Please.  Please make it stop.  Please.

           Choked up, Wade puts a blanket over her.  

                                 WADE
                        You want the blanket, honey?  I know
                        you can't feel it, but...

                                 MAGGIE
                        Please.  Daddy, please just--

                                 WADE
                        Did you know that when you were only
                        a year old, your mother dropped you?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy, I can't...

           Wade smiles through tears.
                                 WADE
                        It wasn't bad.  You fell from the
                        couch to the carpet.  But your mother
                        was hysterical.  She called Vern and
                        told him what had happened.  And you
                        know your mother.  When it came to
                        you, it was a huge deal.  He came
                        out immediately and he looked you
                        over--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy.

           Maggie closes her eyes.

                                 WADE
                        And he told her there was nothing
                        wrong with you.  Just a little shock
                        on her part, that's all.  

           Wade stares down at Maggie, silent a moment.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I was in K.C.  When she told me, I
                        started to cry.  And I only cried
                        around your mother twice.  But when
                        she told me Vern had to come out to
                        see you, I...

           Tears stream down his face.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I...

           He leans down and kisses her forehead for a long moment.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I love you.

           He leans back and sits in the chair across next to her,
           staring at her.  Then, he wipes his eyes and stands, exhaling
           loudly.  And abruptly, he heads to the stairs and up.

           Maggie's chest rises and falls barely noticeable.  She wheezes
           through her breathing and it becomes a slight groan.  Her
           mouth opens and her jaw closes, tightening, then opening
           again.

           Wade returns from upstairs with the .22.  He slowly walks
           back to the chair and sits, staring down at the rifle.  Then,
           he stands and readies it, barrel pointing at Maggie's head.

           Wade's face turns angry, tears streaming.  He MOANS loudly
           in disgusted pain.  His aim begins to waver and he shakes
           his head, moaning again.  
                                 MAGGIE
                            (eyes closed)
                        Why...why were you in K.C.?

           Other than her words, she looks unconscious.  Wade begins to
           shake violently and lowers the gun, sobbing.  He falls back
           into the chair, dropping the gun to the ground.

                                 WADE
                            (sniffing)
                        I was buying seed.  It was your
                        mother's anniversary present.

           A long moment passes.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (eyes closed)
                        What...?

                                 WADE
                            (sniffing)
                        Daisies.  For her garden.

           Wade and Maggie sit in silence.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - BACK PORCH - LATER

           Hose in hand, Wade sprays water over the vomit on the back
           porch, pushing it out into the dead grass.  Then, he grabs a
           bucket and a scrub brush and scrubs the wood.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Wade wakes up on the couch with Maggie's head lying in his
           lap.  Cleaning gloves still on his hands, he strokes her
           buzzed hair, avoiding the sores.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Are you awake?

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I feel so...weird.  I feel like a
                        stranger to myself.  Everything seems
                        foggy.  

           Silence.

                                 WADE
                        I want to show you something.

           She looks up at him, her features morbid.  
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Come on.

           She leans up, then he stands and helps her to her feet.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Wade helps Maggie out of the back door, her motor functions
           failing.  They walk down the back section of the driveway
           and into the dirt.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I can do it.

                                 WADE
                        All right.  Just hold my hand.

           They hold hands and slowly walk through the back yard, under
           the gray sky.

           EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

                                 MAGGIE
                        Where are we going?

                                 WADE
                        Through here.  Just a bit more.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It can't be...

           They exit the forest into a small clearing.

           EXT. SMALL CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie lets out a groan of surprise.  In front of them, in
           lines of splendid flourishing, sits a small garden of daisies,
           enclosed by a small wooden gate, Wade's handmade gate.

           Maggie steps forward and Wade stays behind, watching her.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy.

           She slowly leans down to a daisy.  She runs her hand over
           the petals, then the stem.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Momma's garden?  How...

                                 WADE
                        I don't know.  I came out here last
                        month and there was a small section
                        growing back there.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        I planted some more last week and
                        they grew.  Damndest thing. 

           Maggie smiles ever so briefly.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It's the most beautiful thing ever.  

           She sits down to the earth below, running her rotted fingers
           over more petals.  Wade walks over and sits down next to
           her, putting his arm around her.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What about the fields?

           Wade shakes his head slowly, staring out at the daisies. 

           Maggie leans in on Wade and they sit there, staring at the
           garden, stark against the gray sky and earth.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER

           Wade helps Maggie through the yard, a daisy in her ear.  

                                 WADE
                        I'm going to call Caro--

           Maggie stops and her face goes cold, stressed.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Mag?

           She grunts in pain, doubling over and breathing rapidly.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie...

           She continues breathing heavily.

                                 MAGGIE
                        So hungry.

                                 WADE
                        Let's get you inside and I'll cook
                        some--

                                 MAGGIE
                        Not that.

           She slowly stands, shaking her head, her eyes tortured.  She
           pulls her hand from his.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        It's getting worse.
           Wade simply stares.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I don't want to go to quarantine.  I
                        don't want to go. 

           He stares at her intently.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Daddy!  I don't want to go.  Please
                        don't make me go.  Just stop it. 
                        Make it stop. 

           Wade grabs her hand, but she pulls away.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        No!  Tell me you'll do it.  Tell me
                        you'll make it stop.  I can't do
                        this anymore.

                                 WADE
                        I'll...

                                 MAGGIE
                        Please!

                                 WADE
                        I'll make it stop.  I'll...make it
                        stop.

           Maggie nods solemnly and grabs Wade's hand.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tonight.

           Her grip tightens on his hand.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie sits at the table, the phone pressed to her ear.

                                 MAGGIE
                        ...Um, and ice cream and cookies.  

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        What about Pretty Pony?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course Pretty Pony.  What would I
                        do without Pretty Pony.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        And Hugs-a-Lot?
                                 MAGGIE
                        All of them.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Okay.  Well, you can take them with
                        you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, we can both have them.  I'll
                        have them there, and you can have
                        them here.  How's that?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                            (sniffling)
                        Okay.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, don't cry, Mol.  It's okay.  I'm
                        going to watch you from there
                        everyday.  Tell you what.  I can be
                        your guardian angel. 

           Molly cries.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Is that okay?  I'll always be around
                        with you.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        But you won't be there.  For
                        breakfast.  And after school.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes, I will.  I promise you.  Any
                        time you get nervous or scared or
                        just want to talk to me, just close
                        your eyes real tight and I'll be
                        right there.  Okay?  Molly?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Okay.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love you so much. 

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        I love you.

           Molly begins to cry again as the phone is handed away.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.)
                        Mag.  Bobby told me he talked to
                        you.
                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 CAROLINE (O.S.)
                        Here he is, okay?

           Maggie's jaw begins to shake in the silence.  

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Hi.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey.

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        I'm sorry.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It's okay.

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Is it...is it true about Heaven? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course.

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Really?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.  

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        So you'll be there?  You promise?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.  I promise.  I'll be there.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wade sits back in his chair, rolling a bullet in his fingers
           and listening to Maggie on the phone.

           He sets the gun down, gets up and walks to and out of the
           front door.

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Wade pulls a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and shakily
           lights one.  He puffs on it multiple times.  

           A CLANKING sound suddenly echoes through the house.  Wade
           turns quickly.
                                 WADE
                        Maggie?

           He sprints inside.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wade runs past the gun, and into the kitchen.

           INT. PACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 

           Wade finds Maggie in the chair, staring out at nothing.  The
           phone lies on the floor, still tinnily echoing voices.

                                 WADE
                        Maggie?

           She turns toward him slowly, her eyes distant. 

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Baby?

           She grabs for his arm, and he backs away, tears in his eyes.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie!  MAGGIE!

           He grabs her quickly and spins her around, pinning both her
           arms beneath his.  Then, he begins to shush her gently.  

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  It's me.  It's me.  Come
                        on, baby.  Come on.  Snap out of it.

           She moves slightly in his grasp and he shushes more. 

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Come on baby.  Come on!  Snap out of
                        it.  You can do this.

           He begins to cry harder.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie.  Please.  Don't do this! 
                        Not now!  God dammit!  Maggie!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?

                                 WADE
                        Oh God.  Oh God.  That'a girl.  Come
                        on.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?  What'd I do?
           Wade bursts into a long, exhaled sob.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What's happening?  

                                 WADE
                        Nothing, baby.

           He spins her back gently and looks into her coherent eyes.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        It's okay.  It's over.

           He hugs her.  Her arms slowly hug him back. 

           INT. PACE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Maggie's eyes open and she stares at nothing as she rests on
           her father's lap.  He breathes lightly in his sleep, slouched
           into the couch.

           She slowly gets up and looks him over, quizzically.  Then,
           she leans in, near his neck, then stops and moves up to his
           forehead and puckers her lips, avoiding saliva contact.  She
           kisses him softly on the forehead.  

           Then, she puts a blanket on him and slowly and very shaky,
           she walks up the stairs.

           ONE MONTH EARLIER:

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Wade sprints through the hallway, stops and evaluates a
           directory.  Then he notices the a HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE.

                                 WADE
                            (to employee)
                        Hey!  Where are they keeping all
                        the...sick people?

           The employee stares at him.

                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        The sick people!  The infected.

                                 HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
                        They're using the E.R.

                                 WADE
                        Where the hell is that?

                                 HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
                        Second floor.  
           Wade looks over the directory quickly and then sprints down
           the hall.

           INT. HOSPITAL - E.R. - MOMENTS LATER

           Wade bursts through the doors and a WOMAN IN SCRUBS and a
           mask stops him.

                                 WOMAN IN SCRUBS
                        Sir, you shouldn't be down here. 
                        All the people down here are very
                        badly sick.  I need you to--

                                 WADE
                        My daughter is down here.  She's in
                        here somewhere.

           She hands him a mask and he holds it over his face.

                                 WOMAN IN SCRUBS
                        What's her name?

                                 WADE
                        Magg--Marguerite.  Marguerite Pace.

           The woman leans over to a MAN IN SCRUBS and pulls her mask
           down.

                                 WOMAN IN SCRUBS
                            (to man)
                        You have a Marguerite...

                                 WADE
                        Pace.  Pace.

                                 WOMAN IN SCRUBS
                            (to man)
                        Marguerite Pace?

           The man looks over his clipboard.

                                 MAN IN SCRUBS
                        Hmm.  Pace.  Over there, I think. 
                        There's a lot of--

           Wade sprints toward the direction in which the man points,
           evading people and looking around him at the infected people.

           He searches each bed.

                                 WADE
                        Maggie?  Baby?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Daddy?
           Maggie, sitting on the edge of a makeshift bed, stares up
           dumbfounded at her father as he sprints up to her.  He drops
           the mask and picks her up in a hug.  She hugs him back. 
           They both cry. 

                                 WADE
                            (crying)
                        Oh God.  Where have you been?  I
                        searched everywhere for you.

                                 MAGGIE
                            (crying)
                        I'm sorry, daddy.  I'm so sorry.

                                 WADE
                            (crying)
                        It's okay.  It's okay.  It's gonna
                        be okay. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - STERILE ROOM - LATER

           Maggie sits on a bed in the distance.  Wade stares up at a
           DOCTOR with tears in his eyes.

                                 WADE
                        Nothing?

                                 DOCTOR
                        I'm sorry.  The blood samples show
                        it's progressing rapidly.  But this
                        isn't conclusive.  We don't know
                        anything but what we've seen so far. 
                        The best I can do is release her and
                        contact your family doctor.  Transfer
                        the records.  

           Wade stares at Maggie as she wipes her eyes.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Pace.  Your daughter's bite was
                        severe.  Punctured an artery, which
                        managed to transfer the virus faster. 
                        Most patients admitted now show signs
                        of human bite wounds.  Her wounds
                        don't look like that at all.

           Wade ignores the question, his heavy gaze on Maggie.

                                 WADE
                        Human?  You say it so casually. 
                        Like it happens everyday.

                                 DOCTOR
                        With all respect, it has been.  For
                        the past few weeks.
           Wade looks up at him and they share a silent moment.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Well.  Make sure that she doesn't
                        aggravate the wound.  She has weeks,
                        at best.  I'll send the documents
                        to...

           He looks at a clipboard.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Dr. Kaplan, is that right?

                                 WADE
                        Vern.  Yes. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        He can go over everything with you. 
                        The hospital sincerely appreciates
                        your donation.  It's not often that...

           The doctor notices Wade study Maggie.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        I'm extremely sorry, sir, but I have
                        several other patients.  
                            (beat)
                        I truly am sorry.

           Wade turns to watch the doctor leave, then wipes his eyes
           and goes to Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What'd he say?

                                 WADE
                        You know doctors.  Sky's either always
                        falling or everything's peachy.  But
                        from what I gathered, you have a
                        while.

                                 MAGGIE
                        A while.

                                 WADE
                        Yeah.
                            (beat)
                        Let's get to the hotel.  We can
                        check...

           He grabs her head gently in his hands, runs them back through
           her long hair and stares at her beautiful blue eyes.
                                 WADE (CONT'D)
                        Don't you ever leave me again.  You
                        hear me?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah.

                                 WADE
                        I'm serious.  Never again.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I promise, daddy.

           She tears up and hugs him.

                                 WADE
                        Never.

           They embrace for a long moment.

           NOW:

           EXT. PACE HOUSE - ROOF - EARLY MORNING 

           Maggie, seated on the roof in a long t-shirt and boxers,
           opens her red eyes and stares out at the gray sky and the
           farm around her.  She sits for a long moment, ripping the
           pages out of the Daisy book and letting them float off in
           the wind.  

           When finished, she sets the binder of the book down next to
           a pen.  She stares off at a small patch of cloudless sky. 
           In it, the moon shines.

           She slowly stands, steadying herself.  Her long shirt waves
           in the wind.  She extends her arms out to her sides.  The 
           wind catches her and she shakes, staring down at the long
           drop.  Then, she closes her eyes.

           Her toes wiggle over the edge of the roof.  Scabs and puss
           spot her red and blackened legs.  

           She opens her eyes once more and they stare distantly out at
           nothing.  A gray mist shrouds her pupils and her head wobbles
           slightly.  Her foot comes up and dangles over the edge.

           Then, she steps out, her body falling forward slowly and
           disappearing over the edge of the roof.    

           A few of the daisy pages drift around on the morning breeze
           atop the roof.  In the binder of the book, Maggie's
           handwriting stands out:

           I'M SORRY I BROKE MY PROMISE, DADDY.  I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH
           MOM NOW.  I LOVE YOU.  -DAISY
           FADE OUT.
