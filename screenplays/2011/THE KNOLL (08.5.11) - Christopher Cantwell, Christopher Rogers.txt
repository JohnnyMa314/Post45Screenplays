           SUPER OVER BLACK:

           History is a relentless master. It has no present, only the 
           past rushing into the future. 

           To try to hold fast is to be swept aside. 

           -- John F. Kennedy.

           THE SOUNDS OF DISTANT CHEERING...

           INT. TEXAS BOOK DEPOSITORY - SIXTH FLOOR -- DAY

           CHEERING CONTINUES -- A PARADE CROWD. Innocent. Happy...

           An aging warehouse. Old brick walls. Dimly lit. Cardboard 
           boxes stacked in every direction. 

           WORN SHOES SLOWLY WALK ACROSS THE DUSTY WOODEN FLOOR

           Careful steps. Straight. As if walking a last mile. 

           SUPER IN BOTTOM CORNER: November 22, 1963. 12:28 p.m. 

           A RIFLE HANGS IN A MAN’S GRIP

           Barrel pointed down, strap hanging loose. A 6.5mm Carcano 
           bolt-action. Wooden stock. A poor man’s weapon...

           HIS HAND LOADS IN ROUNDS

           Methodically pushing live jackets the color of dull brass 
           down into the barrel -- HE LOCKS the bolt into place --

           ANGLE ON THE MAN STANDING A FEW FEET INSIDE THE WINDOW

           We see nothing of his view through it. Only him. Slight and 
           wiry. Beads of sweat on his face, warm November day. Thinning 
           hair but only 24 years old and tightly wound.

           LEE HARVEY OSWALD. The crowd noise SPIKES TO DEAFENING, just 
           below outside -- 

           HE KNEELS AT THE WINDOW SILL -- boxes arranged to form a sort 
           of blind in the corner -- 

           Dust particles swimming through the shaft of light on his 
           face, the gun -- rifle at the ready -- 

           -- CROWD CHEERS at a FEVER PITCH -- 
           -- His HEAVY BREATHING, his very HEARTBEAT --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DALLAS STREET -- SUNSET

           SUPER TIMESTAMP: “18 Hours Earlier”

           HEAVY BREATHING, HEARTBEAT CARRY OVER 

           CLOSE ON OSWALD RUNNING

           Now in a flannel shirt, jeans -- breaths in PANICKED GASPS, 
           stumbles, near-falls, constant glances back -- 

           CLOSE ON A POLICE OFFICER RUNNING IN A FULL SPRINT

           A blur of navy blue -- CRUNCH of foliage under boot, CRASH of 
           tree branches being batted aside --

           EXT. LOW-RENT HOUSE -- SAME

           A YOUNG WOMAN IN HER 20’S WAILS AND SCREAMS, mouth and nose 
           bloody, cheek swelling purple -- 

           ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER HOLDS HER BY THE ARMS

           CORPORAL LEROY CURTIS (39) -- stops her from running after -- 

                                 CURTIS
                        DAMMIT, NOLAN! WAIT FOR BACK-UP!

           EXT. DALLAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           OSWALD DARTS INTO THE ROAD, running out of breath --

           CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT, almost plows through him --

           PURSUING COP TACKLES HIM FULL-SPEED OVER THE HOOD

           The men rolling in a BANGING heap across metal -- 

           THEY FALL TO THE ASPHALT

           Our cop, JIM NOLAN (26), pins the suspect with his knees as 
           he reaches for Oswald’s wallet...

                                 NOLAN
                        All right...
                             (reading ID)
                        Oswald. Lee Harvey. 
           EXT. LOW-RENT HOUSE -- SAME

           The woman now calmed to heavy sobs. MARINA OSWALD. 

           The officer: Corporal Curtis--a weathered country boy with 
           some gray peeking out from the sides of his pomaded hair. 

           Curtis still holds Marina’s arm, keeping her put --  

                                 MARINA
                        He did not do anything! He did not 
                        do anything!

                                 CURTIS
                        Marina, you called us, sweetheart--

           NOLAN RETURNS TO THE HOUSE WITH OSWALD

           Nolan: square jaw, sharp and athletic in his sweaty Dallas PD 
           blues. 

           Oswald: Opposite in every way. Small chin. Permanent scowl. 

           Nolan gets a good look at Marina’s battered face.

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s all right, ma’am... you’re 
                        gonna be fine...
                             (turning on Oswald)
                        You like hittin’ your wife, Lee?

                                 OSWALD
                        This is a private affair between 
                        Marina and I--

           FISTS TIGHTEN ON HANDFULS OF FLANNEL, Nolan JERKS Oswald 
           close to his face:

                                 NOLAN
                        Takes a real tough guy to beat on a 
                        woman, Lee. You know what happens 
                        to tough guys like you in County?

                                 CURTIS
                        Easy, Jim--

           TIRES SCREECH ON THE STREET

           Black Ford in an abrupt stop. A gray suit and hat outside in 
           seconds flashing a badge. This is BARSTOW (41) --

                                 BARSTOW
                        Get your hands off ‘em...
                                 NOLAN
                        Hell you s’posed to be--

                                 BARSTOW
                        Get your hands off ‘em. Barstow. 
                        With the Bureau. 
                             (grabbing Oswald)
                        Man’s with me--

           Nolan gets toe-to-toe with the agent -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        FBI? You gotta be kiddin’--

                                 BARSTOW
                        I LOOK LIKE I’M KIDDIN’?

                                 CURTIS
                             (stepping between them)
                        Jimmy, dammit, don’t be a hero!

                                 NOLAN
                        So that’s it?! Fed says so an’ he’s 
                        off the hook? No. We’re takin’ him 
                        in. This woman called the police 
                        and that’s us--

                                 BARSTOW
                             (cutting, to Marina)
                        This true, Marina?

           Marina has quieted to sniffles upon sight of the agent. 

                                 MARINA
                        ...Lee did nothing, just leave us 
                        alone...

           Barstow tosses Lee toward his black Ford.

                                 BARSTOW
                        Get in the car, Lee. 

                                 OSWALD
                        You don’t tell me what to do!

                                 BARSTOW
                        Get in the GODDAMN car.

                                 OSWALD
                        We hit Lewisville, we go our 
                        separate ways--

           BARSTOW BACKHANDS OSWALD ACROSS THE MOUTH
           Barstow makes like he’s about to hit Lee again, but instead 
           spins on the cops --

                                 BARSTOW
                             (to Nolan, Curtis)
                        You boys would do better to keep 
                        outta Bureau business. Understand? 

           Nolan moves to speak, Curtis holds him back with his hand.

                                 CURTIS
                        Understood. 

           Barstow heads back to his Ford, pulling Oswald with him.

                                 NOLAN
                             (calling out)
                        We’ll see ya real soon, Lee.

           The car drives off. Nolan turns to the stricken woman.

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        You all right, Marina?

           She can only nod. Doesn’t meet their eyes. 

           CURTIS steps in front of Nolan, severe --

                                 CURTIS
                        What part of ‘back-up’ don’t you 
                        understand? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Turn-of-the-century place that’s gone to the dogs. Songs of 
           CRICKETS, CICADAS in the blackness. The middle of nowhere.

           AN ELDERLY LANDLADY LEADS A MAN THROUGH THE HOUSE

           She’s spindly, leather and bones. He’s tall, late 30’s, close-
           shaved hair. Hollow eyes. Let’s call him BADGE. 

                                 LANDLADY
                        Jus’ me in the house so the back’s 
                        all yours... 

           BEDROOM. She flicks on a light. Not much. Ancient iron bed, 
           lamp, dusty night stand.
                                 LANDLADY (CONT’D)
                        Here’s your room. Modest, but... 
                        part of the charm, I guess...

           Badge walks in, surveys it with no expression. Carefully puts 
           a worn suitcase on the bed. 

           BATHROOM. She flips the switch. Even less. Tub shower, old 
           curtain. Small mirror and sink. 

                                 LANDLADY (CONT’D)
                        Hope it’s to your liking... 

           No answer. She turns, sees him facing away from her.

                                 LANDLADY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t talk much. 

           He opens the suitcase -- his BACK TO HER -- 

           HE PULLS OUT A PISTOL AND PLACES IT ON THE BED -- SHE DOESN’T 
           SEE as he continues unpacking -- 

           PULLS OUT A SMALL SERRATED COMBAT KNIFE -- military issue -- 
           places it next to THE GUN -- 

                                 LANDLADY (CONT’D)
                        In town to see the president?

           HE PULLS OUT A NAVY BLUE UNIFORM SHIRT -- places it on top of 
           THE GUN -- then tosses a DALLAS POLICE BADGE on it --  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DALLAS POLICE HQ - MUSTER ROOM -- SAME

           More than a hundred uniform and plainclothes officers. The 
           clock on the wall reads 8:15 a.m. 

           OFF TO THE SIDE, Nolan and Curtis, in the midst of being 
           dressed down by CHIEF JESSE CURRY (50). Balding, glasses, 
           husky and boorish. 

                                 CURRY
                        You think I need more to worry 
                        about? You think I need the FBI 
                        callin’ me the day of the parade? 
                        Tellin’ me two officers are 
                        harassing a federal contact--

                                 NOLAN
                        We responded to a call, he was 
                        beatin’ the shit out of her--
                                 CURRY
                        Corporal Curtis.

                                 CURTIS
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 CURRY
                        Get your partner under control. 
                        ‘Fore I make an example.

                                 CURTIS
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 CURRY
                        I mean it. Not today. Of all days, 
                        I do not need it today. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Coulda killed her. 

                                 CURRY
                        Nolan. You’re on traffic duty. I 
                        want you as far from the motorcade 
                        as possible. Read me? 

           LATER: 

           Officers seated as Curry addresses them:

                                 CURRY (CONT’D)
                        ...president’s convoy will now 
                        travel down Main Street, turn right 
                        on Houston Street, then left onto 
                        Elm Street. Then it will enter onto 
                        Stemmons Freeway and proceed 
                        directly to the Merchandise Mart, 
                        where several of you will be 
                        posted. Federal agents have been on 
                        the premises since this morning. 

           ANGLE ON Nolan sitting next to Curtis in the back. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Lewisville.

                                 CURTIS
                        What?

                                 NOLAN
                        What’d he mean? ‘We hit Lewisville, 
                        we go our separate ways.’ 

                                 CURTIS
                        The hell you talkin’ ‘bout?
                                 NOLAN
                        Oswald fella said it. Right before 
                        that FBI sombitch smacked him.

                                 CURTIS
                        You need to learn when to leave 
                        well enough alone, Jimmy. 

           ANGLE ON Curry, continuing to drone on. 

                                 CURRY
                        ...You must take action if it 
                        becomes obvious that someone is 
                        planning to commit an act that may 
                        be harmful or degrading to the 
                        President...

                                 NOLAN
                        Hell, chief said the same damn 
                        thing on TV two nights ago. 
                             (turning to Curtis)
                        I’m outta here. Cover for me?

           Curtis eyes him. Nolan ducks out. 

           EXT. POLICE HQ - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan slips from the room unnoticed. Looks back, stops...

           SEES A FELLOW OFFICER IN FRONT OF HIM

           J.D. TIPPIT (39). Marlboro Man handsome and shy -- 

                                 TIPPIT
                        You leavin’?

                                 NOLAN
                        Uh, yeah.. My part of the detail 
                        starts early... 

                                 TIPPIT
                             (wry smile)
                        I’ll bet it does. What’s her name?

                                 NOLAN
                             (grinning, leaving)
                        I’ll see ya later, J.D. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. HOUSTON STREET -- LATER

           The black Ford pulls up on Houston Street.

           INSIDE THE CAR, Barstow sits in the front seat --

           ANOTHER MAN sits in the passenger seat, stocky, unassuming -- 
           tweed coat, CAMERA IN HIS LAP -- Let’s call him NUMBER ONE -- 
           he’s busy loading film into the camera -- 

           OSWALD sits in the back seat -- in work clothes.

                                 BARSTOW
                        Go.

           Oswald starts to get out.

                                 BARSTOW (CONT’D)
                        Lee.

           Oswald waits.

                                 BARSTOW (CONT’D)
                        You forgot your curtain rods.

           Oswald’s shoulders slump, embarrassed -- takes a long paper-
           wrapped package from the back seat, gets out of the car --

           ON HOUSTON STREET as Oswald makes his way...

           TILT UP ON THE BOOK DEPOSITORY waiting in the morning gloom. 
           A 72-year-old red brick warehouse. His final destination. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER

           Windswept wooden slat home, desolation and barren land. 

           SCREEN DOOR BANGS OPEN -- FOLLOWING BADGE as he walks out in 
           a full Dallas police uniform carrying a LONG TOOLBOX --

           Walks to a parked DALLAS PATROL CAR, empty and waiting there 
           as if it’s been delivered -- 

           HE PUTS THE BOX IN THE TRUNK, closes it -- Gets in the car...

           INSIDE:

           A MANILA ENVELOPE in the passenger seat -- Badge opens it -- 
           drops a set of KEYS into his hand -- STARTS UP THE CAR --

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. MAIN STREET AT LAMAR -- LATER

           CLOSE ON Nolan’s pensive face, a million miles away --

           WIDER TO REVEAL him standing in the middle of an extremely 
           busy intersection -- LONG HORN-HONKING FROM WAITING CARS --

           HE SNAPS TO, starts directing gridlocked traffic -- 

           ANGLE ON A YOUNG WOMAN IN HER RED PICK-UP TRUCK WAITING

           SLAMMING her hand on her metal door, red handkerchief tied 
           over her auburn hair. This is REBECCA (22) --

                                 REBECCA
                        C’MON, LET’S GO!

           NOLAN SEES HER -- beautiful, striking amidst this mess of 
           vehicles, faceless pedestrians -- 

           His eyes LIGHT UP -- he instantly fills with confident 
           bravado --

                                 NOLAN
                             (waving her over)
                        Rebecca! Hey! 

           REBECCA SEES HIM from inside her car -- recognition eliciting 
           a very different reaction as she slumps back in her seat --

                                 REBECCA
                             (to self)
                        Oh, great... 
                             (mustering the strength)
                        How’s it goin’?

                                 NOLAN
                        Pull over here...

                                 REBECCA
                        What?!

           Nolan walks to an empty fire lane curb, waving to her --

                                 NOLAN
                        Pull over here, please...

           REBECCA PULLS HER TRUCK TO THE CURB

           Nolan walks to her window, sees she’s bent out of shape. She 
           GLARES at him -- THROWS it into park --

                                 REBECCA
                        I do somethin’ wrong?
                                 NOLAN
                        Jus’ wanted to say hi. How you 
                        been?

                                 REBECCA
                             (suspicious)
                        ...I don’t know, Jim, how you been?

                                 NOLAN
                        Fine, these last three months, I-- 

                                 REBECCA
                             (losing patience)
                        Really? ‘Cause last time I saw you, 
                        it was at the bottom of a bottle a 
                        Wild Turkey. 

           He can’t deny that one. He places a hand on her arm --  

                                 NOLAN
                        How’re your folks? Haven’t seen ‘em 
                        since the ol’ neighborhood. They 
                        still out in Wylie? 

                                 REBECCA
                             (shakes his hand off)
                        Lubbock. You know where I can park?

                                 NOLAN
                             (undeterred)
                        Tell you what, why don’t you leave 
                        it right here. I’ll keep an eye on 
                        ‘er for ya. 

           She eyes him, unsure. Gets out. Pulls her tan jacket, purse 
           close, as well as a big shoulder bag.

                                 REBECCA
                        I do need to get to the parade-- 

                                 NOLAN
                        So you can get a look at Jackie?

                                 REBECCA
                        That’s what you think, isn’t it? 
                        I’m a woman so I must be obsessed 
                        with Jackie. Do my hair like her. 
                        Wear the same dresses.
                             (pause)
                        I’m actually tryin’ to film the 
                        motorcade as it goes by. 

           Rebecca flips open the top of her shoulder bag. Pulls out an 
           8mm film camera. Nolan nods at the sight of it, impressed. 
                                 NOLAN
                        That’s right, you’re workin’ at 
                        WFAA now--

                                 REBECCA
                             (she’s said too much)
                        WBAP. And, no. They never hired me. 

                                 NOLAN
                        What? I thought you got back from 
                        UT an’ went right to--

                                 REBECCA
                        It’s a man’s world, ain’t it?

           She closes the door on her truck -- he continues to lean 
           against it -- doing his best self-assured cop pose -- 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        You sure I can just leave it here?

                                 NOLAN
                        Sure. One condition, though. You 
                        let me buy you a drink after the 
                        parade-- Dinner. Whatever you want. 
                        Jus’ catch up, talk ol’ times. 

           He smiles smugly. She turns back to the truck, keys out --

                                 REBECCA
                        I’ll move it, thanks--

                                 NOLAN
                        Hey, come on now--

                                 REBECCA
                        We tried dinner a few months ago, 
                        remember? Didn’t go so well.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TEXAS BOOK DEPOSITORY -- SAME

           CLOSE ON a freight elevator slowly going up, OSWALD waiting 
           behind the gate -- holding the WRAPPED PACKAGE -- 

           ELEVATOR STOPS ON THE SIXTH FLOOR

           Oswald PULLS OPEN the gate, raises the second cargo door --
           He surveys the vast floor of cardboard boxes, windows --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN STREET AT LAMAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Rebecca getting back in her truck -- Nolan steps to the door:

                                 NOLAN
                        Wait, wait, wait--

           She hesitates as his bravado gives way to defeat -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m just... 
                             (pause)
                        Leave it here. No strings attached. 
                        You don’t ever have to talk to me 
                        again. Jus’ let me do you a 
                        kindness. 

                                 REBECCA
                        I don’t trust you. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Well, I aim to fix that. 
                             (pause)
                        It’s safe with me. Honest.

           A beat. 

                                 REBECCA
                        ...all right fine... 

           She gets out, walks off toward DEALEY PLAZA -- 

           He watches her go. After a few seconds, he follows her, 
           letting TRAFFIC SNARL IN THE INTERSECTION...

           DOWN MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Rebecca walking -- Nolan running to catch her -- 

           They encounter hundreds and hundreds of people gathering on 
           the sidewalks and streets ready for the president -- Waving 
           flags, greeting signs, everything -- 

                                 NOLAN
                             (trying to keep up)
                        Wait, where you gonna film from?
                                 REBECCA
                             (calling over the noise)
                        Somewhere near Elm and Houston. 

           He LAUGHS at that -- she stops, spins on him, his smile dies.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’m sorry... Whole plaza’s full. 
                        People been there since this 
                        morning.  

           Rebecca stares at him, hadn’t accounted for that. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Pardon the expression, but you 
                        ain’t gonna see shit. 

           EXT. DEALEY PLAZA - HOUSTON AT ELM -- MOMENTS LATER

           ESTABLISHING: For this moment in time, the center of 
           everything in Dallas. Everything in the United States. 

           The Plaza is basically a square of three streets cutting 
           through a slanted park of rolling glass, white concrete 
           public monuments forming the border of its western edge.

           Behind the monuments, the Triple Underpass, entrance to 
           Stemmons Freeway, and the vast railroad yard to the North.  

           People are everywhere. Milling about, waiting, some already 
           cheering, some protesting. All ages, all races, women, men. 

           A snapshot of 1963 America comprises this rapt audience.  

           REBECCA MAKES HER WAY INTO THE PLAZA -- NOLAN following --

           ANGLE ON THE TEXAS BOOK DEPOSITORY -- Its rooftop Hertz 
           electric clock reads 12:13 -- 

           REBECCA quickly jaywalks across the street --

                                 NOLAN
                             (becoming a cop for a 
                              moment)
                        HEY!

           She stops -- Nolan meets her in the center of Houston right 
           before Elm -- a car HONKS at them --

           ANGLE ON THE CAR -- a Dallas patrol vehicle -- 

           BADGE IS BEHIND THE WHEEL. Nolan holds up a hand to the 
           fellow cop without really looking: “Give me a second” --
                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Rebecca)
                        You’re jaywalking. 

                                 REBECCA
                        There’s nowhere. Nowhere good... 

                                 NOLAN
                             (thinking, then:)
                        I know a place. I’ll clear you. No 
                        civilians. Back over there.

           HE POINTS TO THE GRASSY KNOLL -- A hill of green capped by a 
           white concrete peristyle. Abutting the underpass with trees 
           cut across its back, the Depository looming to the east. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        A clear shot. 

           SCREAMS fill the air. Nolan turns. Commotion at the street 
           corner of Elm and Houston. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Just go. Right by the Bryan 
                        monument, by that grassy area. 
                        There’s a wooden fence... You see 
                        any cops, tell them you’re cleared 
                        by Officer Jim Nolan, Oak Cliff 
                        Precinct. Tell them your name. 
                             (pause)
                        Tell them you’re a reporter. 

                                 REBECCA
                        You sure? I don’t wanna get in 
                        trouble--

                                 NOLAN
                        Don’t worry about it. If anyone 
                        gets in trouble, it’ll be me.

           He smiles at her. Her disapproving faces eases up a bit -- 

           NOLAN TAKES OFF toward the disturbance -- Rebecca steps out 
           of the street as the cars pass, watching him run --

           ANGLE ON Nolan as he runs toward the SCREAMING -- He arrives, 
           parts through people gathered into a tight cluster -- 

           A MAN HAS AN EPILEPTIC SEIZURE ON THE GROUND

           Writhing, foaming -- Nolan immediately down next to him, 
           tries to keep him still, hold his head, prevent injury -- 
                                 FEMALE ONLOOKER
                        What’s wrong with him?

           A MOTORCYCLE COP pulls up, steps off his bike -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Seizure. 
                             (to second officer)
                        Call an ambulance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF OF DAL-TEX BUILDING -- SAME

           ACROSS THE STREET from the Book Depository -- a seven story 
           building in Dealey Plaza -- 

           DOOR SWINGS OPEN -- QUICK FOOTSTEPS across the loose gravel 
           and black tar -- TWO MEN walk directly to the ledge --

           THEIR VIEW: 

           HIGH ABOVE THE PARADE -- the entire plaza below -- Looking 
           straight down Elm toward the Triple Underpass -- 

           ANGLE ON one man in a dark jacket, sandy hair, square face, 
           very serious -- Let’s call him NUMBER TWO -- he holds 
           BINOCULARS in his hands --

           ANGLE ON the man next to him, older, shorter -- FEDORA angled 
           low, RATTY COAT pulled tight -- Let’s call him NUMBER THREE -- 
           he has a WALKIE-TALKIE in his hand -- 

                                 NUMBER THREE
                             (into walkie-talkie)
                        In position.

                                 BARSTOW (V.O.)
                             (through walkie)
                        --Hold secure...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - STOCKADE FENCE -- SAME

           Overlooking the knoll, a corner of the plaza monument, Elm 
           Street below. Trees shade the immediate area. 

           THE PATROL CAR PULLS INTO THE LOT -- BADGE steps out -- like 
           clockwork -- heading right to the fence -- 
           REBECCA pulls out her camera as DISTANT CHEERING erupts from 
           far up Main Street. She braces her arms on the wooden fence:

           MATTE -- REBECCA’S POV

           Through her camera’s viewer. She pans down Elm. A pretty good 
           angle, but best right in front of her -- 

                                 BARSTOW (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

           REBECCA looks up from her camera. Barstow has one hand on her 
           arm while the other displays a billfold of credentials 
           identifying himself as a Secret Service agent.  

                                 BARSTOW (CONT’D)
                        You can’t be back here.

                                 REBECCA
                        Oh... I’m a reporter. Rebecca 
                        Harper, cleared by Officer Jim 
                        Nolan-- 

                                 BARSTOW
                        I don’t care, get outta here.

           HE PULLS HER AWAY FROM THE FENCE VIOLENTLY  --

           She stumbles back -- stares for a single second -- 

           BADGE APPROACHES in his uniform-- her eyes go to his badge -- 
           THE NUMBER ON IT: 1019 --

           REBECCA turns and leaves, unsure of what just happened...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           MATTE -- CAMERA LENS

           LONG ANGLE, watching REBECCA from across the street as she 
           makes her way down the grassy knoll -- the dark figures of 
           BARSTOW AND BADGE behind, on the other side of the fence --

           LENS FOLLOWS REBECCA as she glances behind her, walking --

           PHOTO SNAP --

           PHOTO SNAP --

           PHOTO SNAP --

           REVEAL NUMBER ONE holding the CAMERA -- the man in Barstow’s 
           car from earlier -- standing on the OTHER SIDE OF ELM -- 
           HE WALKS OFF -- SNAPPING photos of everything, as if 
           attempting to capture every face in Dealey Plaza -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DEALEY PLAZA - HOUSTON AT ELM -- SAME

           An ambulance pulls away, SIRENS going as onlookers watch --  

           ANGLE ON Nolan trotting away from the scene -- Even more 
           people in the plaza now, CHEERING, a buzz of excitement -- 

           He looks to the knoll, sees Rebecca walking down the grass --

           ON THE KNOLL -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Hey, where you goin’? 

           DISTANT CHEERS closer now as the motorcade nears -- Rebecca 
           glares at him -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        Thanks a lot, Jim! I just got 
                        strong-armed by the goddamned 
                        Secret Service!

                                 NOLAN
                        What? There’s not any--

           But she hurries ACROSS ELM STREET past him to...

           THE PLAZA GRASS, quickly fixing her camera -- FINDS HER ANGLE 
           as the CHEERS become ROARS -- 

           ANGLE ON THE MOTORCADE entering the sunlight at Main Street 
           and Houston -- cycle engines REVVING, the lead cars turning -- 

           ANGLE ON Nolan about to go after her, but he stops, sees -- 

           THE MOTORCADE MAKING ITS WAY DOWN HOUSTON TOWARD ELM

           Sun-glitter of ticker tape -- cadre of motorcycle officers -- 
           Nolan can barely make out JACKIE KENNEDY’s pink dress...

           BEHIND THE STOCKADE FENCE ON THE KNOLL:

           BARSTOW on a walkie-talkie, watching the motorcade approach --

           BADGE KNEELS DOWN AND OPENS THE TOOL KIT -- 

           ASSEMBLES A POWERFUL BLACK RIFLE IN SECONDS -- 
                                 BARSTOW
                             (into walkie-talkie)
                        Awaiting All-Clear... 

           ROOF OF THE DAL-TEX BUILDING:

           At the ledge, NUMBER TWO scans the plaza with BINOCULARS -- 

           MATTE -- BINOCULARS:

           FOCUSING ON the back of the MOTORCADE -- the PRESIDENT’S 
           LIMOUSINE -- No rear security detail -- WIDE OPEN -- 

           NUMBER TWO lowers his binocs -- nods once: AFFIRMATIVE --

           NUMBER THREE SPEAKS INTO HIS WALKIE-TALKIE --

                                 NUMBER THREE
                             (calm, focused)
                        Green. Green. 

           ELM STREET:

           PEOPLE SWARM THE SIDEWALKS AS THE MOTORCADE TURNS

           NOLAN looks to the Hertz clock on top of the Depository --

           THE TIME READS 12:29... THEN 12:30...

           CHEERING, CALLING OUT --

           ANGLE ON REBECCA FILMING, eye jammed into the viewfinder --

           MATTE -- REBECCA’S FILM

           GRAINY 8MM FILM captures the motorcade as it passes in front 
           of the Book Depository, headed toward the GRASSY KNOLL --

           ANGLE ON NOLAN watching, people CHEERING --  A few yards in 
           front of him, to his left -- the motorcade approaching -- 

           SOMEONE IN A DARK COAT OPENS AN UMBRELLA -- Nolan sees the 
           BLACK CANOPY FABRIC -- the BROWN WOOD CURVE of the handle --

           THE CRACK OF ENGINE BACKFIRE echoes out -- Nolan LOOKS LEFT --

           BIRDS FLY FROM THE ROOF OF THE BOOK DEPOSITORY

           BEHIND THE STOCKADE FENCE ON THE KNOLL:

           BADGE BRACES HIS RIFLE ON THE WOOD, TRAILS THE MOTORCADE

            -- Eye carefully trained in the sight -- 
           -- Finger on the trigger -- 

           -- Sunlight glinting off his DALLAS BADGE -- 

           ELM STREET:

           A SECOND DISTANT CRACK DISTINGUISHES ITSELF FROM THE CROWD

           GOVERNOR CONNOLLY’S YELL OF PAIN -- it draws Nolan back to 
           the motorcade -- now RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM -- 

           THE PRESIDENT’S ARMS AND ELBOWS RAISE, HANDS TO THE THROAT

           NOLAN -- eyes wide, mouth open, realizing what’s happening -- 

           HE TAKES ONE WEAK STEP TOWARD THE MOTORCADE -- 

           BEHIND THE STOCKADE FENCE ON THE KNOLL:

           CLOSE ON BADGE AIMING HIS RIFLE -- 

           -- Less than a second lapses --

           -- FINGER PULLS THE TRIGGER -- 

           A THIRD DEAFENING SHOT --

           -- Rifle DISCHARGES against Badge’s shoulder -- 

           -- SHELL EJECTS OUT --

           -- SHOCK OF SMOKE -- 

           ELM STREET:

           ON NOLAN AS EVERYTHING GOES TO COMPLETE SILENCE.

           PEOPLE’S FACES IN THE PLAZA:

           A man with his son on his shoulders.

           Women in front of the Book Depository.

           NUMBER ONE, camera in hand, watching. Emotionless. 

           A SECRET SERVICE AGENT RUNS TO THE MOTORCADE, CLIMBS ON

           Pushes Jackie back to her seat as the car ROARS AWAY -- 

           BEHIND THE STOCKADE FENCE ON THE KNOLL:

           Badge hands the rifle to Barstow -- Barstow crouches, begins 
           disassembly -- 
           ANGLE ON REBECCA FILMING -- She looks up slowly, stunned --

           REBECCA’S POV -- THE STOCKADE FENCE

           BEHIND IT, BADGE -- he looks DIRECTLY at her amidst a 
           lingering haze of smoke -- SIRENS WAILING NOW -- 

           ANGLE ON NOLAN -- PEOPLE RUN PAST HIM -- He draws HIS GUN --

           RUNS FAST UP THE KNOLL -- no idea what he’s running to, just 
           running --

           EXT. GRASSY KNOLL - STOCKADE FENCE -- CONTINUOUS

           BADGE BENDS DOWN -- picks the single shell casing out of the 
           gravel, puts it in his pocket -- efficient -- task complete --

           BARSTOW DEFTLY CLOSES THE TOOL KIT -- His hands covered in 
           black grease -- hands the kit to Badge, who calmly walks it 
           back toward the parking lot -- practiced, clean -- 

           NOLAN CHARGES UP THE HILL -- Comes around the fence -- 
           running at such a speed that he PLOWS INTO BARSTOW -- 

                                 BARSTOW
                        Secret Service! Secret Service! 
                        This area’s cordoned off! Turn 
                        around and go back the way you 
                        came!

                                 NOLAN
                        THE PRESIDENT’S JUST BEEN SHOT!

                                 BARSTOW
                        LISTEN, GO BACK the way you came, 
                        you’re interfering with federal--

           AND THEY RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER. Nolan’s eyes narrow -- Barstow 
           backs off somewhat --  his hands come up -- Nolan sees the 
           GREASE ON THEM -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        You FBI or you Secret Service?!

                                 AGENT
                        I’M WITH THE SECRET SERVICE, PUT 
                        THE GUN AWAY NOW!

           Confusion in Nolan’s face -- BEYOND BARSTOW, BADGE CLOSES AN 
           OPEN TRUNK -- Nolan makes eye contact with the cop -- No 
           recognition -- 

           Nolan steps back. Holsters his gun. 
                                 BARSTOW
                        Now get outta here before I--

           NOLAN PULLS BARSTOW’S TIE, PUNCHES HIM TWICE IN THE FACE

           It’s quick, fierce -- sends Barstow swiftly to the gravel of 
           the parking lot -- 

           BADGE WALKS OFF TOWARD THE RAILROAD YARD AT A QUICK PACE

           Nolan immediately gives chase -- 

           EXT. RAIL YARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan runs at top speed as Badge easily disappears into -- 

           A SMALL MAZE OF BOXCARS, parked in the dusty area around the 
           tracks -- 

           Nolan slows down -- pulls his gun -- puts himself up against 
           the side of one of the boxcars -- inches toward its edge -- 

           THE SCRATCH OF GRAVEL -- possibly footsteps? -- Nolan looks 
           wildly from left to right -- tries to catch his breath --

           HE SWINGS OUT FROM THE BOXCAR, GUN POINTED FORWARD

           Nothing there. Swings THE OTHER WAY -- nothing there, either. 

           HE BACKS UP against the boxcar’s rear door -- continues to 
           slide around -- gun up by his face -- 

           HE SWINGS OUT AGAIN -- BUT BADGE CATCHES HIS GUN

           Wrestles it from Nolan’s hand -- NOLAN DISARMED as Badge 
           knocks the gun to the tracks -- GRIPS Nolan’s forearms -- 

           BADGE’S FACE IS BLANK, A DEAD STARE INTO NOLAN’S EYES

           Nolan SHAKES with physical exertion...

           THROWS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND TWISTS HIS WEIGHT FORWARD

           A trained move -- hand-to-hand combat 101 -- it sends Badge 
           OVER HIM into the dirt -- Both men scramble to their feet -- 

           NOLAN THROWS A FULL-BODY CROSS PUNCH, BADGE DEFLECTS IT

           Whatever Badge’s training, it’s even better...

           BADGE PUNCHES NOLAN IN THE THROAT -- 

           -- BRINGS A KNEE INTO NOLAN’S CHEST -- 
           The moves like lightning -- air knocked from Nolan’s lungs -- 

           BADGE TOSSES NOLAN ONTO THE TRACKS

           Nolan HITS HIS HEAD on the thick metal rail -- OUT COLD -- 

           BADGE PULLS HIS SERVICE WEAPON, AIMS AT NOLAN’S HEAD

           BARSTOW -- nose bloody -- appears next to him -- LOWERS the 
           false cop’s wrist -- 

                                 BARSTOW
                        No collaterals in the operation 
                        zone. 

           Barstow flips Nolan over with a foot --

           BADGE KNEELS DOWN -- gets a good look at Nolan’s face -- 
           pulls HIS KNIFE from his boot -- reads his name bar:

                                 BADGE
                             (French accent)
                        Nolan. 

                                 BARSTOW
                        Badge number 527. 

                                 BADGE
                             (looking up at Barstow)
                        There was a woman. Filming.

                                 BARSTOW
                        I have her name.

           SIRENS FILL THE AIR -- Barstow looks --

           POLICE AND PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS -- Some thirty yards off -- 
           canvassing the whole area -- coming CLOSER -- 

                                 BARSTOW (CONT’D)
                        We have to go. Now. There’ll be a 
                        better opportunity for him. 

           The men walk off in separate directions.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TEXAS BOOK DEPOSITORY -- SAME

           A COMMOTION of people -- onlookers, reporters, police, 
           plainclothes law enforcement -- people pushing to get in, 
           others trying to get out --
                                 ONLOOKER (O.S.)
                        ...shots came from in there!

           THE MOTORCYCLE COP RUSHES UP THE STEPS, GUN DRAWN  --

           It’s the cop who helped Nolan with the seizure victim -- 

           INT. TEXAS BOOK DEPOSITORY - LUNCH ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Oswald trots down stairs, pulls himself together -- puts on 
           his best nonchalance -- approaches a vending machine --

           PUTS A COIN IN, A COKE BOTTLE ROLLS DOWN -- He pulls the cap 
           off on the machine’s opener -- 

                                 MOTORCYCLE COP (O.S.)
                        HEY!

           OSWALD TURNS AROUND -- sees the cop standing in the lunch 
           room doorway -- GUN POINTED RIGHT AT HIM -- OSWALD FREEZES --

           THE BUILDING MANAGER JOINS THE OFFICER -- sees Oswald -- the 
           cop doesn’t take his eyes off Lee as he says:

                        Do you know this man?

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Yes--

                                 MOTORCYCLE COP
                        Does he work here?

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        Yes, he works for me.

           THE OFFICER LOWERS HIS GUN -- heads off with the older man up 
           the stairs -- 

           OSWALD TAKES A SIP OF COKE -- his hand SHAKING...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- SAME

           A burly man lost in his mid 40’s stands in front of his 
           students. The years on his face, time in his cool gray eyes 
           betray a quiet wisdom and distant worry. This is FRANK. 

           Several of the students--boys and girls--are crying. Others 
           stare at their desks, numb. 
                                 FRANK
                             (solemn)
                        School is dismissed for the rest of 
                        the afternoon. Go home and be with 
                        your families. 

           The kids slowly gather their things, shuffle out of the 
           classroom, still sniffling. As they open the door, an aging 
           SCHOOL SECRETARY steps inside.

                                 SCHOOL SECRETARY
                        I’m sorry to interrupt, but... 
                        there’s a police officer here who 
                        would like to speak with you?

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Frank walks out past the students being picked up by parents. 

           He reaches a Dallas patrol car -- BADGE is standing there. 

                                 FRANK
                        You’re not supposed to be here.

           Badge says nothing.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t even know how you found 
                        this place.

           Again, nothing from Badge. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (in perfect French)
                        <Are you here to make things 
                        difficult for me? Because I can 
                        also make things difficult for 
                        you.>

                                 BADGE
                        There is a man--an officer--and a 
                        woman--

                                 FRANK
                        I’m aware. Is this why you came?

                                 BADGE
                        I came to say I won’t charge you 
                        extra for additional work.
                             (pause)
                        Is the package wrapped yet?
                                 FRANK
                        I’m on my way now. Poor bastard 
                        probably thinks he shot him. 
                             (pause)
                        You will find these people?

           Badge says nothing. Gets into his patrol car -- drives off. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAIL YARD -- LATER

           Nolan sitting awake on the train tracks. Wincing, holding his 
           head. He lets out some gasps for air. Overcome with emotion --

           COPS CANVAS THE LOT IN THE DISTANCE WITH SHOTGUNS -- 

           Nolan rubs his face. Finally regains some composure. Pushes 
           himself to standing, stumbles back toward Dealey Plaza --  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TEXAS BOOK DEPOSITORY - FIRST FLOOR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Nolan steps into chaos. Police, sheriffs, FBI everywhere 
           trying to keep people out of the building.

                                 CURTIS (O.S.)
                        Jimmy.

           Nolan turns around to see Curtis. The older officer is 
           worrisome, like he’s just seen a ghost. He pushes Nolan away 
           from the action into a quieter hallway:

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        Where the HELL you been--

                                 NOLAN
                        I chased someone. Someone in a cop 
                        uniform. Dressed like you and me, I 
                        chased him through the rail yard.

           Curtis takes it in, face filling with dread. 

                                 CURTIS
                        Jimmy, they’re lookin’ for you. 
                        Curry got word you attacked a 
                        Secret Service agent--

                                 NOLAN
                        No, goddammit, listen, it was that 
                        FBI jackal from yesterday--
                                 CURTIS
                        Jimmy, you’re walkin’ an awfully 
                        fine line--

                                 NOLAN
                        Curtis, I saw two men--

           CURTIS PUSHES NOLAN AGAINST THE WALL -- NOLAN PUSHES BACK -- 
           too hard -- his anger getting the best of him --

           CURTIS puts a hand on his shoulder -- WALKS HIM BACK TO THE 
           WALL -- holds him there:

                                 CURTIS
                        TAKE IT EASY. Now look, I know 
                        you’re hot right now. Your blood’s 
                        boilin’. Mine is, too. But you’re 
                        in deep shit, you understand? You 
                        struck a federal officer, I don’t 
                        care what kind. And you been radio 
                        silent for over an hour.
                             (pause)
                        You’re outta chances. Dallas PD is 
                        your last one. You wanna get booted 
                        out of another uniform?
                             (quieter)
                        We’re picking up guys all over the 
                        plaza for questioning...

                        ...but they’re saying the shots 
                        came from inside this building.

                        That’s bullshit--

                                 CURTIS (V.O.)
                        You got to relax. Everything is

                                 CURTIS (V.O.)
                        We got the gun. We got the bullet. 
                        Now we just need the man. 

           -- On an OLDER POLICE SERGEANT, talking to NUMBER ONE, NUMBER 
           TWO, and NUMBER THREE in the rail yard lot -- their posture 
           now slouched, unaware, INNOCENT -- as if playing characters --

                        originally, sir.

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Well, where you boys employed at? 
                        Where you stayin’?

                        Jus’ passin’ through on the rails, 
                        sir. Stayed at the rescue mission 
                        last night... Why? What’s goin’ on?

           The SERGEANT EYES THEM -- then:

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        All right. Get outta here, then.

           The men STROLL AWAY from police -- released from custody -- 
           FREE TO GO -- their steely, observant natures returning --

                                 CURTIS (V.O.)
                        Look at me, son.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Nolan meets Curtis’ eyes.

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna get him.

           Curtis holds him against the wall for a moment, then leaves. 

           NOLAN’S POV -- Curtis passes two men in shirts and ties 
           setting up a small movie camera -- loading it with film. 
           CLOSE ON THE FILM as something clicks in Nolan’s head -- he 
           quickly walks out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT - DARKROOM -- LATER

           The small bathroom has been converted into a makeshift photo 
           lab. Very bare bones, chemicals in the bathtub, the window 
           blacked out, the only illumination a dim red. 

           REBECCA carefully clips dripping 8mm film to the shower line. 
           Then turns on a blow dryer to remove moisture.

           LATER, Rebecca winds the film onto a plastic spool. 

           A MUTED KNOCK on the front door startles her. 

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Rebecca goes to the front door, film in hand. Opens it.

           ANGLE ON Nolan standing in the entryway. 

                                 NOLAN
                        How are you?

                                 REBECCA
                        That’s a hell of a question.

           She steps aside and he walks into the apartment. It’s a small 
           and humble place, some things still in boxes. 

           SHE PLACES THE FILM ON THE COUNTER.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you said I never had to 
                        talk to you again. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Tell me what you saw back behind 
                        the fence.

           EXT. TENTH STREET -- SAME

           A Dallas patrol black and white cruises through the Patton 
           Avenue intersection in a quiet Oak Cliff neighborhood. Only 
           going about ten miles an hour. 
           INT. BLACK AND WHITE #10 -- CONTINUOUS

           At the wheel, officer J.D. Tippit. Calm, on his beat.

           Tippit drives for a few more moments. Peers at something 
           through his windshield...

           TIPPIT’S POV -- UP TENTH STREET

           In the far distance, a man in a beige jacket walks toward the 
           squad car with his head down --

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan and Rebecca talk. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Did you get his name?

                                 REBECCA
                        No.

                                 NOLAN
                        And the police officer?

                                 REBECCA
                        I saw him, but from far away. The 
                        second time I saw him...
                             (pause)
                        It was right after the shooting. He 
                        was behind the fence. 
                             (pause)
                        And... and there was smoke around 
                        him. A blue haze. 
           INT. BLACK AND WHITE #10 -- CONTINUOUS

           Tippit continues to drive forward slowly -- watches the man 
           come closer... closer -- 

           The man LOOKS UP -- sees the police car in front of him -- 
           TURNS AROUND, begins to walk in the OTHER DIRECTION, away --

           ANGLE ON Tippit -- he rolls the black and white forward, 
           accelerating, following him -- 

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan and Rebecca.

                                 NOLAN
                        But you’re absolutely sure it was 
                        smoke? You were lookin’ through the 
                        camera, couldn’t it have been some 
                        trick of the light, some kind of--

                                 REBECCA
                             (hard)
                        I know what I saw. There was smoke. 

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE #10 -- CONTINUOUS

           Tippit has pulled up right next to the man. From Tippit’s 
           view out the passenger window, he can only see the man’s 
           chest, waist, notice his hands are in his pockets. 

           The man stops walking -- Tippit likewise slows and stops --

                                 TIPPIT
                        Howdy.

           A beat as the man just stands there. Then he leans down, 
           rests his arms on the open passenger window sill. 

                                 OSWALD
                        Howdy.

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           On Nolan.

                                 NOLAN
                        The film you shot. 

                                 REBECCA
                        I already developed it.
           She looks at him, grim.

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE #10 -- CONTINUOUS

           Oswald continues to lean on the window, nervous, almost 
           trembling -- Tippit observes him -- 

                                 TIPPIT
                        You got a name?

                                 OSWALD
                        Alek. Alek Hiddell.

                                 TIPPIT
                        Where you headed?

                                 OSWALD
                        Just for a walk. 

           A long beat as Tippit and Oswald hold eye contact.

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Rebecca has already set a small projector in place on the 
           coffee table. She finishes spooling the film.

                                 REBECCA
                        Get the lights.

           Nolan walks over, hits a switch, darkening the room. 

           THE PROJECTOR whirs to life, light shooting from the lens...

           ANGLE ON Rebecca and Nolan, side by side, watching...

           THE HOT SQUARE OF LIGHT on the white wall, film ends flipping 
           through until...

           A SHOT OF THE DISTANT MOTORCADE

           Headed down Houston toward Elm.

           An angle never seen before. 

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE #10 -- CONTINUOUS

           Tippit and Oswald. 

                                 OSWALD
                        May I go?
                                 TIPPIT
                        Hold on a second...

           Tippit opens his door, steps out...

           EXT. TENTH STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Tippit exits the car -- hand on the butt of his gun but still 
           calm, almost nonchalant --

           A GUNSHOT --

           LOUD AND CLOSE -- striking Tippit in the stomach before he 
           can even turn around -- 

           ANGLE ON OSWALD AS HE FIRES TWICE MORE

           Hitting Tippit in the right side of his chest, the shoulder --

           TIPPIT FALLS TO THE PAVEMENT 

           Blood already everywhere -- the officer fading from 
           consciousness -- 

           OSWALD STARTS TO WALK AWAY

           Past the back of the squad car -- 

           HE STOPS, TURNS AROUND

           Walks back to where Tippit lay in the street -- 

           WIDE ON TENTH AS OSWALD FIRES ONCE MORE. 

           An EXECUTION SHOT. 

           CLOSE ON Oswald as he turns -- stuffs the gun in his pocket -- 
           walks off at a fast pace --

                                 OSWALD
                             (muttering)
                        Dumb cop... poor dumb cop...

           Oswald breaks into A SPRINTING RUN -- 

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE ON the projection. The film has progressed, the 
           motorcade now full in the frame, the knoll behind it...

                                 NOLAN
                        Any second now...
           REBECCA GASPS -- covers her mouth -- continues to stare -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        Did you see it?

           ON NOLAN’S STUNNED FACE -- 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        That’s the man in the uniform 
                        behind the fence. And the man next 
                        to him... Did you see the muzzle 
                        flash?

                                 NOLAN
                        I saw it. I saw him. I chased him.

                                 REBECCA
                        They killed the--

           SOMEONE KICKS OPEN THE FRONT DOOR

           Nolan and Rebecca turn -- 

           THE FIRST THING NOLAN SEES IS THE GUN

           Held low, a black assault rifle with an extended barrel --

           NOLAN TACKLES REBECCA BEHIND THE COFFEE TABLE

           Just as the GUNMAN FIRES A BURST -- 

           RIPPING UP THE SOFA OVER THEIR HEADS IN A STRAIGHT LINE

           The bullets coming quick in a SILENCED HISS -- 

           A SHOT HITS THE PROJECTOR BASE, BLOWING IT APART

           The film image on the wall GOES DARK -- 

           NOLAN PULLS HIS GUN AND FIRES TWO SHOTS 

           From across the coffee table -- 

           ONE BULLET HITS THE DOOR FRAME, THE SECOND HITS AN ARM

           The gunman grunts in pain -- falls back out of the doorway -- 

           EXT. APARTMENT WALKWAY, 2ND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS

           -- hits the ground, pulls himself against the wall -- it’s 
           BARSTOW -- he holds his bleeding arm -- 
           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- SAME

           Rebecca scrambles across the floor to the shattered 
           projector, pulls the film off, checking it -- 

                                 NOLAN
                             (whispering)
                        C’mon! 

           She frantically spools it up -- hands SHAKING -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        It’s fine, I think it’s fine--

           He pulls her by the shoulder into...

           THE DARKROOM BATHROOM 

           The dim red light still on as Nolan pushes her behind him -- 

           -- HIS GUN READY -- 

           OUTSIDE ON THE WALKWAY

           BARSTOW -- bleeding bad -- TOSSES the rifle away -- pulls a 
           SILENCED PISTOL -- SWINGS LOW INTO THE APARTMENT -- 

           THE LIVING ROOM -- no one in there -- he sees --

           A SLIVER OF RED LIGHT coming from the bathroom -- 

           IN THE BATHROOM:

           NOLAN  peeks out -- sees the killer raise his gun...

           THREE SILENCED SHOTS SHATTER HOLES IN THE WOODEN DOOR

           Rebecca and Nolan duck away -- 

           BARSTOW BARRELS THROUGH THE DOOR

           -- NOLAN GRABS HIM AND THEY STRUGGLE -- 

           THEY FALL HALF INTO THE BATHTUB OF CHEMICALS WITH A SPLASH

           REBECCA looks for a way out -- 

           SHE RIPS THE BLACKOUT CLOTH OFF THE WINDOW

           Spilling WHITE LIGHT into the room -- she wraps the fabric 
           over her arm -- NOLAN AND BARSTOW FIGHT in the tub -- 

           REBECCA PUNCHES THE WINDOW GLASS OUT WITH HER PROTECTED FIST
           Just as Nolan flips on top of Barstow -- HOLDS HIS HEAD UNDER 
           WATER -- NOLAN brings up his gun -- 

           FIRES A SHOT CLOSE RANGE INTO THE WATER

           The chemical bath IMMEDIATELY TURNS RED WITH BLOOD

           REBECCA GASPS, STUNNED AND STARING

           NOLAN. In shock. He just killed a federal agent -- 

           BUT NOLAN WASTES NO TIME -- pulls at Barstow’s suit, raises 
           the dead man out of the water -- eyes OPEN but lifeless --

           NOLAN RUMMAGES THROUGH BARSTOW’S SUIT POCKETS 

           Finds a Secret Service badge, two wet passports. DROPS 
           Barstow back into the tub. 

           Nolan opens the passports -- 

           THE FIRST PASSPORT IS MEXICAN -- contains Barstow’s photo -- 

           THE SECOND PASSPORT IS CUBAN -- contains OSWALD’S PHOTO --

           Lee Harvey, staring back at Nolan. Plain as day. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Jesus Christ...

           POLICE SIRENS OUTSIDE -- Nolan looks up, starts to move to 
           them -- REBECCA grabs him -- 

           REBECCA AND NOLAN make their way out the broken window -- 

           EXT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

           FOLLOWING as Rebecca and Nolan run to her beat-up red Chevy 
           truck -- jump inside and PEEL AWAY -- 

           INT. REBECCA’S TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

           Rebecca drives -- Nolan begins to violently scratch himself --  
           WRITHE in his seat -- the chemicals burning his skin -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        What the hell was in that bathtub?

                                 REBECCA
                        Oh God. Developer and bleach--
                                 NOLAN
                        Goddamn, it’s burnin’...
                             (looking at road)
                        Turn on Tenth, I live right at 
                        Denver...

                                 REBECCA
                        They’re gonna know where you live--

                                 NOLAN
                        They were there for you.

           It hits Rebecca. She looks down to the film spool next to her 
           in the seat -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Stop, this is it.

           Rebecca BRAKES HARD in front of Nolan’s clapboard house --

                                 REBECCA
                        Oh my God. Oh my God--

                                 NOLAN
                        Listen to me. We’re gonna be fine 
                        if we stick together. Just wait 
                        here.

                                 REBECCA
                        We need to go now, they’re gonna--

                                 NOLAN
                        Just. Wait. 

           EXT. NOLAN’S PLACE -- MOMENTS LATER

           He jumps out, trots inside -- GUN DRAWN -- 

           ANGLE ON Rebecca watching him go --  

           Every second is agonizing. She looks in every mirror -- 

           INT. NOLAN’S PLACE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sparse living. He enters, slows down. Gun ready. But the 
           chemicals are really getting to him. Makes his way to -- 

           THE BATHROOM

           Turns the shower on, steps inside fully clothed in his Dallas 
           uniform -- lets the water run down him -- relief and anguish 
           as he POUNDS the tile wall with his fist -- 
           EXT. REBECCA’S TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE ON Rebecca inside... Wildly nervous...

           EVERYONE ON THE STREET is suspicious. She gives everything --
           even a dog BARK -- a second glance -- 

           INT. NOLAN’S PLACE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Nolan rips off the top of his uniform and t-shirt, exposing 
           bare chest and a nasty scar on his abdomen -- pulls on a 
           white t-shirt, a jacket -- throws on jeans over his boots -- 

           GRABS HIS BADGE, PUTS IT IN HIS JEAN POCKET

           OPENS A DRAWER AND PULLS OUT A COUPLE BOXES OF AMMUNITION

           Stuffing them in his jacket -- listening for anything -- 
           watching for any movement the entire time -- 

           EXT. NOLAN’S PLACE -- MOMENTS LATER

           IN THE TRUCK, Rebecca waits for him, every second rattling 
           her nerves just a little more... She glances to the film...

           SHE THROWS THE TRUCK IN GEAR with the column shifter -- ready 
           to take off -- 

           -- but THROWS IT BACK into park. SLAMS the steering wheel in 
           frustration -- 

           NOLAN FINALLY APPEARS -- runs to the truck -- gets in --

                                 REBECCA
                        Took you long enough. 

           She FLOORS IT. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT COMPLEX, 2ND FLOOR -- LATER

           CLOSE ON an OLD WOMAN IN CURLERS being interviewed. 

                                 OLD WOMAN IN CURLERS
                             (thick accent)
                        An’ I heard two loud gunshots next 
                        door, and there was plenty a 
                        commotion, too. Then some glass 
                        broke, like someone dropped a vase 
                        or somethin’.
           REVEAL the person interviewing her... BADGE--still in his 
           Dallas police uniform. 

                                 BADGE
                        Apparently, your neighbor was 
                        cleaning her rifle. It went off 
                        accidentally.

                                 OLD WOMAN IN CURLERS
                        Where you from?

                                 BADGE
                        ...Amarillo.

           INT. REBECCA’S APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Badge walks inside. Steps into...

           THE BATHROOM

           Where Frank stands looking at the floating body in the tub.

                                 BADGE
                        What’s that smell?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s the bleach cooking the skin 
                        off his head.
                             (pause)
                        The passports are gone. 

           Badge cricks his neck. That’s bad. Frank turns to him --

           Grabs a GAS CAN off the sink. Thrusts it in Badge’s arms. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Scratch this place.

           Frank leaves. Badge begins DOUSING THE BATHROOM -- GASOLINE 
           pouring in the tub with Barstow’s corpse -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Footage of WALTER CRONKITE live at his news desk in black and 
           white. He puts his glasses on as he announces:

                        From Dallas, Texas... the flash 
                        apparently official... President

                        minutes ago.

           Cronkite struggles to regain composure after speaking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. REBECCA’S TRUCK -- LATER

           Rebecca drives while Nolan examines Barstow’s Secret Service 
           credentials:

           CLOSE ON THE BILLFOLD -- the badge is real enough -- Nolan 
           slides the ID card out -- SCRATCHES at the Secret Service 
           insignia with his fingernail -- 

           PEELS IT OFF -- revealing an FBI insignia -- That, too, is 
           already faded, peeling away -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        This guy Barstow wasn’t Secret 
                        Service or FBI...

                                 REBECCA
                        What was he?

                                 NOLAN
                        ...I don’t know.

           Nolan picks up OSWALD’S CUBAN PASSPORT -- flips through it -- 
           comes back to the photo -- stares at it --

                                 REBECCA
                        Where am I going?

                                 NOLAN
                        Keep drivin’ South. We need to get 
                        somewhere open and empty. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Jim... maybe it’d be better if we 
                        went our separate ways--

                                 NOLAN
                        Look. This ain’t about me an’ you 
                        right now. I’m just tryin’ to keep 
                        us from gettin’ killed. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TEXAS THEATER -- LATER

           CLOSE ON Oswald sitting in the dark, sweating as the glow of 
           the movie screen turns his face ghostly. 

           SUPER IN BOTTOM CORNER: Texas Theatre, Oak Cliff, 1:48 p.m.

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Lee.

           Oswald JUMPS at the sound of his name -- but he glances back, 
           sees Frank seated behind him -- seems to relax somewhat. 

                                 OSWALD
                        Frank...

                                 FRANK
                        It’s all right, Lee. You did good. 

                                 OSWALD
                        Do you have the passports?

                                 FRANK
                        You’ll get them in Lewisville.

                                 OSWALD
                        I can’t wait that long, I can’t--

           SHHH. Someone doesn’t enjoy talking during the movie. 

                                 FRANK
                             (whispered, in Oswald’s 
                              ear)
                        Getting out of Dallas is impossible 
                        right now, Lee--

                                 OSWALD
                             (shaking head)
                        No--

                                 FRANK
                        A man is coming. He will transport 
                        you to the safe house. Just like we 
                        discussed. Relax, and wait. 

                                 OSWALD
                        I want to get to Cuba. Marina and I 
                        will start a new life. She will 
                        forgive me. We’ll bring the 
                        children...

                                 FRANK
                        The hard part is over, Lee. 
                             (pause)

                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Enjoy the movie. He’ll be here any 
                        minute. You’re home free.

           Frank stands up, walks out of the theater. 

           A few moments go by. Oswald tries to breathe. Relax.

           THE HOUSE LIGHTS FLIP ON -- the movie DISAPPEARS and its 
           SOUNDTRACK DIES OUT -- Oswald looks to the theater doors --

           DALLAS POLICE OFFICERS RUSH IN -- NOT what he expected -- a 
           double-cross -- 

           A sea of blue down both aisles -- CURTIS leads the group on 
           the right side -- a MANAGER points Oswald out to Curtis -- 

           RECOGNITION CROSSES CURTIS’ FACE -- HE HEADS TOWARD OSWALD --

           Oswald won’t even look at him --

                                 OSWALD
                        This is it...

           OSWALD JUMPS TO HIS FEET AND PULLS HIS REVOLVER 

           CURTIS SEIZES THE GUN, WRESTLES WITH HIM AS A SHOT GOES OFF

           CURTIS PUNCHES OSWALD IN THE FACE -- knocking him back into a 
           swarm of Dallas police as CHAOS ENSUES -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FAIR PARK -- NIGHT

           A vast art deco pavilion that speaks to a Texas heyday of 
           thirty years previous. Now the park lies deserted, fountains 
           dry, sidewalks windswept, monuments silent and looming --

           ON REBECCA AND NOLAN: 

           Walking down the empty promenade, moving quickly... 

                                 REBECCA
                        State Fair happens here.

                                 NOLAN
                        Every October. Rest of the time 
                        it’s as quiet as a mouse. 
                             (pause)
                        You ever go as a kid?

           AN ERRANT NOISE draws their attention. After a bit, nothing.
                                 REBECCA
                        You sure we’re safe out in the open 
                        like this?

                                 NOLAN
                        For eleven months of the year this 
                        place doesn’t exist. But it still 
                        has a pay phone. 

           NOLAN REACHES A SET OF PAY PHONES OFF TO THE SIDE

           Rebecca stands close by, not happy -- 

                                 REBECCA
                             (standing)
                        Who you callin’?

                                 NOLAN
                             (picking up receiver)
                        My partner.

           She HANGS IT UP on him. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Jim, this isn’t a grocery store 
                        robbery, okay? We’re talkin’ about 
                        the murder of the President of the 
                        United States.

                                 NOLAN
                             (anger flaring)
                        Exactly. The president is dead. And 
                        your film shows who did it. We have 
                        a duty--

                                 REBECCA
                        We have a duty to not get ourselves 
                        killed! Let’s think this through--

                                 NOLAN
                        If we stay out here on our own, 
                        we’re gonna end up dead. Feel free 
                        to disagree with me, but I’ve got 
                        the gun. 

           A stare off. He picks up the phone, dials. Waits...

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Get me Corporal Curtis. 

           INTERCUT -- NOLAN / CURTIS PHONE CONVERSATION
           INT. DALLAS POLICE HQ -- SAME

           A WATCH COMMANDER hands Curtis the phone. 

                                 CURTIS
                        Jimmy, you better be coolin’ off. 

                                 NOLAN
                        I need to come in.

                                 CURTIS
                        Why?

                                 NOLAN
                        Some stuff has happened, Curtis. 
                        Some... hell, I’ll say it, some 
                        crazy shit. 

                                 CURTIS
                        I know. We got the guy. Right here 
                        in the station. You’re never gonna 
                        believe this... it’s that Oswald 
                        character. 
                             (pause)
                        I guess you were right about that 
                        Fed... I don’t know what to 
                        think...

           Nolan’s face drains somewhat...

           INT. MAKESHIFT BRIEFING ROOM -- SAME

           Cinder block walls, dim lighting -- like a back utility room 
           for some nameless old building -- equipment and gear strewn 
           about -- interconnected with a mess of wires --

           A small telephone SWITCH BOARD sits against the wall -- a 
           hand PLUGS IN A WIRE -- FOLLOW the headphone cords back...

           TO REVEAL FRANK -- listening in on the police phone 
           conversation -- NUMBER ONE next to him -- also listening --

           IN FAIR PARK: 

           Anger, remorse, failure. It buries Nolan in waves. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Send a patrol car to pick me up, 
                        I’m at Fair Park.

                                 CURTIS
                        Fair Park? The hell you doin’ over 
                        there? Listen, let’s meet up 
                        tomorrow, talk it out--

                                 NOLAN
                        Curtis, I’m sittin’ out here in the 
                        cold with an eyewitness to the man 
                        who killed the goddamn president. 

           A long pause. 

                                 CURTIS
                        I’ll put it out. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Keep it quiet. Someone you trust.

                                 CURTIS
                        I’ll come myself--

                                 NOLAN
                        No, stay there. Try to find out 
                        more about this Oswald. 

           Nolan hangs up. He turns to Rebecca.

           Curtis again on the phone:

                             (into phone)
                        I need a unit request from South 
                        Dallas patrol only. I want either 
                        Johnson or my nephew Tommy. 
           INT. MAKESHIFT BRIEFING ROOM -- SAME

           Frank and Number One listen to Curtis’ call on headphones:

                                 CURTIS (V.O.)
                             (through headphones)
                        Have them go to the Fair Park main 
                        gate and await further 
                        instructions.

           Frank UNPLUGS the call -- NUMBER ONE moves over to a POLICE 
           SCANNER and RADIO -- FLIPS A SWITCH to CHANNEL 1 --

           After a moment, Number One picks up the radio --

           Frank FLIPS the radio switch from CHANNEL 1 to CHANNEL 2 -- 
           takes the radio from his cohort:

           INT. BLACK AND WHITE #51 -- CONTINUOUS

           Badge sits in his patrol vehicle. Hand on his radio:

           Nolan and Rebecca walk to her truck some twenty yards away -- 
           It sits parked in front of a row of old black iron bars -- 
           open in the middle -- 

           On either side of Nolan and Rebecca, long and tall pavilion 
           buildings now stand silhouetted in darkness --

                        But what about my truck?

                                 NOLAN
                        It stays. Lot harder to take a shot 
                        at a police car and get away with 
                        it. 
                             (looking at her)
                        It’ll be safe. You got the film?

                                 REBECCA
                             (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, you still got the gun?

           A wry smile from him. She returns it. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Lot different than high school, 
                        ain’t it?

           He checks the ammo in his pistol as they near the gate --

                                 REBECCA
                        Can I ask you something? 
                             (pause)
                        Was that the first person you’d 
                        ever killed?

           He continues to examine his gun -- stalling -- then:

                                 NOLAN
                        As a police officer? Yes.

           A beat. Before she can respond:

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                             (noticing something ahead)
                        Hold up.
           A DALLAS PATROL CAR SITS PARKED AT THE ENTRANCE -- still 
           several yards from them -- partly shaded and quiet -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                             (walking forward)
                        Evenin’...

           No answer. Nolan and Rebecca slow as they reach the car --

           NO ONE INSIDE. Nolan looks around --

           MATTE -- SNIPER SCOPE 

           CROSSHAIRS REST ON NOLAN from an elevated angle -- 

           REVEAL BADGE PERCHED ON THE HIGH GATE WALL IN THE DARKNESS

           Aiming carefully with his rifle -- 

           REBECCA TURNS, SEES A GLIMMER IN THE DARKNESS -- She peers --

           CLOSE ON the dim light REFLECTING against the DALLAS BADGE on 
           the sniper’s uniform -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        JIM!

           Jim turns to her JUST AS A SNIPER BULLET HITS HIS SHOULDER

           KNOCKING HIM to the ground --

                                 NOLAN
                             (to Rebecca)
                        RUN!

           REBECCA FLEES TOWARD THE GATE -- BADGE FIRES AT HER -- 
           BULLETS impact the iron bars, SPARKS shoot off -- 

           NOLAN ROLLS UP ON HIS GOOD ARM -- FIRES HIS OWN GUN at the 
           darkness -- 

           BULLETS RICOCHET AND SPARK AGAINST CONCRETE -- BADGE ducks 
           down to avoid getting shot --  

           NOLAN EMPTIES HIS GUN -- PUSHES HIMSELF TO STANDING -- runs 
           off past the gate -- into the DARKNESS of Fair Park -- 

           BADGE JUMPS DOWN TO THE SIDEWALK -- Falls into a practiced 
           crouch and stands -- Walks to the squad car --

           HE TOSSES THE RIFLE INSIDE -- pulls A SHOTGUN from the 
           passenger well -- calm, icy, as he COCKS the barrel -- 
           HE FOLLOWS THEM into the cloak of night, walking with ease, 
           determination -- 

           EXT. PROMENADE, AUTOMOTIVE BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

           NOLAN CATCHES UP TO REBECCA -- YANKS HER through heavy shadow 
           -- up cement steps -- THROWS HER behind a concrete pillar -- 

           HE PEEKS AROUND THE CORNER -- the SILHOUETTE OF BADGE walking 
           toward them with the shotgun at his side -- 40 yards away -- 

           NOLAN TURNS, SEES HEAVY METAL DOORS IN FRONT OF HIM -- 

                                 NOLAN
                             (whispered)
                        Stay right here.

           NOLAN THROWS HIMSELF AGAINST THE DOORS -- they bend inward 
           but DO NOT OPEN, LOCKED -- 

           BADGE FIRES THE SHOTGUN -- MUZZLE FLASH briefly lighting up 
           his expressionless face in the darkness -- 

           SCATTER SHOT BLASTS CHUNKS OUT OF THE CONCRETE PILLAR -- 
           REBECCA cowers down, squeezes her eyes shut -- 

           NOLAN KICKS THE DOORS -- Nothing --

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Dammit!

           BADGE COCKS, FIRES AGAIN -- BLASTS THE WALL NEXT TO NOLAN -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        JIM, DO SOMETHING!

           BADGE CONTINUES TO WALK TOWARD THEM -- never speeding up -- 

           NOLAN KICKS THE DOORS A SECOND TIME AND THEY GIVE -- SWING 
           WIDE INTO BLACKNESS -- 

           BADGE COCKS HIS SHOTGUN -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        C’MON!

           REBECCA RUSHES FORWARD -- follows NOLAN -- BOTH DISAPPEAR 
           INSIDE JUST AS -- 

           BADGE FIRES AGAIN -- HITS THE PILLAR, DAMAGED DOORS WHERE 
           REBECCA JUST WAS -- He trots up the steps, RELOADING with 
           shells from his pocket -- 
           INT. AUTOMOTIVE BUILDING - MAIN HALL -- CONTINUOUS

           NOLAN AND REBECCA stumble into a VAST SHADOWED HALL the size 
           of an airplane hangar -- stretching a LONG 100 YARDS in both 
           directions -- nearly PITCH BLACK --

                                 REBECCA
                        I can’t see--

                                 NOLAN
                        Hold my hand--

           SHE HESITATES FOR A SPLIT SECOND -- NOLAN notices -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Rebecca!

           SHE GRABS HIS HAND AND THEY RUN LEFT -- No light, no cover, 
           just empty open space -- 

           BADGE’S SILHOUETTE STEPS INSIDE THE HALL -- SHOTGUN braced 
           across his chest -- He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS TO HIS LEFT -- 

           BADGE WALKS AFTER THEM -- FASTER now -- raises the shotgun up 
           and FIRES -- the sound MONSTROUS in the large echoing hall -- 

           COCKS AND FIRES AGAIN as he pursues -- MUZZLE FLASH 
           illuminating the eyes of the killer -- 

           BADGE’S POV -- HE FIRES AGAIN -- THE QUICK FLASH ALSO LIGHTS 
           UP NOLAN AND REBECCA for a half-second -- but then DARKNESS --

           BADGE FIRES TWICE MORE -- WILDLY IN AN ARC -- unable to get 
           an exact read on their position -- 

           NOLAN AND REBECCA RUN -- reaching the END OF THE HALL -- two 
           more DOUBLE DOORS -- 

                                 REBECCA
                             (a mess)
                        ...please be open...

           NOLAN BARRELS THROUGH THE DOORS AND THEY SWING WIDE -- 
           fortunately unlocked as REBECCA FOLLOWS -- 

           INT. AUTOMOTIVE BUILDING - SECOND ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           NOLAN CLOSES THE DOORS BEHIND THEM -- turns around -- 

           Another hangar-sized room, this one about as big as a 
           baseball diamond. Extremely high ceilings with WOODEN BOXES 
           lining the walls -- STACKED HIGH in one particular corner -- 
           THEY GO TO THE BOXES -- NO WAY OUT --

                                 NOLAN
                        Shit. 

           -- NOLAN looks up -- 

           THE CEILING IS A GOOD HUNDRED FEET UP -- NOLAN peers -- 

           CLOSER ON A SQUARE RIM OF LIGHT ON THE CEILING -- in the far 
           corner -- A TRAP DOOR TO THE ROOF -- 

           NOLAN SCRAMBLES UP THE WOODEN BOXES -- GROPES THE WALL --

           FINDS A METAL LADDER BOLTED IN PLACE -- Nolan WHISTLES to 
           REBECCA --

           INSIDE THE SECOND ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER:

           A SHOTGUN BLAST RIPS APART THE DOORS --

           BADGE KICKS OPEN THE BROKEN WOOD -- CRACKING it further as he 
           steps inside -- SHOTGUN AIMED and ready to fire -- 

           HE SWINGS THE BARREL AROUND THE ROOM -- 

           It’s empty. He walks to the boxes -- 

           ANGLE ON NOLAN AND REBECCA HIGH ABOVE HIM -- CLINGING 
           desperately and silently to the ladder -- She’s above Nolan, 
           he’s below her -- both of them LOOKING DOWN at Badge -- 

           CLOSE ON NOLAN’S BLEEDING SHOULDER -- soaked wet -- almost 
           reflective in the dimness -- 

           BLOOD POOLING, ABOUT TO DRIP OFF -- 

           BADGE TURNS AROUND -- away from the boxes -- where are they?

           BEHIND BADGE -- BLOOD DRIPS onto one of the boxes -- almost 
           audibly IMPERCEPTIBLE -- running down the side in a DARK RED 
           STREAK -- 

           ANOTHER DROP. ANOTHER DROP. Quiet TAPS against the wood.

           CLOSE ON BADGE -- he doesn’t turn around -- SLOWLY raises his 
           eyes to the ceiling -- 

           REBECCA SHAKES SILENTLY AGAINST THE LADDER BARS -- trying to 
           hold still, not breathe, her muscles exhausted -- 

           BADGE STORMS OUT OF THE ROOM

           The doors SHUT behind him. 
           ON NOLAN AND REBECCA as they wait a moment --

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                             (still quiet)
                        Okay, go...

           They make their way up the ladder -- 

           EXT. AUTOMOTIVE BUILDING - ROOF -- MOMENTS LATER

           THE TRAP DOOR SWINGS OPEN -- Rebecca, Nolan crawl out of the 
           dark hole, deposit themselves on the roof --

           NOLAN crawls over to the building’s edge -- 

           LOOKING OUT OVER THE REST OF FAIR PARK -- 

           Still night. Nothing but wide open spaces. Kill zones. 

           He sees --

           REBECCA’S TRUCK still sitting by the main gate -- about 300 
           yards away -- THE PATROL CAR still near it -- 

           REBECCA NOTICES NOLAN’S ARM -- SOAKED in blood by now -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        Jim. Jim, you’re shot--

                                 NOLAN
                        I think your truck is the only way 
                        outta here...

           THE PATROL CAR COMES TO LIFE -- headlights FLASH on -- it 
           waits there a moment, then pulls away -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        He’s leaving!

                                 NOLAN
                        Maybe. We’re gonna wait. 

           They watch the spot carefully. 

           EXT. FAIR PARK - MAIN GATE -- LATER 

           THE TRUCK RESTS ALONE by the turn-in area. 

           NOLAN AND REBECCA NOW WAIT IN THE SHADOWS -- watching it from 
           a ways off -- 
                                 NOLAN
                        I’ll drive. An’ when I say ‘go,’ 
                        you go, understand?

                                 REBECCA
                        You think I’m gonna take a walk in 
                        the park?

           A beat. Nolan waits. Then:

                                 NOLAN
                        Go. 

           THEY SPRINT TO THE TRUCK -- NOLAN makes it inside -- REBECCA 
           a few steps behind -- 

           NOLAN STARTS IT UP -- HEADLIGHTS SUDDENLY IGNITE ON THEM --

           THE DALLAS PATROL CAR LIES SHADOWED IN THE DARK -- 

                                 REBECCA
                             (freezing)
                        Oh, SHIT--

           REBECCA THROWS HERSELF INTO THE TRUCK BED -- 

           NOLAN FLOORS THE TRUCK --

           BADGE FLOORS THE PATROL CAR --

           For a split second both cars are in a GAME OF CHICKEN -- 
           about to smash head-on ANY MOMENT --

           NOLAN JERKS THE WHEEL LEFT -- the truck VEERS into the park --

           BADGE JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT -- fishtailing -- in PURSUIT -- 

           BOTH CARS RACE DOWN THE NARROW PROMENADE --

           BADGE PULLS AHEAD -- SOON THE CARS RACE NECK AND NECK -- 

           BARELY fitting in the small walkways -- 

           REBECCA SLIDES AROUND IN THE TRUCK BED -- tries to contain 
           her SCREAMS -- 

           BADGE JERKS HIS WHEEL LEFT, SMASHING INTO THE TRUCK

           NOLAN tries to keep control -- 

           Ahead of them, A DEAD END of brick, buildings --

           NOLAN JERKS RIGHT, PUSHES THE SQUAD CAR AWAY -- 
           BADGE has to adjust right -- running out of road -- 

           THE SQUAD CAR ROARS UP PAVILION STAIRS -- GOING TOO FAST -- 

           -- LEFT WHEEL CATCHES WRONG AND THE CAR FLIPS --

           -- CORKSCREWS IN THE AIR -- 

           -- HITS THE PROMENADE WALKWAY GRILL FIRST --

           -- STANDS UP PERPENDICULAR TO THE SIDEWALK FOR A SECOND -- 

           -- FLIPS BACK ONTO ITS WHEELS -- 

           -- ROLLS BACKWARDS TO A STOP --

           Finishing a kind of violent vehicular cartwheel -- 

           NOLAN BURIES THE FRONT END OF THE TRUCK INTO A FOUNTAIN --

           -- THE TRUCK SPINS AROUND -- 

           -- REBECCA THROWN BACK AGAINST THE TRUCK BED WALL --

           -- THE TRUCK SKIDS TO A STOP -- 

           For a few seconds, silence in the park. 

           INSIDE THE PATROL CAR -- BADGE, bleeding from the head -- 
           GETS OUT -- PISTOL in one hand -- SHOTGUN in the other -- 
           WALKS calmly to the truck -- A good THIRTY YARDS away -- 

           INSIDE THE TRUCK -- NOLAN shakes off the accident -- tries to 
           TURN OVER the engine as it MOANS -- 

           ON BADGE: 

           RAISES THE PISTOL UP AND FIRES, BLOWING THE TRUCK’S BACK 
           GLASS WINDOW OUT -- 

           BADGE EMPTIES HIS GUN -- FIVE SHOTS --  TWENTY YARDS AWAY --

           -- REBECCA STAYS DOWN INSIDE THE TRUCK BED -- 

           ON NOLAN -- turning the engine OVER AND OVER -- 

           ON BADGE -- TOSSING AWAY HIS SERVICE REVOLVER -- empty and 
           worthless to him -- keeps walking forward -- 

           -- HE RAISES THE SHOTGUN -- 

           -- FIRES ONCE -- TWICE -- THREE TIMES -- AGAIN --

           -- PAINT, METAL FLYING OFF THE TRUCK -- TEN YARDS AWAY --  
           ON NOLAN -- ducking down -- the engine turns over -- ROARS TO 
           LIFE -- NOLAN SLAMS DOWN ON THE GAS PEDAL -- TIRES SQUEAL --

           -- BADGE FIRES TWICE MORE --

           THE TRUCK RACES AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE STREET -- 

           Disappears around a corner.

           BADGE stands in the middle of Fair Park. Jaw clenched.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARBEQUE JOINT -- SAME

           Quintessential Texas eatery. Like a converted tool shed 
           turned into a place that serves up smoked meat. Neon beer 
           signs, HANK WILLIAMS on the radio. 

           ANGLE ON FRANK seated against a foggy cracked window at a 
           table, plate of greasy food in front of him. 

           ANGLE ON a few tables behind him -- NUMBER ONE watches the 
           door, meal untouched -- TWO glances back at Frank over his 
           shoulders from another table -- 

           THREE watches Frank from the counter --

           STAY ON FRANK as he talks to someone seated across from him:

                                 FRANK
                        So this boy locked up at the 
                        station downtown. He looks great on 
                        paper. Terrible at conversation. 
                        You know what I mean? 
                             (pause)
                        He was supposed to come out of that 
                        theater horizontally. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        That’s not my problem. I’m just 
                        eyes and ears. That was the deal.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, the deal has changed. You owe 
                        a lot of people a lot of money.
                             (pause)
                        Now I can help you with that. But 
                        there’s a trade-off. 
                             (pause)
                        I’d hate to see you lose your 
                        clubs. Without your clubs, who are 
                        you to anybody in this town?
           THREE TEENAGE BOYS approach them -- normal kids, if a little 
           shell-shocked from recent events -- Frank switches gears...

                                 TEENAGE BOY 1
                        Hey, Mr. Bishop...

                                 FRANK
                        How you boys holding up?

                                 TEENAGE BOY 2
                        Fine, I guess...

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t worry. This country’s strong. 
                        We’ll get past this. 
                             (pause)
                        We’re still going to have that test 
                        next Tuesday. 

                                 TEENAGE BOY 3
                        Yeah, we been studyin’...

                                 FRANK
                        Good boys. I’ll see you next week 
                        at school. 

           He nods to the boys and they leave -- 

           REVEAL THE MAN ACROSS FROM FRANK -- early 50’s, black suit, 
           balding -- nervous and squirrelly -- He spins a GRAY FEDORA 
           with one hand on the table in front of him -- 

           JACK RUBY. 

                                 RUBY
                             (weak smile)
                        Mr. Bishop, huh?

           Frank stands, wipes his mouth with a napkin. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’m nobody to you, Jack. Just like 
                        you’re nobody to me. 
                             (tosses napkin down)
                        You’ve got 36 hours to put it 
                        together. 

           Frank leaves as Ruby continues to spin his hat on the table. 

           ANGLE ON ONE, TWO, THREE -- watching Ruby for a moment -- 
           then they rise and exit after Frank.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- LATER

           No way around it: a rough area. Rundown warehouses, a couple 
           of junkies shivering in doorways. But considering the recent 
           danger, it’s relatively nice and quiet. 

           REBECCA AND NOLAN arrive in front of one such warehouse. 
           Nolan is clearly in a lot of pain, the shot to his shoulder 
           looking worse. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Thought we were headed somewhere 
                        safe... 

                                 NOLAN
                        Safest place to hide is the hole 
                        you crawl into.

                                 REBECCA
                        Yeah, but this is a shithole...

           Nolan KNOCKS on a door. It opens, a tall junkie with hollow 
           eyes named WAYLON (24) answers the door. 

                                 WAYLON
                             (recognizing him)
                        Jim? 

                                 NOLAN
                        Waylon.

                                 WAYLON
                        You been shot. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Yeah. One reason we’re here. 

                                 WAYLON
                        What’s the other?

                                 NOLAN
                        Need a place to stay. Just for the 
                        night. 

           A moment as Waylon looks them over. Finally lets them in. 

           INT. SMALL BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Waylon leads them into a tiny room. Cot on the floor. This 
           used to be a warehouse office maybe thirty years ago.

                                 WAYLON
                        Shower’s in the back. 
                                 NOLAN
                        I know.

                                 WAYLON
                        Thought you were doin’ better.

                                 NOLAN
                        Thought I was, too. 
                             (pause)
                        Thanks, Waylon.

           Waylon nods, leaves them alone. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Friend of yours?

                                 NOLAN
                        You could say that. I used to live 
                        here. 

           Nolan takes his jacket off, RIPS the sleeve clean -- reaches 
           under the cot, pulls out a dusty BOTTLE OF VODKA -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Right where I left it. 

                                 REBECCA
                        You really think now’s a good time 
                        for a drink? 

                                 NOLAN
                        Haven’t had a drink in four months.

           Nolan pulls his t-shirt off -- Rebecca sees the SCAR on his 
           abdomen -- FRESH BULLET WOUND in his shoulder -- Nolan sees 
           her staring -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Went clean through... Should be 
                        fine...

           Nolan pours the vodka over the wound -- GRUNTS through 
           gritted teeth in extreme pain -- calms down -- sits back 
           against the wall and closes his eyes for a moment. 

           Rebecca stares at him. He’s shirtless, lit from behind by a 
           raw bulb desk lamp. The sharp contours of his body. 

           Nolan hands Rebecca the sleeve of his jacket --  

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Tie this around, will ya? As tight 
                        as you can make it. 
           She wraps the fabric around the wound -- pulling it TIGHT -- 
           he GRUNTS again -- Both of them realize their close proximity 
           to each other -- 

           REBECCA walks away -- sits in a chair facing the cot -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        Growin’ up in the neighborhood, you 
                        were always nice, good to my folks. 
                        I didn’t pay you too much mind. 
                             (pause)
                        But by the time I got to high 
                        school... Lord almighty. There you 
                        were, this red-blooded All-American 
                        running back senior.

           The nostalgia fades from her face. 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        So what happened to you? 

                                 NOLAN
                        Nothin’ that needs talkin’ about.

                                 REBECCA
                        When you came back from the 
                        service. Somethin’ changed. 

           His casual demeanor drops. His face goes dark.

                                 NOLAN
                        I was stationed out of Fort Hood. 
                        Okay Marine. Clean bunk, good shot, 
                        fastest man on base. 
                             (pause)
                        They integrated my unit. The Corps, 
                        in its supreme foresight, gave us 
                        one colored guy. Just one. Kid 
                        named Hewitt. Good marine. Funny. 
                        Sharp. Cover for ya in a pinch. We 
                        all liked him. Enough of us did, at 
                        least. 
                             (pause)
                        Comes time to go on leave, bunch of 
                        us head down to Austin. Hewitt 
                        comes along, ‘cause you know. He’s 
                        one of us. Til the drinkin’ starts. 
                        This one bastard. Monahan. Angry 
                        drunk. Starts in on him. Low an’ 
                        behold, other guys join in.
                             (pause)
                        An’ I can see Hewitt ain’t takin’ 
                        it good. An’ it’s gettin’ bad. 
                        Shovin’ him. Callin’ him names. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NOLAN (CONT'D)
                        Stuff like that. So I step in. Jus’ 
                        to calm everybody down. Course I’m 
                        drunk, too, so it don’t go over so 
                        well. I get hot, there’s a fight.
                             (pause)
                        At the end of it, Monahan’s dead.

           A beat.

                                 REBECCA
                             (quiet)
                        How’d he die?

           Nolan shifts on the cot, uncomfortable. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Somehow... punched him just the 
                        right way... broke his neck. 
                             (pause)
                        Weird, ain’t it? Shit luck, I’ll 
                        tell you what. Shit luck.
                             (pause)
                        Ducked a manslaughter charge but 
                        was dishonorably discharged. Moved 
                        back home, couldn’t look my dad in 
                        the eye. Moved in here ‘cause by 
                        then... I’s jus’ drunk all day. 

                                 REBECCA
                        So that scar. On your stomach.

                                 NOLAN
                        Different bar fight. Don’t really 
                        remember that one.

                                 REBECCA
                        Least you didn’t get in a brawl 
                        when we went out--

                                 NOLAN
                        Look... I’m sorry about that night. 

           A beat.

                                 REBECCA
                        Don’t be. What did I expect you to 
                        say? Shoulda known those feelings I 
                        had were unrequited. 
                             (pause)
                        ‘Course, I didn’t expect you to 
                        laugh so hard... 

           She looks to the floor, the hurt still fresh. 
                                 NOLAN
                        What you said that night. I been 
                        thinkin’ about it ever since. 
                             (pause)
                        It kept me goin’ while I cleaned 
                        up. Gave me a goal. 

           She looks back at him, a small glimmer in her eye...

                                 REBECCA
                        Well... there might be a statute of 
                        limitations on old crushes. 

           He smiles, as does she. Neither knows where to go from here.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                             (standing)
                        I’m gonna try that shower. Probably 
                        be dirtier when I come out. 

           She leaves Nolan alone with his thoughts. 

           LATER:

           The sound of OLD PIPES IN THE WALL RUNNING WATER as --

           NOLAN PULLS OUT THE PASSPORTS -- flips through them again -- 
           goes through Oswald’s -- completely blank.  Stops again on 
           the photo -- 

           Flips through Barstow’s passport -- starting on the photo -- 
           stops on HANDWRITING scrawled across a single page -- 

           A STRING OF NUMBERS: 011-052-55-555-7121

           UNDERNEATH, AN ALPHA-NUMERIC: P-121

           REBECCA’S SHRILL SCREAM PROPELS HIM TO HIS FEET -- NOLAN 
           grabs his gun -- DARTS downstairs --

           INT. BATHROOM -- SECONDS LATER 

           NOLAN BURSTS INSIDE -- REBECCA SCREAMS AGAIN at the sight of 
           him -- quickly covers herself in an old towel -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        What happened?

                                 REBECCA 
                        The water went cold!

           Nolan’s face fills with confusion for a second -- he comes 
           back to Earth -- 
                                 NOLAN
                        What?

                                 REBECCA
                        The water went cold... sorry...

           He looks at her -- half-wet, back against the corner of the 
           cement shower stall -- clinging to her towel -- water stream 
           still on --

           HE LOOKS AWAY out of respect -- takes in the awful bathroom -- 
           barely lit -- more a place where one would hose down 
           livestock -- he sees the rusted nozzles on the wall -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Here. Old farm boy trick. 

           He puts his gun down on the floor -- steps into the freezing 
           stream of water -- turns the right nozzle clockwise -- IT 
           COMES OFF in his hand -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit... 

                                 REBECCA
                        Wait... it worked...

           Steam begins to fill the shower stall -- Nolan looks up into 
           the hot water -- 

           HER HAND COMES TO HIS SHOULDER -- HE TURNS AND SHE KISSES HIM

           -- The shower continues to soak him from behind --

           The kiss becomes more intense -- THE RUSTED NOZZLE DROPS FROM 
           HIS HAND onto the floor -- He pulls away for a moment -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Wait...

                                 REBECCA
                        No. 

           SHE KISSES HIM AGAIN -- THE TOWEL DROPS onto the floor -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POLICE HQ -- LATER

           MATTE -- BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION

           Oswald in custody, surrounded by police and reporters -- an 
           impromptu press conference of sorts -- 
           SUPER IN BOTTOM CORNER: Dallas Police HQ, 11:23 p.m.

                                 OSWALD
                        Nobody has told me anything, except 
                        that I am accused of, uh... of, 
                        uh... murdering a policeman...

           EXT. LOWER GREENVILLE -- SAME

           Late night on lower Greenville, barely anyone out at this 
           usual hot spot strip -- 

           FOLLOWING ANGLE ON BADGE -- the cuts on his face cleaned up --
           he patrols the streets in a black convertible Mercury -- 

           No expression -- Just cold malice in his eyes -- 

                                 OSWALD (V.O.)
                        I know nothing more than that. I do 
                        request... someone to come forward. 
                        To give me legal assistance. 

           INT. MAKESHIFT BRIEFING ROOM -- SAME

           FRANK stands at a long wooden table, going over photographs 
           with NUMBER ONE -- 

           CLOSE ON THE PHOTOS as they’re laid out on the table: 

           SHOTS OF DEALEY -- Rolling green grass and dots of people -- 
           some before the shots started -- PEOPLE FLEEING in the ones 
           taken after [some of these are real photos from that day] -- 

           SEVERAL PHOTOS: A WOMAN IN A TAN COAT, RED HANDKERCHIEF --

           Tied over her head -- she holds a CAMERA in her hands and 
           faces the knoll -- [again, actual historic photos of what 
           many call the unidentified “babushka lady”] --

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Did you kill the president?

           FRANK circles’ the lady’s small form in one photo with a red 
           pen -- NUMBER ONE passes him more photos -- these are CLOSER 
           SHOTS -- surveillance-style -- 

                                 OSWALD (V.O.)
                        No, I have not been charged with 
                        that.

                                 NUMBER ONE
                        Here’s a better angle.
           FRANK looks -- these shots more plainly reveal REBECCA 
           leaving the knoll before the assassination -- Frank places a 
           photo of Rebecca next to the one he circled in red -- 

           INT. POLICE HQ -- SAME

           As Oswald is led away the sound of COMMOTION rises -- 

           JACK RUBY nervously stands behind several reporters -- 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        What happened to your face?

                                 OSWALD 
                        A policeman hit me.

           INT. MAKESHIFT BRIEFING ROOM -- LATER

           The lights in the room have been darkened -- 

           NUMBER ONE FLIPS ON A SMALL PROJECTOR -- 

           An 8mm image burns onto a white screen that’s been stood up, 
           rolled down --  it shows the presidential MOTORCADE -- 

           THE ZAPRUDER FILM.

           FRANK walks closer -- the assassination footage silently 
           reflecting in his glasses for a moment...

                                 FRANK
                        There, stop it there.

           NUMBER ONE flips a switch on the projector -- holds the image 
           in a jittering FREEZE FRAME --

           A CLUMP OF THREE FIGURES STAND IN THE PLAZA GRASS

           Blurry spectres as the image wobbles -- 

           CLOSER ON A FIGURE IN A TAN COAT, HANDKERCHIEF --

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        That’s her. Who else has seen this?

                                 NUMBER ONE
                             (reading from a type-out)
                        Cameraman was a Mr. Abraham 
                        Zapruder, 58, of Dallas. Gave two 
                        copies to the Secret Service this 
                        evening. The original is already 
                        for sale to LIFE Magazine. 
           Frank squints hard at REBECCA’S grainy image --

                                 FRANK
                        It’s her film I want. 

           INT. SMALL BEDROOM -- LATER

           Nolan pulls a new shirt from a drawer and puts it on -- 

           He puts the gun on a table next to Rebecca’s spool of film --

           OPENS BARTSOW’S PASSPORT -- turns to the handwriting -- 

           PLACES A ROTARY PHONE into his lap -- picks up -- begins to 
           dial the long string of numbers -- 

           INTERCUT -- NOLAN’S PHONE CONVERSATION

           INT. SMALL OFFICE -- SAME

           File clutter on a desk -- single lamp on -- cigarette burning 
           in a full ashtray -- black phone RINGING -- a hand answers --

           AT FIRST WE DON’T SEE THE SPEAKER’S FACE -- only parts -- his 
           mouth -- eyes -- hands -- glowing cigarette and smoke --  
           This is the STATION CHIEF --

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Mexico City.

           Nolan has no idea what to say on his end.

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                             (immediately suspicious)
                        Who is this?

                                 NOLAN
                        Barstow. 

           A beat. 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        What do you want?

                                 NOLAN
                        I want to speak to the man in 
                        charge. 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                             (cynical laugh)
                        Miss the office that much, huh?
                                 NOLAN
                        Somethin’ like that.

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        But I guess no one ever really 
                        leaves the agency, do they?

           Nolan stares at BARSTOW’S PICTURE -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        There’s one way to leave. 

           REVEAL THE STATION CHIEF’S FACE -- one of extreme 
           intelligence -- older, stern, mid 50’s -- 

           He lets the cigarette burn in his fingers for a moment as 
           mentally pieces the call together -- 

           STAMPS OUT the cigarette -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Where are you?

                                 NOLAN
                        Dallas.

           The station chief waves to staff off-screen: Get over here.

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        This had better be some kind of 
                        sick joke.
                             (pause)
                        Who is this? 

           Nolan HANGS UP. 

           REBECCA enters the room, hair still wet. 

                                 NOLAN
                        What’s the agency?

           Nolan hands her the passport -- she examines the writing -- 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        That number calls somebody in 
                        Mexico. American. Kept mentioning 
                        the agency. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Jesus... 

                                 NOLAN
                        What?
                                 REBECCA
                        Central Intelligence Agency. 

           The weight of that hits them both. She continues reading -- 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        What’s P-121?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MAKESHIFT BRIEFING ROOM -- SAME

           Frank sits while NUMBER TWO stands near him -- 

                                 NUMBER TWO
                             (totally sans accent)
                        We are looking into previous 
                        addresses for the officer. 

           NUMBER ONE pins photos to a corkboard -- historical 
           photographs -- shots of Rebecca -- NOLAN’S POLICE ID PHOTO -- 

                                 FRANK
                        Follow up on every one. And I need 
                        unit 5-1 scrubbed from the Dallas 
                        motor pool manifest since that 
                        psycho wrecked the patrol car. 

           With that order, NUMBER THREE nods, leaves the room -- 

           The phone RINGS -- Frank answers -- 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT -- FRANK / STATION CHIEF PHONE CONVERSATION

           The station chief at his desk, looking at files -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Apparently an employee of mine has 
                        gone missing. Case officer Barstow.

           Frank WAVES OFF the others -- they look to each other -- 
           Frank turns back to the phone -- 

                                 FRANK
                        Sorry to hear that...

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        We haven’t been able to reach him 
                        in a while. He was a good pal of 
                        yours, right? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        During your agency days?
                             (pause)
                        We’re still pals, aren’t we, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe we should get on a more 
                        secure line--

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Keep something in mind, Frank. 
                             (pause)
                        You don’t work here anymore. So 
                        don’t act like you do. The more I 
                        think about it, this thing in 
                        Dallas has your fingerprints all 
                        over it, and if it comes to light 
                        you were involved, I’m going to 
                        forget in a big hurry what great 
                        pals we are. 

           The man HANGS UP on Frank. 

           Frank turns to his remaining operatives, the color DRAINING 
           from his face -- 

                                 FRANK
                        Let’s start packing this place up.

           INT. SMALL OFFICE -- SAME

           The station chief has just hung up. He turns to someone off-
           screen, looking up from his desk --

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        We need to find the man who called 
                        here. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CAROUSEL CLUB -- MORNING

           Hole in the wall establishment. Desolate, like the streets 
           around it. A handwritten sign fixed to the door. CLOSED. 

           INT. THE CAROUSEL CLUB -- SAME

           A sleazy dive bar with black plastic booths, red carpet. 
           Likewise empty. Nobody here and only a few lights on. 

           ANGLE ON the bar where Corporal Leroy Curtis sits in uniform. 
           Drinking alone. 

           AN ARM WRAPS AROUND HIS NECK, A TIGHT HEADLOCK

           WIDER to reveal Nolan behind him -- Curtis FIGHTS the grip --

                                 NOLAN
                        You got about three seconds to 
                        explain yourself--

           Curtis COUGHS -- a WAR OF STRENGTH as his face turns red -- 
           he CLAWS at Nolan’s arm -- 

                                 CURTIS
                        It wasn’t me... it wasn’t me--

                                 NOLAN
                        You send a cruiser and I end up 
                        getting shot at--

           CURTIS HEAD BUTTS NOLAN BACKWARDS

           Nolan stumbles back -- Curtis STANDS, TURNS -- 

           NOLAN BELTS HIM ACROSS THE FACE AND SENDS HIM THROUGH A TABLE

           NOLAN WALKS CLOSER to Curtis on the ground -- Curtis makes 
           for his GUN -- 

                                 REBECCA (O.S.)
                        Don’t even.

           Curtis looks -- 

           ANGLE ON REBECCA -- NOLAN’S GUN TRAINED ON HIM -- 

           NOLAN stands over Curtis -- OFFERS HIM A HAND -- 

           -- PICKS CURTIS BACK UP TO HIS FEET. 

                                 CURTIS
                        You’re outta your damn minds.

           Curtis sits back on his stool, facing them. 

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        I put it out to my trusted guys--

                                 NOLAN
                        That’s horseshit--

                                 CURTIS
                        Who do you think I am, Jimmy?
                             (pause)

                        All I knew, you were dead an’ gone. 
                        I was scared shitless but I 
                        couldn’t go through the proper 
                        channels, ‘cause that’s what put 
                        you there in the first place. 
                             (pause)
                        Why the hell you think I’m sittin’ 
                        here drinkin’ at 9:30 in the 
                        morning? 

                                 NOLAN
                        That all you been doin’ since then?

                                 CURTIS
                        No. I did some checkin’ up. The car 
                        that responded to the park was unit 
                        Five-One. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Who’s unit is that?

                                 CURTIS
                        DPD doesn’t have a Five-One. Not 
                        according to the motor pool. 
                             (pause)
                        So now you’ve got my attention.

           Nolan looks to Rebecca -- NODS: “it’s okay.” -- SHE LOWERS 
           THE GUN -- Nolan takes it from her -- sets it ON THE BAR -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        I need to talk to Oswald.

                                 CURTIS
                        Jimmy, you’re crazy--

                                 NOLAN
                        You can get me close to him.

           ON REBECCA -- looking Curtis over -- CLOSE ON HIS BADGE -- 
           Rebecca reads the number scrawled across it --

           1019 -- THE SAME NUMBER SHE SAW ON BADGE AT THE GRASSY KNOLL.

           REBECCA’S EYES WIDEN -- She TRIES to remain calm -- 

           -- SHE EYES NOLAN’S GUN ON THE BAR -- 

                                 CURTIS
                        No way. Even if I could, Curry 
                        would break my badge in half if he 
                        found out.
                                 NOLAN
                        No one needs to know. No one can 
                        know. Don’t you get it? Oswald’s 
                        just a pawn in this.

           REBECCA PLACES HER HAND ON THE BAR -- Unassuming -- Watching 
           Curtis talk to Nolan -- 

                                 CURTIS
                        A what? 

           REBECCA’S HAND INCHES TOWARD THE GUN -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s quaint that he’s the only one 
                        been caught. These other guys don’t 
                        get caught. They either get away or 
                        get killed.
                             (pause)
                        Barstow’s dead. 

                                 CURTIS
                        Jesus, Jimmy...
                             (pause)
                        What about that fella in the police 
                        uniform? You tell anybody about 
                        him?

                                 NOLAN
                        No. Haven’t had a chance...

           NOLAN looks past Curtis -- sees REBECCA’S HAND MOVING TOWARD 
           THE GUN -- her chest rising, falling quickly -- 

           NOLAN LOOKS BACK TO CURTIS -- EYE CONTACT -- 

           CURTIS TURNS -- SEES REBECCA GOING FOR THE GUN --

           HE BACKHANDS HER WITH A CLOSED FIST TO THE HEAD -- KNOCKING 
           HER OUT and to the floor -- 

           NOLAN LEAPS AT HIM -- TACKLES HIM onto the bar in a CRASH OF 
           GLASS -- THEY FIGHT THERE -- AT EACH OTHER’S THROATS --

           NOLAN GETS A PUNCH IN -- HARD into Curtis’ face -- 

           CURTIS KICKS NOLAN OFF -- Sends him BACK INTO RACKS OF BOOZE 
           BOTTLES -- They SHATTER and Nolan falls to the floor -- 

           -- CURTIS GOES FOR NOLAN’S GUN FROM THE BAR -- 

           NOLAN’S ON HIS FEET IN SECONDS -- Delivers FAST BODY BLOWS to 
           Curtis’ kidneys -- the older man turns, trying to guard -- 
           NOLAN SENDS JAB POPS TO HIS FACE -- HOOKS TO THE SIDE -- 
           CURTIS tries to block, CAN’T -- NOLAN DEFLECTS CURTIS’ 
           PUNCHES with a marine corps efficiency -- 

           NOLAN UPPERCUTS CURTIS BACK AGAINST THE BAR -- his veteran 
           partner done for, bleeding heavily from the mouth -- As he 
           falls -- 

           HE GRABS A LIQUOR BOTTLE -- SPINS AND SMASHES IT ACROSS 
           NOLAN’S HEAD -- Nolan falls to the floor --

           CURTIS GRABS NOLAN’S GUN FROM THE BAR

           -- AIMS IT at his younger partner --

           -- NOLAN stays on the floor -- 

           -- CURTIS PULLS THE HAMMER BACK -- but his HAND SHAKES -- 

                                 CURTIS
                        I told you it ain’t the time to be 
                        a hero... 

                                 NOLAN
                        Goddamn you... How could you be a 
                        part of this?!

                                 CURTIS
                        You think I knew it was gonna go 
                        this far?! 
                             (pause)
                        Jesus CHRIST, son, you are as shit-
                        all stupid as rookies get. 
                             (pause)
                        Jack Ruby comes up to me couple 
                        months ago. He owns this bar. Been 
                        a good friend to a lot of police 
                        over the years. Wants me to sell 
                        him my badge. Couple thousand 
                        dollars. No questions asked.
                             (pause)
                        What do I care? Served the beat in 
                        Oak Cliff for twelve years. Korea 
                        before that. What do I got? Two 
                        stripes and a neighborhood full a 
                        niggers. Starin’ down the barrel of 
                        another twenty years before my 
                        pension kicks in. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Look what they done--
                                 CURTIS
                        Don’t you get righteous on me. I 
                        coulda done a lot worse. They 
                        wanted me to kill Oswald, too. At 
                        the theater. Shoot on sight, Ruby 
                        said. Promised me a few more 
                        grand... But I couldn’t do it... I 
                        mean... I just couldn’t...
                             (pause)
                        After last night, they come to my 
                        house. They threaten me. Say I 
                        gotta remove 5-1 from the motor 
                        pool manifest or that’s it... What 
                        could I do? Once I knew I’d been a 
                        part of... I thought you were 
                        already dead...
                             (pause)
                        You just couldn’t leave well enough 
                        alone, could you, Jim? 

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re not gonna kill me.

                                 CURTIS
                        I won’t have to. 

           Curtis keeps the gun trained on him -- picks up a phone -- 
           DIALS -- drops the receiver down and leaves it off the hook --

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        Now they’re comin’. I call that 
                        number, they’re comin’.

                                 NOLAN
                        What’s P-121?

                                 CURTIS
                        I can think of two people who’d 
                        know, an’ it sounds like you killed 
                        one of ‘em. The other is sittin’ 
                        handcuffed in police HQ with the 
                        whole world watchin’ his every 
                        move. 

                                 NOLAN
                        You let them kill the president, 
                        Curtis. 

                                 CURTIS
                             (worked up)
                        I know. I voted for the sombitch...
                             (breaking down)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CURTIS (CONT'D)
                        Never in my wildest dreams did I 
                        imagine that somethin’ like this 
                        was possible... That they could 
                        kill the President of the United 
                        States. That this country would 
                        even allow it... 
                             (somber)
                        And that somehow... I would help 
                        make it happen. 

                                 NOLAN
                        You gonna let a small group of 
                        violent men change the world like 
                        that?

                                 CURTIS
                        They already have, son. 
                             (pause)
                        We already have.

           CURTIS KEEPS THE GUN TRAINED ON NOLAN -- 

           -- But then lowers it. 

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna disappear. 
                             (pause)
                        You should do the same. 
                             (pause)
                        Go. 

           Nolan slowly stands up, in disbelief -- 

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        Go. I don’t know how far you’ll 
                        get. But go. They’ll be here any 
                        minute. 

           Nolan JUMPS over the bar -- REBECCA is already starting to 
           wake up -- He pulls her to her feet -- 

           ONE LAST LOOK OF HURT CONTEMPT FROM NOLAN -- 

                                 CURTIS (CONT’D)
                        GET OUTTA HERE!

           Nolan takes Rebecca out through the back of the club -- 

           Curtis stands alone for a moment. 

           Sits back down at the bar. Pours himself another drink. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- LATER

           Back in Nolan’s old place. Rebecca sits on the cot, leaning 
           against the wall -- her left cheek swelling up and turning 
           dark -- 

           NOLAN THROWS THE BOTTLE OF VODKA AGAINST THE WALL 

           And it EXPLODES -- he sighs -- trying to calm his anger -- He 
           sits down by the OPEN WINDOW -- looks back to Rebecca --  

                                 NOLAN
                        You all right?

                                 REBECCA
                        Yeah.
                             (turning to him)
                        You?

           Nolan doesn’t answer. Silence for a while. 

                                 NOLAN
                        He said two people know.

                                 REBECCA
                        What?

                                 NOLAN
                        Two people know what P-121 means. 
                        One’s Barstow. He died in your 
                        bathtub. 
                             (pause)
                        The other is Oswald.

                                 REBECCA
                        Jim. Maybe it’s time we cut loose. 
                        Never come back. I’m sure we can 
                        find some place--

                                 NOLAN
                        I failed as a marine. I will not 
                        fail at this. I’m a police officer. 
                        I have a duty. There was a murder. 
                        I will not stop until I get every 
                        last one a these sons a bitches. 
                             (pause)
                        Dead or alive.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BOARDING HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Badge sits in a rocking chair shrouded in shadow. Staring 
           intently. But at nothing. In complete silence. 

           BANG OF THE SCREEN DOOR in the living room -- FOOTSTEPS -- 
           moments later, FRANK enters the bedroom -- STARTLES on seeing 
           Badge staring at him from the dark --

           Badge does not answer. FRANK SNIFFS -- something draws his 
           attention and he walks to the bathroom --

           CLOSE ON the DEAD LANDLADY hanging out of the basin bathtub -- 
           FLIES BUZZING -- FRANK repulsed by the sight --

                                 BADGE
                        Too many questions.

           Frank comes back -- sees BADGE unmoved in his chair -- 

                                 FRANK
                        I want the cop GONE. I want the 
                        girl GONE. The film. Destroyed. I 
                        want INFORMATION on them so that 
                        all ends can be tied off. I want it 
                        shut down and sealed up QUIETLY. 
                        Oswald is going to blink out of 
                        existence. I have a man in play to 
                        do the job. You need to make sure 
                        he finishes it. 
                             (pause)
                        You will aid me in accomplishing 
                        all these things. Then you will go 
                        back to whatever hell you crawled 
                        out of. 

                                 BADGE
                        And where will you go?
                             (pause)
                        Cuba?
                             (pause)
                        Or back to school?

           BADGE tosses a MANILA FILE across the floor -- FRANK picks it 
           up -- thumbs through it -- 

           WAYLON’S PICTURE inside -- A MUGSHOT -- AN ARREST RECORD -- 

                                 FRANK
                             (reading)
                        Better. 
                             (closing folder)
                        I’ll take care of it. The agency is 
                        sniffing down our trail. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        We generate too much heat... I 
                        don’t have to tell you what happens 
                        to the both of us. 
                             (pause)
                        And bury that body.

           Frank leaves.

           EXT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- LATER

           Rebecca sits on the front stoop, alone. Afraid. Tired. The 
           neighborhood quiet at this hour.

           NOLAN steps outside from the front door. 

           For a moment, neither say anything. 

                                 NOLAN
                        Oswald’s under heavy lock and key. 
                        Place is swarming with press. Not 
                        even the invisible man could get in 
                        there right now.

                                 REBECCA
                        I mean he’s only the most guarded 
                        murder suspect in the entire world. 
                        I’m surprised they wouldn’t let you 
                        just take him out to lunch.

                                 NOLAN
                        There might be a chance tomorrow 
                        morning. Just before they transfer 
                        him to County.

           Nolan sits down next to her. 

                                 REBECCA
                        You walk in there, you’re dead.

                                 NOLAN
                        I’m not gonna run. Not this time.

           Rebecca nods -- then STORMS DOWN THE STREET -- Nolan goes 
           after her -- 

           CATCHES UP to her -- TAKES HER by the arm -- 

                                 REBECCA
                             (tears welling)
                        Let go of me.
                                 NOLAN
                        Rebecca, don’t. I can’t protect you 
                        out there--

                                 REBECCA
                        I don’t need you to protect me, 
                        Jim. I was doin’ just fine without 
                        you-- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Listen, you can hate me tomorrow 
                        when this is all over--

                                 REBECCA
                        You think this is over tomorrow? We 
                        don’t even know what the hell is 
                        goin’ on. We don’t know who, what 
                        orchestration... we don’t even know 
                        why it happened...

           A beat.

                                 NOLAN
                        You know this is right.

           She takes a long look at him. It’s true, unfortunately.

                                 REBECCA
                        I need a minute.

                                 NOLAN
                        Just come inside--

                                 REBECCA
                        In a minute, Jim. 

           Nolan slowly turns away from her, heads to the house -- 
           REBECCA hops into the truck bed to sit and calm herself -- 
           wipe the wetness from her eyes --

           NOLAN looks back before walking to the front door -- She 
           avoids his direction -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DALLAS JAIL CELL -- MORNING

           Early sunlight cuts through iron bars, creating a striped 
           pattern of warmth and cold on the floor. 

           CLOSE ON OSWALD sitting on his metal bunk. Awake. Likely 
           never slept. 
           A plainclothes cop in a light suit, STETSON HAT nears -- Lee 
           JUMPS to his feet -- goes to the bars --

                                 OSWALD
                        I want to speak to my wife. I want 
                        to speak to Marina--

           The cop OPENS THE BARS -- tosses a BLACK SWEATER at Oswald, 
           who catches it --

                                 STETSON HAT
                        Put that on.
                             (pause)
                        Gonna be cold out there this 
                        mornin’.

           HE SLAMS THE BARS CLOSED -- walks away...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LOVE FIELD TERMINAL -- SAME

           This is where the president arrived to thousands of cheering 
           onlookers -- But now it’s stone quiet in the early morning -- 

           THE STATION CHIEF STEPS OUTSIDE -- dark fedora, white shirt, 
           dark suit -- both unassuming and imposing -- 

           HE GETS INTO A WAITING BLACK CHEVROLET -- it speeds off -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- LATER

           Nolan sits on the concrete steps outside, gazing out as the 
           sun comes up over the rooftops. He hasn’t slept either.

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        The City Courthouse is right there 
                        on Harwood, between Main and 
                        Commerce. The first floor will be 
                        full of press. The floors above 
                        that are jail cells. They’re takin’ 
                        Oswald to County out through the 
                        basement. There’s two ramps down. I 
                        don’t know which side they’ll go 
                        out of. 
           INT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- LATER

           NOLAN opens a closet door -- gets down on his knees -- pulls 
           out a cardboard box and OPENS it --

           OLD MEN’S CLOTHES inside -- 

                                 REBECCA (V.O.)
                        Curtis might be there. I’m sure 
                        others. You walk in there as 
                        Officer Jim Nolan... You don’t want 
                        to be recognized. 

           LATER:

           NOLAN puts on a shirt and tie, takes care to tie the knot, 
           throw on a gray tweed coat while he inspects his appearance 
           in the mirror --

                                 NOLAN (V.O.)
                        I know. I’ll keep a low profile. 

           EARLIER:

           This conversation in real time, Nolan and Rebecca sitting and 
           discussing the plan. She’s distant -- withdrawn -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        I need to get to Oswald before he 
                        hits that basement. He spends most 
                        of his time in interrogations but 
                        there’s gotta be some downtime 
                        before the transfer--

                                 REBECCA
                        The best chance you have is to get 
                        into that armored car with him. 
                        That’ll give you a few minutes to 
                        talk during the drive to County. 

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re right. I gotta get in the 
                        that truck. 

                                 REBECCA
                        It’ll be tough. I wouldn’t just 
                        jump in. 
                             (pause)
                        You’re liable to get shot.

           They make eye contact -- tense, sad -- it’s a distinct 
           possibility he could die -- he looks away -- 
                                 NOLAN
                        I’ll make my way down with the 
                        others and act like part of the 
                        detail. When they get in, I’ll 
                        flash a badge and get in, too. 
                        Maybe I can even get some time with 
                        him beforehand. 

           LATER:

           Nolan finishes dressing -- looks in the mirror -- dressed 
           sharp, if not a little faded -- holds a dark fedora in his 
           hands -- EXHALES -- 

           REBECCA enters -- he sees her in the reflection -- her face 
           full of tired dread -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        I look like I’m goin’ to a funeral.

                                 REBECCA
                        Jus’ make sure it’s not your own.

           INT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- LATER

           NOLAN -- Rebecca hands him THE SPOOL OF FILM -- he puts it in 
           his coat pocket -- 

           WAYLON stands some ways off, watching them -- the weight of 
           all this has sobered even him -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        Bring this back to me. 

                                 NOLAN
                        I will. Hold onto the passports. If 
                        something happens... you go far and 
                        keep goin’, all right? 

           Nolan hands Rebecca HIS GUN -- 

                                 REBECCA
                        No--

                                 NOLAN
                        Take it.

           She does -- NOLAN looks to WAYLON -- the men share a single 
           solemn nod of understanding: “Thanks.”

           NOLAN goes for the door -- 
                                 REBECCA
                        Jim...

           He stops -- REBECCA GOES TO HIM, HUGS HIM TIGHT -- 

           Catches him by surprise.

           He hugs her back -- they part -- 

           -- HE LEAVES, uneasy --

           stands the STETSON HAT from Oswald’s cell -- along with the

                        What you fail to realize is that 
                        this country will not remember the 
                        death of this president as 
                        important.

                        What will be more important is who

                             (quickly)
                        I did not kill President Kennedy. I 
                        did not kill Officer Tippit. I 
                        didn't kill anybody. I told you 
                        before, I am just a patsy--

           BADGE moves toward him -- NOLAN turns and walks away -- DUCKS 
           into the stairwell -- BADGE follows -- 

           IN THE STAIRWELL:

           HE SEES NOLAN on the flight above -- NOLAN stops, glances 
           down, sees BADGE -- KEEPS GOING -- 

           BADGE heads up the stairs, pushing past the cops -- 

           INT. POLICE HQ - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan steps out into the hallway. If it was busy before, now 
           it’s INSANE. He walks forward -- keeps HIS HAT LOW -- 
           continues to glance back --
           BADGE steps out into the hallway -- FOLLOWS him -- the 
           frenzied crowd making it difficult -- 

           NOLAN reaches an elevator -- hits the button -- DOORS OPEN -- 
           he steps inside -- 

           BADGE trots to reach the elevator -- gets there just as the 
           DOORS CLOSE, giving him only a glimpse of Nolan --

           BADGE heads through a STAIRWELL DOOR -- 

           IN THE SECOND STAIRWELL: 

           BADGE PULLS HIS KNIFE FROM HIS BOOT as he ascends -- the 
           blade protruding only a few inches out of his clenched fist -- 

           INT. JAIL CELL LEVEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           The ELEVATOR OPENS -- Nolan steps out -- reaches the JAILER’S 
           DESK -- the uniformed man steps from his behind his desk --

                                 JAILER
                        Can I help you?

                                 NOLAN
                        They just shot Oswald...

                                 JAILER
                             (looking past him)
                        Jesus, really--

           NOLAN HITS HIM HARD ON THE BACK OF THE NECK -- Knocking him 
           out -- Nolan catches the man’s weight -- lets him down to the 
           floor easy -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Sorry, buddy...

           NOLAN GRABS THE JAILER’S KEYS 

           Heads for the main door -- UNLOCKS IT -- 

           BADGE ENTERS through the stairwell door -- 

           NOLAN sees him -- HE RUNS -- GROUP PRISONER CELLS the entire 
           length of the hallway -- SIX MEN to a cell -- 

           PRISONERS YELL AT THE SIGHT OF NOLAN -- BANGING against their 
           iron bars -- ONE PRISONER FLICKS A LIT CIGARETTE at him -- 

           BADGE THROWS OPEN THE MAIN DOOR -- coming after him -- 

           NOLAN UNLOCKS A PRISONER DOOR 
           Slides it open -- PRISONERS can’t believe their eyes -- They 
           wander out into the hallway -- 

           NOLAN UNLOCKS ANOTHER PRISONER CELL -- THEN ANOTHER -- 

           MORE ROWDY PRISONERS FLOW OUT OF CELLS BETWEEN HIM AND BADGE

           Slowing the chase -- Nolan grins, likes his clever plan -- He 
           turns to the exit at the end of the hall --

           A PRISONER GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND

           IMMEDIATELY TEARING AT HIM -- PULLING HIM TO THE FLOOR --

           NOLAN FIGHTS WITH THE PRISONER -- CLAWING -- 

           NOLAN HEAD BUTTS HIM -- PULLS AWAY -- 

           Flees to the exit on the other side of the hallway -- 

           IN A MATTER OF SECONDS THE PRISONERS SEE BADGE

           In his blue police uniform -- their ROWDINESS TURNS TO RAGE --

           THEY RUSH HIM --HE KNIFES THE FIRST ONE IN THE GUT -- 

           BADGE DROPS THE MAN TO THE FLOOR -- The rest of the PRISONERS 
           STEP BACK -- NEARLY AT A FULL-ON RIOT --

           BADGE steps back behind the main door -- SWINGS IT CLOSED -- 

           NOLAN DUCKS OUT THROUGH A DOOR AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL --

           UNLOCKS then RE-LOCKS the door before disappearing -- 

           ON BADGE’S END OF THE HALL:

           ANOTHER UNIFORMED JAIL COP reaches the jail floor -- 

           BADGE SEES HIM, POCKETS THE KNIFE -- 

           The other cop sees the unconscious jailer -- 

                                 JAIL COP
                        What the hell’s goin’ on?

                                 BADGE
                        Lock this. I’ll go for help.

           The cop goes to the main door -- LOCKS it -- the prisoners 
           SCREAM AND SHOUT inside the hallway -- contained for now -- 

           COP’S POV -- A PRISONER HOLDS HIS BLEEDING GUT ON THE FLOOR
           BADGE HEADS BACK OUT THROUGH THE STAIRWELL --

           EXT. POLICE HQ -- MOMENTS LATER

           NOLAN exits the building -- pushing out to the street even as 
           people RUSH to get inside -- 

           NOLAN WALKS QUICKLY -- Takes off his hat -- 

           TOSSES IT IN AN ALLEY as he passes --

           Keeps walking -- Keeps GLANCING BEHIND HIM --

           As he’s looking back, he walks right into...

           EXT. DEALEY PLAZA -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan turns, stops upon seeing where he is. 

           The Book Depository. Elm Street. Flowers placed in memoriam 
           by the Grassy Knoll. 

           The scene of the crime. 

           Nolan can’t bear to look. 

           He quickly walks away, down another street. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. REBECCA’S TRUCK -- LATER

           Nolan drives, wipes the sweat from his face. Tries to focus 
           on the road as he makes his way through the run down 
           industrial area of Deep Ellum -- 

           EXT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- LATER

           Nolan PARKS the truck -- walks to the front door -- KNOCKS -- 

           No answer. 

                                 NOLAN
                        It’s me.

           Nothing. He KNOCKS again. 

           Finally, he tries the knob -- it’s OPEN -- 
           INT. DEEP ELLUM -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan carefully steps inside the place -- 

           It’s TORN APART. 

           A bookcase overturned. Seat cushions off the couch. Furniture 
           knocked over. A broken window. 

                                 NOLAN
                             (calling out)
                        REBECCA!

           He walks through the broken home. No one there. 

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        REBECCA!

           He heads back out the front door -- 

           EXT. DEEP ELLUM WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Nolan walks onto the street -- unsure where to go next -- 

           In the distance... the sound of a CONTINUOUS CAR HORN -- 

           NOLAN RUNS -- 

           HE BECOMES A BLUR -- 

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL INTERSECTION -- MOMENTS LATER

           The CAR HORN louder now -- SIRENS in the far distance -- 

           NOLAN REACHES THE INTERSECTION -- Slows... 

           Stops. 

           Stares. 

           NOLAN’S POV -- A CAR CRASHED INTO A LAMP POST.

           A MAN LIES AGAINST THE STEERING WHEEL

           Completely arrested in a smoking heap -- the front end BENT 
           AROUND the metal pole -- 

           NOLAN WALKS CLOSER -- HORN growing louder as he approaches -- 

           He reaches the driver’s side.
           The man’s hair soaking with blood -- dripping in a steady 
           stream to the concrete and shattered glass below -- 

           Nolan pulls the head back -- 

           The HORN stops -- 

           Waylon. Dead.

           A FEW ONLOOKERS HAVE GATHERED AT THE OPPOSITE CURB -- 

           NOLN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT -- Can see into the car -- 

           NO ONE ELSE IS INSIDE -- THE DOOR STILL OPEN --

           He goes to the other side -- WILD WITH NERVES --  

           Peers in through the open passenger door -- 

           Empty. He sees -- 

           A BULLET HOLE THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD --

           A path straight to DEEP RED ON THE CORNER OF THE SEAT -- 

           Nolan touches it with his hand -- 

           Pulls back shaking fingers covered in fresh blood. 

           SIRENS GROWING CLOSER...

           A BLACK CHEVY SCREECHES ONTO THE STREET --

           NOLAN -- The look in his face says HE’S READY TO DIE  -- 

           CAR STOPS NEAR HIM -- THE STATION CHIEF BEHIND THE WHEEL -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Get in.

                                 NOLAN
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Mexico City.

           Nolan REALIZES -- connecting the dots -- all of this 
           happening too fast -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        WHERE IS SHE?

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Get in the car--
                                 NOLAN
                        WHERE IS SHE?!

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Get in the GODDAMN car.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE -- OPERATION’S END

           INT. PARKLAND MORGUE -- DAY

           Oswald dead on a stretcher. Orderlies pull a white sheet over 
           his blank stare.

           INT. LOW-RENT HOUSE -- SAME

           Marina sits on a couch alone. Crying. Tears full of fear.

           EXT. BOARDING HOUSE -- SAME

           Desolate and empty, both inside and out. The screen door 
           repeatedly BANGS OPEN in the wind.

           EXT. BUS TERMINAL -- SAME

           NUMBERS ONE, TWO, THREE, part ways without a word, each of 
           them boarding different buses out of town.

           One by one, the buses pull away.

           EXT. ROUGH PRAIRIE -- SAME

           Empty plains of dry short grass. Expansive sky for miles.

           A SMALL FIRE on the ground -- BADGE stands over it, now 
           dressed as a civilian --

           TOSSES THE BLUE POLICE UNIFORM INTO THE FIRE -- 

           Then Curtis’ badge. 

           Badge KICKS DIRT over the Dallas law shield with his foot. 

           INT. DALLAS JAIL CELL -- SAME

           BARS SLAM on Jack Ruby while he nervously paces inside.
           INT. GARAGE -- SAME

           Frank inspects the damage to the side of his vehicle. Clearly 
           from a side-swipe accident. 

           HE PULLS NOLAN’S SIDEARM from the back of his waistband and 
           examines it -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CITY OVERLOOK -- LATER

           The station chief’s car, parked in a quiet turnoff.

           THE DALLAS SKYLINE ominously in the distance.

           NOLAN KNEELING IN THE OVERGROWN GRASS NEAR THE CAR --

           Emotionally destroyed from all that’s happened --  

           THE STATION CHIEF stands near the driver door, watching him --

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Officer James Nolan. Badge number 
                        527. Dallas Police Oak Cliff 
                        Precinct. Dishonorably discharged 
                        from the Marine Corps, November 16, 
                        1962. Born May 29 in Waco, Texas 
                        1937--

                                 NOLAN
                        Is she dead?

           A beat.

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Honestly, I don’t know. But I don’t 
                        see a reason why they’d keep her 
                        alive.
                             (pause)
                        I’m sorry. 

           NOLAN FACE REDDENS, tears well up -- he tries to swallow it -- 
           relaxes -- he’s burned out, used up --  

                                 NOLAN
                        If you’re gonna kill me, I’d rather 
                        you just get it over with... 

           The station chief eyes him. 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Do you know who I am?
                                 NOLAN
                        You’re the man on the phone. 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        And I know all about you. What does 
                        that tell you?

                                 NOLAN
                        You’re with the CIA. 

           The chief tosses a black folder in front of Nolan -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        The man who killed your girl. He is 
                        not.  

           NOLAN gathers his wits -- OPENS THE FOLDER -- 

           CLOSER ON FRANK’s black and white ID photo -- several pages 
           of documents -- much of it stamped CONFIDENTIAL or TOP SECRET 
           -- whole passages redacted, BLACKED OUT -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Hasn’t been since ‘61. Kennedy 
                        cleaned house after the Bay of Pigs 
                        invasion. Got rid of a lot of 
                        people, all the way up to the 
                        Deputy Director. 
                             (pause)
                        This man’s friends died in Cuba. 
                        His record was tarnished. Career 
                        destroyed. He has personal reasons 
                        for hating the President of the 
                        United States. 

           Nolan continues to flip through the documents -- much of it 
           BLACKED OUT and unreadable -- save for words like -- 
           “UNSTABLE,” “VIOLENT TENDENCIES” -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        When this... unspeakable thing 
                        happened two days ago... I had my 
                        suspicions. But I didn’t want to 
                        believe it. He was one of ours, for 
                        Christ’s sake.
                             (pause)
                        Then you called me.

                                 NOLAN
                        What about Oswald?

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        My guess is a decoy. Meticulously 
                        built. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT'D)
                        In every operation, there is always 
                        one man who takes the fall. Usually 
                        it’s a man who believed he was part 
                        of something large and 
                        meaningful... 
                             (pause)
                        But in the end he was probably just 
                        a pawn in a game he never knew 
                        existed.

           Nolan SLAMS the file closed -- STANDS -- goes to the chief -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Why are you telling me all this?

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Smart question. Why do you think?

                                 NOLAN
                        Because you want me to go after 
                        him. But even I knew where he was, 
                        even if I trusted you, what makes 
                        you think I stand a chance against 
                        some rogue CIA soldier? 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Because I believe you want justice 
                        just as much as I do. Maybe more.

                                 NOLAN
                        What’s P-121? 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        I don’t know. Likely some code for 
                        the operation. 

           NOLAN WALKS OFF -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Jim.

           Nolan stops -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        We’ll be watching. 

           Nolan goes, not wanting to listen to any more -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY -- LATER

           Rebecca’s truck speeds far out of the city -- 
           INSIDE THE TRUCK:

           Nolan driving, no real destination in sight -- at his wit’s 
           end -- SOMETHING catches his eye -- he PULLS THE WHEEL HARD 
           to the right -- 

           Pulls up into the gravel lot of a rundown roadside saloon.

           INT. ROADSIDE SALOON -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Hours have passed. CLOSE ON NOLAN sitting at the bar. The 
           older BARTENDER wanders over. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Son, you been here long enough, you 
                        may as well order somethin’. 

           Nolan holds up a finger: one beer. 

           THE BOTTLE ARRIVES IN FRONT OF HIM

           Cold, moist in his grip. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        You hear they shot Oswald?

           Nolan eyes him. Turns his attention back to the beer. 

                                 NOLAN
                        I did hear. 

           Nolan raises the bottle, about to drink --

                                 BARTENDER
                        Came over the radio on my way up 
                        from Lewisville this morning. 

           Nolan stops. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Poor Jackie. Right?

           Nolan puts the beer down on the bar. Looks at the old man.

           THEN HE HURRIEDLY STANDS -- tosses a sawbuck down for the 
           bottle -- heads out the door. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY -- LATER

           The red truck barrels down a two lane highway, endless 
           horizon stretching off in every direction -- 

           ON A ROAD SIGN -- Highway marker -- the white shape of Texas 
           set against black -- 

           The words -- “NORTH” “LEWISVILLE” -- 

           The highway number -- “121” -- 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. REBECCA’S TRUCK -- SUNSET 

           Nolan drives -- 

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- Coming up on Lake Lewisville --

           Sprawling in the distance -- miles and miles of man-made lake 
           -- sparse brown landscape of trees, brush, blackbirds -- 
           rural winter quiet -- 

           The setting sun turning EVERYTHING GOLD -- SHADOWED -- 

           NOLAN PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY -- slows down -- 

           NOLAN’S POV -- LAKE LEWISVILLE -- 

           A small turn-off that gives way to the water -- 

           A LONG WOODEN PIER -- 

           A handful of boats in slips -- covered for the season --

           NOLAN stops off the highway... 

           A SUN-BLEACHED SIGN LABELS THE AREA:

           PIER 121.

                                 NOLAN
                             (echoing Oswald)
                        Marina. 

           NOLAN GRABS THE FILM out of his coat pocket -- puts it in the 
           GLOVE BOX.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PIER 121 -- MOMENTS LATER

           BADGE walks down the wooden pier -- boots CLACKING on the 
           wood -- the lake spread out in the distance like dull glass -- 
           faded autumn trees gating it from the rest of the world -- 

           Hardly a sound out here. Vacant for the winter.

           BADGE APPROACHES A 35’ CHRIS CRAFT 

           Moored in the calm water off the pier -- White wood and blue 
           trim, enclosed cabin. Before the age of cheap fiberglass. 

           FRANK STEPS OUT OF THE CABIN -- 

                                 FRANK
                        Welcome to Lewisville. 

           Badge says nothing. 

           LATER -- ON THE BOAT:

           Frank unties the line as the Chris Craft -- now powered up -- 
           pulls away from the pier and out into the OPEN WATER -- 

           Frank walks onto the deck -- BADGE stands there -- looking 
           out onto the lake -- THE SUN NOW GONE -- the sky a dull 
           purple and quickly getting darker -- 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The officer. Did you take care of 
                        him?

           BADGE doesn’t look at him -- continues to watch the water -- 

                                 BADGE
                        ...he is no longer a problem.

           Satisfied, Frank steers the helm -- 

           ON THE SHORE -- NOLAN watches them, hidden -- 

           ON THE BOAT:

                                 FRANK
                        We’ll head out across the lake to 
                        the dam, where it’s deepest. That’s 
                        where we’ll drop our anchor. 
                             (pause)
                        From there, you can disembark. 
                        Cross the dam into the marshes of 
                        the river. Your payment--in full--
                        is on the other side. 
                                 BADGE
                        I don’t trust you.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t trust you, either. That’s 
                        why there’s no money on the boat.

           Badge PULLS HIS KNIFE -- but keeps it at his side -- 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You can kill me now, but that’ll 
                        just make it a farther swim. 

           Badge eyes him -- walks away down the starboard side -- 

           FRANK HEADS BELOW DECK -- 

           INT. CHRIS CRAFT CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Frank steps down into the small enclosed space lined with 
           windows looking out onto the water --

           REBECCA SITS ON A BENCH -- One wrist HANDCUFFED to a chrome 
           running rail fixed to the bulkhead wall -- 

           She’s bruised, battered, bloodied -- presumably from the 
           accident, and whatever may have happened since --

           FRANK SITS DOWN across from her -- TOSSES THE PASSPORTS on 
           the table -- leans forward into her face--

                                 FRANK
                        Before the sun comes up, you’re 
                        going to tell me where that film 
                        is. 
                             (pause)
                        You might think you won’t. That 
                        you’re strong. Willful. 
                             (pause)
                        But we’re going to spend the next 
                        several hours proving that isn’t 
                        true. 

           REBECCA SPITS IN HIS FACE -- bloody -- he wipes it away -- 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        That’s good. Put up a fight now. 
                        Later, when you give up... when you 
                        sink to the bottom of this lake... 
                        you’ll know you at least put forth 
                        an effort.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PIER 121 -- SAME

           NOLAN SCRAMBLES FROM COVER near the pier -- watches the BOAT 
           grow smaller as it moves out further into the water -- 

           He looks around -- spots the SMALL COVERED BOATS moored for 
           the winter -- goes to them -- 

           PULLS BACK ONE COVER -- a small, rusting fishing boat -- He 
           JUMPS into it -- Searches the ignition -- NO KEYS -- 

           GOES TO A SECOND BOAT -- pulls back the cover -- reveals a 
           PRISTINE FINISHED WOODEN SPEED BOAT -- 

           He drops into the cockpit -- FINDS KEYS -- 

           TURNS THE IGNITION -- the boat ROARS TO LIFE -- begins to 
           churn the lake water of its slip --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHRIS CRAFT CABIN -- LATER

           Frank stands over a small gas stove -- HEATING THE METAL END 
           OF A PAIR OF PLIERS IN THE FLAME -- 

                                 FRANK
                        On the last day of my history 
                        class, I always read Eisenhower’s 
                        farewell speech to the students. Do 
                        you remember it? 

           She says nothing -- looks away -- jaw quivering -- 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (quoting)

                        ‘We recognize the imperative need 
                        for this development. Yet we must 
                        not fail to comprehend its grave 
                        implications. Our toil, resources 
                        and livelihood are all involved; so

           He looks to her. 

           EXT. THE OPEN WATER -- SAME

           NOLAN PUSHES THE SPEED BOAT TO ITS LIMIT -- cutting through 
           the water at an incredible speed -- 

           AN AMERICAN FLAG FIXED TO THE STERN FLAPS WILDLY ---

           NOLAN GAINING ON THE CHRIS CRAFT IN THE DISTANCE -- 

           INT. CHRIS CRAFT CABIN -- SAME

           Frank sits down across from Rebecca -- Terror in her face, 
           even as she tries to look away, hide it -- 

                                 FRANK
                        I ask the students to analyze that 
                        speech. Tell me what it means. 

           He PINCHES the HOT PLIERS together a few times -- 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        They always say the same thing. 
                        They say it’s a warning. 
                             (pause)
                        Then I ask them if they agree. They 
                        all say yes. Of course they do. No 
                        one should ever disagree with the 
                        President of the United States. 

           EXT. THE OPEN WATER -- SAME

           THE CHRIS CRAFT drifts quietly -- Several yards off its bow, 
           the DAM WALL -- slanted concrete jutting out of the water 
           about six feet up -- choking the lake off from the river --

           IN THE SPEED BOAT -- NOLAN continues -- NOT SLOWING DOWN -- 

           -- BOW POINTED RIGHT AT THE CHRIS CRAFT’S PORT SIDE -- 

           -- NOLAN THROWS THE THROTTLE FORWARD -- TOP SPEED -- 
           INT. CHRIS CRAFT CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           FRANK GRABS REBECCA’S FACE -- TRIES TO HOLD HER STILL AS SHE

           HE BRINGS THE PLIERS CLOSER -- 

                                 FRANK
                        But I say... the complex is the 
                        reason we’re even here. The reason 
                        these kids get to go to a school in 
                        a free world. Our toil, resources,

           INT. THE OPEN WATER -- SAME

           It’s NIGHT now -- NOLAN RACES THE BOAT TOWARDS THE CHRIS 
           CRAFT -- THE ENGINE SCREAMING -- 

           ON THE CRAFT:

           BADGE stands on the bow -- hears the WHINE OF THE ENGINE --  
           TURNS AND SEES THE SPEED BOAT GUNNING RIGHT FOR THEM -- 

           IN THE SPEED BOAT:

           NOLAN STANDS UP -- LOOKS AT BADGE -- 

           NOLAN LEAPS OUT OF THE COCKPIT -- HITTING THE WATER HARD -- 
           Disappears with a SPLASH into the black murk -- 

           THE SPEED BOAT PLOWS INTO THE FRONT OF THE CHRIS CRAFT

           NEARLY RIPPING THE BIGGER VESSEL’S BOW OFF -- A BLAST of WOOD 
           SPLINTERS -- 

           IN THE CABIN: -- FRANK SLAMS INTO THE HULL -- 

           OUTSIDE:

           BADGE IS THROWN BACK -- OVERBOARD -- He, too, disappears with 
           a SPLASH -- 

           THE SPEED BOAT CONTINUES ITS TRAJECTORY -- Hull and bow 
           destroyed -- 

           THE HULK OF THE SPEED BOAT EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL

           WIDER ON THE LAKE as the orange FIREBALL MUSHROOMS off the 
           darkness of the water --
           SPLINTERS OF WOOD SPLASH DOWN -- Pockets of OIL FIRE BURN -- 

           NOLAN SURFACES -- bursting forth and gasping for air -- 

           INT. CHRIS CRAFT CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Frank lies unconscious against a back wall -- BLEEDING BADLY 
           from the head -- 

           REBECCA GASPS -- WATER SPILLS INTO THE CABIN -- 

           The boat is quickly sinking -- 

           Already water rises past her knees --

                             (screaming)
                        NO!

           EXT. THE OPEN WATER -- SAME

           NOLAN HEARS HER -- can’t believe it’s her voice -- STARTS 
           SWIMMING toward the sinking cabin FAST -- 

           INT. CHRIS CRAFT CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           REBECCA FRANTICALLY PULLS AT HER HANDCUFF -- the water RISES 
           to her waist -- 

           UNDERWATER:

           NOLAN SWIMS INSIDE -- hoists himself over the gunwale -- 
           squirms down into the destroyed hull -- finds the cabin door 
           and goes through it -- 

           HE SURFACES -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Rebecca?!

           SHE SEES HIM -- HE GOES TO HER --  

                                 REBECCA
                        Jim... Jim, I’m in trouble, here...

           HE SEES THE HANDCUFF -- PULLS at the chrome rail -- BOLTED 
           TIGHT to the cabin wood -- 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                             (crying)
                        Please... please...
           NOLAN TUGS AT THE RAIL, CRIES OUT WITH EACH PULL

           As HARD as he’s ever been able -- PRIMAL, ANIMAL as he YANKS 
           AT THE RAIL -- it WON’T BUDGE -- 

           THE CABIN TILTS FORWARD -- the door to top deck shrinking as 
           the water rises and the boat is pulled under -- 

           IT DISAPPEARS -- A pocket of air now in the angled cabin -- 
           LESSENING BY THE SECOND -- 

           REBECCA LOOKS, FRANK IS GONE -- lost in the rising water -- 

           THE WATER TO THEIR SHOULDERS NOW  -- NOLAN CONTINUES TO PULL 
           AT THE RAIL -- 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Go, get outta here--

           THE CABIN LIGHTS SHORT OUT -- Leaving them in darkness -- lit 
           only by the MOON reflecting off the water outside -- 

           -- WATER AT THEIR NECKS -- 

           HE PULLS HER INTO A LONG KISS 

           Then breaks from it -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        I’m not leaving you. 

           THE WATER RISES PAST HER HEAD -- 

           -- NOLAN INHALES DEEP AND GOES UNDER -- 

           UNDERWATER: 

           Refracted moonlight and MUTED SOUND -- 

           REBECCA STRUGGLES AGAINST THE HANDCUFF -- BUBBLES escaping 
           her mouth -- 

           NOLAN PULLS AT THE RAIL -- 

           REBECCA’S EYES FLUTTER -- THEY CLOSE -- 

           -- She floats weightless as the cuff pulls her down -- 

           -- NOLAN BRACES HIS FEET AGAINST THE CABIN WALL -- 

           -- GRABS THE RAIL WITH BOTH HANDS AND PULLS -- 

           -- THE WOOD BEGINS TO CRACK -- 
           NOLAN TEARS ONE SIDE OF THE RAIL OUT OF THE BULKHEAD

           HE GRABS REBECCA -- GUIDES THE HANDCUFF FREE OF THE RAIL -- 

           -- WRAPS HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST AND DIVES -- 

           -- SWIMMING FOR THE CABIN ENTRANCE -- 

           -- MAKES IT THROUGH AND CLIMBS TO THE SURFACE -- 

           EXT. THE OPEN WATER -- MOMENTS LATER

           NOLAN SURFACES WITH REBECCA -- she’s unconscious -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        Rebecca... Rebecca, c’mon, 
                        darlin’...

           NOLAN SEES THE DAM WALL several yards away -- begins to swim 
           for it -- avoiding splintered wood -- 

           THE FIRES HAVE BURNED OUT, BOTH BOATS HAVE SUNK -- the lake 
           quiet once again -- 

           EXT. DAM WALL -- MOMENTS LATER

           NOLAN reaches the cement breaker -- CRAWLS UP the steep slope 
           -- DRAGGING REBECCA behind him -- 

           HE REACHES THE TOP -- a narrow cement walkway about a half 
           mile straight ahead in either direction -- 

           He lies her on the path -- checks her breathing -- 

           GIVES HER MOUTH TO MOUTH -- Nothing -- 

           CHEST COMPRESSIONS -- more MOUTH TO MOUTH -- nothing -- 

           A BOOT KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST

           Sends him ROLLING DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL -- 

           EXT. RIVER MARSHES -- CONTINUOUS 

           NOLAN TUMBLES INTO THE MUD -- Splashing down into the 
           thinning and winding bed of the Trinity River shallows -- 
           twisted trees and lush foliage spawned by the drained basin -- 

           NOLAN ATTEMPTS TO GET TO HIS FEET -- 
           SOMEONE GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND -- Throws Nolan back down into 
           the shallow river water -- Nolan turns over --

           BADGE COMES TOWARD HIM -- soaking wet and bleeding -- face 
           partly burned -- NOLAN SCRAMBLES TO HIS FEET -- 

           EXT. DAM WALL -- SAME

           Rebecca lies motionless on her back...

           WATER RUSHES UP OUT OF HER MOUTH as she COUGHS -- turns over 
           on her side -- GASPING for air --

           EXT. RIVER MARSHES -- CONTINUOUS

           NOLAN PUNCHES BADGE IN THE FACE -- but Badge carries the 
           momentum -- 

           TAKES NOLAN BY THE SHOULDERS AND KNEES HIM IN THE CROTCH -- 

           PUNCHES HIM ACROSS THE FACE -- PULLS HIS KNIFE -- 

           SWIPES AT NOLAN -- CUTS HIM ACROSS THE CHEST -- 

           SWINGS AGAIN -- SLASHES NOLAN’S ARM -- THEN HIS FACE -- 

           BADGE LUNGES TO KILL --

           NOLAN DROPS TO THE GROUND AND ROLLS INTO BADGE’S FEET -- 
           Knocking him over into the mud -- 

           BADGE STANDS UP -- Nolan struggles on the ground -- can’t 
           breathe -- grabs a WET PIECE OF HEAVY DRIFTWOOD -- 

           SWINGS IT INTO BADGE’S KNEE -- The man CRIES OUT -- FALLS 
           into the mud -- 

           NOLAN STRUGGLES WITH HIM THERE -- Hands slipping in the wet 
           dirt, blood -- 

           BADGE TRIES TO FORCE HIS KNIFE INTO NOLAN’S CHEST -- NOLAN 
           FIGHTS THE KNIFE OFF -- PUSHES against Badge’s body -- 

           NOLAN SMASHES A HANDFUL OF MUD INTO BADGE’S BURNED FACE -- 
           Some of the wet and charred flesh giving with the attack -- 

           BADGE SCREAMS AND FALLS BACK -- Blood from his own face 
           running into his mouth -- NOLAN ROLLS ON TOP OF HIM --

           THE MEN TUMBLE DOWN TO THE SHALLOW RIVER --
           BADGE’S HEAD STRIKES A ROCK EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND -- 
           Dizzying him -- HE DROPS THE KNIFE ON THE SHORE -- 

           THEY HIT THE WATER -- 

           NOLAN PRESSES HIS FOREARM DOWN ON BADGE’S THROAT AS THEY 
           STRUGGLE -- 

           BADGE’S HEAD SUBMERGES WITH EACH PUSH -- THEN RESURFACES -- 

           -- NOLAN PUSHES DOWN WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH -- 

           -- STRANGLING BADGE WITH HIS FOREARM -- 

           -- BADGE PUSHES HIM OFF -- 

           -- NOLAN REACHES FOR THE KNIFE ON THE SHORE AND TAKES IT -- 

           HE BURIES THE BLADE INTO THE SIDE OF BADGE’S NECK

           BLOOD SPRAYS INTO THE MUDDY WATER -- 

           BADGE’S EYES ROLL BACK AND HE GOES LIMP 

           Half-floats there in the inches of river water. Dead. 

           EXT. DAM WALL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Rebecca pushes herself to her knees, coughing the water out 
           of her lungs -- 

           SHE SEES TWO FEET WALK TOWARDS HER -- Black shoes, black 
           pants -- she looks up --

           EXT. RIVER MARSHES -- MOMENTS LATER

           Nolan walks back toward the DAM WALL -- starting to RAIN -- 

           FRANK steps out of the darkness -- face half-covered in BLOOD 
           -- pointing Nolan’s own SERVICE REVOLVER at him -- 

                                 FRANK
                        Where’s that film?

           Nolan stares at him --

                                 NOLAN
                        Mailed it to the Morning News. 

                                 FRANK
                        Sure you did.
                                 NOLAN
                        You don’t believe me?

                                 FRANK
                        You think that’s the right thing to 
                        do, don’t you? Tell the truth? 
                             (pause)
                        If America woke up tomorrow morning 
                        and learned that we killed John F. 
                        Kennedy.  What would happen? Would 
                        they throw a parade in your honor, 
                        Jim? 
                             (pause)
                        The country would be broken. Its 
                        spine. Its spirit. 
                             (pause)
                        Do you think that’s why I did this?

                                 NOLAN
                        You conspired to kill the President 
                        of the United States--

                                 FRANK
                        We conspired to keep this country 
                        ALIVE!

           The RAIN falls harder now... 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You should’ve seen Cuba before 
                        Castro. Beautiful. Another land of 
                        opportunity. 
                             (pause)
                        I was there. Bay of Pigs. I was on 
                        those beaches when that coward 
                        Kennedy decided to let us die. I 
                        got out, but the men who didn’t? 
                        Castro took his time killing them.  
                             (pause)
                        It was so close to being ours, and 
                        I had to watch it all vanish. 
                        Everything taken from me. Why? So 
                        we could focus on civil rights? 
                             (pause)
                        You know what really brings America 
                        together? As a nation? As an 
                        economy? A common enemy. The Nazis. 
                        The Soviets. Cuba. Vietnam on the 
                        horizon. 
                             (pause)
                        If we ever stop going to war, this 
                        country will be out of a job. 
                        Without an identity. 
                                 NOLAN
                        That’s not what this place is 
                        about.

                                 FRANK
                        If that’s what you think, then 
                        you’re as naive as Kennedy was.

           Nolan laughs darkly, in spite of it all. 

                                 NOLAN
                        So you’ll just kill me here. 

                                 FRANK
                        Jim, don’t you recognize this gun?
                             (pause)
                        You’re distraught over the loss of 
                        your partner, and a woman you could 
                        never take care of because you’re a 
                        drunk. Not to mention the fact that 
                        the president was killed on your 
                        watch. 
                             (pause)
                        You drove yourself out to the 
                        Trinity River and shot yourself 
                        with your own service weapon.  

                                 NOLAN
                        No one will believe it. 

                                 FRANK
                        That’s the beauty of conspiracy, 
                        Jim, these people want to believe. 
                        They’re desperate to. 
                             (pause)
                        They want it tied together neatly. 
                        Suicide. A car accident. Vigilante 
                        justice. One lone gunman. One 
                        mastermind. It all can be 
                        compartmentalized and stored away. 
                        Forgotten about. 
                             (raising gun)
                        God bless America.

           A RIFLE SHOT BLASTS APART THE BACK OF FRANK’S HEAD

           Dead before he hits the ground --  

           NOLAN LOOKS AROUND WILDLY -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Easy--
           A MAN IN THE SHADOWS -- dark coat, shirt and tie -- the brim 
           of his fedora low -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a lot of men trained on 
                        you right now.

           Nolan blinks through the rain -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Your country owes you, son. 

           Nolan looks at Frank’s dead body in front of him -- 

                                 NOLAN
                        There’s only one way to leave the 
                        agency. 

           The station chief eyes Nolan...

                                 NOLAN (CONT’D)
                        Am I next? 

           A long beat as they stare at each other.

           The station chief HOLDS UP THE FILM -- taken from the truck -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Is this the only copy? 

           Nolan STARTS FORWARD, looking wildly around for Rebecca -- 
           the chief holds up a hand --

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Relax. She’s safe. On the pier. 

           A beat.

                                 NOLAN
                        What will you do with it?

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Keep it. As leverage.

                                 NOLAN
                        Leverage against what?

                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Call it job security. 

           Nolan looks to where he left BADGE’S BODY -- it’s GONE. 

                                 NOLAN
                        What about justice? 
                                 STATION CHIEF
                        Justice was done tonight. Just not 
                        on your terms. 

           RAIN BEGINS TO FALL -- Nolan blinks through it -- then WALKS 
           AWAY, toward the dam wall -- past the station chief -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (CONT’D)
                        Put it behind you, Nolan. 

           The station chief looks up into the rain --NOLAN TURNS BACK -- 
           Sees the chief RAISE A BLACK UMBRELLA AND OPEN IT --

           Nolan stands in the dark of the marshes, rain drenching him. 

           Then he walks away, back toward the pier. It’s finished. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PIER 121 -- LATER

           Rebecca stands at the end alone. Arms crossed. Looking out 
           onto the quiet lake as rain continues to fall. 

           NOLAN WALKS DOWN THE PIER 

           She turns as he reaches her --

           THEY EMBRACE -- HE HUGS HER TIGHT -- CLOSES HIS EYES...

           FLASH CUT TO EARLIER:

           NOLAN replays the encounter with the chief in his head --

           The station chief looks up into the rain -- RAISES A BLACK 
           UMBRELLA --

           NOLAN TURNS BACK -- SEES the CHIEF’S DARK COAT -- the BLACK 
           CANOPY FABRIC OF THE UMBRELLA as it opens -- the BROWN WOOD 
           CURVE of the handle -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (V.O.)
                        In every operation...

           FLASH CUT:

           After Nolan has gone -- NUMBERS ONE, TWO, THREE emerge from 
           the woods behind the station chief -- dressed in dark 
           military gear -- one ARMED WITH A HIGH-POWERED RIFLE -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...there is always one man who 
                        takes the fall.
           FLASH CUT:

           The three operatives pick up FRANK’S BODY -- 

           CLOSE ON FRANK’S VACANT AND MUD-SPATTERED FACE -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A decoy. Meticulously built. 

           They load the corpse into the back of a WAITING BLACK VAN -- 
           then they get in as well -- 

           THE STATION CHIEF GETS INTO THE PASSENGER SIDE -- 

           BACK DOORS CLOSE -- THE VAN DRIVES OFF -- NO HEADLIGHTS -- 

           Disappearing into the rain and blackness of the night -- 

           FLASH CUT TO THE ASSASSINATION:

           NOLAN back on THE KNOLL -- watching, people CHEERING -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        A man who believed he was part of 
                        something large and meaningful... 
                             (pause)
                        But in the end...

           SOMEONE IN A DARK COAT OPENS AN UMBRELLA -- Nolan sees the 
           BLACK CANOPY FABRIC -- the BROWN WOOD CURVE of the handle -- 

           CLOSER ON THE SIDE OF THE MAN’S FACE -- THE STATION CHIEF...

           -- CROWD CHEERS at a FEVER PITCH -- 

           THE ECHOING MEMORY --

           BACK TO SCENE:

           -- OF A GUNSHOT.

           NOLAN pulls back from Rebecca on the pier -- face haunted by 
           what he now knows -- 

                                 STATION CHIEF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...he was just a pawn in a game he 
                        never knew existed. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           SUPER: 

           In September 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Lee 
           Harvey Oswald acted alone in the killing of President John F. 
           Kennedy and the wounding of Texas Governor John Connolly, and 
           that Jack Ruby acted alone in the murder of Oswald. 

           INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE -- DAY

           An older Nolan and Rebecca take seats across a small desk. A 
           microphone and tape-fed recorder sit before them.

           SUPER:

           In 1976, the United States House of Representatives Select 
           Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) re-opened the Kennedy 
           assassination. The Committee investigated for two years, 
           interviewing hundreds.

           SUPER:

           The HSCA’s 1979 report concluded with high probability that 
           at least two gunmen fired at the president’s motorcade. 

           FADE UP SECOND SUPER: 

           The committee further believed, on the basis of evidence 
           presented, that President Kennedy was likely assassinated as 
           the result of a larger conspiracy.

                        can you please describe to me what 
                        you saw on the Grassy Knoll? 

           Nolan and Rebecca look to each other. 

           Nolan turns to the microphone -- opens his mouth to speak --

           The HSCA was unable to identify any other possible gunmen, or

           SUPER: 

           The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie -- 
           deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, 
           persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic. 

           Belief in myths allows the comfort of opinion without the 
           discomfort of thought.
