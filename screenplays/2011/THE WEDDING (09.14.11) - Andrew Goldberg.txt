           A series of WEDDING VIDEO-STYLE SHOTS of various weddings:

           A Jewish groom stomping on a glass, a bridesmaid stealing a 
           glance at a groomsman, an extremely old man checking out the 
           cleavage on the young woman sitting next to him, a Greek man 
           shattering a plate on a dance floor, some twenty-somethings 
           doing the “a little bit softer now” part of “Shout”, two sets 
           of legs - one in tuxedo pants, the other in a rumpled dress - 
           under a bathroom stall door, etc.

           Over these images, we hear the voice of a man we’ll come to 
           know as DANNY:

                                 DANNY (V.O.)
                        Starting with my cousin Johnny’s, 
                        when I was six years old, I’ve been 
                        a guest at twenty-eight weddings.  
                        And the thing about being a guest 
                        at a wedding, as I’ve gathered from 
                        my twenty-eight, is: it shines a 
                        big, bright spotlight on whatever 
                        your relationship status is at the 
                        moment.  If you’re single, you’re 
                        really single.  And if you’re in a 
                        relationship with problems, those 
                        problems are amplified by the 
                        perfect couple standing in front of 
                        you professing their undying love.  
                        And if you’re in a relationship 
                        with no problems, well then pull 
                        your head outta your ass, because 
                        you’re not looking closely enough.

           INT. SUBURBAN BEDROOM - DAY

           TIM (30s, a bit high-strung, but sweet) works on his tie, 
           while his wife, BETH (30s, pretty, distant), puts on her 
           makeup.  Tim’s in a great mood.  He sings Eric Clapton’s 
           “Wonderful Tonight.”

                                 TIM
                        IT’S LATE IN THE EVENING / SHE’S 
                        WONDERING WHAT CLOTHES TO WEAR / 
                        SHE PUTS ON HER MAKEUP / AND 
                        BRUSHES HER LONG BLOND HAIR / AND 
                        THEN SHE ASKS ME...

           Tim grins at Beth expectantly, kind of like a dork, trying to 
           entice her to join in.  A beat.  She doesn’t.
                                 TIM (cont’d)
                                (launching back into it)
                        ...”DO I LOOK ALRIGHT?” / AND I 
                        SAY...

           He grins at her again.  Maybe this time?  Nope?  Okay.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                                (just as enthusiastic)
                        ...“YES, YOU LOOK WONDERFUL TONIGHT”

           EXT. STYLISH APARTMENT - DAY

           At the doorway, ROGER (30s, strikingly handsome, confident) 
           kisses a HOT GIRL still wearing her cocktail dress from the 
           night before goodbye.

                                 ROGER
                        I had fun.

                                 HOT GIRL
                        Me too.

                                 ROGER
                        If I find your panties, I’ll text 
                        you.

           She exits.  Roger pulls out his phone and dials.

                                 ROGER (cont’d)
                        Hey, gorgeous... I’ll pick you up 
                        in twenty minutes?... Great, wear 
                        something that’ll make the groom 
                        regret his decision.

           INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY

           RYAN and CAROLINE (late 20s, have been dating for three 
           years, not engaged) get dressed in silence.

                                 RYAN
                        You okay?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Why wouldn’t I be?

                                 RYAN
                        No reason.  I mean, good.  I think 
                        we’re gonna have a really nice time 
                        tonight.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Are we?

                                 RYAN
                                (hopeful)
                        ...Yes?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Great.  I hope we do.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           JEREMY (17, an optimistic underdog, younger brother of the 
           bride) delicately trims his pubes.

                                 JEREMY
                        Gently.  Careful.  Just enough to 
                        make the shaft look longer.  Lift 
                        and cut.  Lift and cut.

                                 JEREMY’S MOM (O.S.)
                        Jeremy!  Let’s go!

                                 JEREMY
                        Ma!  I’m coming!

           Jeremy looks back down at his crotch.

                                 JEREMY (cont’d)
                        No.  Ohhh.  Fuck me.

           Jeremy lifts his non-scissor hand into frame.  It has a 
           trickle of blood on it.

           INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY

           ANNIE (early 30s, cute, funky, emotional) tries to zip up her 
           dress by herself.  She can’t quite reach.  She looks over at 
           an empty closet with a few stray hangers and frowns.  Someone 
           has clearly just moved out.  Just then, her phone RINGS, and 
           the machine picks up.

                                 OLDER WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Annie, sweetie, just calling to see 
                        if you’re okay.  I know you have 
                        Jessica’s wedding, and I just want 
                        to make sure you don’t mope.  Men 
                        don’t like a moper.  Okay.  Bye.  I 
                        love you.  Don’t mope.

           Annie SIGHS.
           INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - DAY

           DANNY (30s, the best man, goofy, fun) sleeps very peacefully.  
           His eyes flutter open, and he looks at his bedside clock.  
           His eyes go wide.

                                 DANNY
                        SON OF A WHORE!

           EXT. CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER

           Cars line the street.  GUESTS file in.

           INT. CHURCH - SAME

           Roger, the awesome single guy, and Tim, the husband who 
           couldn’t get his wife to sing, stand at the back of the 
           sanctuary, ushering.

                                 ROGER
                        It’s disgusting.

                                 TIM
                        You don’t know what it’s like to be 
                        married.

                                 ROGER
                        Not getting laid in six months?  
                        That’s not normal married guy 
                        stuff.  That’s deviant.  You’re 
                        gonna go into work one day and 
                        shoot the place up, and they’re 
                        gonna be like, “Why?!?!”  And then 
                        I’ll be like, “His wife won’t touch 
                        his cock.”  And they’ll be like, 
                        “Oh.  Okay.  That makes sense.”

                                 TIM
                        Well, tonight’s the night.  Dancing, 
                        booze, hotel room... plus, it’s a 
                        wedding, love is in the air.

                                 SEXY FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Uh-oh, we’ve got a romantic.

           Tim turns around to find SIMONE (20s, exotic, very gorgeous).  
           He is stunned by how attractive she is.

                                 TIM
                        Holy shit.

           Simone LAUGHS.
                                 ROGER
                        Tim, this is Simone.  My date.

                                 TIM
                        Of course.

           They shake hands.

                                 SIMONE
                        Hi, Tim.  Nice to meet you.

                                 TIM
                                (still thrown)
                        I’m going to have sex tonight.

                                 SIMONE
                                (smiles, amused)
                        That’s great.  I think I might, 
                        too.

                                 ROGER
                        Oh, yeah, you definitely are.

                                 SIMONE
                        We’ll see.

           Simone KISSES Roger on the lips and exits toward the pews.  
           The guys both watch her.

                                 TIM
                        Good lord.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, she’s a yoga instructor.

                                 TIM
                        You don’t say?

                                 ROGER
                        I find fucking her very Zen.

           INT. BRIDAL SUITE - SAME

           Annie, the girl with the empty closet, and Caroline, the girl 
           who isn’t engaged, work on their hair and makeup with KATE 
           (early 30s, stunning, smart, competitive, a little intense).  
           They all wear similar bridesmaid dresses.

                                 ANNIE
                        I had to ask my landlord to zip my 
                        dress.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Oh, honey.

                                 ANNIE
                        He asked me if I wanted to “make 
                        sex” on him.

                                 KATE
                        What did you say?

                                 ANNIE
                        What do you think?  I let him lick 
                        my nipples, and now I get free rent 
                        for a year.

                                 KATE
                        Jesus!

           Caroline LAUGHS.

                                 ANNIE
                        Well, what the hell kinda question 
                        is that?!  I told him, “no.”  He’s 
                        seventy-five years old, and he has 
                        one of those giant gut, skinny legs 
                        bodies.  I’m not that desperate yet.

           Another BRIDESMAID approaches.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        You guyyys!  You look awesome!  Hi, 
                        Annie!  Where’s Keith?  I haven’t 
                        seen him.

                                 ANNIE
                        Um, we broke up.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Oh my god!!  You must be 
                        devastated!!

                                 ANNIE
                        No, I’m okay.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        No!!  It’s terrible!!

                                 ANNIE
                        If you insist.

           Bridesmaid #1 exits, distraught.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        No, no, no!
                                 ANNIE
                                (to Caroline and Kate)
                        That’s gonna get annoying real fast.

           Just then, there’s a KNOCK AT THE DOOR and Jeremy pokes his 
           head in.

                                 JEREMY
                        Ten minutes, ladies!
                                (then)
                        Hey, Annie.  Where’s Keith?

           Annie scowls.

           INT. CHURCH - SAME

           MICHAEL and LINDA (60s, argue constantly, but “happily” 
           married for forty years, Danny’s parents) sit in a pew.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is a terrible seat.

                                 LINDA
                        Michael, it’s fine.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (standing and looking around)
                        We should be up at least four rows.

                                 LINDA
                        Sit down.

           Michael sits down.

                                 MICHAEL
                        When Danny gets here, I wanna show 
                        him my parking spot.

                                 LINDA
                        You will not.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s a terrific spot!!

           BY THE ENTRANCE, Danny hustles through the door, still 
           struggling with his jacket and tie.

                                 DANNY
                                (to various guests)
                        Hi.  Shit.  Sorry, I’m late.  Hey, 
                        everybody.  Hey, Emily, you look 
                        great.  Did you lose some weight?
                                 FEMALE GUEST
                        I’m bulimic.

                                 DANNY
                        Ha!
                                (then)
                        Oh, you’re serious?  Oh shit.  Good 
                        luck.  Stay strong.

           Danny joins Tim and Roger in their usher positions.

                                 ROGER
                        You know, it’s traditional for the 
                        best man to arrive before the 
                        wedding’s supposed to start.

                                 TIM
                        Good thing he didn’t have a date to 
                        pick up.

                                 ROGER
                                (to Danny)
                        Seriously, man, what kinda creep 
                        doesn’t bring a date to a wedding?

                                 DANNY
                        What?  Where is it written that you 
                        have to bring a date?  I defy that 
                        convention.

                                 TIM
                        Who are you gonna dance with?

                                 DANNY
                        Whoever I want.

                                 ROGER
                        Who are you gonna talk to?

                                 DANNY
                        Whoever I want.

                                 TIM
                        Who are you gonna slow dance with?

                                 DANNY
                        Who wants to slow dance?!

                                 ROGER
                        Okay, and what are you gonna do at 
                        the end of the night?
                                 DANNY
                        I’m gonna call a cab, go home, fall 
                        asleep in my tux, and then wake up 
                        and figure out how to get my car.

           A beat.  Tim turns to Roger:

                                 TIM
                        That actually doesn’t sound half 
                        bad.

           INT. BRIDAL SUITE - SAME

           The girls continue getting ready.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Did you see Roger’s date?

                                 ANNIE
                        Holy fuck.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know, what is she like twenty?

                                 ANNIE
                                (realizing)
                        Um, Caroline... Kate may not wanna 
                        talk about Roger’s disgustingly 
                        gorgeous date.

                                 KATE
                        Why should I care?  I have Charlie.

                                 ANNIE
                        We love Charlie.

                                 CAROLINE
                        He’s like the anti-Roger.

                                 ANNIE
                        But still hot.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Adorable.

                                 ANNIE
                        And I can’t believe he wants you to 
                        move in with him, it’s so exciting!

                                 KATE
                        Oh...

           This is news to Caroline.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Charlie wants you to move in with 
                        him?

                                 KATE
                        Yeah...

                                 CAROLINE
                        That’s terrific.  Why didn’t you 
                        tell me?

                                 KATE
                        I don’t know.

                                 CAROLINE
                                (”come on”)
                        Kate.

                                 KATE
                        Well, I guess maybe I was nervous, 
                        ‘cause I didn’t know how you’d 
                        react.  ‘Cause, you know, Ryan...

                                 CAROLINE
                        What?  Has been dating me for three 
                        years and still hasn’t proposed and 
                        shows no signs of ever proposing?  
                        Kate, stop it.  I’m fine.

           Caroline GULPS DOWN some champagne.

           INT. CHURCH - SAME

           Ryan, Caroline’s boyfriend, sits on a pew next to LIONEL and 
           DOTTIE (80s, a very sweet married couple).

                                 DOTTIE
                        Don’t you just love weddings?

                                 RYAN
                        No.  Actually, I hate them.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Why?  Are you a homosexual?  Someday 
                        we’re going to repeal that law.

                                 LIONEL
                        Sweetheart, homosexuals love 
                        weddings.  Because of the flowers 
                        and whatnot.
                                 DOTTIE
                        They also like to urinate on each 
                        other in the shower.

                                 LIONEL
                        They do.

                                 RYAN
                        What?  No, I’m-- I-- I have a 
                        girlfriend.

           Lionel and Dottie look at him, smiling expectantly.  They 
           clearly want more.

                                 RYAN (cont’d)
                        And, well... she wants me to 
                        propose.  So every wedding we go to 
                        now is like a pressure cooker, 
                        boiling up the inevitable fight.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Oh dear.

                                 RYAN
                        That’s right.  I’m not even trying 
                        to avoid the fights anymore.  I’m 
                        just trying to win them.  Or get 
                        them over with as soon as possible, 
                        so we can get on with our lives.

                                 LIONEL
                        Why don’t you want to get married?

                                 RYAN
                        I do.  I mean, maybe I do.  I don’t 
                        know.  It’s a very big decision.

                                 LIONEL
                        True.  But when you know, you know.

                                 DOTTIE
                        And if it’s not right, then you 
                        know that too.

                                 RYAN
                        I’m not so sure about that.

           A beat, as they all let this soak in.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Homosexuals also like to buy and 
                        flip real estate.
                                 LIONEL
                        Yes.

           INT. CHURCH ENTRANCE - A LITTLE LATER

           The groomsmen (including Danny, Roger, and Jeremy) and the 
           bridesmaids (including Annie, Kate, and Caroline) gather just 
           outside the entrance to the sanctuary.  Jeremy approaches 
           Danny and Roger.

                                 JEREMY
                        Hey, guys.

                                 DANNY
                        Jeremy.

                                 JEREMY
                        Who would you say is the sluttiest 
                        bridesmaid here?

                                 DANNY
                        Excuse me?

                                 ROGER
                        Who is this kid?  I like him.

                                 DANNY
                        The bride’s little brother.

                                 ROGER
                        Ah.  Congratulations.

                                 JEREMY
                        Thanks.

                                 DANNY
                        Why, uh-- Why do you need to know 
                        who the sluttiest bridesmaid is?

                                 JEREMY
                        I’m getting laid tonight.

                                 ROGER
                        I definitely like him.

                                 DANNY
                        What makes you so sure you’re 
                        getting laid?
                                 JEREMY
                        Because it’s a wedding.  A time for 
                        celebrating passion, romance, and 
                        the glorious possibility of true 
                        love.  Plus, seeing another lady in 
                        a pretty dress, getting tons of 
                        attention makes women temporarily 
                        lose their minds.

                                 ROGER
                        He’s right.  At my sister’s 
                        wedding, I had sex with her lesbian 
                        best friend.

                                 DANNY
                                (gesturing)
                        Well, the sluttiest bridesmaid at 
                        this wedding would probably have to 
                        be Kate.  I mean, she used to have 
                        sex with Roger, and he’s a certified 
                        man whore.

                                 ROGER
                        I do have a lot of sex.

                                 DANNY
                        It’s gross.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m like walking proof that 
                        straight guys can’t get AIDS.

                                 JEREMY
                                (looking around)
                        Wait, which one’s Kate?

                                 DANNY
                        Over there.

           ANGLE ON Kate, by a pew, asking CHARLIE (30s, good looking, 
           clean cut, a genuinely terrific guy) to hold her purse.

                                 ROGER (O.S.)
                        Who the hell is that?

           ANGLE BACK ON the guys.

                                 DANNY
                        Charlie.  Her boyfriend.

                                 ROGER
                                (clearly thrown)
                        Kate has a boyfriend?
                                 DANNY
                        They’re moving in together.

                                 JEREMY
                                (to Roger, re: Kate)
                        You hit that?  Nice job.

           Jeremy holds up his hand for a high-five.  Roger ignores him, 
           still staring at Kate and Charlie.

                                 ROGER
                        He looks like an asshole.

                                 DANNY
                        No way, Charlie’s delightful.  He’s 
                        taking me out on his catamaran next 
                        weekend.

                                 ROGER
                                (irritated)
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        It’s called “The Sea Word.”  S-E-A. 
                                (short beat)
                        Kinda funny.

           INT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           We hear PROCESSIONAL MUSIC, as the wedding party walks down 
           the aisle.  Roger is paired with Kate.  As they walk:

                                 ROGER
                        Charlie, huh?  Where’d you find him?  
                        J Crew catalogue?

                                 KATE
                        Where’d you find Simone?  Pep rally?

                                 ROGER
                        She’s twenty-three.

                                 KATE
                        You’re thirty-four.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, but I have the body of a 
                        twenty-one year old.

                                 KATE
                        You used to.
                                 ROGER
                        Still do.  Happy to show you.

                                 KATE
                        You show me yours, I show you mine?

                                 ROGER
                        If you want.

                                 KATE
                        Or how about you show yours to 
                        Simone, I show mine to Charlie, the 
                        police arrest you for exposing 
                        yourself to a minor, and I fuck 
                        Charlie’s brains out?

                                 ROGER
                        Or, what if... you and Simone both 
                        show yours to me, and to each other, 
                        and Charlie just goes away?

           Kate rolls her eyes but can’t help but smile a little.

           ANGLE ON Danny and Annie who follow them down the aisle.  
           Michael and Linda wave from their pew and whisper-shout:

                                 MICHAEL
                        Danny!

                                 LINDA
                        You look very handsome!

                                 DANNY
                                (small wave)
                        Hey, guys.
                                (to Annie)
                        My parents.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wanna show you my parking spot!

                                 LINDA
                        Michael!

                                 MICHAEL
                        It used to be a handicapped zone, 
                        but they changed it!  You can still 
                        see some of the blue paint!

           Danny shakes his head, then turns back to Annie:
                                 DANNY
                        By the way, where’s Keith?

           Annie grimaces.

           ANGLE ON Jeremy and Caroline who follow them down the aisle.

                                 JEREMY
                        That’s a very lovely dress.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You mean the one we’re all wearing?  
                        That your sister made us buy?  For 
                        seven-hundred dollars?  That I’m 
                        probably never gonna wear again?

                                 JEREMY
                        Yeah, but... you look nice in it.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Okay, thanks.

                                 JEREMY
                        I’m not usually this forward, but 
                        this being a wedding and all, true 
                        love and such--

                                 CAROLINE
                        How old are you?

                                 JEREMY
                        Seventeen.  True love and such, I 
                        thought maybe you could save me a 
                        dance tonight.  No strings, just a 
                        dance.  And if sparks fly, well 
                        then sparks fly.  I mean, you’re a 
                        man, I’m a woman-- Shit.  I mean, 
                        you’re a woman, I’m obviously a--

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know what you mean.  I have a 
                        boyfriend.

                                 JEREMY
                        Ahh, but not married?

                                 CAROLINE
                                (betraying a hint of strain)
                        No.  Not married.
           INT. CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER

           The BRIDE and GROOM stand in front of a PRIEST.  [NOTE: 
           during the ceremony, as with the rest of the movie, we only 
           see the Bride and Groom from behind, never actually seeing 
           their faces.]  Danny, Roger, Jeremy, and the groomsmen, and 
           Annie, Kate, Caroline, and the bridesmaids flank them on 
           either side.

                                 PRIEST
                        Dear friends and family, we are 
                        gathered here today...

           ANGLE ON Tim and Beth, sitting on a pew.

                                 TIM
                                (sotto)
                        I got them to put a bottle of 
                        champagne in our hotel room.  And 
                        one of those metal buckets filled 
                        with ice.

                                 BETH
                                (sotto)
                        That’s nice.

                                 TIM
                                (sotto)
                        There’s also a jacuzzi.  We can 
                        even drink the champagne in the 
                        jacuzzi.  Although they say not to 
                        get drunk in a jacuzzi, because you 
                        can have a stroke.  I think that’s 
                        how John Candy died.  But we’re 
                        both in pretty good shape.

           ANGLE BACK ON the altar.

                                 PRIEST
                        ...A brief moment in time and the 
                        scrawl of a pen are all that is 
                        required to create the legal bond 
                        of marriage, but it takes a 
                        lifetime of love, commitment, and 
                        compromise to make marriage durable 
                        and everlasting... 

                                 ROGER
                                (sotto, to Kate)
                        You look very beautiful, by the 
                        way.  I forgot to say that.
                                 KATE
                                (sotto)
                        Shhh.

                                 DANNY
                                (sotto, scolding)
                        Roger.

                                 ROGER
                                (sotto)
                        I’ve always liked that birthmark on 
                        your collarbone.  It’s very sexy.

           The Priest glares at Roger.  Kate subconsciously touches her 
           collarbone.

                                 ROGER (cont’d)
                                (to Priest)
                        Sorry... your grace.

           The Priest continues to look at him for a beat, annoyed, then:

                                 PRIEST
                                (to Bride)
                        Do you, Jessica, take Jason to be 
                        your partner in life, to support 
                        and respect him...

           ANGLE BACK ON Tim and Beth.  Tim takes her hand:

                                 TIM
                                (sotto)
                        Can you believe it’s been seven 
                        years since we were standing up 
                        there?  And you know what, honey?  
                        You’re just as beautiful right now 
                        as you were back then.  This is 
                        gonna be a really magical night.

                                 BETH
                                (sotto)
                        Tim, I want a divorce.

           ANGLE BACK ON the altar.

                                 PRIEST
                        Do you have the rings?

           The MAID OF HONOR holds out a ring to the Bride, and the 
           Bride takes it.  Danny and Roger both hold out a ring to the 
           Groom.  The Groom takes Roger’s.

                                 PRIEST (cont’d)
                        With this ring, I thee wed...
                                 DANNY
                                (sotto)
                        What the hell?

                                 ROGER
                                (sotto)
                        They gave me the real ring.  They 
                        thought you’d lose it.

                                 DANNY
                                (sotto)
                        That’s so messed up!

                                 ROGER
                                (sotto)
                        You barely made it to the ceremony.

           ANGLE BACK ON Tim and Beth.

                                 TIM
                                (sotto, half laughing)
                        I don’t-- I don’t understand?  Are 
                        you joking?  Is this a joke?

                                 BETH
                                (sotto)
                        This has been coming for a very 
                        long time.  We both knew it.

                                 TIM
                                (sotto)
                        I didn’t know it!

                                 BETH
                                (sotto)
                        Tim, we haven’t even had sex in 
                        eight months.

                                 TIM
                                (sotto)
                        What?  No.  It’s been six months.  
                        Remember?  Your birthday?

                                 BETH
                                (sotto)
                        You consider that sex?

                                 TIM
                                (sotto)
                        Well, yeah, it... it went in.

           ANGLE BACK ON the altar.
                                 PRIEST
                        I now pronounce you man and wife.  
                        You may kiss the bride.

           The Bride and Groom KISS.  The crowd CLAPS, and there are a 
           few CAMERA FLASHES and a couple “WOOO!”S.

                                 DANNY
                                (to Roger, re: fake ring)
                        Well, what the hell am I supposed 
                        to do with this?

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t know, whatever you want.

           RECESSIONAL MUSIC plays, and the Bride and Groom start back 
           up the aisle.  Danny SIGHS and turns to the bridesmaids:

                                 DANNY
                        Anyone want a wedding ring?

           He holds the ring out, right in front of Caroline.

                                 CAROLINE
                                (”help”)
                        Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                                (grabbing the ring)
                        I’ll take it.

           The bridesmaids and groomsmen pair off and start up the 
           aisle.  Ryan, having witnessed this from his seat, smiles 
           weakly at Caroline.  She smiles weakly back.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Is that your girlfriend, dear?

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah.

                                 LIONEL
                        You’re in for a long night.

           ANGLE BACK ON Tim and Beth.  Tim is devastated.

                                 TIM
                        I-- I can’t believe it.

                                 BETH
                        I’m sorry, but I’ve felt this way 
                        for a long time.
                                 TIM
                        But, I love you.

                                 BETH
                        I know, and it’s really annoying.

           ANGLE ON Michael and Linda, as the recessional passes them 
           and exits the church.

                                 LINDA
                        What a lovely ceremony.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I couldn’t see a damn thing, we 
                        should’ve changed seats.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           A delightful outdoor cocktail hour, at a suburban country 
           club.  It’s later, close to dusk.  A MALE GUITARIST plays an 
           ACOUSTIC VERSION OF THE BANGLES’ “ETERNAL FLAME,” while a 
           WAITER weaves his way through the CROWD with a tray of hors 
           d’oeuvres.  He stops in front of Danny and a YOUNG WOMAN.

                                 WAITER
                                (offering)
                        Seared Ahi tuna on wonton crisp?

                                 DANNY
                        Thank you, that looks delicious.

                                 WAITER
                                (offering)
                        Seared Ahi tuna on wonton crisp?

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        No thanks.

                                 DANNY
                        She’s bulimic.

           ANGLE ON Roger, Simone, Kate, and Charlie.

                                 KATE
                                (introducing)
                        Charlie, Roger.  Roger, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                                (shaking hands)
                        Hey, great to meet you!  Kate’s 
                        told me so much about you.
                                 ROGER
                        Really?  Did she tell you about the 
                        time we had sex on the deck of the 
                        Staten Island Ferry?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uhhh, no.

                                 KATE
                        But I did tell him about the time I 
                        walked in on you having sex with a 
                        waitress in our apartment.

                                 ROGER
                        In my defense, she was Native 
                        American.

                                 KATE
                        How is that in your defense?

                                 ROGER
                        We took their land, Kate.  I felt I 
                        owed her something.

                                 SIMONE
                                (extending her hand)
                        Hi, I’m Simone.

                                 KATE
                                (shakes hands)
                        Hi, sorry.  Kate.  I love your 
                        dress.

                                 SIMONE
                        Thank you.
                                (attempting to bond)
                        I was actually worried it was a 
                        little slutty.

                                 KATE
                        Well, you have the figure to pull 
                        it off.

                                 SIMONE
                        Oh.  Thanks.

                                 ROGER
                        Simone’s a yoga instructor.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Really?  I love yoga!  It’s 
                        increased my strength, my 
                        flexibility--
                                 ROGER
                        I’m more of a racket ball guy, 
                        myself.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I love racket ball, too!  We should 
                        play sometime.

                                 KATE
                        No, you shouldn’t.

                                 SIMONE
                        I play racket ball, too.  Roger’s 
                        teaching me.

                                 KATE
                                (to Charlie)
                        You’re not playing racket ball with 
                        either of them.

           ANGLE ON Jeremy.  He approaches TWO BRIDESMAIDS, drinks in 
           hand.

                                 JEREMY
                                (passing out the drinks)
                        Okay, one Jack and Diet, and one 
                        Grey Goose Cosmo with a lime twist 
                        and an orange wedge.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                                (impressed)
                        They served you?

                                 JEREMY
                        Of course.  I can be very smooth 
                        and devilishly charming when I need 
                        to be.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Oh my god, you’re so adorable.

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        Isn’t he?

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Totally.

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        Adorable.

                                 JEREMY
                        Like a puppy adorable?  Or like 
                        take me in the coat room and make 
                        me a man adorable?
                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                                (laughing)
                        That’s so funny!  You’re so cute!

                                 JEREMY
                                (laughing)
                        Thanks, but, no, I’m serious.

           ANGLE BACK ON Roger, Simone, Kate, and Charlie.

                                 ROGER
                        You know, Kate and I actually 
                        introduced the bride and groom.  
                        Back when we were dating.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No way.  I didn’t know that.

                                 SIMONE
                        I didn’t even know you guys dated.

                                 ROGER
                        Yup.  Kate’s the only girl to ever 
                        dump me.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, I can’t take all the credit for 
                        that.  Him being an asshole helped.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow.  You two have a real Sid and 
                        Nancy thing going on, huh?

                                 ROGER
                        Sid and Nancy, didn’t they end up 
                        together?

                                 KATE
                        He stabbed her to death and then 
                        died of a heroin overdose.

                                 ROGER
                        Ah.

                                 SIMONE
                        How long were you guys together?

                                 ROGER
                        Two years.

                                 KATE
                        A year and a half.
                                 ROGER
                        It felt like two.

                                 KATE
                        It felt like ten.

                                 ROGER
                        We had some good times.

                                 KATE
                        And some terrible times.

                                 ROGER
                        But it was never boring.

                                 KATE
                                (has to admit)
                        No... It was never boring.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB ENTRANCE - SAME

           Tim and Beth pull up in their car.  As the get out:

                                 TIM
                        This is insane!  You can’t just--

           Tim hands his keys to a VALET.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        Thank you.
                                (back to Beth)
                        You can’t just say--

                                 VALET #1
                        Your ticket, sir.

                                 TIM
                        Um, thanks.
                                (back to Beth)
                        You can’t just say, “I want a 
                        divorce and--”

                                 VALET #1
                        Have a nice evening, sir.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, fine, you too.
                                (back to Beth)
                        You can’t just--

                                 VALET #1
                        The reception is right through 
                        those doors.
                                 TIM
                        Do you mind?!  I’m having a marital 
                        situation here!

                                 VALET #1 
                        Good luck, sir.

                                 TIM
                        Thank you, I--

           The Valet CLOSES THE CAR DOOR and DRIVES OFF.  Tim turns back 
           to find Beth about to enter the club.  He chases after her.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        Beth!  You can’t just say, “I want 
                        a divorce,” and that’s it!  There 
                        has to be some kind of discussion!

                                 BETH
                                (turns around)
                        Fine.  Let’s discuss.

                                 TIM
                        Okay.  Well... Umm... I don’t want 
                        a divorce.

                                 BETH
                        That’s not how it works, Tim.  Only 
                        one person has to want it.

                                 TIM
                        But we belong together!

                                 BETH
                        No, we don’t.

                                 TIM
                        Yes, we do!

                                 BETH
                                (sighs)
                        Tim, you’re a wonderful man.

                                 TIM
                        Thank you.

                                 BETH
                        But you disgust me.

                                 TIM
                        Oh.  There was more to that thought.
                                 BETH
                        I look at you lying next to me in 
                        bed, and I just wanna throw up.  In 
                        your face.  And then smear it all 
                        over you.

                                 TIM
                        We could try counseling.

           Beth shakes her head.

                                 BETH
                        You’re a sweet, kind, excellent 
                        man.  But not for me.

           Beth enters the country club.  ANOTHER VALET sidles up to Tim.

                                 VALET #2
                        My brother got divorced.  He lives 
                        on a houseboat in Stamford.  I 
                        check in on him a couple times a 
                        week to make sure he hasn’t blown 
                        his brains out.  Half the time, I 
                        show up hoping he’s already done 
                        it, so he’s out of his misery.
                                (a beat, then)
                        You got someone who can check in on 
                        you a couple times a week?

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - SAME

           Annie orders a drink at the bar.

                                 ANNIE
                        Seven and Seven, please?

           A WOMAN approaches.

                                 WOMAN
                        Annie!  Hi!

                                 ANNIE
                        Hey, Becca.

                                 WOMAN
                        You looked so pretty up there.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, thank you.  That’s really sweet.

                                 WOMAN
                                (looking around)
                        Where’s Keith?
                                 ANNIE
                                (annoyed)
                        Um.  We, uh...
                                (then)
                        Actually, he has these terrible 
                        sores on his penis.  And the doctor 
                        won’t let him travel.

                                 WOMAN
                                (taken aback, disgusted)
                        Oh my god.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah.  The eruptions-- that’s what 
                        the doctor calls them, eruptions-- 
                        they happen whenever his groin gets 
                        warmer than about seventy-five 
                        degrees.  So sitting in a car, 
                        standing outside in the sun, 
                        walking briskly, he can’t do any of 
                        that.

                                 WOMAN
                        That’s... terrible.

                                 ANNIE
                        I know, the puss drips down his 
                        thigh, and then he’s at risk for 
                        further infection.  They think he 
                        got it from petting a sick dog and 
                        then masturbating.

                                 WOMAN
                        Jesus.

                                 ANNIE
                                (chipper)
                        I’ll tell him you said, “hi!”

                                 WOMAN
                                (very uncomfortable)
                        Yeah.  Okay.  Or, I guess, maybe 
                        tell him to feel better?  Or just 
                        don’t say anything at all.

           The Woman exits.  Annie smiles, very pleased with herself.  
           Just then, the bartender hands her a drink.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, thank you!

           Annie cheerfully sips through the straw.
                                 ANNIE (cont’d)
                        Yum.

           ANGLE ON Danny, who approaches a sketchy-look man.  This is 
           the bride’s creepy UNCLE VON (50s, long stringy blonde hair, 
           dark sunglasses which he will wear all night, very strange).

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, you’re Jessica’s Uncle Von, 
                        right?

                                 UNCLE VON
                        You a cop?

                                 DANNY
                        What?  No.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        You have to tell me if you’re a cop.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m not a cop, I’m Danny.  The best 
                        man.  I went to college with Jason.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Oh, cool, nice to meet you, Rashaad.

                                 DANNY
                                (as they shake hands)
                        Danny.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Totally, man.
                                (then)
                        Hey, have you seen a cat?

                                 DANNY
                                (confused)
                        Why?  Did you-- did you lose your 
                        cat?

                                 UNCLE VON
                        No.

           ANGLE ON the receiving line, where RYAN and CAROLINE speak 
           with the MOTHER OF THE BRIDE.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Congratulations, you must be 
                        thrilled.
                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (fishing)
                        Our little Jessica did pretty well, 
                        huh?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Absolutely.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        A doctor!

                                 CAROLINE
                        Well, a chiropractor.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        So...?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yes?

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        Hmm...?

                                 RYAN
                                (to Caroline)
                        What’s she doing?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I have no idea.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (leaning in obnoxiously)
                        Are you two next?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Oh.

                                 RYAN
                        Uhhh.

                                 CAROLINE
                        We...

                                 RYAN
                        We’re taking it slow.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        What for?!

                                 RYAN
                        Well, it’s kind of a major life 
                        decision.
                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        Nonsense!  I wanna be dancing at 
                        your wedding in a year!

                                 CAROLINE
                        That’s very sweet.

                                 RYAN
                        Not sure you’d be invited.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (to Ryan)
                        What’re you waiting for?!  You’ve 
                        gotta snatch this girl up!

                                 RYAN
                        I, uh, appreciate your concern--

                                 CAROLINE
                                (trying to escape)
                        We should probably go congratulate 
                        Jess.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (jostling Ryan’s arm)
                        She’s one of the good ones!

                                 RYAN
                                (getting annoyed)
                        Thank you.  I’ve always suspected 
                        she might be, but now that I’ve 
                        heard it from you, I’m convinced.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        You’d better be careful, young man, 
                        or Caroline’s gonna find a doctor 
                        of her own!

                                 CAROLINE
                        Chiropractor.

                                 MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
                        Seriously!  I don’t understand you 
                        kids!  You try and make everything 
                        so complicated!  Just get down on 
                        your knee and ask her to marry you!

                                 RYAN
                                (firmer)
                        Mrs. Ackerman, I’m trying to be as 
                        polite as possible, but please, I’m 
                        begging you, as a favor to me on 
                        your daughter’s wedding day, please 
                        mind your own fucking business.
           The mother of the bride’s eyes nearly pop out of her head.

                                 CAROLINE
                                (grabbing Ryan)
                        Okay!  Let’s sign the guest book.

           Caroline drags Ryan away from the finally speechless mother 
           of the bride.

           ANGLE ON Danny, drinking by himself.  Roger approaches him.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey.

                                 ROGER
                        Hey.

                                 DANNY
                        Have you met Jessica’s uncle?  I 
                        think he might be totally psychotic.

                                 ROGER
                        I think Kate’s still into me.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, I guess we’re talking about 
                        your thing.

                                 ROGER
                        There’s still a spark.  Maybe more.

                                 DANNY
                        And are you still into her?

                                 ROGER
                        Kate’s incredible.  She’s like no 
                        woman I’ve ever been with.

                                 DANNY
                        What about Simone?  She seems nice 
                        and has the hottest ass I’ve ever 
                        seen in my entire life.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, she’s phenomenal, but Kate’s 
                        different.  She’s Kate.

                                 DANNY
                        And she dumped you.

                                 ROGER
                        So?
                                 DANNY
                        I’m just saying, are you maybe into 
                        her because she doesn’t want you?

                                 ROGER
                        She does want me.  Haven’t you been 
                        listening?

           Uncle Von wedges himself in between Danny and Roger.

                                 UNCLE VON
                                (to Danny)
                        Hey, Rashaad, you and your friend 
                        wanna buy some angel dust?

                                 DANNY
                        No.  Thank you, no.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        I thought you said you weren’t a 
                        cop?

                                 DANNY
                        I’m not.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Okay, officer.

           Uncle Von exits.

                                 ROGER
                        That’s...?

                                 DANNY
                        Jessica’s uncle.

                                 ROGER
                        And why does he think you’re a cop 
                        named “Rashaad”?

                                 DANNY
                        I’m really not sure.

                                 ROGER
                        Okay, well, what about Kate?

                                 DANNY
                        Kate??  Roger, even if Kate does 
                        want you, are you sure that’s a 
                        good thing?  You guys fought all 
                        the time.

                                 ROGER
                        We had a fiery relationship.
                                 DANNY
                        You know who you guys are?  If you 
                        get back together, in thirty years, 
                        you’re my parents.

                                 ROGER
                        Your parents have been married for 
                        half a lifetime.  They have a 
                        terrific relationship.

                                 DANNY
                        They bicker all the time.

                                 ROGER
                        They’re never boring.

           ANGLE ON Michael and Linda, at a table of sushi.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What is this?

                                 LINDA
                        Michael, don’t touch it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I didn’t touch it, I was pointing 
                        at it.

                                 LINDA
                        You touched it.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (to a nearby waiter)
                        Did I touch it?

                                 WAITER #2
                        I... I’d rather not get involved.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (to Linda)
                        See?

                                 LINDA
                        See what??

                                 MICHAEL
                        He says I didn’t touch it.

                                 LINDA
                        He didn’t say that!

                                 MICHAEL
                        I pointed at it!  Like this!  I 
                        didn’t touch it!
                                 LINDA
                        You just touched it again!!

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, I didn’t!

                                 LINDA
                                (to the waiter)
                        You must’ve seen it that time.  
                        Tell him he touched it.

                                 WAITER #2
                        I really couldn’t...

                                 LINDA
                        It’s your job!

                                 WAITER #2
                        I’m-- I’m just supposed to clear 
                        the little plates.

                                 LINDA
                        You know what?  I’m sorry.  I 
                        apologize.  I didn’t mean to make 
                        you feel uncomfortable.

                                 WAITER #2
                        Thank you.

                                 LINDA
                        And it’s not important if my 
                        husband touched the sushi or not.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I didn’t touch it!

                                 LINDA
                        Michael!  It doesn’t matter.
                                (then, sotto, to waiter)
                        But, please, young man, just 
                        between you and me...?

                                 WAITER #2
                                (a beat, then)
                        He touched it.

                                 LINDA
                        Aha!!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fine!!  I touched it!!  But what 
                        the hell is it?!?!
                                 WAITER #2
                        Spicy tuna roll topped with crab 
                        meat and avocado.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thank you!!

           ANGLE ON Ryan and Caroline, as Ryan signs the guest book.

                                 RYAN
                        “Congratulations, you two crazy 
                        lovebirds.  Wishing you a lifetime 
                        of happiness.  Best, Ryan McGowan.  
                        P.S. Sorry I cursed at your mom.”

                                 CAROLINE
                        We’re gonna have to get them a 
                        nicer gift.

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah.

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Roger.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, let me ask you something.  For 
                        my toast...

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah?

                                 DANNY
                        I’m thinking of using the word 
                        “pussy.”  What do you think?

                                 ROGER
                        In what context?  Referring to 
                        cowardice or vagina?

                                 DANNY
                        Vagina.

                                 ROGER
                        I think it’s a great idea.

           Tim approaches them, distraught.

                                 TIM
                        You guys, I-- I can’t believe I’m 
                        saying this, but-- Beth-- she--

                                 DANNY
                        Whoa.  What’s wrong, man?
                                 TIM
                        Beth wants a divorce.

                                 ROGER
                        Oh, yeah.  Who’s the guy?

                                 DANNY
                        Is it someone you know?

                                 TIM
                        What?!

                                 ROGER
                        Or did she just say she wanted a 
                        divorce and not mention the guy?

                                 DANNY
                                (to Roger)
                        Well, there might not be a guy.

                                 ROGER
                        I think there’s probably a guy.

                                 TIM
                        What the fuck, you guys?!

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sorry, should we be more 
                        surprised?

                                 TIM
                        Yes!!

                                 ROGER
                        Why?  You two haven’t had sex in 
                        six months--

                                 TIM
                        Apparently, eight.

                                 ROGER
                        Okay, eight months.  And you never 
                        look each other in the eye.  You 
                        barely spend any time together--

                                 TIM
                        That’s not true.

                                 ROGER
                        When’s the last time you guys were 
                        alone together?  Not in the car.  
                        Not watching TV.  Just you and 
                        Beth.  Alone together.
           As Tim says the following, he realizes how pathetic it is:

                                 TIM
                        We went to Target last month, and 
                        we showed up before the store 
                        opened, so we had to stand outside 
                        for a couple minutes.

                                 DANNY
                        Fuck.

                                 TIM
                        How am I the only one who didn’t 
                        see this coming?!

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sorry, man.  I really am.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, it sucks, but we’re gonna get 
                        you through this.  I promise.

                                 TIM
                        Thanks.

           They all hug, a bit awkwardly, in tuxedo jackets and whatnot.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, there we go.  Man hug.  Bring 
                        it in.

                                 TIM
                        You guys are the best.

                                 DANNY
                        We’re buddies.  This is what we do.

                                 TIM
                        I know.

           They break the hug.  Danny turns to Roger, realizing:

                                 DANNY
                        You know who I bet it is?!  That 
                        guy who did their kitchen and kept 
                        telling Beth she had a great body!

                                 ROGER
                        Yes!

           Tim slams his face into his hands and starts BAWLING.

                                 TIM
                        Aaaa!
           ANGLE ON Kate.  She brings a plate of hors d’oeuvres to 
           Lionel and Dottie who sit at a table.

                                 KATE
                        Here you go.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Oh, thank you.  You’re such a 
                        sweetheart.

           Kate sits, as Lionel takes apart a skewer.

                                 LIONEL
                        Dottie only likes the tomatoes, and 
                        I only like the mozzarella.

                                 DOTTIE
                        This way, I get all the tomatoes I 
                        want.

                                 LIONEL
                        And I get all the mozzarella.

                                 DOTTIE
                        And we don’t waste.

                                 LIONEL
                        Dottie doesn’t like waste.

                                 KATE
                        You guys make it seem so easy.

                                 LIONEL
                        It is easy.

                                 DOTTIE
                        As long as you don’t get carried 
                        away with the little things.

                                 KATE
                        But aren’t the little things what 
                        it’s all about?  Sharing appetizers?  
                        Holding her lipstick?

                                 LIONEL
                        No.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Little things are little.

                                 LIONEL
                        Exactly.
                                 DOTTIE
                        Except for Ryan Seacrest.  He’s 
                        very little, but he’s a big star.

                                 LIONEL
                        Ryan Seacrest is the exception that 
                        proves the rule.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Well said, sweetheart.

                                 LIONEL
                        In the end, all that matters is, do 
                        you love her?

                                 DOTTIE
                                (taking Lionel’s hand)
                        That’s right.  When he walks into 
                        the room and smiles, does it make 
                        your day?

           Lionel and Dottie smile at each other.  Kate looks over at 
           Roger, who stands with Danny and Tim.  Roger catches her eye, 
           and she looks away.

                                 LIONEL
                        Also, sex is important.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Once a week.

                                 LIONEL
                        Once a week.

           EXT./ESTAB. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

           The sun is going down.  The two valets from earlier lean 
           against a Prius and stealthily share a joint.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           Guests enter and check the place card table.  The room is 
           arranged with tables surrounding a dance floor on three 
           sides.  In front of the dance floor is a stage with THE BAND.  
           The female lead singer, LARISSA (20s, sexy, flirty, rock and 
           roll), sings an edgy, sultry version of CHEAP TRICK’S “I WANT 
           YOU TO WANT ME.”

                                 LARISSA
                        I WANT YOU TO WANT ME / I NEED YOU 
                        TO NEED ME / I’D LOVE YOU TO LOVE 
                        ME / I’M BEGGIN’ YOU TO BEG ME...
           One guest, a man in his 30s, is already busting a move on the 
           dance floor, all by himself.  This is THE DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T 
           STOP DANCING.  We’ll get to know him more later.

           ANGLE ON the entrance to the ballroom.  Danny and Tim enter.

                                 TIM
                        Oh my god, I just realized... Beth 
                        and I are gonna be seated at the 
                        same table.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sure we can squeeze you in 
                        someplace else.

                                 TIM
                        No, that’s good.  I’m gonna make a 
                        romantic gesture.

                                 DANNY
                                (skeptical)
                        You think that’s gonna help?

                                 TIM
                        I am in crisis!  I need a romantic 
                        gesture!

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know, Tim.  Maybe just lay 
                        low tonight.  Give Beth a little 
                        time to--
                                (noticing Larissa)
                        Time to... Who... Who’s that?

           ANGLE ON Larissa singing.  She’s totally foxy.

                                 LARISSA
                        DIDN’T I, DIDN’T I, DIDN’T I SEE YOU 
                        CRYIN’? / I WANT YOU TO WANT ME...

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Tim.

                                 TIM
                        Considering she’s on stage singing 
                        with the wedding band, I’m gonna 
                        guess she’s the wedding singer.

                                 DANNY
                        She’s sexy as hell.

                                 TIM
                        I guess.  Yeah.
                                 DANNY
                        I’m gonna... I’m gonna watch the 
                        band for a minute, okay?  You don’t 
                        do anything crazy.  I’ll be here... 
                        Watching the band.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I think maybe I will do 
                        something crazy.

                                 DANNY
                                (totally distracted)
                        That’s the spirit, tiger.

           Tim exits.

           ANGLE ON Annie at the place card table.  She locates her 
           place card.  ANGLE ON the card.  It reads: “Ms. Annie Rice & 
           Mr. Keith Barrett”.  ANGLE BACK ON Annie.  She sighs.

           ANGLE ON a table with FOUR COUPLES.

                                 COUPLE MAN #1
                        So we’re like, “Next time, we’ll 
                        have you guys over, we’ll forget 
                        about the dessert, and just drink 
                        twice as much wine!”

           The table BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER.

                                 COUPLE MAN #1 (cont’d)
                                (laughing)
                        Isn’t that what we said, honey?!

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #1
                                (laughing)
                        It is!

                                 COUPLE MAN #1
                                (laughing)
                        It’s what we said!

           Annie approaches the table.

                                 COUPLE MAN #1 (cont’d)
                        Annie!

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #2
                        Are you sitting here?!

                                 ANNIE
                                (holds up her card)
                        Yup.
                                 COUPLE WOMAN #2
                        That’s so great!

                                 COUPLE MAN #2
                        Where’s Keith?

                                 ANNIE
                        Keith, um... he’s had explosive 
                        diarrhea for three straight weeks.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #3
                        Oh god.

                                 COUPLE MAN #2
                        Explosive diarrhea?

                                 ANNIE
                        The doctors say he may need skin 
                        grafts on his anus.

                                 COUPLE MAN #1
                        Holy shit.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah, his bowel acids have eaten 
                        away at his anal skin to the point 
                        where it’s not gonna heal without 
                        medical intervention.  It kind of 
                        looks like a chemical burn, but 
                        with more bubbles and pustules.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #2
                        That’s revolting.

                                 ANNIE
                        You actually kinda get used to the 
                        looks of it.  What really turns my 
                        stomach, though, are the blood-
                        curdling screams every time he 
                        voids himself.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #1
                        Oh my.

                                 ANNIE
                        And, of course, the smell of 
                        corroding ass flesh.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #3
                                (standing and exiting)
                        Excuse me.
                                 ANNIE
                        Also, as you can imagine, he can’t 
                        be more than five or ten feet from 
                        a toilet at all times.  We tried to 
                        go to the movies last week, and he 
                        exploded all over the parking 
                        garage.
                                (fake emotional)
                        It’s really hard to see someone you 
                        love crying, and covered in diarrhea 
                        from the waist down.

                                 COUPLE MAN #4
                        Poor guy.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #2
                        Poor Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        Does anyone else have any questions 
                        about Keith?

                                 COUPLE MAN #2
                        No.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #1
                        No.

                                 COUPLE MAN #1
                        No.

                                 COUPLE MAN #3
                        I don’t even know him.  And I hope 
                        that I never meet him.

           Annie tries to suppress a smile, then notices a party favor 
           on the table:

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, look!  A chocolate turtle in 
                        sand made of brown sugar!  That’s 
                        so cute!

           ANGLE ON Jeremy who walks up to a table, place card in hand.  
           The table is populated by a bunch of GRADE SCHOOL AGED KIDS.  
           The only other teenager there is PEPPER (16, pretty, smart).

                                 JEREMY
                        Table fourteen?

                                 PEPPER
                        Yup.  I think it’s the “kids table.”
           Jeremy looks over at another table where the two bridesmaids 
           from earlier flirt with a couple of guys.

                                 PEPPER (cont’d)
                                (extending her hand)
                        I’m Pepper.

                                 JEREMY
                        Oh, yeah.  I’m Jeremy.  Jessica’s 
                        brother.

                                 PEPPER
                        I know.
                                (then)
                        My parents think they’re pretty 
                        radical.

                                 JEREMY
                        Excuse me?

                                 PEPPER
                        “Pepper.”  Kind of a funky name.  
                        Seems better for a dog.  Or a 
                        really old African American jazz 
                        guitarist.  I used to tell people 
                        my name was Jennifer.

                                 JEREMY
                        I used to tell people my sister was 
                        born a hermaphrodite.

           Pepper LAUGHS.

                                 JEREMY (cont’d)
                        My friend’s parents actually 
                        believed me until I told them we 
                        kept her penis in a jar in the 
                        basement.

                                 PEPPER
                        That’s really twisted.

                                 JEREMY
                        Well, she used to dress me up in 
                        tights and a miniskirt, so I 
                        consider us even.

           Pepper smiles at him.

           ANGLE ON Beth sitting at her table.  Tim approaches holding a 
           handful of centerpiece flowers.
                                 TIM
                        Beth Hubbard, I am your husband, I 
                        love you, and I refuse to let you 
                        give up on us.

                                 BETH
                        Tim, please don’t.

                                 TIM
                        I know you think we’re broken and we 
                        can’t be fixed, but I can fix us.
                                (offering flowers)
                        Let me fix us.

                                 BETH
                        Did you take these flowers from one 
                        of the tables?

                                 TIM
                        Yes.

                                 BETH
                        Please put them back.

                                 TIM
                        Not until you agree to give me 
                        another chance.

                                 BETH
                        I can’t do that.

                                 TIM
                        Please.

                                 BETH
                        No.

                                 TIM
                        I beseech you.

                                 BETH
                        You “beseech” me?

                                 TIM
                        Look at me, Beth...

           Tim drops to his knees.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        I’m down on my knees, in my best 
                        suit, begging you.
                                 BETH
                        Tim, stop it.

                                 TIM
                        Please, Beth!  Please don’t leave 
                        me!  I need you!  I love you!

           Everyone at their table and the tables surrounding them turns 
           to look.  ANGLE ON Roger and Simone at a nearby table.

                                 ROGER
                        Oh, Timmy.

                                 SIMONE
                        Roger, do something.

           ANGLE BACK ON Tim and Beth.  He grabs the hem of her dress.

                                 TIM
                        I’ll do anything you want!  I’ll 
                        start working out!  I’ll get sick 
                        ab muscles!

                                 BETH
                        That’s not--

                                 TIM
                        I’ll get that upper groin triangle 
                        muscle that Australian guys have!

           Roger grabs Tim by the arm.

                                 ROGER
                        Tim, get up.  Come on.  Let go of 
                        her dress.

                                 BETH
                        Thank you, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        I’m not on your side.

                                 TIM
                                (to Beth, calming down)
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry, I didn’t 
                        mean to embarrass you.
                                (then)
                        I’ll buy you a Land Rover.

           Beth exits.  Uncle Von leans over from his table:
                                 UNCLE VON
                        You need a good divorce lawyer or a 
                        drifter to stab your wife?  ‘Cause 
                        I’ve got a guy for both.

           INT. BALLROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON Larissa with the microphone as the band launches 
           into “SHOUT” IN THE STYLE OF JOAN JETT’S BADASS COVER.

                                 LARISSA
                        WELLLLLLL... YOU KNOW YOU MAKE ME 
                        WANNA SHOUT! / THROW MY HANDS UP, 
                        SHOUT!...

           ANGLE ON the dance floor, as guests race out to dance.  Kate 
           and Charlie.  Roger and Simone.  Ryan and Caroline.  TWO 
           TWENTY-SOMETHING GIRLS dance together sexily:

                                 DANCING GIRL #1
                        Woohoo!

                                 DANCING GIRL #2
                        Shout!

           The douchebag who won’t stop dancing bounces around the floor 
           asking various girls to dance:

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Wanna dance?  Wanna dance?  Dance?  
                        Dance?  Dance?  Dance?

           Linda drags Michael onto the dance floor.  Uncle Von grinds 
           with two PRETTY YOUNG LADIES:

                                 PRETTY YOUNG LADY #1
                        He’s so cute!

                                 PRETTY YOUNG LADY #2
                        He’s Jessica’s uncle!

                                 PRETTY YOUNG LADY #1
                                (to Uncle Von)
                        Can I try on your sunglasses?

                                 UNCLE VON
                                (still grinding)
                        No.

           ANGLE ON Jeremy and Pepper sitting at the kids table.

                                 PEPPER
                        This band kinda rocks.
                                 JEREMY
                        Yeah.

                                 PEPPER
                        Do you maybe wanna dance?

                                 JEREMY
                        Uh--

                                 BRIDESMAID #1 (O.S.)
                        Jeremy!  There you are!

           The two bridesmaids from earlier grab Jeremy by the arm.

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        We wanna dance!

                                 JEREMY
                        Okay!

           As the bridesmaids drag Jeremy toward the dance floor, he 
           mouths “sorry” to Pepper.  Pepper frowns.  TREVOR (12, a 
           precocious dork) turns to her.  

                                 TREVOR
                        If you’re lookin’ for a dude to 
                        dance with, I got moves.

                                 PEPPER
                        Thanks, I’m good.

                                 TREVOR
                        Okay, well if you change your mind, 
                        I’ll be here making fake puke.

           Trevor pours some soda onto his plate and mixes it up with 
           his bread and salad.  Pepper cringes.

                                 TREVOR (cont’d)
                        Looks pretty real, huh?

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...YOU MAKE ME WANNA SHOUT! / KICK 
                        MY SHOES OFF, SHOUT! / THROW MY 
                        HANDS UP, SHOUT! / TAKE MY PANTS 
                        OFF, SHOUT!...

           ANGLE BACK ON the dance floor.  Everyone’s having a terrific 
           time.

                                 LINDA
                        Michael, lift up your feet!
                                 MICHAEL
                        I am!

           Roger twirls Simone.  He can really dance.  Kate watches out 
           of the corner of her eye.  Danny dances with a woman, but he 
           can’t take his eyes off Larissa.  Jeremy dances with the two 
           bridesmaids, getting low to the ground:

                                 JEREMY/BRIDESMAID #1/BRIDESMAID #2
                        A LITTLE BIT SOFTER NOW, SHOUT / A 
                        LITTLE BIT SOFTER NOW, SHOUT...

           Michael and Linda also get low to the ground.  Michael 
           clutches his back in pain.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ooooh!

           The douchebag who won’t stop dancing is super low to the 
           ground and way too into it.

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW, SHOUT! 
                        / A LITTLE BIT LOUDER NOW, SHOUT! / 
                        HEYY-EYY-EYY-EYY!...

           ANGLE BACK ON the dance floor.

                                 EVERYONE
                        HEYY-EYY-EYY-EYY!

           Uncle Von is still grinding with the pretty young ladies:

                                 PRETTY YOUNG LADY #1
                        I’m getting a little freaked out.

                                 PRETTY YOUNG LADY #2
                        Me too.

           Jeremy twirls one of the bridesmaids.  Roger dips Simone.  
           Kate kisses Charlie.  The douchebag does a split.

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...JUMP UP AND SHOUT NOW / A LITTLE 
                        SHOUT NOW / YEAHHH!

           The guitarist SLAMS THE FINAL CHORDS, and the room ERUPTS IN 
           APPLAUSE.  Larissa smiles.  Danny CLAPS extra hard.
           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           Two cars SPEED DIRECTLY AT EACH OTHER on the straight part of 
           the driveway.  At the last moment, one of cars SWERVES TO THE 
           SIDE, avoiding a head-on collision.  Both cars SCREECH TO A 
           STOP.  A valet hops out of each car.

                                 VALET #1
                        Dammit!

                                 VALET #2
                                (arms raised, victorious)
                        Pussy!

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           Danny watches intently, as Larissa sings a touching version 
           of ROBERTA FLACK’S “KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS SONG”.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...STRUMMING MY PAIN WITH HIS 
                        FINGERS / SINGING MY LIFE WITH HIS 
                        WORDS / KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS 
                        SONG / KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS 
                        SONG...

           ANGLE ON Kate and Charlie dancing.  Roger approaches.

                                 ROGER
                        May I cut in?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure, I’ll hit the bar.
                                (to Kate)
                        Scotch, rocks?

                                 KATE
                        Perfect.

           Charlie KISSES Kate and hands her off to Roger.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Love you.

           Charlie exits.  Roger and Kate dance.

                                 ROGER
                        Nice wedding.

                                 KATE
                        Beautiful.
                                 ROGER
                        I think you’re still hung up on me.

                                 KATE
                        Is that so?

                                 ROGER
                        Yup.

                                 KATE
                        Well, you’re wrong.

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t think so.

                                 KATE
                        I’m happy with Charlie.  He’s an 
                        adult.  And he doesn’t feel the 
                        need to have sex with every girl 
                        who’s ever existed.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, but can he do this?

           Roger twirls Kate, then pulls her back in tight with a 
           flourish.  One can’t deny, they move well together.

                                 KATE
                                (very close)
                        There’s more to life than that.

                                 ROGER
                                (still close)
                        Yeah, but it’s a good start.

           ANGLE ON Lionel and Dottie who watch them.

                                 LIONEL
                        Such a nice couple.

                                 DOTTIE
                        I don’t think that’s her boyfriend.

                                 LIONEL
                        Oh, well then she’s a tramp.

           INT. BALLROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           The band plays an INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF GUNS N’ ROSES’ 
           “NOVEMBER RAIN”, as Larissa steps down from the stage and 
           grabs a glass of water.  Danny approaches.
                                 DANNY
                        Hi.  I’m Danny.  The best man.

                                 LARISSA
                        Larissa.

           They shake hands.

                                 DANNY
                        You guys kick ass.

                                 LARISSA
                        Thank you.

                                 DANNY
                        Um, for my toast, is it okay if I 
                        go last?

                                 LARISSA
                        Sure, but that’s a pretty bold 
                        move.  Requesting last.

                                 DANNY
                        I’m pretty confident.

                                 LARISSA
                        It’s a good toast?

                                 DANNY
                        You know it’s gonna push the 
                        envelope.  I think it’ll take 
                        people on a ride, and they’ll be 
                        like, “Wow, I never thought I’d go 
                        there, and I always assumed I 
                        didn’t even want to go there, but 
                        now that I am there, thank you.  
                        Thank you, Danny.”

                                 LARISSA
                                (smiles, warming)
                        Well, now I’m intrigued.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, do you take requests?

                                 LARISSA
                        Sure.

                                 DANNY
                                (flirting)
                        Ohhh, that was a test.  You never 
                        take requests from anybody but the 
                        bride and groom and their parents.
                                 LARISSA
                        But you’re the best man!

                                 DANNY
                        That doesn’t mean you can trust me.

                                 LARISSA
                        Okay, well, just out of curiosity, 
                        what would you have requested?

                                 DANNY
                        I don’t know...

                                 LARISSA
                        Come on, I wanna know.  You can 
                        tell a lot about a guy by the song 
                        he requests.

                                 DANNY
                        Well, I guess... “Paradise by the 
                        Dashboard Light.”

                                 LARISSA
                                (laughs)
                        Oh my god.  What are you, a twelve-
                        year-old girl?

                                 DANNY
                                (taps his heart)
                        In here, yes, I am.

           Larissa LAUGHS again, charmed.

           ANGLE ON Ryan and Caroline at their table, eating salads.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Jessica looks really pretty.

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah.

                                 CAROLINE
                        And they seem happy.

                                 RYAN
                        Yes, very.  I’m happy for them.  
                        Happy they’re happy.  You look 
                        really pretty.

                                 CAROLINE
                        What?
                                 RYAN
                        Jessica looks really pretty, but so 
                        do you.  A little prettier.

           Caroline winces.  Now she’s toying with him.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You’re not supposed to look 
                        prettier than a bride on her 
                        wedding day.

                                 RYAN
                        Okay, well, then you look like one 
                        tenth of one percent less pretty 
                        than Jessica.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I’m not as pretty as Jessica?!

                                 RYAN
                        Oh, come on!

                                 CAROLINE
                        What?

                                 RYAN
                        You’re fucking with me!

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yup.

                                 RYAN
                        Look, can we please just have our 
                        fight now and get it over with?  
                        Then we can get on with our night 
                        and dance and have fun.

                                 CAROLINE
                        No, it’s my friend’s wedding.  I 
                        don’t wanna fight.

                                 RYAN
                        Well, I think that’s just really 
                        inconsiderate.

           Ryan goes back to his salad.

           ANGLE ON on the stage.  Larissa holds up her microphone.

                                 LARISSA
                                (husky, Jon Bon Jovi)
                        Once upon a time, not so long ago...

           The band hammers out BON JOVI’S “LIVIN’ ON A PRAYER.”
                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        TOMMY USED TO WORK ON THE DOCKS / 
                        UNION’S BEEN ON STRIKE / HE’S DOWN 
                        ON HIS LUCK / IT’S TOUGH, SO 
                        TOUGH...

           ANGLE ON the dance floor.  Beth dances with SOME GUY.

           ANGLE ON Tim, Roger, and Simone who stand near the edge of 
           the dance floor, watching them.

                                 ROGER
                        Who is that?

                                 TIM
                        I have no idea.

                                 ROGER
                        That’s probably the dude she’s 
                        sleeping with.  You should go over 
                        there and punch him in the face.

                                 SIMONE
                        Be nice.

                                 TIM
                                (to Roger)
                        You really think there’s another 
                        guy?

                                 ROGER
                        Nobody goes eight months without 
                        having sex.

                                 SIMONE
                        I once went a year and a half 
                        without having sex.

                                 ROGER
                        Nobody believes that.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, no way.

           Danny joins them.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, I was very wise not to bring a 
                        date.  Larissa, the wedding singer, 
                        I think she likes me.

                                 SIMONE
                        Nice, she’s hot.
                                 DANNY
                        We had a very pleasant back and 
                        forth.  Serious chemistry.

                                 ROGER
                        You asshole, she doesn’t like you.  
                        She’s the wedding singer.  She’s 
                        paid to flirt with the guests.  
                        She’s like a hooker.

                                 DANNY
                        What?  No.

                                 TIM
                        He’s kinda right.

                                 SIMONE
                        Well, now hold on.  Just because 
                        she’s paid to like him doesn’t mean 
                        she can’t really like him.

                                 DANNY
                        She’s not paid to like me!

                                 ROGER
                        Listen to yourself.  You’re like 
                        one of those idiots who goes to a 
                        strip club and thinks the stripper 
                        on his lap is in love with him.

           During the previous line, the douchebag who won’t stop dancing 
           comes up behind Simone and starts freaking her from behind.

                                 SIMONE
                                (turning around)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Dancing.

                                 SIMONE
                        We’re in the middle of a 
                        conversation.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                                (never stops dancing)
                        You’re on the dance floor, your 
                        heel’s on the wood, you’re fair 
                        game.  Boom.  That’s the lawn 
                        mower.  I’m doin’ the lawn mower.  
                        Wave to the neighbors.  Wave to the 
                        neighbors.  Back to the lawn.  Back 
                        to the lawn.
           ANGLE ON Larissa, as the band finishes:

                                 LARISSA
                        ...TAKE MY HAND, AND WE’LL MAKE IT 
                        I SWEAR / WHOA LIVIN’ ON A PRAYER

            The guests APPLAUD.

                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        Thank you.  Thanks.  We appreciate 
                        it.  Now... if you’re single, and 
                        you’re a woman, please gather on 
                        the dance floor, because the bride 
                        is about to throw the bouquet.

           ANGLE ON Ryan and Caroline’s table.  The two bridesmaids who 
           were dancing with Jeremy grab Caroline by each arm.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Come on, Caroline!  Bouquet!

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        I bet you catch it!

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        She’s totally gonna catch it!

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        Not if I catch it!

                                 CAROLINE
                        Guys, I don’t--

           But it’s too late, they’ve got her.

           ANGLE ON the stage.  The bride turns around (we just miss her 
           face) and tosses the bouquet over her back.  The bouquet 
           soars through the air and... SOME RANDOM WOMAN catches it.  
           The woman then turns to Caroline and offers the bouquet.

                                 RANDOM WOMAN
                                (sympathetic)
                        Here, sweetie.  I hear you 
                        need this more than I do.

           ANGLE ON Ryan.  He shuts his eyes in pain.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           The valets remove an airbag from the steering wheel of a 
           Lexus.  We hear a CLINKING sound O.S.
           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON a fork TAPPING a wine glass.  ANGLE ON the father of 
           the bride who stands on stage with a microphone.

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                        Dear friends, beloved family, I 
                        can’t tell you how proud I am to 
                        have seen Jessica grow into such a 
                        fine young woman...

           ANGLE ON Annie and Caroline at the bar.

                                 ANNIE
                                (to bartender)
                        Seven and Seven, please.

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                        And I’m doubly proud to see her 
                        choose such a fine young man to be 
                        her husband.  Jason, welcome to the 
                        family.  And now, let us all lower 
                        our heads in silent prayer and 
                        thank God Almighty...

           ANGLE ON Jeremy and Pepper.

                                 JEREMY
                        And Bruce Almighty.

                                 PEPPER
                        And Evan Almighty.

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                        ...for allowing this blessed union 
                        to take place.

           The father of the bride closes his eyes and bows his head.  
           The guests all follow suit, just as the bartender hands Annie 
           her drink.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ooop.  Thank you.

           Annie bows her head.

           ANGLE ON Michael and Linda, their heads bowed.  Michael 
           LOUDLY SUCKS SOME FOOD FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH.
                                 LINDA
                                (sotto)
                        Shhh!

                                 MICHAEL
                                (sotto)
                        Nobody can hear that!

           ANGLE ON Kate and Charlie, their heads bowed.  Charlie holds 
           Kate’s hand.

           ANGLE ON Roger and Simone, their heads bowed.  Under the 
           table, Roger slides his hand between Simone’s legs.  Simone 
           playfully swats it away.

           ANGLE ON Lionel and Dottie, their heads bowed.  Under the 
           table, Lionel slides his hand between Dottie’s legs.  Dottie 
           does not protest at all.  In fact, she smiles a little.

           ANGLE ON Caroline, her head bowed.  She glances to her side 
           at Annie whose head is bowed, but she’s NOISILY SLURPING her 
           Seven and Seven through a straw.

           ANGLE ON Uncle Von, his head bowed.  He lifts the crook of 
           his hand up to his nose and SNORTS something.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Oh, god, god, yes, thank you, god.

           ANGLE ON Tim, his head bowed.  He raises his eyes and looks 
           over at Beth’s table.  Beth’s head is bowed.  The guy she was 
           dancing with sits right next to her.

           ANGLE ON Jeremy and Pepper, their heads bowed.

                                 JEREMY
                        I’m praying they serve dinner soon.

           Pepper LAUGHS.  The father of the bride throws them a stern 
           look.

           INT. BALLROOM - LATER

           The MAID OF HONOR now stands on stage with a microphone.  She 
           is mid-speech.  And she is terrible.

                                 MAID OF HONOR
                        ...Jess and I have known each other 
                        so long.  You don’t understand how 
                        close we are.  We are like sisters.  
                        It’s like insane how close we are...

           ANGLE ON Ryan and Danny near the bar.
                                 DANNY
                        Hey, man.  Caroline bitch you out, 
                        yet?

                                 RYAN
                        No, she doesn’t wanna fight at her 
                        friend’s wedding.
                                (then, realizing)
                        Wait, how do you know she’s gonna 
                        bitch me out?

                                 DANNY
                        You’re at a wedding, you’re not 
                        engaged, and you’ve been dating for 
                        two years.

                                 RYAN
                        Three years.

                                 DANNY
                        Three years?  Oh man, good luck.

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.

                                 MAID OF HONOR
                        Jess, you remember Cancun? 
                                (inside joke)
                        Margaritas!!  Oh my god, that was 
                        the funnest time!
                                (then, suddenly somber)
                        I can’t believe Amy’s dead.
                                (bursts into tears)
                        We never should’ve let her go 
                        scuba diving!!

           The maid of honor BREAKS DOWN SOBBING.  The two bridesmaids 
           appear and escort her off stage.  As they drag her off:

                                 MAID OF HONOR (cont’d)
                        Jess, you’re the best!  You’re the 
                        beeeeeest!

           ANGLE ON Roger and Simone.  Roger CLAPS.

                                 ROGER
                        That was a fucking abortion.

           INT. BALLROOM - LATER

           Danny now stands on stage with a microphone and a beer.
                                 DANNY
                        ...Let’s face it, folks, Jessica’s 
                        too good for Jason.

           The crowd, including the father of the bride, LAUGHS.

                                 DANNY (cont’d)
                        Seriously, she’s better than him.

           More POLITE CHUCKLES.

                                 DANNY (cont’d)
                        I mean, think about it.  He’s a 
                        chiropractor, and she’s an actual 
                        real-life doctor with a stethoscope 
                        and everything.

           More POLITE LAUGHS and few GOOD NATURED “OHHH!”S, as if Danny 
           has really burned Jason.

                                 DANNY (cont’d)
                        And that’s not all.  Jessica’s an 
                        obstetrician, so she’s gotten way 
                        more pussy than Jason.  Not mention 
                        in college, when she went through 
                        her Enya and fingering phase.

           ANGLE ON the crowd.  Everyone is silent, puzzled, horrified.  
           The father of the bride looks completely disgusted.

                                 UNCLE VON
                                (in the distance)
                        Ha!

           ANGLE ON Larissa whose jaw drops in an amused, shocked smile.

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        But all kidding aside, doesn’t Jess 
                        look beautiful tonight?

           The crowd TENTATIVELY CLAPS, hoping this was just an isolated 
           lapse in judgement.

                                 DANNY (cont’d)
                        I swear, even the priest got a boner.  
                        Although, he may have been looking at 
                        the ring bearer.  Cute kid.

           The crowd looks appalled again.  We hear a few GROANS.

                                 RANDOM GUESTS
                        Come on! / Not cool! / That’s my son!
           ANGLE ON the priest who sits at one of the tables.  He looks 
           at the other guests, confused.  “What did he mean by that?”

           ANGLE ON Uncle Von who LAUGHS HIS ASS OFF.

                                 UNCLE VON (CONT’D)
                        Hahahaha!  Who is this guy?!

                                 ROGER
                        You know him, that’s Rashaad.

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  I 
                        think I may have gone a little bit 
                        too far.  I’m sure the boner was 
                        from Jessica and not from the 
                        little kid.  But that’s besides the 
                        point.  The point is...

           ANGLE ON Larissa.  She clamps her hands over her mouth, 
           trying not laugh.

           ANGLE BACK on Danny.  He raises his glass.

                                 DANNY (cont’d)
                        Jessica, Jason... I love you guys 
                        very much.  And watching you up 
                        there today and seeing how happy 
                        you are together, it makes me think 
                        back to right after your first 
                        date, and what Jason said to me.  
                        “Danny,” he said, “I think I may 
                        have just met the girl I’m gonna 
                        ask to George and Alan’s Halloween 
                        party and eat out in their 
                        bathroom.”
                                (then, significantly)
                        And you know what?  He did.

           Silence.  Everyone looks shocked and appalled.  The father of 
           the bride is furious.  The mother of the bride WEEPS into a 
           napkin.  Uncle Von stands up and CLAPS ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Bravo!  Nice shit!  That’s how you 
                        fuckin’ toast!

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                        Sit down, Von!!

           Uncle Von sits down.  Danny cringes and looks over at Larissa 
           who can’t help but LAUGH.  She gives him the “perfect” sign.
                                 DANNY
                                (into the microphone)
                        Um... let’s eat.

           INT. BALLROOM - LATER

           A WAITER carries several dinner plates stacked up his arm.  
           He passes Michael and Linda.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (looking around impatiently)
                        Every other table’s already been 
                        served!

                                 LINDA
                        Relax.  Have another roll.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t wanna fill up on bread!

           ANGLE ON Tim and Simone.  Tim just stares at his plate.

                                 SIMONE
                        Tim, aren’t you gonna at least 
                        taste your fish?

                                 TIM
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 SIMONE
                        Well, you’ve gotta eat something to 
                        absorb all that vodka.

                                 TIM
                        This is just club soda.

                                 SIMONE
                        Wait a minute?  Your wife dumped 
                        you, and you’re drinking club soda?  
                        You need a real drink.

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know.

                                 SIMONE
                        Tim.  Personal tragedy.  Open bar.

                                 TIM
                        Well, maybe like a white wine.

                                 SIMONE
                        You need brown liquor.
           ANGLE ON Charlie and Kate.  Charlie feeds her a bite of his 
           steak.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Isn’t that amazing?

                                 KATE
                        Mmm.

           Roger appears and places three shot glasses on the table.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, Roger!

                                 KATE
                                (re: shots)
                        What’s this?

                                 ROGER
                        For old time’s sake.

                                 KATE
                        I don’t think so.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, come on, Kate.  It’s a wedding.  
                        Shots!

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, Kate.  Shots!

           They each pick up a shot glass.

                                 ROGER (cont’d)
                        To Jess and Jason.

                                 CHARLIE
                        To Jess and Jason!

           They CLINK glasses and toss back the shots.

                                 CHARLIE (cont’d)
                        Oh shit!  What is this?!

                                 KATE
                        Roger!

                                 ROGER
                        It’s Tequila and Tabasco.  Like we 
                        had in Australia.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think I’m gonna throw up.
           Charlie covers his mouth, scrambles to his feet, and rushes 
           toward the exit.  Kate stands, throwing down her napkin.

                                 KATE
                                (to Roger)
                        Not cool.

                                 ROGER
                        It’s not my fault your boyfriend’s 
                        a lightweight!

           Kate exits in Charlie’s direction.  Despite her annoyance, 
           she can’t help but smile and shake her head.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Danny eats with Larissa and the band (which, aside from 
           Larissa, is all men).

                                 GUITARIST
                                (to Danny)
                        You’re crazy, man.

                                 DRUMMER
                        Talkin’ about the bride fingerin’ 
                        chicks and gettin’ eaten out?  I’ve 
                        been to a fuckload of weddings, and 
                        I ain’t never seen that before.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, I think maybe the material 
                        was a little too hip for the crowd.

                                 LARISSA
                        “Maybe”??

           They all LAUGH.

                                 DRUMMER
                        That dude’s all, “let’s bow our 
                        heads and pray to God,” and then 
                        you’re talking about his daughter 
                        gettin’ munched in a bathroom.

                                 DANNY
                        In my defense, that all happened.

                                 LARISSA
                        And the priest?

                                 DANNY
                        I think he was eyeing that ring 
                        bearer.
           Everyone LAUGHS again, including Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        Hey, it’s cool you came in here to 
                        eat with us.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.  It is cool.

           The smile at each other.  Just then, the swinging doors to 
           the kitchen FLY OPEN.  It’s the father of the bride.

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                        You filthy son of a whore!

           The father of the bride lunges at Danny and TACKLES him to 
           the ground.

                                 DANNY
                        Ow!  You bitch!  You poked me in 
                        the eye!

           The father of the bride pins Danny to the floor and cocks his 
           fist back, but two band members grab him from behind and pull 
           him off Danny.

                                 DRUMMER
                                (to father of the bride)
                        Chill out, sir!

                                 BASSIST
                                (to Danny)
                        You should probably get outta here, 
                        dude.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah.
                                (to Larissa)
                        Hey, I had a really nice time 
                        eating dinner with you.

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (struggling to get at Danny)
                        I am gonna rip your heart out and 
                        shove it down your throat!

                                 DANNY
                        Wouldn’t that just put it right 
                        back where it was?

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (struggling even harder)
                        Aaaaaa!
                                 BASSIST
                                (to Danny)
                        Dude.

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, yeah, sorry.
                                (to Larissa)
                        I’ll see you out there?

                                 LARISSA
                        I’ll be the one on the stage.

                                 DANNY
                        Right.  I’ll be the one on the 
                        dance floor dry humping all of 
                        Jessica’s cousins.

                                 FATHER OF THE BRIDE
                                (struggling again)
                        Gyyaaaaa!

                                 DANNY
                        Okay, gotta go.

           Danny exits kitchen.  Larissa watches him and LAUGHS.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           Annie sits at her table, watching all the couples feed each 
           other their entrees.

                                 COUPLE MAN #1
                        Mmm, try this.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #1
                        Yummy, yum yum yum!

                                 COUPLE MAN #2
                        Here, my steak came with mashed 
                        potatoes.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #2
                        Mmm!  Why is that so good?!

                                 COUPLE MAN #2
                        Butter.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #2
                        It’s always butter, isn’t it?!  
                        Hahahahaha!

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #3
                        It is always butter!  Hahahahaha!

                                 ANNIE
                                (getting up)
                        Excuse me.

                                 COUPLE MAN #4
                        Here, try it with the sauce.

                                 COUPLE WOMAN #4
                        But I don’t want the sauce.

                                 COUPLE MAN #4
                        You have to try it with the sauce!!

           INT. BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A MALE GUEST stands at the bar.  Annie approaches.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hey.

                                 MALE GUEST
                        Hey, Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                                (re: bar)
                        Are you...?

                                 MALE GUEST
                        No.  Go ahead.

                                 ANNIE
                                (to bartender)
                        Another, please.

                                 MALE GUEST
                        How’s it going?

                                 ANNIE
                        Good, good.

                                 MALE GUEST
                        Where’s Keith?

           Annie stares at him a beat, then snaps:

                                 ANNIE
                        Who gives a shit where Keith is?!
                                 MALE GUEST
                        I, uh--

                                 ANNIE
                        He’s probably screwing some slutty 
                        congressional page in DC or sticking 
                        his cock in the Lincoln Memorial!
                                (breaking down)
                        The truth is, I have no fucking clue 
                        where Keith is!  Okay?!  He left!

           Everyone is now looking at Annie.  Caroline and Kate rush 
           over and hustle her off.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Come on, honey.

                                 ANNIE
                        He left.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know.

           They exit.  A beat, then Lionel turns to Dottie:

                                 LIONEL
                        Who’s Keith?

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           It’s dark now.  One of the valets presses his crotch against 
           the side of a car, peeing into the gas tank.  The other valet 
           keeps a lookout.  We hear a FAMILIAR PIANO INTRO, then:

                                 LARISSA (O.S.)
                        AT FIRST I WAS AFRAID, I WAS 
                        PETRIFIED...

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           Larissa sings GLORIA GAYNOR’S “I WILL SURVIVE.”

                                 LARISSA
                        ...KEPT THINKIN’ I COULD NEVER LIVE 
                        WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIDE...

           All the female guests (and the douchebag who won’t stop 
           dancing) go apeshit and race for the dance floor.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Wooo!
                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        This is my jam!

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Mine too!

           INT. LADIES ROOM - SAME

           We hear the faint sound of Larisssa singing Gloria Gaynor’s 
           seminal girl power anthem, as Annie, Kate, and Caroline hide 
           out in the bathroom, drinking from a bottle of champagne.

                                 ANNIE
                        Okay, so maybe breaking up with 
                        Keith is a big deal.

                                 KATE
                        You guys were together a really 
                        long time.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Yeah.

                                 KATE
                        I mean, not as long as Ryan and 
                        Caroline, but that’s like-- I mean, 
                        who dates that long?

           Caroline SMACKS Kate with her purse.

                                 KATE (cont’d)
                        Ow!  Sorry, sorry!

           Annie LAUGHS a little, starting to feel better.

                                 KATE (cont’d)
                                (re: Caroline’s purse)
                        What the hell’s in that thing?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Your mother’s tampons.

                                 KATE
                        What?  I don’t even know what 
                        that’s supposed to mean.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Your mother has a huge vagina, so 
                        she has big, heavy tampons.

                                 KATE
                        Oh.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Yeah.

           Annie LAUGHS some more and takes a SWIG of champagne.

                                 ANNIE
                        Also, I think being at a wedding by 
                        myself isn’t really helping my 
                        situation.

                                 KATE
                        Well, you’re not by yourself.

                                 CAROLINE
                        That’s right.  We’re here.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah... thanks.

           Kate raises the champagne bottle.

                                 KATE
                        Here’s to no more weddings for a 
                        long, long time.
                                (then, razzing Caroline)
                        Oooh, sorry, Caroline.

           Caroline jumps on Kate and HITS her some more with her purse.

                                 KATE (cont’d)
                        Ow!  Stop it!  My mom’s tampons are 
                        so big and heavy!

           Annie smiles, as Kate and Caroline fight.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           Larissa continues singing.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...OH NO, NOT I / I WILL SURVIVE / 
                        OH, AS LONG AS I KNOW HOW TO LOVE / 
                        I KNOW I’LL STAY ALIVE...

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR, the douchebag who won’t stop dancing gets 
           down with his bad self and sings along passionately.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        ...I’VE GOT ALL MY LIFE TO LIVE / 
                        AND I’VE GOT ALL MY LOVE TO GIVE... 
           Nearby, the two twenty-something dancing girls from earlier 
           dance together even more sexily, grinding, then pressing 
           their foreheads together and singing into each other’s faces.

                                 DANCING GIRL #1/DANCING GIRL #2
                        ...AND I’LL SURVIVE / I WILL 
                        SURVIVE / HEY HEY...

           Also nearby, Jeremy dances with the two bridesmaids.  One in 
           particular wriggles close to him.

                                 JEREMY
                        Hey, do you wanna take a walk?

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        What?

                                 JEREMY
                        Do you wanna take a walk?!

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Oh my god, you’re so cute!
                                (to Bridesmaid #2)
                        Dina, I think he wants to hook up 
                        with me!

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        Oh my god, that’s adorable!

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        I should just like totally screw 
                        his brains out!

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        Casey, that would be hilarious!

                                 JEREMY
                        Yeah, you should do that.  Just for 
                        the story.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Oh my god, he thinks I’m serious!!

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        That’s so cute!!

           ANGLE ON the side of the dance floor.  Tim and Simone watch 
           Beth dance with the guy.  Tim holds a glass of whiskey.

                                 TIM
                        She’s danced with him like four 
                        songs!
                                 SIMONE
                        Tim, relax.  Roger was just trying 
                        to instigate earlier.  That’s what 
                        he does.

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa, as she finishes “I WILL SURVIVE.”

                                 LARISSA
                        ...I’VE GOT ALL MY LIFE TO LIVE / 
                        AND I’VE GOT ALL MY LOVE TO GIVE / 
                        AND I’LL SURVIVE / I WILL SURVIVE!

           ANGLE ON the dance floor.  The guests CHEER.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Yes!!  Yes!!

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        Thank you.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING (O.S.)
                        Thank you!!

           The keyboardist starts a slower tune, JOURNEY’S “FAITHFULLY.”

                                 LARISSA
                        HIGHWAY RUN / INTO THE MIDNIGHT 
                        SUN...

           ANGLE ON Beth and the guy.  They start to slow dance, his 
           hand on the small of her back.

           ANGLE ON Tim and Simone.

                                 TIM
                        Isn’t his hand a little low?

                                 SIMONE
                        No, that’s how you dance.
                                (then)
                        That whiskey was supposed to loosen 
                        you up.

                                 TIM
                        It’s burning my insides.

           Simone LAUGHS, then:

                                 SIMONE
                        Hey.  You wanna dance?
                                 TIM
                        Sure, can I put this drink down 
                        here and then never see it again?

           Simone takes Tim’s hand and leads him toward the dance floor.

           ANGLE ON the entrance to the ballroom.  Uncle Von stands at 
           the table with the wedding presents, randomly switching all 
           the cards.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck 
                        you up the ass, fuck you...

           Kate, Annie, and Caroline enter, passing the table.

                                 KATE
                        Bar?

                                 ANNIE
                        Bar.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I’m good.

           Kate and Annie head toward the bar.  Meanwhile, the douchebag 
           who won’t stop dancing hip-thrusts his way up to Caroline.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                                (still dancing)
                        Hey.  You wanna dance?

                                 CAROLINE
                        No thanks.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Why not?

                                 CAROLINE
                        I have a boyfriend.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Oooh.

                                 CAROLINE
                        What?

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        Nothing, it’s just the way you said 
                        “boyfriend.”  You sounded, I don’t 
                        know, pissed.

           Caroline looks at the douchebag.  Does she really wanna vent 
           to this guy?  But she has to vent to somebody.
                                 CAROLINE
                        Well, we’ve been dating for over 
                        three years...

           ANGLE ON the dance floor.  Tim and Simone dance.

                                 SIMONE
                        Isn’t this better than standing on 
                        the side and being jealous?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah.

           But he watches as the guy dips Beth.  She laughs.  Tim looks 
           angry, his heart beating faster.

           ANGLE ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...OH GIRL / YOU STAND BY ME...

           On the dance floor, Danny dances with a cute, little flower 
           girl.  He smiles up at Larissa.  She smiles back.

                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        ...I’M FOREVER YOURS / FAITHFULLY...

           ANGLE BACK ON Caroline and the douchebag.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        That’s crazy.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I know.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        You’re hot as shit.  You shouldn’t 
                        have to beg a guy to marry you.

           Caroline looks at the douchebag for a beat.  It’s an epiphany.

                                 CAROLINE
                        You’re right.  I am hot as shit.  I 
                        shouldn’t have to beg a guy to 
                        marry me!

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                        So, you wanna dance?

                                 CAROLINE
                        No.  Not at all.

           Caroline exits.
           ANGLE ON Tim and Simone dancing.  Tim removes himself. 

                                 TIM
                        Excuse me.

                                 SIMONE
                        Where are you going?

           Tim doesn’t answer.

           ANGLE ON Ryan who talks to a few other guests.  Caroline 
           marches up to him.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Now I wanna fight!

           As Ryan reacts, we...

           ANGLE ON Beth and the guy dancing.  Tim strides up to them.

                                 TIM
                        Hey.

           Tim PUNCHES the guy in the face.  The band stops playing, and 
           everyone turns to look.

                                 BETH
                        Tim!  Are you out of your mind?!

           The guy is thrown off balance for a moment, but he quickly 
           collects himself and PUNCHES Tim back much harder.  Tim goes 
           down like a sack of bricks.  We CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           All is peaceful and quiet, except for the SCREECH of one of 
           the valets SPINNING THE TIRES of an Audi R8.  The other valet 
           stands nearby and drinks a forty, as smoke from the tires 
           wafts around him.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           We see the bride and groom, from behind of course, as they 
           cut the cake.  The bride messily feeds the groom a handful.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look at that, they’re wasting a 
                        perfectly good cake.

                                 LINDA
                        I think it’s romantic.
                                 MICHAEL
                        How is mashing food into somebody’s 
                        face romantic?

                                 LINDA
                        It’s whimsical.  It wouldn’t kill 
                        you to be whimsical once in a while.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You want whimsical?  Here.

           Michael grabs a handful of food from a nearby plate and 
           sticks it in Linda’s face.

                                 LINDA
                        Michael!  Not funny!

           ANGLE ON the stage.  The keyboardist plays an INSTRUMENTAL 
           VERSION OF STEVIE WONDER’S “I BELIEVE (WHEN I FALL IN LOVE IT 
           WILL BE FOREVER)”.

           ANGLE ON a few tables.  Slices of wedding cake are served.  
           We see that ties have been loosened, sleeves have been rolled 
           up, and high-heeled shoes have been discarded.

           ANGLE ON a table in the corner.  Simone holds a napkin full 
           of ice against Tim’s eye.

                                 SIMONE
                        What were you thinking?

                                 TIM
                        I was thinking, “that guy’s porking 
                        my wife.”

                                 SIMONE
                        You still think that?

                                 TIM
                        I don’t know, probably not.  And 
                        even if he is, it doesn’t matter.  
                        It doesn’t change anything.

                                 SIMONE
                        Yeah...

           A beat, then Simone smiles.

                                 SIMONE (cont’d)
                        You should’ve seen the look on your 
                        face when you punched him and he 
                        didn’t go down.
                                 TIM
                        I know!  I thought for sure I’d 
                        knock him out.

                                 SIMONE
                        Not even close.

                                 TIM
                        But you wouldn’t say I got my ass 
                        kicked, though, right?

                                 SIMONE
                        Well...

                                 TIM
                        We each punched each other once!  
                        That’s a draw!

                                 SIMONE
                        Yeah, but you were unconscious.

                                 TIM
                        For like two seconds!

                                 SIMONE
                        And you woke up crying.

                                 TIM
                        I had something in my eye.

                                 SIMONE
                        Yeah, that guy’s class ring.

           Tim LAUGHS.

                                 TIM
                        Ow.  Laughing makes my face hurt.

                                 SIMONE
                        Sorry.

                                 TIM
                        No, it’s good.  I mean, it’s nice 
                        to laugh.  It’s just... painful.

                                 SIMONE
                        Okay, well, let’s take a look at 
                        that eye.

           Simone removes the napkin.  Tim’s eye is black and blue.

                                 SIMONE (cont’d)
                        Oy.
                                 TIM
                                (amused)
                        “Oy”?

                                 SIMONE
                        Yeah, “oy.”  What?

                                 TIM
                        “Oy” isn’t something a beautiful 
                        twenty-year-old girl says.

                                 SIMONE
                        I’m twenty-three.

                                 TIM
                        It’s something an eighty-year-old 
                        Jewish guy says when he tries to 
                        stand up after eating too much lox.

                                 SIMONE
                        Well, your eye is pretty “oy.”

                                 TIM
                        Do I at least look tough?

                                 SIMONE
                        You look... battered.

                                 TIM
                                (sarcastic)
                        Thanks.

           Simone LAUGHS.

                                 SIMONE
                        You wanna get a drink?

                                 TIM
                        Yes.  Yes, I do.
                                (as he stands up)
                        Oy.

           Simone LAUGHS again.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Ryan and Caroline stand outside the bathroom, arguing.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I don’t deserve this, Ryan!

                                 RYAN
                        I know--
                                 CAROLINE
                        You wanted time, I gave you time.  
                        You wanted me to move in, I moved 
                        in.  What else am I supposed to 
                        do?!  I’ve done everything you 
                        want!  At every step of the way!

                                 RYAN
                        You have--

                                 CAROLINE
                        And if I pressure you, I’m like not 
                        cool or a bitch or something.  It’s 
                        just-- It’s wrong!  You need to 
                        figure out what you want, Ryan.  A 
                        lot of men would love to marry me.  
                        And if you’re not one of them, you 
                        should let me know.

           A beat, then:

                                 RYAN
                        You’re right.

                                 CAROLINE
                        That’s it?

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah, you’re... you’re right.

           Off Caroline’s troubled reaction, we CUT TO:

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON Larissa at the microphone.

                                 LARISSA
                        IF YOU’RE HAVIN’ GIRL PROBLEMS, I 
                        FEEL BAD FOR YOU SON / I GOT NINETY-
                        NINE PROBLEMS, BUT A BITCH AIN’T ONE!

           The keyboardist spins JAY-Z’S “NINETY-NINE PROBLEMS” on a 
           turntable.  Larissa throws herself into the rap with total 
           commitment and sexy aggression (think Natalie Portman’s “SNL” 
           rap video).

                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        I GOT THE RAP PATROL ON THE GAT 
                        PATROL / FOES THAT WANNA MAKE SURE 
                        MY CASKET’S CLOSED...

           ANGLE ON Annie watching Larissa, impressed, as she nurses a 
           drink.  Jeremy approaches her.
                                 JEREMY
                        Hey, Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hey.  You having fun?

                                 JEREMY
                        Yeah, this singer’s for real.

                                 ANNIE
                        She’s pretty badass.

                                 JEREMY
                        You wanna dance?  Or, I don’t know, 
                        take a walk?

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you-- Are you hitting on me?

                                 JEREMY
                        Maybe.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t do that.

                                 JEREMY
                        Why not?

                                 ANNIE
                        Well, for one thing, I’m still 
                        trying to come to terms with what 
                        happened with Keith.

                                 JEREMY
                                (a little flippant)
                        What?  That you broke up?

                                 ANNIE
                                (a little annoyed)
                        Yeah.  It was a pretty serious 
                        relationship.

                                 JEREMY
                        Why would you wanna be in a 
                        relationship anyway?

                                 ANNIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 JEREMY
                        You’re in the prime of your life.  
                        Be single.  Have fun.  When the 
                        right guy comes around, you’ll know 
                        it.  And he’ll know it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEREMY (cont'd)
                        And if it’s meant to be, you’ll 
                        both figure out a way to make it 
                        work.  Until then, live.  Enjoy 
                        your freedom.  Go crazy!

                                 ANNIE
                                (a beat, realizing)
                        Wow... you’re right.

                                 JEREMY
                        I know!  You wanna hook up?

                                 ANNIE
                        How old are you?

                                 JEREMY
                        Twenty-two.
                                (then)
                        Nineteen.
                                (then)
                        Seventeen.

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re sweet, but no thanks. 
                                (then)
                        Besides, I think there’s someone else 
                        who seems to have her eye on you.

           Annie nods toward Pepper, who is sitting by herself at the 
           kids table.  Jeremy looks at Pepper, really noticing her for 
           the first time. 

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...I GOT NINETY-NINE PROBLEMS, BUT 
                        A BITCH AIN’T ONE / HIT ME...

           ANGLE ON another table.  Tim sits with Lionel and Dottie.  
           They share a piece of wedding cake.

                                 LIONEL
                        A whole piece of cake is too much.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Half a piece is perfect.

                                 LIONEL
                        If I have a whole piece, I’m up all 
                        night.

                                 DOTTIE
                        And then I’m up all night.
                                 LIONEL
                        I get frisky.

                                 TIM
                                (amazed and a little sad)
                        How do you guys do it?

                                 DOTTIE
                        Well, Lionel takes a pill, and then 
                        after twenty minutes he hollers, 
                        “Dottie!”, and I hurry upstairs as 
                        fast as I can-- 

                                 TIM
                        No, I mean this.  Happiness.  A 
                        happy marriage.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Oh, that’s easy.

                                 LIONEL
                        You don’t need a pill for that.

                                 DOTTIE
                        You just need to find the right 
                        person.

                                 LIONEL
                        That’s right.

           Lionel looks at Dottie with stars in his eyes (or are they 
           cataracts?) and holds her hand.

                                 LIONEL (cont’d)
                        And if you’re really meant to be 
                        together, it gets easier every 
                        single day.

           Tim takes this in.  He cannot picture him and Beth looking 
           like this someday.

           ANGLE BACK ON Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...IF YOU’RE HAVIN’ GIRL PROBLEMS, 
                        I FEEL BAD FOR YOU SON / I GOT 
                        NINETY-NINE PROBLEMS, BUT A BITCH 
                        AIN’T ONE!

           The guests CHEER and HOOT.

                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        That was actually a request from 
                        the groom.  Very romantic.
           ANGLE ON the bride and groom.  They kiss, their faces 
           obscured.

                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        And now, I’d like invite the best 
                        man, Danny, to come up here and 
                        join me in a duet.

           INT. BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Danny and Larissa stand on stage with microphones.  The band 
           plays MEAT LOAF’S ROCK EPIC ABOUT TEENAGE LOVE AND LUST, 
           “PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT.”

                                 DANNY
                                (sings to Larissa)
                        I REMEMBER EVERY LITTLE THING / AS 
                        IF IT HAPPENED ONLY YESTERDAY / 
                        PARKIN’ BY THE LAKE / AND THERE WAS 
                        NOT ANOTHER CAR IN SIGHT / AND I 
                        NEVER HAD A GIRL / LOOKIN’ ANY 
                        BETTER THAN YOU DID / AND ALL THE 
                        KIDS AT SCHOOL / THEY WERE WISHIN’ 
                        THEY WERE ME THAT NIGHT

                                 DANNY AND LARISSA
                                (sing to each other)
                        AND NOW OUR BODIES ARE OH SO CLOSE 
                        AND TIGHT / IT NEVER FELT SO GOOD, 
                        IT NEVER FELT SO RIGHT

           ANGLE ON the dance floor.  It’s packed.  Kate dances with 
           Charlie.  Roger dances with Simone.  The bridesmaids dance 
           with Uncle Von.  The douchebag who won’t stop dancing is on 
           fire, again by himself.

                                 DANNY AND LARISSA (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        AND WE’RE GLOWIN’ LIKE THE METAL ON 
                        THE EDGE OF A KNIFE / GLOWIN’ LIKE 
                        THE METAL ON THE EDGE OF A KNIFE

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        COME ON!  HOLD ON TIGHT! / COME ON!  
                        HOLD ON TIGHT!

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Larissa.

                                 DANNY AND LARISSA
                        THOUGH IT’S COLD AND LONELY IN THE 
                        DEEP DARK NIGHT / I CAN SEE 
                        PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT
                                 LARISSA
                        AIN’T NO DOUBT ABOUT IT / WE WERE 
                        DOUBLY BLESSED / ‘CAUSE WE WERE 
                        BARELY SEVENTEEN / AND WE WERE 
                        BARELY DRESSED...

           ANGLE ON Pepper.  Jeremy approaches her.

                                 JEREMY
                        Hey.  I was just thinking, maybe 
                        I’m a jerk.

                                 PEPPER
                        That’s funny.  I was just thinking 
                        the same thing.

                                 JEREMY
                        Well... Do you think it’s too late 
                        for me to ask you to dance?

           A beat.  Pepper doesn’t answer.

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Larissa.

                                 DANNY
                        ...AND WE’RE GLOWIN’ LIKE THE METAL 
                        ON THE EDGE OF A KNIFE / GLOWIN’ 
                        LIKE THE METAL ON THE EDGE OF A 
                        KNIFE / COME ON!  HOLD ON TIGHT!...

           ANGLE BACK ON Pepper and Jeremy.  Pepper grabs Jeremy by his 
           shirt and LAYS A MIND-BLOWING KISS right on his lips.  Then:

                                 PEPPER
                        Okay, let’s dance.

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Larissa.

                                 DANNY AND LARISSA
                        ...YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU CAN / AND 
                        LET MOTHER NATURE DO THE REST / 
                        AIN’T NO DOUBT ABOUT IT / WE WERE 
                        DOUBLY BLESSED / ‘CAUSE WE WERE 
                        BARELY SEVENTEEN / AND WE WERE 
                        BARELY--

                                 DANNY
                        WE’RE GONNA GO ALL THE WAY TO 
                        TONIGHT / WE’RE GONNA GO ALL THE 
                        WAY AND TONIGHT’S THE NIGHT

           ANGLE BACK ON the dance floor.  Amidst the revelry, Roger and 
           Simone and Kate and Charlie switch partners, Charlie dancing 
           with Simone, and Roger dancing with Kate.
                                 DANNY (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        WE’RE GONNA GO ALL THE WAY TO 
                        TONIGHT / WE’RE GONNA GO ALL THE 
                        WAY AND TONIGHT’S THE NIGHT

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.  The guitarist steps up to a 
           microphone and does a perfect Phil Rizzuto impression:

                                 GUITARIST
                        Okay, here we go, we got a real 
                        pressure cooker going here, two 
                        down, nobody on, no score bottom of 
                        the ninth.  There’s the windup, and 
                        there it is, a line shot up the 
                        middle, look at him go, this boy 
                        can really fly!...

           ANGLE ON Beth, sitting at her table.  Tim approaches her.

                                 TIM
                        Hey.

                                 BETH
                        Hey.  There’s nothing going on with 
                        me and David.

                                 TIM
                        “David.”  Okay, good.  Now I know 
                        the name of the guy who made me his 
                        bitch.

                                 BETH
                                (sincere)
                        Are you okay?

                                 TIM
                        Yeah.  I mean, no.  But I will be.

                                 BETH
                        I’m sorry.  This was obviously not 
                        the right time to spring this on 
                        you.  I just--

                                 TIM
                        Beth, it’s okay.  You were right.  
                        We don’t fit.  I was in denial.  I 
                        was forcing it.

           Beth frowns.  She’s glad Tim’s come around, but it’s still 
           difficult to hear.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        We both deserve to find the right 
                        person and be happy.
           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.

                                 GUITARIST
                        ...Here he comes, squeeze play, 
                        it’s gonna be close, here’s the 
                        throw, here’s the play at the 
                        plate.  Holy cow, I think he’s 
                        gonna make it!

                                 LARISSA
                        STOP RIGHT THERE! / I GOTTA KNOW 
                        RIGHT NOW! / BEFORE WE GO ANY 
                        FURTHER / DO YOU LOVE ME? / WILL 
                        YOU LOVE ME FOREVER? / DO YOU NEED 
                        ME? / WILL YOU NEVER LEAVE ME? / 
                        WILL YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY FOR THE 
                        REST OF MY LIFE?  WILL YOU TAKE ME 
                        AWAY, WILL YOU MAKE ME YOUR WIFE?

           ANGLE ON Ryan and Caroline.  Ryan sits on a chair, and 
           Caroline stands next to him, watching everyone dance.  Over 
           the following, Ryan takes her hand, pulls her onto his lap, 
           and kisses her shoulder.  They clearly love each other very 
           much, but she’s clearly still very hurt and upset.

                                 LARISSA (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        DO YOU LOVE ME?! / WILL YOU LOVE ME 
                        FOREVER?! / DO YOU NEED ME?! / WILL 
                        YOU NEVER LEAVE ME?! / WILL YOU 
                        MAKE ME SO HAPPY FOR THE REST OF MY 
                        LIFE?!  WILL YOU TAKE ME AWAY, WILL 
                        YOU MAKE ME YOUR WIFE?!

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.

                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        I GOTTA KNOW RIGHT NOW! / BEFORE WE 
                        GO ANY FURTHER! / DO YOU LOVE ME?! 
                        / WILL YOU LOVE ME FOREVER?!

                                 DANNY
                        LET ME SLEEP ON IT / BABY, BABY LET 
                        ME SLEEP ON IT / LET ME SLEEP ON IT 
                        / I’LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER IN THE 
                        MORNING...

           ANGLE ON Annie who stands on the side, watching.  The 
           douchebag who won’t stop dancing shimmies up to her.
                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING
                                (singing along as he dances)
                        LET ME SLEEP ON IT / BABY, BABY LET 
                        ME SLEEP ON IT / LET ME SLEEP ON IT 
                        / I’LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER IN THE 
                        MORNING...

           Annie CHUCKLES a little.

                                 DOUCHEBAG WHO WON’T STOP DANCING (cont’d)
                        So, what’s up?  You wanna dance?

           Annie thinks about what Jeremy said for a beat, then:

                                 ANNIE
                        Sure.  Why not?

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Larissa.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...I GOTTA KNOW RIGHT NOW! / BEFORE 
                        WE GO ANY FURTHER / DO YOU LOVE ME? 
                        / WILL YOU LOVE ME FOREVER?

                                 DANNY
                        LET ME SLEEP ON IT

                                 LARISSA
                        WILL YOU LOVE ME FOREVER?!

                                 DANNY
                        LET ME SLEEP ON IT

                                 LARISSA
                        WILL YOU LOVE ME FOREVER?!?!

                                 DANNY
                        I COULDN’T TAKE IT ANY LONGER / 
                        LORD, I WAS CRAZED! / AND WHEN THE 
                        FEELIN’ CAME UPON ME / LIKE A TIDAL 
                        WAVE / I STARTED SWEARIN’ TO MY GOD

                        WOLD LOVE YOU TO THE END OF TIME / 
                        I SWORE I WOULD LOVE YOU TO THE END 
                        OF TIME!

           ANGLE BACK ON the dance floor and the surrounding tables.  
           Over the following, we CUT AROUND to different couples.  
           Simone dances with Charlie.  Kate dances with Roger.  Beth 
           wistfully watches Tim walk away from her table.  Jeremy 
           dances with Pepper.  The douchebag dances with Annie.  
           Caroline sits on Ryan’s lap.
                                 DANNY AND LARISSA (O.S.)
                        SO NOW I’M PRAYIN’ FOR THE END OF 
                        TIME / TO HURRY UP AND ARRIVE / 
                        ‘CAUSE IF I GOTTA SPEND ANOTHER 
                        MINUTE WITH YOU / I DON’T THINK

                        NEVER BREAK MY PROMISE OR FORGET MY

                        DO RIGHT NOW / I’M PRAYIN’ FOR THE 
                        END OF TIME

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny and Larissa.

                                 DANNY AND LARISSA (cont’d)
                        IT’S ALL THAT I CAN DO-OO-OOO! / 
                        PRAYIN’ FOR THE END OF TIME / SO I 
                        CAN END MY TIME WITH YOOOUUU!

           As the band winds down:

                                                                LARISSA
                              DANNY
           IT WAS LONG AGO, AND IT WAS 
           FAR AWAY / AND IT WAS SO MUCH 
           BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY / IT 
           WAS LONG AGO, AND IT WAS FAR 
           AWAY / AND IT WAS SO MUCH 
           BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY...
                                                    IT NEVER FELT SO GOOD, IT 
                                                    NEVER FELT SO RIGHT / AND WE 
                                                    WERE GLOWIN’ LIKE THE METAL 
                                                    ON THE EDGE OF A KNIFE / IT 
                                                    NEVER FELT SO GOOD, IT NEVER 
                                                    FELT SO RIGHT / AND WE WERE 
                                                    GLOWIN’ LIKE THE METAL ON THE 
                                                    EDGE OF A KNIFE...

           The ballroom erupts in APPLAUSE.  We CUT AROUND to Kate and 
           Charlie, Roger and Simone, Jeremy and Pepper, the douchebag 
           and Annie.  They CHEER.

                                 ANNIE
                        Woohoo!  Danny!

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.  Danny and Larissa hug.

           ANGLE ON Ryan and Caroline.  Caroline CLAPS and wipes a tear 
           from her cheek.

           ANGLE BACK ON Danny, as he steps off the stage (and the band 
           starts a new song).  Michael and Linda are there to greet him.

                                 LINDA
                        Danny, that was terrific!

           She kisses him on the cheek.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I taped it on my phone!  I think.  
                        I don’t know how this damn thing 
                        works.
                                 DANNY
                        Hey, let me ask you guys a 
                        question.  What do you think of 
                        Larissa?  Because I’m pretty sure 
                        she likes me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Danny, don’t be a schmuck.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 MICHAEL
                        She’s just doing her job being nice 
                        to you.  She’s the wedding singer, 
                        you’re the best man.  She’s an 
                        entertainer, for god’s sake!

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah, but--

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about Captain Dan who used to 
                        do magic tricks at your birthday 
                        parties?  You think he’s got the 
                        hots for you?  You gonna go out on 
                        a date with Captain Dan and his 
                        bird puppet, Conrad?

                                 LINDA
                        Michael, stop it!  You’re gonna 
                        destroy his self confidence!

           Danny, unsure, looks up at Larissa who sings flirtatiously 
           into the same microphone with her guitarist.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

           One of the valets has sex with a waitress against the side of 
           a Ford Explorer.  The other valet takes a picture with his 
           cell phone.

                                 LARISSA (O.S.)
                        ...SO LET’S SINK ANOTHER DRINK / 
                        ‘CAUSE IT’LL GIVE ME TIME TO THINK

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           The band plays BILLY IDOL’S “DANCING WITH MYSELF.”  The dance 
           floor is sparsely populated, but Annie and the douchebag who 
           won’t stop dancing are out there, and they’re awesome.  
           The douchebag may have moves dancing on his own, but he was 
           born to dance with a partner.  Annie is having a ball.

                                 LARISSA
                        IF I HAD THE CHANCE / I’D ASK THE 
                        WORLD TO DANCE / AND I’D BE DANCING 
                        WITH MYSELF...

           ANGLE ON Michael and Linda’s table.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Linda, get your purse.  I wanna 
                        leave now and beat the traffic.

                                 LINDA
                        What traffic?  It’s twelve-fifteen.

                                 MICHAEL
                        The bars close at one, and the 
                        streets are flooded with lunatics!

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           By the coat check, Lionel and Dottie, now wearing their 
           coats, head toward the exit.  Ryan stops them.  

                                 RYAN
                        Hey.  You guys taking off?

                                 DOTTIE
                        Lionel took a pill, so we need to 
                        be home in twenty minutes.

                                 RYAN
                        Oh.  Well, I just wanted to thank 
                        you for your advice.  It meant a 
                        lot.  What both of you said.

                                 DOTTIE
                        You’re very welcome, dear.

                                 LIONEL
                        I’m sure everything will turn out 
                        for the best.

                                 RYAN
                        Yeah... Drive safe.

                                 LIONEL
                        Thank you, young man.

           Ryan exits, and Lionel and Dottie continue toward the door.
                                 DOTTIE
                        What a lovely evening.

                                 LIONEL
                        You remember our wedding night, 
                        Dottie?

                                 DOTTIE
                        Like it was yesterday.

           A CLUB EMPLOYEE holds the door open for them.

                                 GUEST
                        That’s sweet.  How long have you 
                        folks been married?

                                 LIONEL
                        Oh, about six months.

                                 DOTTIE
                        This is my fourth marriage.  I’ve 
                        got a good feeling about this one.

           Lionel and Dottie exit.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - SAME

           Roger and Kate walk along a fairway, underneath a tree.

                                 ROGER
                        You know, there was a time when I 
                        thought you and I might get married.

                                 KATE
                        To each other??

                                 ROGER
                        I’m serious.  You were in that 
                        accident, with your Volvo.  And you 
                        were fine, but it made me think... 
                        “What would my life be like without 
                        her?”

                                 KATE
                        And how is your life without me?

                                 ROGER
                        It’s okay.

                                 KATE
                        Seems better than okay.
                                 ROGER
                        It has its moments.

                                 KATE
                        You know, it took me a really long 
                        time to get over you.

                                 ROGER
                        You dumped me.

                                 KATE
                        You didn’t give me much of a choice.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah... I’m sorry about that.

                                 KATE
                        Wow.

                                 ROGER
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        You apologized.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah...

                                 KATE
                        Thank you.

           A beat.  Roger KISSES Kate.  She KISSES him back.  Then:

                                 KATE (cont’d)
                                (breaking the kiss)
                        I can’t do this.

                                 ROGER
                        Sure, you can.

                                 KATE
                        No, I... I actually don’t want to.

                                 ROGER
                                (chuckles)
                        What’re you dumping me again?

                                 KATE
                        I love Charlie.  He makes me happy.  
                        When he walks into the room and 
                        smiles, it makes my day.  Because I 
                        never have to wonder why he’s 
                        smiling.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (cont'd)
                        If he’s covering up something or if 
                        he has some hidden agenda.  He’s 
                        smiling because he loves me.
                                (a bit more emotional)
                        And because he appreciates me 
                        loving him.

                                 ROGER
                        He sounds like a good guy.

                                 KATE
                        He is.  Good night, Roger.

           Kate exits.  Roger hangs his head.

           EXT. BACK PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Roger heads back toward the ballroom.  He runs into Uncle 
           Von, who sits Indian-style on a deck chair and smokes opium.

                                 ROGER
                        Jesus.  What the hell are you doing?

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Smoking opium, what the fuck does 
                        it look like?  You want a hit?

                                 ROGER
                        No.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Well, then stand over there and 
                        keep a lookout for security or my 
                        fuckface brother.

           Uncle Von goes back to smoking his opium.  A beat, then Roger 
           heads over to where Uncle Von wanted him.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           The band plays DONNA SUMMER’S “LAST DANCE.”

                                 LARISSA
                        LAST DANCE / LAST CHANCE FOR LOVE / 
                        YES, IT’S MY LAST CHANCE / FOR 
                        ROMANCE TONIGHT...

           On the dance floor, Jeremy dances with Pepper, Annie dances 
           with the douchebag who won’t stop dancing, and the two twenty-
           something dancing girls MAKE OUT FURIOUSLY.  One of them jams 
           her hand up the other’s dress.
           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Tim and Simone sit on the floor, leaning against a wall, 
           drinking beers.

                                 TIM
                        It’s just, you spend so much time 
                        scratching and crawling, trying to 
                        save something, and you never stop 
                        to wonder if it’s even supposed to 
                        be saved.

                                 SIMONE
                        Wow, that’s pretty profound.  Maybe 
                        you don’t have a concussion.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, I’m totally fine.  There’s 
                        three of you sitting there, right?

           Simone LAUGHS.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s a 
                        disaster.  And a shock.

                                 SIMONE
                        It’s a shocksaster.

                                 TIM
                        Yes!  I love that.  Thank you.  “A 
                        shocksaster.”

           Simone smiles.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        But it’s like I told Beth.  In the 
                        end, she was right.  We both 
                        deserve to find the right person.

                                 SIMONE
                        Well, any girl would be lucky to be 
                        found by you.

           A beat.  They KISS.  It’s amazing.  Tim hasn’t kissed another 
           woman in a decade, and it’s a revelation.  When they break:

                                 TIM
                        We can’t have sex tonight.

                                 SIMONE
                        Oh, uh--
                                 TIM
                        I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’d love 
                        to.  You’re obviously insanely 
                        beautiful and sexy, but emotionally, 
                        I’m not ready.  And physically, I 
                        haven’t had sex in eight months, so 
                        I’d probably explode as soon as I 
                        got halfway in.

           Simone smiles, oddly charmed.

                                 TIM (cont’d)
                        Although, I do have a hotel room 
                        with champagne and a jacuzzi, but 
                        no, no, it’s not a good idea. 

           ANGLE ON the coat check.  Ryan hands Caroline their ticket.

                                 RYAN
                        Hey, you wanna grab our coats?

                                 CAROLINE
                        Sure.

                                 RYAN
                        And then maybe we’ll take a ride 
                        over to Gillie Park and talk this 
                        out?  I don’t wanna go to bed mad.

                                 CAROLINE
                                (softening a little)
                        What’re you trying to sucker me 
                        into a better mood with the park 
                        from our first date?

                                 RYAN
                        It’s nice at night.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Alright...

           Ryan exits.  Caroline hands the ticket to the ATTENDANT.

                                 CAROLINE (cont’d)
                        Thanks.

           As Caroline waits for their coats, she looks over at Uncle 
           Von, who leans against a wall talking to a YOUNG LADY.

                                 YOUNG LADY
                        Can I try on your sunglasses?

                                 UNCLE VON
                        I don’t like to take them off.
                                 YOUNG LADY
                        Pleeeease?

                                 UNCLE VON
                        Eh, alright.

           Uncle Von takes of his sunglasses.  CLOSE ON his eyes.  They 
           are blue and green and absolutely beautiful.

                                 YOUNG LADY
                        Oh my god, your eyes are gorgeous.

                                 UNCLE VON
                        I know.

           The attendant returns with Ryan and Caroline’s coats.

                                 ATTENDENT
                        Thank you, have a good night.

                                 CAROLINE
                        Thanks.

           As she takes the coats, Caroline feels something.

                                 CAROLINE (cont’d)
                        What the...?

           Caroline digs into the pocket of Ryan’s coat and comes out 
           with... a ring box.  Overcome with emotion, she smiles a 
           small but very meaningful smile.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAME

           The band plays.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...’CAUSE WHEN I’M BAD, I’M SO, SO 
                        BAD / SO LET’S DANCE, THE LAST 
                        DANCE / LET’S DANCE, THIS LAST 
                        DANCE...

           ANGLE ON Jeremy and Pepper dancing.  The two bridesmaids 
           interrupt.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Hey, Jeremy!  You wanna come drink 
                        with us on the golf course?

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                                (holding up bottle)
                        We’ve got Stoli!
                                 JEREMY
                        Oh, uh...

           Jeremy looks at the bridesmaids, then at Pepper.

                                 JEREMY (cont’d)
                        No thanks.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Are you serious?

                                 JEREMY
                        Yeah, I’m serious.  Isn’t that 
                        adorable?

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        What?

                                 JEREMY
                        I’m dancing with somebody.  You’re 
                        interrupting.

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                        Ugh, whatever.  Let’s go, Dina.

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                                (as they exit, drunk)
                        What just happened?  Is he coming?

                                 BRIDESMAID #1
                                (pulling her)
                        Let’s go.

                                 BRIDESMAID #2
                        Okay, but I need to pee, but I 
                        don’t wanna pee alone, because I 
                        wanna pee with you.

           A beat, then:

                                 PEPPER
                        Skanks.

                                 JEREMY
                        Totally.

           ANGLE BACK ON the stage.

                                 LARISSA
                        ...COME ON BABY, DANCE THAT DANCE / 
                        COME ON BABY, LET’S DANCE TONIIIIGHT

           The band finishes, the remaining guests APPLAUD, and Larissa 
           takes a few bows.
                                 LARISSA (cont’d)
                        Thank you!  Good night!

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - SAME

           Danny stands with Michael and Linda at the valet stand.

                                 MICHAEL
                        How much you gotta tip these guys?

                                 LINDA
                        Five dollars.

                                 MICHAEL
                        For driving my car twenty feet?!

                                 LINDA
                        What does it matter how close it 
                        is?!  You’d rather they park it in 
                        Yonkers?!

                                 DANNY
                        You know, you guys really have an 
                        amazing relationship.

                                 LINDA
                        Explain yourself, Daniel.

                                 DANNY
                        You can scream and argue all the 
                        time, and it doesn’t matter.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (screams)
                        Who’s arguing?!

           Michael and Linda’s car pulls up.  Michael hands a bill to 
           the valet.

                                 MICHAEL (cont’d)
                                (resentful)
                        Here.

                                 VALET #2
                        Thank you, sir.

           Danny kisses Linda on the cheek, as Michael and Linda get in 
           their car.

                                 DANNY
                        Good night, guys.  Drive safe.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Don’t touch the air conditioning, 
                        Linda!  You make it too cold!

           Michael and Linda drive off.  Danny turns around to find 
           Larissa exit the country club.  She looks around, then spots 
           Danny and smiles.

                                 DANNY
                        You looking for me?

                                 LARISSA
                        I thought I missed you.

                                 DANNY
                        No, I was just saying goodbye to my 
                        parents.  They’re extremely insane.  
                        I actually hope to be that crazy 
                        someday.

                                 LARISSA
                        Well, I wanted to make sure you 
                        didn’t leave without my number.

           Larissa hands Danny a napkin.  Danny looks down at the phone 
           number.  

                                 DANNY
                        Oh!  Thanks.

           When he looks back up, Larissa KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.  When 
           they finally separate, Danny has a big, goofy smile.

                                 LARISSA
                        What?

                                 DANNY
                        I was right.  You do like me.

                                 LARISSA
                                (smiles)
                        Yeah.  I do.

           Larissa exits.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

           The parking lot is almost empty.  One of the valets closes up 
           the valet stand.  The other valet throws car keys into the 
           woods.
           EXT. BACK PATIO - SAME

           Roger and Tim sit on the patio smoking cigars and drinking 
           from a lifted bottle of champagne.  Danny joins them.

                                 DANNY
                                (holding up napkin)
                        Suck it, Roger Dodger.  She did 
                        like me.

                                 ROGER
                        Wasn’t the only thing I was wrong 
                        about tonight.

                                 DANNY
                        Kate?

                                 ROGER
                        My life may be fun and exciting--

                                 TIM
                        And sexually exuberant.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah.  But it may have also cost me 
                        my best chance at lasting love and 
                        happiness.

           Tim takes a swig of champagne, then:

                                 TIM
                        I kissed your date.

           Roger processes this for a beat.

                                 ROGER
                        I probably deserve that.

                                 TIM
                        Yeah, you do.

                                 DANNY
                        Definitely.

                                 TIM
                        And I’d like to give her a ride 
                        home, too, if that’s okay.

                                 ROGER
                                (sighs, then)
                        Sure, have a blast.
                                 TIM
                        And I need to borrow your car.  
                        Beth left with ours.

           Danny smiles.

                                 ROGER
                                (holds out his keys)
                        You know how to drive stick, right?

                                 TIM
                                (takes the keys)
                        Ah, I’ll figure it out.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

           As the lights inside shut off one by one, Tim drives Roger’s 
           Mercedes convertible (Simone sitting in the passenger seat) 
           up the driveway, jerking forward and GRINDING THE CLUTCH all 
           the way.

           INT./EXT. VARIOUS - NIGHT

           Over the following scenes, we hear an INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF 
           ERIC CLAPTON’S “WONDERFUL TONIGHT” and:

                                 DANNY (V.O.)
                        It was a surprisingly wise 
                        seventeen-year-old who once told 
                        me, “a wedding is a time for 
                        celebrating passion, romance, and 
                        the glorious possibility of true 
                        love.  Plus, seeing another lady in 
                        a pretty dress, getting tons of 
                        attention makes women temporarily 
                        lose their minds.”  It’s also a 
                        time to meet new people, connect 
                        with old friends, and maybe even 
                        learn something about yourself.  
                        And about the people you love.

           EXT. SIMONE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tim drops off Simone, kisses her at the door.

           EXT. SUBURBAN ROADSIDE - NIGHT

           Annie and the douchebag who won’t stop dancing make out on 
           the hood of his car.
           INT. JEREMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeremy sits on his bed, texting.

           INT. PEPPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Pepper lies on her bed, texting him back. 

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kate lies in bed, as Charlie enters from the bathroom while 
           brushing his teeth and smiles at her.  It makes her day.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Uncle Von, still wearing his sunglasses, has crazy-ass sex 
           with the two bridesmaids.

           INT. RYAN AND CAROLINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan and Caroline lie in bed, snuggled, sleeping peacefully.  
           CLOSE ON Caroline’s left hand.  She’s wearing a diamond 
           engagement ring.

                                         THE END

           ROLL CREDITS: Over wedding photos - not stills from the 
           movie, but new images - during which we see the bride and 
           groom’s faces for the first time.  They are played by Gisele 
           Bündchen and Tom Brady.
